You have an intention set to really do something to change the world, and you have to keep it up. \u0027It makes me so emotional. You\u0027re doing really, really good work and I\u0027m so happy that we\u0027re here. We give you our full support.\u0027 The couple\u0027s \u0027surprise\u0027 appearance at the school on Friday turned out to be the worst-kept secret on campus.As Gladys Berejiklian, the Premier of New South Wales, teased them about being overexcited to see her, the teenagers fizzed with anticipation until the Duke and Duchess were finally introduced. Then, cheers and excited screams filled the air as they walked outside to meet the well-behaved girls, who had been sitting neatly for assembly. Invited to sit on a park bench in the centre, the couple watched a ballet-inspired dance performance from students to the song \u0027Power of Love\u0027 before heading inside for the workshops.           The program aims to unite young people from erse communities to be \u0027advocates for positive change in their communities\u0027          Invited to sit on a park bench, the couple watched a ballet-inspired performance from students to the song \u0027Power of Love\u0027The couple earlier went to Bondi Beach, one of Australia\u0027s most famous landmarks, to meet a local community surfing group known as One Wave.It was founded by Grant Trebilco who suffered from mental health issues for a decade but felt unable to talk about them.He was eventually diagnosed as being bi-polar and hospitalised.When he came out, he said surfing was \u0027his saviour\u0027 and he finally felt able to open up to his closest friends, who were incredibly sympathetic to him and also shared issues of their own.He has now created \u0027Fluro Fridays\u0027 where people dress up in fluorescent clothes and go to the beach, with the aim of fostering an atmosphere where others can open up about their own mental health issues. Harry and Meghan, who was wearing a sleeveless Martin Grant dress with espadrille tie wedges, were both given brightly-coloured \u0027leis\u0027 - garlands of flowers - to put round their necks in order to enter into the spirit of things.Accompanied by Trebilco, they kicked off their shoes on the edge of the beach and walked barefoot to sit in a group with some of the colourfully-dressed surfers.          Among others, Meghan spoke to fellow expectant mother Charlotte, who is pictured with her two-year-old son Finn          Meghan shared with a group of yoga performers she does yoga to stay grounded, while Harry prefers to talk openly          Harry revealed her prefers informal chats about mental illness, hoping to reduce the stigma around them          The  couple met with members of a local surfing community called One Wave, which aims to raise awareness for mental health          The community group One Wave aims to raise awareness of mental health and wellbeing, saying it\u0027s a strength to ask for help    The couple spent around ten minutes listening to the experiences of other members of the group and sharing their own           Meghan told them yoga helps ground her and that she tries to find the time to make it part of her daily routine          One Wave founder Grant Trebilco said the couple\u0027s openness about mental health will help people across the globeTrebilco, 37, of Bondi, said the couple\u0027s openness about mental health would help people around the world.\u0027To have the Duke and Duchess down at Fluro Friday helped make mental health visible around the world,\u0027 he said.\u0027And it let people know that mental health doesn\u0027t descriminate.\u0027One thing that really stood out for me was that Prince Harry said asking for help is not a sign of weakness.\u0027It\u0027s a sign of strength.\u0027Mental health is invisible. You can\u0027t see when people are struggling.\u0027Wearing the bright flouro helps start conversations that never usually happen around mental health\u0027It reduces that barrier.\u0027Those bright colours show we can make it visible and we don\u0027t have to go through it alone.\u0027    The couple donned floral leis as they met surfing and yoga members of the community          Members of the sharing group said the royal couple were relatable, open and honestDabriella Quayle, 37, said afterwards: ‘Oh my goodness, they were just so real, so relatable. They shared their own experiences, which was amazing.\u0027Harry said seeking help was the best thing he had ever done. He was really open and honest. He said it doesn\u0027t matter who you open up to, they don\u0027t have to be professional. Anyone can be there for you. It could be your best mate or a stranger. You just need to open up to them.\u0027She added: \u0027They talked about the strangeness of their own situation and the lives they lead but that at the end of the day they are just real people. They are just human beings.\u0027They said they were just like us in that people say lots of positive things to you and then they say one negative thing, and that\u0027s what gets you down.\u0027Meghan said how she did yoga at 4.30 this morning because of the jet lag. She says she is feeling OK, not too bad. They said they hadn\u0027t really had time to settle down and get their heads round thing, and they have another 70 odd engagements to go.\u0027          One member of One Wave said Meghan had a \u0027double whammy\u0027 of jet lag due to her pregnancy          Meghan revealed she had been up at 4.30am that morning practicing yoga when she couldn\u0027t get back to sleep           Meghan said yoga was her \u0027leveller\u0027, with the couple still having another 70 odd engagements to goAfter the circle the royals walked over to a group practising yoga. Nio Poniatowski, 25, said: \u0027Meghan said it was her leveller, it\u0027s what keeps her grounded, like surfing does for us. She said it was her escape.\u0027Chatting with another group of surfers, Harry said he had never waxed a board before, so he and Meghan both had a go.Surf instructor Sam Schumacher, 31, said the couple both revealed they had surfed, adding: \u0027The circle time was great. Two or three of us shared our personal stories.\u0027This visit will really raise the profile of what we are trying to do and the fact that mental health doesn\u0027t discriminate. \u0027It can affect anyone and that we all need to try and look after each other. \u0027I can see the passion in their eyes.\u0027Trebilco said the couple had been \u0027so nice, so friendly\u0027.          One member of the circle said he could \u0027see the passion\u0027 for awareness of mental health in the couples\u0027 eyes          Chatting with another group of surfers, Harry said he had never waxed a board before, so he and Meghan both had a go          The royal couple pictured with garlands of flowers, or \u0027leis\u0027, dangling around their necks as they walk through the sand          Thousands of well-wishers came out to Sydney\u0027s iconic Bondi Beach to see the royal couple on Friday morningStuart Klees, 34, of Bondi, said: \u0027Harry shared his views on mental health towards everyone.\u0027\u0027He\u0027s a big believer in normalising the conversation around mental health.\u0027He feels fortunate that he\u0027s in a position to get the right people together to spread that message.\u0027He\u0027s a big supporter of small community groups like One Wave.\u0027Prince Harry talked to the group about his own issues with mental health.\u0027He said he\u0027s seen a couple of counsellors before and never found one that suits him,\u0027 Klees said.\u0027He\u0027s a big believer in having normal conversations with normal people.\u0027He was pretty genuine, real honest, real open, real relaxed.\u0027He wasn\u0027t trying to put on a show. He was really genuine in the way he came across.\u0027As she left, Meghan told the group that she was \u0027loving\u0027 her first experience of Australia. \u0027It is so great to be here,\u0027 she said."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/20/03/51775D1300000578-0-image-m-30_1540001784691.jpg","title":"Karlie Kloss Joshua Kushner married","story":"Say \u0026#39I do\u0026#39 in a beautiful Dior wedding dress like KarlieGet the look belowSupermodel Karlie Kloss revealed on Instagram that she\u0026#39s tied the knot with her beau Joshua Kushner!The beautiful bride chose a stunning wedding gown by Dior, featuring a fitted bodice with long-sleeved lace overlay and a full skirt.

I love the smoky, sophisticated atmosphere of the image. This feels very right for now — escapist and sensual...

It is the most beautiful, timeless Dior bag.

approximately $50million in White House documents released last year, is controlled by not only Josh but also Ivanka’s sister-in-law Nicole Meyer. Jared\u0027s brother Josh and sister Nicole may in

You\u0027re proud of where you\u0027re from, you can champion where you\u0027re from and make people see it for what it is.\u0027 Harry, sitting with a second group of youngsters, joked that he was \u0027clinging onto my youth at the age of 34,\u0027 said he now looked to the younger generation for inspiration. \u0027We\u0027re so lucky that wherever we go in the world, we\u0027re finding young people like you guys,\u0027 he said. \u0027This sweeping wave of kindness and optimism and empathy that\u0027s seems to be lacking in some of the previous generation.

We give you our full support.\u0027 The couple\u0027s \u0027surprise\u0027 appearance at the school on Friday turned out to be the worst-kept secret on campus.As Gladys Berejiklian, the Premier of New South Wales, teased them about being overexcited to see her, the teenagers fizzed with anticipation until the Duke and Duchess were finally introduced. Then, cheers and excited screams filled the air as they walked outside to meet the well-behaved girls, who had been sitting neatly for assembly. Invited to sit on a park bench in the centre, the couple watched a ballet-inspired dance performance from students to the song \u0027Power of Love\u0027 before heading inside for the workshops.           The program aims to unite young people from erse communities to be \u0027advocates for positive change in their communities\u0027          Invited to sit on a park bench, the couple watched a ballet-inspired performance from students to the song \u0027Power of Love\u0027The couple earlier went to Bondi Beach, one of Australia\u0027s most famous landmarks, to meet a local community surfing group known as One Wave.It was founded by Grant Trebilco who suffered from mental health issues for a decade but felt unable to talk about them.He was eventually diagnosed as being bi-polar and hospitalised.When he came out, he said surfing was \u0027his saviour\u0027 and he finally felt able to open up to his closest friends, who were incredibly sympathetic to him and also shared issues of their own.He has now created \u0027Fluro Fridays\u0027 where people dress up in fluorescent clothes and go to the beach, with the aim of fostering an atmosphere where others can open up about their own mental health issues. Harry and Meghan, who was wearing a sleeveless Martin Grant dress with espadrille tie wedges, were both given brightly-coloured \u0027leis\u0027 - garlands of flowers - to put round their necks in order to enter into the spirit of things.Accompanied by Trebilco, they kicked off their shoes on the edge of the beach and walked barefoot to sit in a group with some of the colourfully-dressed surfers.          Among others, Meghan spoke to fellow expectant mother Charlotte, who is pictured with her two-year-old son Finn          Meghan shared with a group of yoga performers she does yoga to stay grounded, while Harry prefers to talk openly          Harry revealed her prefers informal chats about mental illness, hoping to reduce the stigma around them          The  couple met with members of a local surfing community called One Wave, which aims to raise awareness for mental health          The community group One Wave aims to raise awareness of mental health and wellbeing, saying it\u0027s a strength to ask for help    The couple spent around ten minutes listening to the experiences of other members of the group and sharing their own           Meghan told them yoga helps ground her and that she tries to find the time to make it part of her daily routine          One Wave founder Grant Trebilco said the couple\u0027s openness about mental health will help people across the globeTrebilco, 37, of Bondi, said the couple\u0027s openness about mental health would help people around the world.\u0027To have the Duke and Duchess down at Fluro Friday helped make mental health visible around the world,\u0027 he said.\u0027And it let people know that mental health doesn\u0027t descriminate.\u0027One thing that really stood out for me was that Prince Harry said asking for help is not a sign of weakness.\u0027It\u0027s a sign of strength.\u0027Mental health is invisible. You can\u0027t see when people are struggling.\u0027Wearing the bright flouro helps start conversations that never usually happen around mental health\u0027It reduces that barrier.\u0027Those bright colours show we can make it visible and we don\u0027t have to go through it alone.\u0027    The couple donned floral leis as they met surfing and yoga members of the community          Members of the sharing group said the royal couple were relatable, open and honestDabriella Quayle, 37, said afterwards: ‘Oh my goodness, they were just so real, so relatable. They shared their own experiences, which was amazing.\u0027Harry said seeking help was the best thing he had ever done. He was really open and honest. He said it doesn\u0027t matter who you open up to, they don\u0027t have to be professional. Anyone can be there for you. It could be your best mate or a stranger. You just need to open up to them.\u0027She added: \u0027They talked about the strangeness of their own situation and the lives they lead but that at the end of the day they are just real people. They are just human beings.\u0027They said they were just like us in that people say lots of positive things to you and then they say one negative thing, and that\u0027s what gets you down.\u0027Meghan said how she did yoga at 4.30 this morning because of the jet lag. She says she is feeling OK, not too bad. They said they hadn\u0027t really had time to settle down and get their heads round thing, and they have another 70 odd engagements to go.\u0027          One member of One Wave said Meghan had a \u0027double whammy\u0027 of jet lag due to her pregnancy          Meghan revealed she had been up at 4.30am that morning practicing yoga when she couldn\u0027t get back to sleep           Meghan said yoga was her \u0027leveller\u0027, with the couple still having another 70 odd engagements to goAfter the circle the royals walked over to a group practising yoga. Nio Poniatowski, 25, said: \u0027Meghan said it was her leveller, it\u0027s what keeps her grounded, like surfing does for us. She said it was her escape.\u0027Chatting with another group of surfers, Harry said he had never waxed a board before, so he and Meghan both had a go.Surf instructor Sam Schumacher, 31, said the couple both revealed they had surfed, adding: \u0027The circle time was great. Two or three of us shared our personal stories.\u0027This visit will really raise the profile of what we are trying to do and the fact that mental health doesn\u0027t discriminate. \u0027It can affect anyone and that we all need to try and look after each other. \u0027I can see the passion in their eyes.\u0027Trebilco said the couple had been \u0027so nice, so friendly\u0027.          One member of the circle said he could \u0027see the passion\u0027 for awareness of mental health in the couples\u0027 eyes          Chatting with another group of surfers, Harry said he had never waxed a board before, so he and Meghan both had a go          The royal couple pictured with garlands of flowers, or \u0027leis\u0027, dangling around their necks as they walk through the sand          Thousands of well-wishers came out to Sydney\u0027s iconic Bondi Beach to see the royal couple on Friday morningStuart Klees, 34, of Bondi, said: \u0027Harry shared his views on mental health towards everyone.\u0027\u0027He\u0027s a big believer in normalising the conversation around mental health.\u0027He feels fortunate that he\u0027s in a position to get the right people together to spread that message.\u0027He\u0027s a big supporter of small community groups like One Wave.\u0027Prince Harry talked to the group about his own issues with mental health.\u0027He said he\u0027s seen a couple of counsellors before and never found one that suits him,\u0027 Klees said.\u0027He\u0027s a big believer in having normal conversations with normal people.\u0027He was pretty genuine, real honest, real open, real relaxed.\u0027He wasn\u0027t trying to put on a show.

Labradors - described as ‘kooky and outgoing’ in the survey - also rated highly in the research, which found 80 per cent of their owners are married or in a relationship and 40 per cent of them have been asked out during walkies.A perhaps more surprising discovery was the apparent ‘pulling power’ of the Queen’s favourite breed, the Corgi. Corgi owners were ranked the fourth most likely to be asked on a date while walking their dog. This may be because Corgi owners are considered to be ‘loyal, reserved and friendly’ just like the little dogs.The Kennel Club is encouraging people to find their ‘perfect dog match’ so that they might then find their perfect human match too. They are hosting a ‘Discover Dogs’ event where people can meet more than 200 dog breeds at London’s ExCel tomorrow and on Sunday where people can do just that.

Nigerian-born and raised, they currently live in Brooklyn. In 2017 Emezi won the Commonwealth short story prize (for Africa region) for Who Is Like God? Their highly acclaimed first novel, Freshwater, is a coming-of-age story that follows Ada from a troubled childhood in Nigeria to an American university where a traumatic event takes place. The book is about sexual, spiritual and emotional awakening and the negotiating of many inner voices inside a multiple self. The New York Times has hailed it a “remarkable and daring debut novel” and the New Yorker as an “indigenous fairytale”. Emezi’s children’s book, Pet, is to be published in 2019, and their second adult novel, The Death of Vivek Oji, is also due for publication.Your central character, Ada, is a Nigerian student in America who is inhabited by ogbanje, which I understand to be spirits in Igbo…Ogbanje are children who die over and over again. They are considered to be tricksters, torturing their parents who hope they will stay alive. Ada is a spirit child, or ogbanje. She is not possessed by spirits people think in binaries a lot, so that one thing has to be possessed by another. But with ogbanje, these things are collapsed.So the voices are different sides of herself?Yes, the way I describe Ada is as a singular collective and plural inidual. Ada is described as a “girl” but is not, actually. “She” has gender-affirming surgery and it is not said but she is trans.Ada’s mother is Malaysian, her father is Nigerian, as are yours. Like you, she goes to America to study. Is it right to say that the book is partly based on personal experience?It’s an autobiographical novel – a breath away from being a memoir. There are chapters in there that are my journal entries which I copied and pasted. There are a couple of things about writing it this way: first, the things that people think are fictionalised are not fictionalised. Second, I wanted to make clear it was autobiography, otherwise it would be considered to be very fantastical. I wanted readers to be sure that it was not magical realism or speculative fiction. It’s what has actually happened! I’m using fiction as a filter for it.Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie has spoken of “the danger of the single story” and relates it to her own Nigerian childhood experience of reading stories about white-skinned, blue-eyed characters. What did you grow up reading in Nigeria?In school I read a lot by African writers, but at home my parents’ book collections were way more western. My dad went to medical school in Russia and met my mom in London while she was at nursing school. The books ranged from Dostoevsky and Tolstoy to all the British children’s books: Enid Blyton, CS Lewis, JK Rowling. I read all of them.What’s the last really great book you read?I recently reread Helen Oyeyemi’s The Icarus Girl. I liked reading it the first time, but I read it after Freshwater was published and I cried because there were so many parallels I hadn’t been aware of. It’s the first book she wrote and it has a different quality from the rest: this one is big and sprawling and scary. I’d forgotten how scary it was.Which genres do you particularly enjoy reading? Are there any you avoid?I’m still the kid trying to read about fantasy worlds to get away from this one. It’s not like I have never read contemporary literary fiction, but I would much prefer to read speculative fiction. One of my absolutely favourite writers is NK Jemisin, and the Malaysian writer Zen Cho is amazing.Who is your favourite literary hero or heroine? Antihero or villain?I’m not sure about hero or heroine, but there’s a villain in Octavia Butler’s Patternist series called Doro. I read the first book and hated him so much that it took me years to read the rest of the series. It was a visceral feeling. He is a rapist and controls people’s minds.What kind of reader were you as a child?Voracious. I read literally everything I could get my hands on – the shampoo bottle, the cereal box. My mom didn’t let us have books at the table or we’d all have read. We didn’t always have electricity, so I read by candlelight. I read really fast too. My parents realised I’d run out of things to read and were like: “We need to buy you way more books.”Which book or author do you always return to?Terry Pratchett. He wrote 40-something books based in one invented universe.• Freshwater by Akwaeke Emzi is published by Faber (£10). To order a copy for £8.60 go to bookshop or call 0330 333 6846.

There’s nothing like a book to persuade you that you’re not alone. John Steinbeck said: “We are lonesome animals. We spend all our life trying to be less lonesome. One of our ancient methods is to tell a story, begging the listener to say – and to feel – ‘Yes, that’s the way it is, or at least that’s the way I feel it. You’re not as alone as you thought.’”But I think decency is what’s called for here, a selection of books that burn brightly on the side of the light. You might start with the work of Mary Oliver. She’s a wonderful poet – humane, generous and forgiving. Start with the heart-repairing Wild Geese.You might then read Alexander Masters’s A Life Discarded. He’s a lovely writer, and this sad, true, uplifting story will make you see the wonder of the everyday world.As far as novels go, you might try Americanah by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie – it’s a beautiful and moving love story across two continents. Or what about Cormac McCarthy’s The Road? It paints an unutterably bleak picture of the planet’s future and yet, at the end – spoiler alert – there is hope.Failing all this, you might do what I do when I’m feeling grim and dreary: draw the curtains, put on the kettle and reach for PG Wodehouse.Submit your question for Book Clinic below or email bookclinic@observer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2aa5ba7ca3e904e8d1d9f16a7c9838b69f709412/0_0_4284_2571/master/4284.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d3b5a1624b153558219b7a369009e7fc","title":"little drummer girl john le carre perfect lie fiction","story":"Secret interrogations, elaborately staged deceptions, conspiracies and murder ... John le Carré’s murky spy thriller could not be more relevantDavid Cornwell, or John le Carré, as we usually call him, must have been wincing as he viewed the CCTV stills of those two Russian visitors to Salisbury. He was surely shaking his head in dismay as he watched their later avowals of their touristic interest in Salisbury Cathedral on Russian TV. This is not just because he is an old secret service hand himself, with some professional appreciation of the skill at avoiding surveillance that any decent agent must develop. It is also because his every novel takes it as axiomatic that those with covert purposes (Russian spies, British spies, terrorists) have to be brilliantly cunning at hiding themselves. If spooks were to be like the apparent blunderers of the GRU, le Carré’s entire oeuvre would be doomed.The target of all the machinations of his 1983 novel The Little Drummer Girl, now made into a glossy BBC six-part adaptation, is certainly as ingenious and elusive as any of his previous masterminds. He is Khalil, an accomplished and highly intelligent bomb-maker, dedicated to the murder of prominent Jews in western Europe at the end of the 1970s. The BBC’s previous le Carré adaptation, The Night Manager, was updated from its original setting in the early 1990s to something like the present. The protagonist’s scalding experiences undercover in Ireland were turned into traumatic memories of missions in Iraq. The Little Drummer Girl takes us back to 1979 and stays there.We are in the world before the collapse of communism. The Little Drummer Girl was the novel that le Carré wrote immediately after Smiley’s People, in which his owlish British intelligence officer George Smiley had finally defeated his opposite number in Soviet intelligence, Karla. It seemed to mark a new direction. It focuses not on the cold war spy game between west and east, but instead on the consequences for western Europe of the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. And it was the first, and remains the only, le Carré novel with a female protagonist. In this most traditionally masculine of genres (another former spook, Stella Rimington, has been one of the few to break the gender cartel), this felt like a significant experiment for the novelist. The fall of the Berlin Wall may have been one of the happiest events of John le Carré’s lifetime, but it was a cruel deprivation for him as a novelist. The wall itself runs like a beloved line of narrative through le Carré’s fiction for almost three decades. In 1963 he transformed the spy fiction genre with the publication of his third novel, The Spy Who Came in from the Cold, a novel that begins and ends at the Berlin Wall. Moral compromise – even moral failure – became le Carré’s stock in trade. The world of espionage he presented was a far cry from the glamour and gadgets of many of his contemporaries.Just a few months before the novel appeared, Ian Fleming published On Her Majesty’s Secret Service, in which James Bond infiltrates the Alpine headquarters of Ernst Blofeld and defeats Spectre’s scheme to destroy British agriculture. A very different kind of secret service. Le Carré was not entirely alone in bringing some kind of “realism” to the genre. In the 1930s, the derring-do of Erskine Childers and John Buchan had given way to the more unsettling fiction of Eric Ambler, in which well-meaning amateur heroes – journalists or writers – find themselves caught up in the machinations of spies and international criminals. Yet the plots were often baroque, while the protagonist was usually appalled by the world of intrigue into which he had blundered.In 1962, Len Deighton published his debut novel, The Ipcress File, also a bestseller. The first of a series of successful spy novels, it has something in common with le Carré’s murky realism: it gave the reader cynical British spymasters and a secret service governed by turf wars and bureaucratic imperatives. But the narrative, involving the kidnapping and brainwashing of a series of British boffins, was more Bond than Smiley, and the novel’s multiple and sometimes highly contrived killings took it a long way from probability.Le Carré brought a new authority and, the reader inferred, authenticity to the cold war thriller. It soon became widely known that “le Carré” was the pen name of David Cornwell, who had worked for several years for MI6, and was still doing so when he wrote The Spy Who Came in from the Cold. The book’s success allowed him to become a full-time writer, and for the next 25 years he produced a string of grimly plausible cold war novels. The last was The Russia House (1989), a novel about a thawing Soviet Union. He brought to spy fiction not just a special circumstantial texture – that language of “tradecraft” – but also a beauty and discipline of plotting that is rarely found in the fiction of his predecessors.When his plotting is at its best, as in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (1974) or The Perfect Spy (1986), it is a rare literary achievement. These stories feel distant from the adventures of The Night Manager, especially when reimagined for television with more than a touch of James Bond. In Tinker Tailor, Smiley spends most of his time either reading through old files or interviewing old agents. The very plot of the novel is about the piecing together of narratives, of inconsistencies or echoes between different stories. It is slow and minutely attentive. No wonder that, for the aficionado, the 2011 film is so disappointing, at once reductive (all the stages of investigation hurried into just two hours) and visually extravagant (in order to distinguish itself from the meticulously faithful 1979 TV adaptation).In The Little Drummer Girl, the shift back to a time without mobile phones or the internet – and with almost nothing in the way of video surveillance – emphasises the need for narrative and psychological ingenuity. The TV drama, like the novel, relies on operatives with binoculars and large cameras, gnomic calls from public telephones, coded messages scribbled on pieces of paper. It is gratifyingly cluttered with the antique machinery that spies might have loved four decades ago: reel-to-reel tape recorders, ticker-tape machines and primitive video recorders. The plot relies on the skills of forgers of documents and photographs.Like The Night Manager, The Little Drummer Girl is a story of infiltration. Charlie (AKA Charmian), a young would-be actor, has been picked by Martin Kurtz, a wise and wily Mossad spymaster, to infiltrate bomb-maker Khalil’s tightly controlled network. Kurtz has chosen her because of her righteously radical past (even stronger in the book than the dramatisation) to the terrorists she will seem a likely recruit. He has also picked her because she is currently touring half-empty repertory theatres, and he can lure her with the offer of a real star performance. But will she be persuaded?The elaborate construction of a credible lie is the essential process of a le Carré novel. How do you make the most suspicious person in the world believe your lie? Kurtz and Charlie’s handler “Joseph” instructs her in the arts of disarming or deflecting suspicion. Early le Carré novels are all masterclasses in these arts. Karla, the Soviet espionage chief in Tinker Tailor may be a communist fanatic, but he is a subtle analyst of the human heart. He instructs Bill Haydon to begin an affair with Smiley’s wife in order to discredit Smiley’s suspicions about him, not only with his superiors, but with himself. The scrupulously rational Smiley will naturally check himself from suspecting the man who has cuckolded him he would only be giving in to resentment. In The Night Manager, the shrewd and calculating arms dealer Richard Roper lives by suspicion, yet is made willing to look past the coincidence of Jonathan Pine turning up more than once in his life by an elaborately planned MI6 back story, in which Pine is on the run from a murder that he has committed. He is compromised and therefore manipulable, and Roper cannot resist him.Spy fiction is narratively paranoid. Charlie becomes alive to the possibility that anyone could be a spy. Queuing to cross the border between Greece and Yugoslavia, she finds herself behind an open sports car, two men in the front, two women in the back. Are they Joseph’s? Or Khalil’s? Or police of some kind? “She was learning to see the world that way: everyone belongs to someone.” She begins to see how little the rest of us see, how unknowing are all “the innocents” around her. “They are where I came from, she thought. They are me before I walked through the looking-glass.” But now she is awake to possibilities. The world is charged with meaning. In a spy novel, everything that the initiated character notices might mean something. Suspicion electrifies narrative.In 1983, someone reading The Little Drummer Girl must have wondered where the book’s sympathies lay – or rather, where the reader’s sympathies were being directed. Even more so now. Kurtz is a liberal Israeli who wants to make the conditions right for a peaceful solution in the Middle East. Dates matter very much. Kurtz, in his 50s in 1979, is a Holocaust survivor with memories of a winter journey in a cattle truck and of watching his own mother going to her death. In the TV version, an awkward west German secret service officer notices the tattooed number on Kurtz’s forearm. In a passage not to be found in the book, Kurtz jokes about how the numbers, tattooed when he was young, stretched out as he grew. The Israeli agents in west Germany shudder inwardly at the country in which they operate.An author’s note at the opening of The Little Drummer Girl acknowledges the “many Palestinians and Israelis who gave me their help and time in the writing of this book”, ranging from a former chief of Israeli military intelligence to a Palestinian military commander. The even-handedness is decisive and is built into the plot. The Mossad agents instruct their recruits for undercover work using the best arguments of the terrorists. They have to understand how it feels to believe in their enemies’ cause.Where is our judgment to settle? It is a question that the reader of le Carré’s post-1989 fiction rarely has to ask. Since 1990, many of the enemies le Carré has found for his troubled, itchy agents have been straight-up villains. In The Night Manager, Pine thinks of international arms salesman Roper as “the worst man in the world”. And so he is – a man driven to accumulate ever more wealth by trading the most effectively murderous weapons to anyone who can pay his prices. In one respect the TV dramatisation improved on the book: Hugh Laurie brought a ghastly charm to the character that was entirely absent from the novel.Some of le Carré’s more recent villains have been corporate, and they too are unambiguously bad. In The Constant Gardener the agent of evil is a multi-national pharmaceutical company, responsible for the murder of diplomat Justin Quayle’s wife Tessa, who was about to reveal its deadly use of experimental drugs in east Africa. The novelist’s values and moral energy may be impeccable, but the reader can feel their pressure. The new heroes may be psychologically wounded – the sine qua non for a le Carré protagonist – but there are no doubts about what they are up against.The moral failures of western intelligence agencies were always essential to the stories le Carré told, the cynicism of spymasters being a firm convention of the genre. But since 1989, the western spooks have begun looking like villains too. In The Constant Gardener, the Foreign Office sides with murderous big pharma. In Absolute Friends, the hero, Ted Mundy, is pitted against the “renegade hyperpower” that is the United States and eventually becomes awkward enough to be killed by his own side. It is notable that the struggle against Islamist fundamentalism, which has become the major preoccupation of secret services in western Europe, and is the background to many recent film and TV thrillers, has interested le Carré the novelist very little.His most recent novel, A Legacy of Spies, is a revisiting of the cold war and, indeed, of the “case” of Alec Leamas in The Spy Who Came in from the Cold. It is narrated by that old Circus hand Peter Guillam, now retired but ready to take us back to that looking-glass war. Many readers detected a nostalgia for the days before the wall fell. The Berlin Wall was where we last saw Smiley, waiting to see if his final gambit against Karla would work in the last chapter of Smiley’s People: “the white halo of sodium arc lights, and behind it … a barricade, a pillbox, then the bridge”. Germany is at the heart of all le Carré’s early novels (Cornwell’s German language skills were important in his own secret service work) and in The Little Drummer Girl we return there.We also return to the business of psychological manipulation that gave literary urgency to le Carré’s new species of spy fiction. In The Little Drummer Girl, the canny Kurtz patiently explains to his sceptical superiors how Charlie’s fiery leftist past will make her the best recruit. “Her ideological drift did not dismay him in the least the nearer she was to drowning, he said, the greater would be her pleasure at coming aboard.”Charlie’s sagacious Mossad advisers are experts in lying, as are the Circus veterans who advise Leamas how to deal with interrogation. Interrogation, the fascination and the slowness of it, is essential to The Little Drummer Girl. It is a long novel, dedicated as much to manipulating those who are questioned as to finding out any answers. The patient slowness of these sessions is what makes them credible.When he is as careful and subtle as this, le Carré is not necessarily easy for TV. The Night Manager sometimes resembled a Bond story. All those glamorous settings! Where was the drabness of vintage le Carré? The hopeless Somerset prep school where we find Jim Prideaux at the beginning of Tinker Tailor the bed and breakfast in a deserted Devon coastal resort where Magnus Pym is seeking refuge on “a blustery October morning” in the first chapter of A Perfect Spy. These are the places that a British spy ends up. (You can still see the influence on contemporary thrillers: the British spies in Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s Killing Eve – which is based on Luke Jennings’s Codename Villanelle novellas – live in the drab old world, while the female assassin has a lovely Paris flat and a limitless expense account.)You become a spy because of something in your past. The idea is alive in The Little Drummer Girl too. Charlie has been driven by her own unhappiness into rebellion and excess, and, before the spooks ever get to her, has already constructed a fiction about her past to justify her bohemian life. She is entirely ready to adopt a new set of lies. The novel emphasises her restless, almost angry, promiscuity the TV version, written in a different age, avoids this. (Detectably, the sexual politics of the novel has given the writer and director of the adaptation some uneasiness.)A Perfect Spy, le Carré’s most autobiographical novel, draws on this interest in the early habit of duplicity. It interleaves its account of Pym’s career in the British secret service with his memories of his relationship with his father, Rick, a charming conman and dedicated deceiver. The sense that the arts of deception are first learned within the family is made all the stronger by our knowledge that the character of Rick Pym is based closely on Cornwell’s own father, Ronnie. Pym was born in the same year as le Carré and has had the same public school and Oxford education.

However, the work was never started, explains Reid.Reid, perhaps best known for winning the 2009 Costa book award for his collection, A Scattering, written in tribute to his late wife, is on the surface an unlikely choice of successor to the austere Eliot. Although it’s arguable that just as Eliot, the cat lover, was a very feline kind of person, so the enthusiastic Reid is more obviously doglike – “and like them, I can growl”, he admits.Dig deeper, however, and it becomes clear why the Eliot estate contacted him. “I did put a lot of dogs in my other poems – I hadn’t actually realised there were so many until an American journalist pointed it out,” he admits “Why were there so many? I think it’s because there’s something slightly tragic and poignant about the relationship between humans and dogs – the way that they try to greet you but you can’t completely connect.”Among the consequential dogs, which Reid hopes will thrill a new generation of fans, are lurcher Molly ,“a dog of the Night” and “a rare enough beast” languid lap dog Leopold and Flo, the wonderfully philosophical foxhound whose “powerful mind works all the timeon problems mundane and sublime…Like: What are shoes for?If not to chew? And: Why are dog biscuits always too few?”“The poems were very vivid to me as I wrote them – I describe it as though one by one the dogs lined up and instead of asking to be taken for a walk they were asking to be taken for a poem,” he says, adding that his main ambition is for children to hear them.“I think that when kids hear somebody reading a poem they grow wide-eyed and their imaginations are set free. In my experience they always make more of it, doing their own thinking and imagining. It would be wonderful if a child read the book and then said why isn’t there a iel? To which I would say write your own iel poem and off they would go to do that.”He describes his book as “done with love, respect and a bit of cheek – most certainly a homage”, and says he was determined to avoid simply copying Eliot’s work – “although I did adhere closely for The Naming of Dogs because I thought I should get that out of the way as a salute to Eliot before going off and doing what I wanted”. He was also keen not to stray into whimsy or sentimentality because “there’s nothing twee or cute or randomly silly about Eliot, his cats have full personalities and I wanted my dogs to be seen in the same way. I see the book as an expression of delight in dogs.”There were, however, inevitable differences. “While Eliot’s best cats are mischievous, uncontrollable and frankly villainous, dogs, on the other hand, are more trusting, beholden to humanity – they don’t take themselves as far from human beings as cats do.”In spite of that Reid decided against including any humans in the book. “I did have a poem about ownership of dogs, but it didn’t fit the tone and by that point I was having to tell myself to stop, to be honest. I knew I had to trim it down and cut a few poems.”As to whether he’d like to see Old Toffer’s Book of Consequential Dogs one day enshrined in musical theatre history alongside Andrew Lloyd Webber’s Cats, Reid simply laughs. “It depends who the composer is … I’ll be long dead by then.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f86c373de8f1d943e936a8c727c1392c55f93b5d/0_2533_3744_2246/master/3744.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb0cbe2536113f66e262a0334eb9acf9","title":"boxes within boxes share your examples of excessive packaging","story":"We would like your help investigating egregious examples of excessive packaging With some companies ditching plastic straws, a movement to get people reusing coffee cups and of course a UK plastic bag levy, some may think progress is being made despite dire warnings about the environment  this month.Among a litany of reasons that there is a long way to go, excessive packaging remains a worry for many consumers and environmentalists.We have heard from several readers sharing their concerns about extreme packaging and have previously published some of their stories.

But where is the former prime minister who called the referendum that will blight Britain for as far ahead as anyone can see? Whatever happened to that likely lad? David Cameron doesn’t want to talk about it, one of his friends tells me. “He doesn’t defend the referendum, but won’t say he made a mistake either. Europe is like a family scandal. We know what’s happened but we don’t say a word: it’s his no-go zone.”At a personal level, the consequences swirl around him. I may be exhausting your capacity for compassion but the smallest of the casualties of Brexit has been the good fellowship of the Chipping Norton set. Naturally, the Cotswolds’ wealthy Leavers are grateful. But Cameron must resent them. He must know that he has been the useful idiot who succumbed to the demands of Rupert Murdoch’s Rebekah Brooks, a member of the local nouveau gentry by virtue of her converted barn, in the crashingly stupid belief that no harm would come from his surrender.Invitations to “kitchen suppers” from Remainers, however, can only include Samantha Cameron’s name – if, they are extended at all. Tania Rotherwick invited the Camerons to her pool at the magnificent Cornbury Park estate before she split from her husband and Cameron split Britain from Europe. She is now particularly contemptuous, I hear.Cameron’s memoirs were meant to be published this month but have been delayed until next year. The early signs are ominous. A book has to be coherent if it is to find a readership: its opening must prefigure its conclusion. As described in the publishing press, Cameron’s effort will have no consistency. He will tell the story of the formation of the coalition, his contributions to economic, welfare and foreign policy, his surprise victory in the 2015 election and then – as if from nowhere – the conventional memoir will end with the author carelessly deciding he will settle the European question, without planning a campaign or preparing an argument and, instead, launching a crisis that will last for decades. Nothing will make sense. Nothing will hang together. It’s as if a romcom were to conclude with serial killers murdering the cooing lovers or Hilary Mantel were to have aliens invade Tudor England on the last page of her Thomas Cromwell trilogy.The book Cameron cannot write would accept that his political battles and achievements were as nothing when set against his decision to appeal to the worst of the Tory party. It would begin with Cameron honouring the decision that won him the Conservative leadership in 2005. He would confess that he should have known better than to pull the Conservatives out of the centre-right group in the European parliament and align them with Law and Justice, the know-nothing Polish nationalists who are reducing their country to an ill-governed autocracy. The manoeuvre was pure Cameron: tactics above strategy appeasement instead of confrontation.The pattern continued throughout his premiership. He thought he could buy off the right by refusing to explain the benefits of EU membership to the voters. At one point in 2014 he threatened to leave the EU. He then turned around in 2016 and asked the public to believe that leaving would be a disaster and was surprised when 17.4 million men and women he had never treated as adults worthy of inclusion in a serious conversation ignored him.If he were being honest, Cameron would admit too that Brexit ought to bring an end to a British or, to be specific, English, style that is by no means confined to the upper class, but was everywhere present among the public-school boys who ruled us.I mean the ironic style that gives us our famously impenetrable sense of humour (which we will need now the rest of the world is laughing at us). The perfidious style that allows us to hide behind masks and has made England superb at producing brilliant actors for the West End but hopeless at producing practical politicians for Westminster. The teasing style of speaking in codes that benighted foreigners can never understand, however well they speak English. The cliquey style that treats England as a club, not a country, and allowed Jeremy Corbyn to say that Jews cannot “understand English irony”, however long their ancestors have lived here.The deferential style that allowed one Etonian to lead the Remain campaign and another to lead the Leave campaign and for the English to not even see why that was wrong. The life’s-a-game-you-shouldn’t-take-too-seriously style that inspired Cameron to say he holds “no grudges” against Boris Johnson now the match is over and the covers back on the pitch. The gentleman amateur style that convinced Cameron he could treat a momentous decision like an Oxford essay crisis and charm the electorate into agreeing with him in a couple of weeks, as if voters were a sherry-soaked don who could be won round with a few clever asides. The effortlessly superior style that never makes the effort to ask what the hell the English have to feel superior about. The gutless, dilettantish and fatally flippant style that has dominated England for so long and failed it so completely. The time for its funeral has long passed.A politician who bumped into Cameron said he thinks the referendum result must be respected, but that Britain should protect living standards by going for the softest Brexit imaginable and staying in the single market. This is a compromise well to the “left” of Theresa May and Corbyn’s plans and is worth discussing. Whatever his critics say, David Cameron is a former PM. He not only has the right to offer his solution but a duty. If he is to earn the right to a hearing, however, he must first find not only self-knowledge and courage, but an un-English seriousness of purpose he has evaded all his life."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e007b379c3f4c6ebabbf5b041975327cd66e9440/0_115_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=971794f4e63ca1a0199e0c51a887fd53","title":"john bercow is not the man to fix the house he should go","story":"A fish rots from the head, apparently. I have no idea if this is fact or a fiction that makes for a brutal metaphor, one that I heard again and again in parliament last week. The fish is parliament and the head is the Speaker, John Bercow.Dame Laura Cox’s report into bullying and harassment had no need for putrefying metaphors. The language was clear, the message simple. In parliament, there are “systemic or institutional failings and a collective ethos in the house that have, over the years, enabled the underlying culture to develop and to persist”.To make this report all about John Bercow is to entirely miss the point, but to ignore his role in it would also be remiss. Some MPs called for Bercow’s resignation from a position of care for those hurt and a genuine desire to repair the damage being done to the reputation of parliament. Publicly, these people were few in number.Of course, many MPs hate John Bercow and wanted rid of him and used the report as their opportunity. They care as much about changing the culture in parliament for the staff as much as Tommy Robinson cares about sexual exploitation victims. The staff who have been bullied, harassed, silenced and ignored are just a toy for them to play with for political and tribal ends. Into the bin with them.The other pervading response was that we are already in a massive mess constitutionally and we need a firm hand to steer the ship. We will call this the Brexit defence. Unlike the shameless proxy war of the Bercow scalp brigade, I do think in the most part this defence of Bercow came from a place of good faith, although I don’t agree. There is a genuine concern that we need a Speaker who will not genuflect to the executive and let them get away with preventing parliament from having a proper say. Who could disagree? After all, the government is allowing a meaningful vote on the Brexit deal only because Gina Miller took it to court.The Brexit defence runs easily with those who think that Bercow has been a great Speaker for MPs. This is an undeniable fact. He has also been a reformer and a progressive who has acted to improve ersity and with it the effectiveness of parliamentarians and also staff.I am not in any of the Bercow defence groups. I will not defend him or defend his staying in his post. It won’t kill me, but that sentence was hard to write because I like him a lot and I like what he does. He knows how to speak truth to power, which is rare. You wouldn’t know it from modern-day online discourse but people can be good at some things and bad at others.To me, Bercow is exactly that, but his good in no way absolves him.The reality is that parliament’s bullying and hierarchical culture will never change until a robust, transparent and accountable process determines if someone stays or goes, not who they are mates with or which party they are from or, these days, if they are Leavers or Remainers. Power and patronage rules above all else in parliament, now more than ever. I have no hope that any substantial change will result from this report if MPs are the ones who steer what that change will be. It must be independent of our friendships, loyalties and fears.Laura Cox cannot name names, but you don’t have to be Columbo to work out what she is saying in the report’s closing statement: “It may be that some iniduals will want to think very carefully about whether they are the right people to press the reset button and to do what is required to deliver that change in the best interests of the house.”I agree. Bercow reset and revived parliament in so many ways but I don’t think he can reset this. I just hope our fish doesn’t end up with a head more rotten than the last.• Jess Phillips has been the Labour MP for Birmingham Yardley since 2015"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d3bd82a3e82cb349368eb5a4c44abf694c790aa/0_137_4094_2456/master/4094.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2e17f3fb5b0b056537767279ca1cac97","title":"lizzo would be a sea witch to make us live happily ever after","story":"The American rapper seems a natural for the remake of The Little MermaidThe singer and rapper Lizzo, from Minneapolis, set Twitter’s amateur casting agency ablaze when she posted her “audition tape” to play Ursula in Disney’s forthcoming live-action remake of The Little Mermaid. “Bye bitch,” she waves, as she’s driven away from the camera wearing a dreamlike rainbow dress, chuckling in such an Ursula-esque manner that it will be an outrage worthy of mass protest if she isn’t at least considered.In the frantic gossip factory of the internet, Lady Gaga has been rumoured to be in line for Ursula, but there has been concern that it would be slimming down the part. Actually, it may be one of the rare situations where Gaga might not be camp enough – the look of the original 1989 Ursula was based on the drag queen Divine and Disney, apparently, couldn’t decide whether to reach out to Joan Collins or Bea Arthur for the role. (She was played, in the end, with an inimitable fag-ash croon by Pat Carroll.)Lizzo would be a perfect new Ursula, though it remains to be seen how Disney will update the not-very-2018 plotline of a 16-year-old girl giving up her voice and ability to swim efficiently in order to marry a prince. It’s an issue that Keira Knightley, who has some live action Disney experience of her own, brought up on Ellen DeGeneres’s chatshow, when talking about the children’s films her three-year-old daughter is not allowed to watch. The Little Mermaid is out, for the reasons above, as is Cinderella, who “waits around for a rich guy to rescue her. Don’t! Rescue yourself. Obviously,” she said.In a veritable uprising of Disney women, Kristen Bell, who voiced Frozen’s Princess Anna, has been explaining that she teaches her children to ask questions about Snow White, such as why she takes the apple from the witch or why the prince is allowed to kiss her as she’s sleeping.As with Knightley, this has led to a generic “PC gone mad” kind of grumbling, when, really, both appear to be simply teaching their kids to think about what they’re seeing. With the endless success of the still-inescapable Frozen, which turned the swooning-over-a-prince storyline on its head, there’s a strong case to be made that, by showing just how much the new-mould heroines such as Anna and her sister, Elsa, appeal to them, kids are arguing the exact same points for themselves.When Jo Brand was first on TV in the 90s, she sent herself up as the kind of comedian who did jokes about man-hating, food and, notoriously, periods. I don’t entirely trust a vague memory I have of her doing a joke about periods, as it has been a long time since the 90s, so I’ve had a good trawl of the internet, but can’t find any surviving remnants of those gags. These days, as well as writing books, Brand hosts Bake Off: Extra Slice and she’s not really doing that kind of joke on there, which is probably fine for everyone. I did find an interview from 2001, though, in which she busted the myth that all she did was period jokes. “I went back through my material to see exactly how long I’d got on periods. It was actually just one and a half minutes out of my whole comedy career,” she said.Nevertheless, she’s still being asked about them. In an interview with the BBC, she said: “I think people kind of laughed because they couldn’t quite believe I said it. But I thought, ‘I’ve said it, well, good.’” She also mentioned that around 10 years ago, she’d noticed male comedians doing jokes about periods, too. “I thought it was nicking stuff off women really. A bit of bandwagon jumping. ‘You’ve run out of Star Trek jokes, have you?’”At the Edinburgh fringe this year, I saw so many comedians doing jokes that involved talking about periods (rather than, and this seems to be a key difference, jokes about periods) that it was almost as ubiquitous as Brexit and sexism the idea of it once being seen as a taboo subject seemed ridiculous and remote.In other menstruation news, the rights to Judy Blume’s getting-your-period bible, Are You There God It’s Me, Margaret?, have been bought by Hollywood producers. It’s about bloody time, etc.Occasionally, a celebrity profile throws up eccentric gold in the unlikeliest of quarters. Bella Thorne, 21, a tabloid magnet type of famous person who was in a Disney series, Shake It Up, as a young teenager, is now a film actor.She is experiencing her obligatory “Miley Cyrus smoking weed and making an album with the Flaming Lips” era of rebellion, if an LA Times interview is anything to go by. Usually, in pieces such as this, there are one or two wonderful details to be savoured, but this is a cornucopia of decorating delights and it makes her house sound as if it’s ripe for the documentary treatment: Grey Gardens 2: This Time It’s Pink?Thorne has a 12ft, hand-painted statue of a unicorn, hundreds of felt roses glued to the wall, an area of her kitchen dedicated to marijuana, “tooth jewellery”, inspirational notes in the bathroom and, incredibly, 19 cats, all descended from her original cat, Lola, because she thought having her spayed would be barbaric. Celebrities try the “we’re just like you” thing far too often to be believable, but it’s an absolute treat to stumble into a world like Thorne’s, where there’s not even a hint of fake-humble."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82ee83d686c6fefc78b55f70be2b91e5e1fdb2e8/0_48_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=74f045a537e2e5709324faeb14b00b0e","title":"the peoples vote cartoon","story":"As campaigners march against Brexit, a child voices the question asked by millions"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e18df1b107396e82d489d3fb24eaeee16790026d/0_212_3173_1904/master/3173.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf5445f0930b79c23181e2a9e98bcd62","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"A 1,000-metre spider web and a hellbender devouring a snake are among this week’s pick of images from the natural world"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ecb714834db18244ef43d9238bfe6e152eea7191/0_170_1764_1058/master/1764.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8e3c2da67c919db8dfa508a515df3c4","title":"tell us how does it feel to watch a classic film on first release","story":"As audio of frenzied audience reactions to the original Halloween has gone viral, we want to hear your stories of seeing defining films at the cinemaThe much-hyped release of the latest Halloween installment (tipped to break records with a $70m opening) has led many to think back to the film that started it all back in 1978.While there have been rankings aplenty, there’s also been a rather fascinating video going viral that gives us an idea of what it would have been like to see the original on the big screen.

I think reality television and all that that entails had an extraordinary impact, a profound impact on the way we view the creation of character.“I think it provides a lot of opportunity, but the downside of it is that we now, particularly in America, I think, we expect and only expect people to make a profound connection to a character when it’s close to their experience.”Sir Ian McKellen is among those critical of Hollywood’s attitude to gay actors.

Sicko made a persuasive case for socialised medicine in America, but rather undermined its own cause by wilfully misinterpreting the healthcare systems in other countries. The message of Where to Invade Next was partially obscured by all the grandstanding gimmickry.But with this searing, broad-ranging account of the political trends in the US, Moore reaffirms himself as one of the essential voices offering commentary on the world today. It’s just a shame that that voice frequently sounds so glib. It takes a while to realise that the anger and outrage that power this film are unfeigned.Moore employs his trademark blend of dark humour and stunts to explore what led us to the Trump-era political arena, but as the film progresses, he increasingly dials down the comedy. Some things just aren’t funny. Moore juxtaposes the plight of various communities of ordinary Americans against an increasingly unaccountable, uncaring elite. He returns repeatedly to the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, which exposed an entire generation of children to lead contamination. He touches upon the epidemic levels of prescription opiate addiction.To a score of feverish violins, Moore makes an alarmingly persuasive case that democracy itself is under threat. Hope for the future, he argues, rests on the shoulders of a newly politicised younger generation, and on a wave of idealists replacing the moribund career politicians in the Democratic party. It’s not subtle – at one point he grafts Trump’s voice on to footage of Hitler addressing a Nazi rally. But subtle was never in Moore’s cinematic vocabulary. And as someone adept at harnessing entertainment for political purposes, he has the skill set to take on Trump at his own game."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87e9167cf1f72812b81c0df4faa423595188ea8a/0_264_5661_3397/master/5661.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db85974137c5b73ceaa5c9e21ddfb91c","title":"stanley kubrick refused to pay composer friend gerald fried","story":"Gerald Fried, who scored five of the director’s films, on the auteur’s insecurities as a boy and demanding working methodsThey were childhood friends who collaborated on five films, including one of cinema’s most powerful anti-war movies, Paths of Glory. But Stanley Kubrick refused to pay Gerald Fried for the music he wrote for their first film, the composer has now revealed.That film was the 1951 Day of the Fight, a short documentary following a day in the life of middleweight Irish boxer Walter Cartier.Fried was speaking after identifying himself as the owner of a lost Kubrick screenplay, whose discovery came to light in July. He is selling it through Bonhams New York on 20 November, along with some letters from the film director.Commenting on Kubrick’s mean-spirited streak, Professor Nathan Abrams of Bangor University, a leading Kubrick expert, said: “He was known for keeping his eye very closely on the bottom line. He had control of all the financial aspects of his films.” Fried did at least get paid for their other films, which include the 1956 crime heist The Killing.Recalling his high-school days with Kubrick, Fried said: “Stanley couldn’t quite fit in. As a child, he felt a combination of, ‘I am smarter, more talented and better than everybody’ and ‘I am inferior to you all because I’m not a regular kind of person’. That, I think, dominated him.”Kubrick, an American who lived most of his life in Britain, died in 1999. The lost screenplay, an story of adultery entitled Burning Secret, is so close to completion that it could be developed by contemporary film-makers. It is an adaptation of the 1913 novella by the Viennese writer Stefan Zweig.MGM is believed to have cancelled the project after learning that Kubrick was also working, in breach of contract, on Paths of Glory. Abrams suggests that it may have been too risque.Asked about Kubrick’s approach to music, Fried said: “For Day of the Fight and the other ones, he didn’t know much about music, so he kept his mouth shut. By the time he got to Paths of Glory, I had to justify every note. It was quite a tortuous process. But, then again, he was a great movie-maker, so maybe that’s one of the reasons why.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7efb40a1e78891e7eeffc861cd3a3c9e651b48eb/224_12_4373_2624/master/4373.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d136322dcb1867998e62c0f042235578","title":"viola davis stifled who was lost years the help","story":"Success hasn’t come easy for the Oscar-winning star. She talks to  Benjamin Lee about the limited roles black actors are offered, why The Help was a missed opportunity, and how she learned to take the lead – in life and on screenIn the opening scene of Widows, the new thriller from artist-turned-director Steve McQueen, Viola Davis lies in bed, passionately kissing her on-screen husband, Liam Neeson. A kiss between a married couple might not seem remarkable, but for Davis it is a groundbreaking moment.“For me, this is something you’ll not see this year, last year, the year before that,” Davis says, sitting in her living room in Toluca Lake, Los Angeles. “That is, a dark-skinned woman of colour, at 53 years old, kissing Liam Neeson. Not just kissing a white man,” she adds, “Liam Neeson, a hunk. And kissing him sexually, romantically.”We meet after Davis has finished her photoshoot for the , a simple grey robe now pulled over her shimmering evening gown. She turns up the heating in the sparsely furnished open-plan room that opens out on to the rest of the ground floor assistants mill around the house, and her eight-year-old daughter, Genesis, who greeted me at the door, pops in and out.Davis predicts that few people will want to talk about the significance of the Widows’ kiss. “Nobody will pay attention to that. And if you mention it to someone, I think they’ll feel like it’s hip and it’s funky that they didn’t notice it. But will you see it again?” she asks. “If you don’t think that’s a big deal, then tell me, why isn’t it happening more?” She sighs. “There’s a part of me that can answer that.”After a three-decade career playing more than 75 mostly supporting roles, Widows – an adaptation of Lynda La Plante’s 1983 British miniseries – marks Davis’s first lead role in a major studio movie. She plays the wife of a master criminal (Neeson), forced to continue his work after his death. It’s a film that’s both familiar and fresh a heist movie, but spearheaded by a group of strong-willed female characters (played by Michelle Rodriguez, Elizabeth Debicki, Cynthia Erivo) whose racial ersity is almost incidental, something that Davis says is unusual.“I always say that one thing missing in cinema is that regular black woman,” she says, maintaining direct eye contact, as she does the whole time I’m with her. “Not anyone didactic, or whose sole purpose in the narrative is to illustrate some social abnormality. There’s no meaning behind it, other than she is just there.” Davis says she wants to play the sort of roles Jane Fonda and Meryl Streep have had. “I would love to have a black female Klute, or Kramer, or Unmarried Woman, or Annie Hall. But who’s gonna write it, who’s gonna produce it, who’s gonna see it, again and again and again?”In the past 10 years, Davis has become one of the most decorated actors in Hollywood – winning Tonys for roles in August Wilson’s stage plays King Hedley II and Fences, an Oscar for the big-screen take on the latter and an Emmy for her performance in Shonda Rhimes’s pulpy TV series How To Get Away With Murder. She’s a Grammy short of an EGOT, a full sweep, but tells me it’s not going to happen: she can’t sing.Davis refers to her latest role as a “gift” from McQueen, “because it was just a woman in the middle of a narrative who was facing personal challenges”. Widows is undoubtedly more multiplex-leaning fare than the director’s previous work (Hunger, 12 Years A Slave), though his script, co-written by Gone Girl author Gillian Flynn, raises issues of political corruption, poverty and police brutality.The decision to switch the setting from London to Chicago, a city struggling with a rise in violent crime, turns the city into a character in itself. “There was a shooting every single day, every single night,” Davis says of her time in Chicago. “It has a history that is palpable and, in the present, it’s obviously a city that’s in crisis. But at the same time, there’s this beautiful mix of cultures and art. It made the movie bigger than it could have been.”Davis says she enjoyed working with McQueen. She has played many roles written by white men and says that, when she has tried to offer insight on the black female experience, she hasn’t felt listened to. “I get a gag order placed on me. They don’t want to see your liberation, they don’t want to see your mess – they don’t want to see you.” For years, she says, this had a damaging effect. “I was trying to fit in, stifling my voice, stifling who I was, in order to be seen as pretty, in order for people to like me. And then going home, not being able to sleep and having anxiety. I have found that the labelling of me, and having to fit into that box, has cost me a great deal. I’ve had a lot of lost years.”What did she do in the lost years? “A lot of things I didn’t believe in, in order to further my career. All the things I thought had great value haven’t served me. It’s been the whole hair thing,” she says, gesturing to her close-cropped natural hair – a look that she rarely wore in her early career, but kept for her role in Widows. (“Your own hair is beautiful – just wear it that way,” McQueen told her.) “Even the weight thing, how I look in a dress, how I look on the red carpet. I’ve never been the beauty queen. Listen, when I was six years old, I lost the Miss Central Falls Recreation Contest – that was a beauty contest and I was in a bathing suit that I bought in the Salvation Army. Still, you hold on to the feeling of ‘Do people think I’m pretty?’ But pretty doesn’t have a value. Pretty didn’t serve me when I was grieving for my father when he passed away.”Davis has a rallying tone that recalls the acceptance speeches she gave at last year’s Oscars and the 2015 Emmys, performances that in themselves received wide acclaim. When she won her Emmy, she quoted Harriet Tubman, founder of the Underground Railroad – a network set up to help African American slaves escape to free states – and spoke about opportunity (“You cannot win an Emmy for roles that are simply not there.”) At the Oscars, she praised Wilson, “who exhumed and exalted the ordinary people”. And in January this year, she gave an emotional speech to the Women’s March in Los Angeles. “I am speaking today,” she said, “not just for the #MeToos, because I was a #MeToo, but when I raise my hand, I am aware of all the women who are still in silence.”Recently, Davis caused waves when she told the New York Times that she had some regrets about one of her most commercially successful roles to date, maid Aibileen Clark in The Help. The drama about racial tensions in the 60s was told mostly from the viewpoint of a white woman, played by Emma Stone. It was a box-office hit and led to a best actress Oscar nomination for Davis, but was seen by many critics as a whitewash of a shameful time in US history. Davis told the New York Times that, “I just felt at the end of the day that it wasn’t the voices of the maids that were heard.”In what way? “For me, it was just too filtered down,” Davis says. “I know Jim Crow, I understand that time period. It’s a 100-year time period that was rife with lots of violence and anger, and people with lost dreams and hopes. I wanted the frustration and that anger to be more palpable.”On a more personal level, Davis expected that her most widely seen role would change her career. It didn’t. “I went right back to playing the same roles I did before The Help, only getting paid a little bit more money. It’s like you have to sift through sewage in order to get what you feel like you deserve. I was not a box-office draw. So I just went back to having my five or six days on a film.”White actors, she says, are afforded a vast range of roles in comparison. “The Forbes list of the top 10 highest-paid actresses are all Caucasian,” she says. “Some of them haven’t even done a film in the past year, and they’re still up there.”She praises her peers, women from Octavia Spencer to Taraji P Henson to Lupita Nyong’o, for producing and seeking out their own projects. (Spencer is set to produce and star in a new Netflix series about the first black, female self-made millionaire Henson is executive producer on her upcoming remake of What Men Want and Nyong’o is adapting Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s novel Americanah). If there has been any improvement, Davis says, it is “only because the black women that I know have taken it into their own hands”. Without them, “I would say no, it has not changed. I still find that we only exist within certain genres.”She points out that even her new role wasn’t specifically written for a black woman. “If I had turned down the role in Widows, it would have gone to a white actor. The same thing with a lot of Denzel Washington’s roles.”Davis fell in love with acting at the age of six, when she saw Cicely Tyson in a TV adaptation of The Autobiography Of Miss Jane Pitman (“That magic, how she transformed, the beauty of that artistry,” she recalls). She grew up desperately poor, born in what she has described as a “one-room shack” in South Carolina, before moving to Rhode Island with two of her four siblings, while the others stayed to live with her grandmother. Her father was a horse trainer her mother a maid and factory worker, as well as a civil rights campaigner fighting for welfare reform. Aged two, Davis was with her mother at a protest outside Brown University, when she was arrested they spent hours in a holding cell. At times Davis relied on school lunches as her only meal of the day.But she enrolled in the theatre programme at high school and, after graduating from college, auditioned for the drama course at the Juilliard School, New York’s performing arts conservatory. She was 26 and won one of only 14 funded places her audition was a monologue from Alice Walker’s The Color Purple.Looking back, she thinks she learned a lot from those gruelling early years. “I feel like my past has been the perfect foundation to teach me everything about this business and about life,” she says. “I know what it’s like not to have food. I know what it means to even have half of my refrigerator full, or not to have electricity and hot water, to have a job and a pay cheque. It was ripe ground to study human behaviour. Everyone knew who the town drunk was, who was beating their wife, everyone knew everyone’s mess. So that’s helped me greatly, informing my work.”She knew from an early age that she would have to work twice as hard as anyone else because she didn’t have any connections. “When I say connections, I don’t mean that I didn’t know Steven Spielberg, blah blah blah,” she says. “I mean a connection with someone who knows how to fill out a college application. Someone who knows how to get a job, so you can make at least minimum wage, so you can afford bus fare. I’m talking that. I’m talking low level.”Davis struggled with her confidence in the early days. “I’m not an extroverted person,” she says, wrapping her robe tighter. “I used to have crippling social anxiety. When I first started acting, I would get bad stage fright and when I say bad, I mean heart palpitations. I would stop cold in rehearsal. I’d have people screaming at me just to open my mouth and say a word.” But she persevered. “This is socialisation on steroids, this business. I’m so much better than I used to be.”She has been married for 15 years, to fellow actor Julius Tennon (“Me and my husband are really fun, we have some great parties”) and she talks with pride of their adopted daughter. Family are key fame and fortune don’t automatically lead to happiness, she notes. “No one ever talks about significance. They talk about success.” It’s an important distinction for Davis. “When I was young, I said I wanted to be rich and famous. I’m really embarrassed by that. I wanted to be a great actress of the stage, I wanted people to throw flowers at me. People have thrown flowers at me, I’ve got my awards, all of that, and still, bam, disillusionment. Especially when you’re working so hard and you’re away from your family – you’re exhausted. There’s no measuring significance and living a life of purpose. Significance is something way deeper. It’s about legacy.”A legacy is something she takes seriously, and to this end she has set up her own production company, JuVee, with Tennon. This year they released two documentary series, Two Sides and The Last Defence, focusing on racial discrimination within the criminal justice system. “It will shift the pendulum because it’s changing the narrative for people of colour,” she says.When she talks about the things most important to her, it’s easy to hear echoes of Davis’s rousing public speeches. “Sanford Meisner,” she continues, “who’s a great acting teacher, one of the things he says – and it’s my motto for life – is that the most important question an actor can ask is, ‘Why?’ So that’s been my big thing. Why don’t I have a say in whatever character I choose to play? Why can’t I speak up in a room? Why do I have to feel scared because I spoke up and I pissed someone off? Why can’t I call my agents and tell them how much I want to get paid? When I answer that question for myself and I see ‘nothing’ as the answer, it gives me the impetus to speak up. And I’ll tell you what else gives me the impetus to speak up: my daughter, that whole generation, who need to find their way.”She remains hopeful, praising Streep, a friend, and Reese Witherspoon, for campaigning for change and the #MeToo and TimesUp movements for their effect on the industry. “The silence is just not acceptable any more,” Davis says. “The old days of the 50s, of hiding your feelings and your desires and your dreams behind vacuum cleaners and perfectly applied lipstick and wax floors – hell, no! I think #MeTooTime’s Up has a lot to do with it. People may see flaws in it, but one beauty is that women are stepping into who they are.”She’s keen to find more roles that reflect real-life experiences. “I’ve gone through the heartache of losing a parent, the joys of being married, the joys of getting a job. I’ve lived a life, so when I read a script and it strikes me as being disingenuous – a person who’s not fully explored – that’s what stops me.”Her next project might be her biggest part to date, playing Shirley Chisholm, the first black woman elected to Congress, and the first woman to run for president, against Nixon, McGovern and George Wallace. Chisholm’s campaign slogan, “Unbossed and unbought”, might be Davis’s own mantra.But her most pressing concern as I prepare to leave is whether she can bear to sit through a YouTube series that Genesis wants to watch (Genesis says it involves a hacker and someone called Rebecca Zamolo Davis describes it as “mindless”.)In a few weeks’ time, Widows will be released, something Davis is mildly anxious about, saying, “If it doesn’t do well, then I would take it personally. It’s the first movie that I can really say I was a lead in. So it’s more of a statement about me.” Still, she has a sort of fatalistic confidence: “I know that whatever the results are going to be, there’s a famous saying, ‘God willing and the creek don’t rise’. Meaning, if I’m still alive, whatever it takes, I’m going to continue.”• Commenting on this piece?

All vegans have a couple of tins of chickpeas in their cupboard. Therefore, all students have a couple of tins of chickpeas in their cupboard.” Now, despite those two premises being not terribly empirical, I have a feeling that, in 2018, this is not too far from the truth. So today I offer a three-course meal based on two tins of chickpeas, two tins of coconut cream and a bunch of other inexpensive ingredients. Whether you’re a student, a vegan or neither, there’s lots to enjoy.If you can’t get hold of chard, use spinach or another leafy green instead.

Add two teaspoons of oil, a good pinch of salt and a good grind of pepper, toss to coat, then roast for about an hour, until golden and crisp.Heat two tablespoons of oil in a large saucepan on a medium-high flame, then saute the onions, stirring often, until softened and lightly browned – about seven minutes. Add the remaining 260g chickpeas, carrot, celery, potato, thyme, tomato paste, smoked paprika and half the garlic, cook for two minutes. Add the stock, a teaspoon and three-quarters of salt and a good grind of black pepper, and bring to a boil. Turn the heat to medium, cover the pan and leave to simmer gently for about 25 minutes, until the vegetables are completely soft. Transfer to a blender in batches and blend smooth, then keep warm until ready to serve.Heat two tablespoons of oil in large saute pan on a medium heat. Add the chard stems and cook for five minutes, until softened. Add half the chilli and the remaining garlic, cook for two minutes, then stir in the chard leaves, a quarter-teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper, and cook for four minutes, until wilted. Turn off the heat and stir in the parsley, lemon zest and juice.Divide the soup between four bowls, top with the chard, the crisp chickpeas and the remaining chilli, drizzle with the remaining 30ml oil and serve hot with lemon wedges.Serve these with a spoonful of yoghurt instead of the coriander cashew cream, if you prefer, or even just drizzled with lime juice.

You need to start a day ahead, so the ice-cream can freeze overnight. Aquafaba is the thick, viscous water you find in a tin of chickpeas.

Strain the liquid into a bowl and set aside. Mix the coconut flakes with the sea salt and spread out on an oven tray lined with baking paper. Cover loosely with clingfilm and set aside overnight.Put the aquafaba in a stand mixer with the whisk attachment in place (or use a handheld whisk). Whisk on high speed for about eight minutes, until the mixture resembles semi-stiff whipped egg whites, then gently fold in the coconut cream until well combined.

José Mourinho had kept to his promise that he would demonstrate restraint if his team were winning and, in fairness, Chelsea’s supporters had shown no appetite to hound him in the way they had on previous visits to his former club with Manchester United. But then the dramatic, extraordinary finale: 96 minutes gone, the moment when everything erupted, when Mourinho lost the plot and a confrontation in the tunnel that made it literally shake because of the number of people involved.Mourinho was clearly incensed by the provocative manner in which Marco Ianni, of Maurizio Sarri’s staff, celebrated Ross Barkley’s late equaliser directly in front of him, fists pumping, and it was true the home team’s coach seemed unduly keen to rub it in.“Bad education,” Mourinho noted afterwards and until the stewards intervened he looked like he would happily throttle his antagonist. The FA is likely to want an explanation and in the circumstances it was almost a surprise Mourinho calmed down quickly enough to shake Sarri’s hand at the final whistle a few moments later.Sarri was not impressed with Ianni either, describing it as a “big mistake” and instructing his assistant to apologise to Mourinho. “The situation is now between me and my staff, face to face,” Sarri said, indicating that would not be the last Ianni, who worked with him at Napoli, would hear of it.At least Mourinho accepted the apology but it was an extraordinary finish to a match that left United’s manager complaining about an “awful result”, so convinced was he that his team ought to have won. He was clearly enraged and held up three fingers – signifying the number of league championships he won for Chelsea – in the direction of supporters who were baiting him as he made his way off the pitch. Nothing, however, will have hurt him as much as the final attack when David Luiz’s header hit the post, David de Gea kept out Antonio Rüdiger’s follow-up effort and Barkley scored from the second rebound.As Mourinho pointed out, the goal originated from a set play, just as was the case after 20 minutes when Rüdiger scored. United have managed only one clean sheet all season and Chelsea’s first goal came from a standard corner routine: a ball delivered by Willian, a splendid demonstration from Paul Pogba of how to lose a man inside the penalty area, and a decisive header from eight yards out.Chelsea had won all three of Mourinho’s previous visits as United’s manager, with a combined score of 6-0 and his exasperation was understandable given that, for the most part, his team controlled the threat of Eden Hazard, rarely encountered any problems from the listless Álvaro Morata and gradually took hold of the game courtesy of two second-half goals from a renascent Anthony Martial.In those moments it must have been startling for Sarri to see the way his team lost their way and perhaps for the first time we saw hard evidence of why Chelsea’s manager has been saying since the start of the season that his team are not fully equipped to sustain a title challenge.Until the last, dramatic twist United’s second-half improvement could probably be summed up by the sight of Mourinho stepping on to the pitch to give Martial a congratulatory slap on the back for chasing down an opponent.Chelsea did at least have the force of personality to start pressing again in the final exchanges but it was a strangely subdued performance. Sarri was correct to say they were rarely threatened in the first half. Equally, it was unusual to see them create so few opportunities aside from those that led to the goals.Sarri might also be intrigued to find out why, immediately before Martial’s first goal, Marcos Alonso made the curious decision to lie motionless in the penalty area – presumably hoping the referee, Mike Dean, might stop play – because of an apparent injury that did not appear to affect him in the slightest for the remainder of the game.Chelsea could certainly have done with all their defenders on their feet. Kepa Arrizabalaga kept out Juan Mata’s shot but the home side never properly cleared their lines and when Ashley Young had a go from the other side the shot took a slight deflection off Jorginho and Marcus Rashford before reaching Martial, who fired in emphatically.Martial’s second goal was an even more accomplished finish: another thumping right-foot shot into the bottom corner after a quick, penetrative breakaway led by Mata and Rashford. At that stage United looked a decent bet to follow up their 3-2 defeat of Newcastle with another hard-won victory from a losing half-time position.Unlike Newcastle, however, Chelsea still managed to have the final word and Barkley’s opportunism means they have remained unbeaten in their first nine games for only the third time in the Premier League era – the other occasions being title-winning seasons in 2005-06 and 2014-15, both under Mourinho.Sarri seemed dismayed that one of his coaches had set out to antagonise the opposition manager and it was probably for the best Ianni rather sneakily raced down the tunnel to avoid prolonging the argument. Man of the match: the orange-jacketed steward who caught Mourinho just as it seemed some real damage might be done."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2aa48908553d7a615cf4bcb999c231ed90ab71e6/15_28_2569_1542/master/2569.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65eda49dd30751d83ccd5835c5ccaede","title":"maurizio sarri chelsea apology jose mourinho manchester united","story":"• Assistant coach made ‘big mistake’ provoking United manager• Mourinho dismisses Marco Ianni’s actions as ‘bad education’Maurizio Sarri apologised to Manchester United and admitted Chelsea were in the wrong after one of his coaches sparked a furious touchline row with José Mourinho.Mourinho leapt from his seat on United’s bench to confront Marco Ianni after Sarri’s assistant coach celebrated Ross Barkley’s dramatic late equaliser for Chelsea by pumping his fists in front of the away dugout at Stamford Bridge. The dispute spiralled into the tunnel, forcing stewards to intervene, and led to heated exchanges between members of both benches.It was a while before Mike Dean, the referee, was able to restore order. Once the dust had settled, however, Sarri was quick to accept the blame and criticise Ianni’s actions. Mourinho, who accused Chelsea’s fans of disrespecting him, also attempted to draw a line under the matter despite saying that Ianni’s actions were down to a “bad education”.“I didn’t see anything on the pitch but after the match I spoke with José and immediately understood that we are wrong,” Sarri said. “I have spoken with the member of my staff and then I bring him to speak with Mourinho to say sorry to him. I think it is finished. We made a mistake. We were in the wrong.”Sarri is yet to decide if he is will punish Ianni. “I have dealt with the situation immediately,” the Italian said. “I have to speak to him again because I want to be sure he is able to understand that it was a big mistake. I have to view everything. Now the situation is between me and the staff face to face.”There were so many bodies involved that it was difficult for Dean to get a good view of what happened. The Football Association will have to wait for Dean’s report and view the footage before deciding whether to discipline either club.It is thought that Mourinho meant that Ianni was guilty of a lack of manners when he spoke about the Italian’s education. In any case, United’s manager was not in a mood to prolong the argument.“Not celebrations, bad education,” the Portuguese said. “But I also made mistakes in football matches and will make more. I accepted his apologies. Maurizio saw and said he would take care of it internally and to accept his apology, which I did. Then the young fellow came and apologised and I told him I accepted. I said: ‘I did mistakes when I was your age’.”United were on the verge of securing their first win at Stamford Bridge since 2012 after mounting an impressive comeback in the second half, with Anthony Martial scoring twice after Antonio Rüdiger had given Chelsea an early lead. Yet Mourinho ended up questioning why Dean played so much stoppage time after Barkley snatched a point for the hosts in the 96th minute. “The referee gave six minutes,” he said. “Normally when I am losing I never get six minutes. I do not know where the extra time came from. But that is football.”United, who host Juventus in the Champions League on Tuesday, showed enough promise to suggest that Mourinho still has the support of his players after weeks of speculation about his future at Old Trafford. Martial was excellent in the second half and Mourinho refused to criticise Paul Pogba for losing Rüdiger when the Chelsea defender headed in the opening goal from a corner.“My feeling is that we work on the pitch,” Mourinho said. “We defend mixed, so some players are in zones and some have inidual opponents. Sometimes the opponent is better than us. In this case Antonio was really strong in the movement. Players make mistakes. I prefer to focus on the global performance. My midfield was very good. Paul was good.”It was an eventful return to his former club for Mourinho. After the final whistle he held up three fingers to signify the number of league titles he won across two spells at Stamford Bridge. “I did not get respect back from Chelsea fans but that is not my responsibility,” Mourinho said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be926f74e8fb1f2c89dc15b927efa1612fcb6857/0_148_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b115d211817624a2073b2d2a25e5e62","title":"huddersfield v liverpool premier league live","story":"A warm embrace between Wagner and Klopp on the touchline. Wagner surely won’t be too upset his team will take great heart from their performance, once the sting of defeat subsides. It should serve them well in the coming weeks. Klopp meanwhile will know his side dodged a bullet today Salah still looks a little short on confidence, while there’s a big drop-off in the potency of their attack when Mane doesn’t play. They’re still struggling to locate their mojo. On the other hand, they’re joint top of the Premier League with Manchester City, having yet to click into anything approaching top gear! There are worse states to be in.The final whistle goes. Liverpool survive. It’s not entirely clear how Huddersfield didn’t score this evening. Liverpool were poor, and rode their luck. But it’s three points for the Reds. They go joint top, though if they keep playing like that, they can forget about the title. On the other hand, if Huddersfield keep playing like that, they’ll have a good chance of staying up.90 min +3: Diakhaby crosses again from a tight spot on the left. Jorgensen, on the left-hand corner of the six-yard box, flicks the ball high to the far post, but it sails out for a goal kick.90 min +2: Diakhaby - a former team-mate of Fabinho at Monaco - comes on for Hogg. He nearly makes an instant impact, steaming past Lovren down the left and crossing from the byline. Alisson and van Dijk just about manage to smother and clear.90 min +1: Salah has an opportunity to set Firmino clear down the left. He plays the ball straight at Durm. Some of Liverpool’s passing today has been risible.90 min: There will be at least four added minutes.89 min: Salah and Sturridge combine well down the inside-right channel. Then the ball’s rolled across the face of the box for Firmino, who has time to size things up ... but blooters wildly over the crossbar.88 min: Sturridge flicks a pass down the right for Gomez, who has time to pick a pass. He pulls back for Salah, who squirms into a little space down the inside-right channel and tries to dink a finish past Lossl from a tight angle. But the keeper smothers.87 min: Liverpool are struggling to keep hold of the ball. That’s giving Huddersfield and their vocal support hope.85 min: Then the ball’s launched long from the left, and Depoitre wins a corner on the right. The set piece is cleared by van Dijk, and suddenly Liverpool are tearing clear on the break! Firmino has Shaqiri to his left, but opts to lay off to Salah on his right. And he undercooks the pass, allowing Lowe to slide in and intercept. Liverpool should have put the game to bed then. They at least should have got a shot on target. On the touchline, Klopp is going spare, throwing semaphore shapes that spell U-N-H-A-P-P-Y, as well as E-F-F and C-E-E.84 min: Firmino handles the ball out on the left. That gives Pritchard a couple of chances to dribble into the box from that wing. Gomez sticks out a leg to stop him, just as he threatens to break through on goal.82 min: Mbenza tears down the right and curls in a cross. Van Dijk fresh-air kicks his attempted clearance. The ball clanks off the back of a panicked Lovren, who is trying ... I’m not sure what he’s trying. A donkey kick? Anyway, the ball drops to Mounie, who also panics, and shins a hopeless effort over the bar from eight yards. Huddersfield should be level. Liverpool are hanging on by their fingertips.80 min: Salah shimmies into the Huddersfield area from the right, and there’s space for a shot, but he looks to slip Shaqiri in on goal instead. His pass inside is easily intercepted by Jorgensen, who clears.79 min: Huddersfield stroke it around the back awhile, and Liverpool seem happy enough to let them do it. Eventually they come forward and Fabinho takes up possession. He runs at the hosts but eventually has to turn back. Liverpool are utterly disjointed in attack.77 min: Firmino replaces Milner. Then Lossl launches long, Depoitre flicks past van Dijk, and Mounie blazes recklessly high and wide from an ambitious position.76 min: Shaqiri’s delivery goes out of play before it reaches the box. Sturridge blasts the ball away in frustration and is booked for his sauce.75 min: The corner’s shuttled to Wijnaldum on the edge of the box. He considers shooting but indecision overwhelms him. But then Shaqiri comes again down the left and wins another corner.74 min: Sturridge finds a little pocket of space in the Huddersfield box, and dribbles into it, down the inside-right. But his attempt to cross for Salah is blocked. Then another phase of Liverpool attack, as Shaqiri slips a pass down the left for Robertson on the overlap. Schindler slides in at the near post to concede the corner, with Sturridge lurking.72 min: It’s all very scrappy again, as the subs find their feet and both teams recalibrate.70 min: Billing is replaced by Mounie. Huddersfield now have two strikers on the pitch. They also swap a defender in Hadergjonaj for the winger Mbenza. They’re going for it, with Liverpool looking increasingly uncertain of themselves.69 min: Lallana, who hasn’t started a game for yonks, is down with cramp. He gets up, then limps off to be replaced by Fabinho.67 min: Liverpool are preparing a change. It looks as though the lesser-spotted Fabinho will be coming on soon.65 min: Space for Pritchard down the right. His ball inside finds Durm, coming in from the other wing, but the wing-back can’t control the ball to get an effort on target. Liverpool are holding firm, but there’s a sense that Huddersfield could get something if they keep this up.63 min: Sturridge, deep on the left, curls a pass inside for Salah, who chests down and powers down the inside-left channel. He enters the box and whistles a shot across Lossl and inches wide of the right-hand post. A suggestion Salah might have brought that down with his upper arm instead of his chest, so the miss nips that controversy in the bud.61 min: The corner’s launched deep. At the far post, van Dijk tries to guide a volley into the net from a tight angle, but can only cushion it into the arms of Lossl.60 min: Gomez strolls forward down the right. He lays off for Salah, who drifts inside and has a whack from distance. It’s blocked for a corner on the left.59 min: Lallana and Salah combine down the inside-right channel, forcing a corner. Salah takes. Schindler clears with van Dijk lurking in the six-yard box.55 min: Hadergjonaj scoops a cross into the Liverpool box from the left. Depoitre rises highest, and guides a header towards the bottom right, but Alisson reads it well and smothers. Depoitre didn’t quite catch that a bit more oomph and Liverpool might have been in trouble.54 min: Shaqiri hugs the right touchline and slides a pass down the wing for Salah, who turns on the jets but runs down a cul-de-sac. Liverpool aren’t firing up front at all like that’s breaking news.52 min: A throw for Huddersfield deep on the left. Billing flings it in. Milner stoops bravely to head clear from a thicket of flailing legs.51 min: Henderson was taken off as a precautionary measure, as he was feeling a tight hamstring.50 min: Wijnaldum spins out of a tackle and into space down the left. He’s dragged back by Hogg. Liverpool get the foul, but Hogg escapes a yellow. That’s a pretty generous decision, and Klopp engages the fourth official in debate accordingly.48 min: Liverpool appear to be trying to up the tempo a little. Milner makes ground down the left. His cross is only half cleared, and drops to Sturridge, who tries to curl one into the top left. Too high and wide. Sturridge is cutting a frustrated figure right now.46 min: Robertson spins infield from the left wing and exchanges passes with Sturridge. Robertson has a shot from just inside the area, but it’s blocked pretty much at source. Sturridge hesitated before playing the return ball, and it probably cost Robertson there.And we’re off again! Liverpool have made a change: Wijnaldum has come on for Henderson. Huddersfield get the ball rolling once more.Liverpool will be happy to hear the half-time whistle. Huddersfield were coming at them in waves. The hosts will wonder how they’ve not managed to score they’ve been very lively in attack. It’s going to be a very interesting second half. Liverpool need to change something, because their midfield is being over-run.45 min: Pritchard whips in dangerously from the left. The Liverpool box is loaded but Alisson reads it well to claim.43 min: Huddersfield have a goal disallowed! The ball’s headed down the inside-left channel, and Pritchard is clear into the area! He flicks the ball past the outrushing, star-jumping Alisson ... but the flag goes up for offside. It’s the correct decision, but there was only an inch or so in it.42 min: Van Dijk and Lovren get into all sorts of bother trying to play out from the back. Hogg heads back into the box. The ball strokes Milner’s hip and the inside of his arm. Hot shouts for a penalty, but it’s not awarded. You’ve certainly seen those given, though Milner will argue he was too close to Hogg and his arm was in a natural position.40 min: A lovely flowing move by Huddersfield. Pritchard slips a pass down the right for Hadergjonaj, who rolls infield for Depoitre. Billing is free on the left, and eventually gets the ball, but the hesitation by Depoitre allows Gomez to get over and block the shot. Liverpool were all over the place at the back there."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fcdf67b7a385832ee407b3b96aed21bc16d59ee/0_127_3310_1986/master/3310.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d095109666fd2dca207e15d9c658fd86","title":"manchester city v burnley west ham v tottenham and more live","story":"The defending champions roared to the top of the Premier League as Newcastle’s horror start to the season continuedLouise Taylor was at St James’ Park.

The first step. The first word. The first time they turn to you and say: “Please stop, you are embarrassing me.” To these, we can now add the moment a parent solemnly hands their child their first mobile phone. But what’s the right age for this to happen? According to Dr Linda Papadopoulos – a child psychologist and ambassador for Internet Matters, a not-for-profit organisation dedicated to children’s online security – the beginning of secondary school is a good starting point. “It makes them contactable and means they can get in touch with their parents if things go wrong,” she says. “A lot of their peers will get a phone at that age, so it means they can communicate with their friends and feel part of that.” Some believe that the right age may be even earlier. The moment when children start travelling alone on a regular basis is a commonly recommended start point for a phone – which in some cases could be a year or two before or after they start secondary school. Sean Hargrave, a tech journalist and father of three, says: “It’s when your children are spending more time on their own. Their independence and geographic borders start to widen, so it makes sense to trust them with a smartphone.” Statistics suggest that most parents tend to agree that secondary school is the right age for a phone, with a July 2018 survey of 1,000 parents by Tesco Mobile concluding that the mean age most think a child should have their first phone is 11. But a mobile is more than just a phone, it offers access to a multitude of information and ideas. Much of this is positive – a child can use the phone to look up bus timetables and talk to friends, as well as let adults know when they require the parental taxi service – but parents still need to remain engaged, continually talking to children about their internet use and monitoring the sites they access and the amount of time they are online. For this reason, some experts suggest that there’s no such thing as a right age for a phone, with it depending entirely on the inidual child, the parents and the circumstances.  “When a child first receives a smartphone is a parent’s choice,” says Andy Burrows, head of child safety online at the NSPCC – which has introduced a guide to children’s online safety called Net Aware. “What’s most important is that mums, dads and carers have early conversations with their children.” For Papadopoulos, it is essential to have these conversations. These shouldn’t be lectures, but instead should encourage a child to think critically. “Until now, they will mainly have communicated face-to-face now they are communicating using texts, memes and emojis. What does it mean if they send a picture to one friend and not another? How do group chat dynamics work? Invite them to talk to you and think about these things.”  Having seen three children reach an age where they are entrusted with a phone, Hargrave has had some testing moments, but also feels children get a lot from their new devices. “They are using them for so many different things – they might be playing games, making films, watching TV, chatting to friends, researching homework,” says Hargrave. “It’s not just sitting in an armchair tapping screens. One of my kids makes films, another does arty stuff, one researches astronomy. They are a force for good, it’s just about having parameters.” And once the boundaries are established, children will be better equipped to enjoy their new device no matter what their age. Encouraging a healthy dynamic around mobile phone usage might even be easier if children get their first phone at a younger age. Hargrave believes that retaining parental access to the phone is essential, which is easier to do with an 11-year-old than a teenager. “The phone is a great safety device and it’s also great for them to communicate with their peers, but you need to keep an eye on it,” he says. “You need to have a conversation, let them know you will look at their phone periodically. You should only do it when they are there and the phone is in front of you. It’s not right to rifle around behind their backs.” It’s natural for parents to worry about their child in any new situation, and mobiles are no exception. While that can be mitigated by the use of parental controls and location tracking, these technological solutions don’t absolve parents from the responsibility of parenting. “We know that this is something parents worry about,” says Papadopoulos. “Up to now, everything the child has done the parent will have done first. But now the child will be using apps the parents have never heard of. It can make us feel insecure. But you do need to engage. You can’t just say: ‘I don’t understand.’ That’s not good enough. You need to understand, you need to get on the apps and figure them out for yourself.”Visit Tesco Mobile for more information and content on families and mobile"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cdbf79728fe1b052ae2e3d67fb45248b0ae7a5fe/0_2099_4672_2803/master/4672.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0120a147f680ba3ba1b92962b23427f5","title":"switch off your phone and start bonding great ideas for family nights in","story":"Cutting down mobile usage is a great way to create family time.

Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes puts the headset-wearer in the reinforced boots of a bomb disposal technician. They must then describe said explosive to their teammates, who issue increasingly tricky instructions to disarm it from a manual. Cue much filmic “the red wire!” “which red wire?!” bickering and a fair bit of genuine tension. With VR headsets now affordable to those without hereditary peerages, this could be a fine reason to invest.Monster HuntFilmYou could settle for the latest po-faced superhero smash-em-up that plops from Marvel’s blockbuster-peristalsis machine, but it doesn’t hurt to go off-piste with your movie-watching from time to time. And Hollywood is far from the only place producing epic family movies. Spirited Away or Howl’s Moving Castle – any of Hayao Miyazaki’s oeuvre, really – offer just the right balance of whimsy and menace, but for sheer epic scale, try Raman Hui’s charmingly weird action-comedy, and its barmy $150m sequel (Monster Hunt 2). The plot about monsters and humans happily coexisting until they don’t is basically nonsense, but you get a lot of bang, fart jokes and spectacle for your buck.Wynona EarpTV show, Netflix  SYFYThink Buffy on a budget and you’re in the right area. Wild west moustache enthusiast Wyatt Earp was in fact a demon hunter, you see. His curse – the curse of having to shoot demons in the middle of the face – was then passed down through his heirs, until it landed in the lap of Wynona, a wisecracking, leather-jacketed ex-juvie tearaway with a penchant for booze and thumping people. The show’s tone is on the mature end, but is light enough for most young teens, keeping its scares, sexual references and profanity just on the correct side of Mary Whitehouse. It’s a ton of knockabout, demon-slaying fun.PandemicBoard game, 2-4 playersThere is nothing – nothing – more certain to trigger a weeks-long Christmas-ruining family row than a “friendly” game of Monopoly. But the award-winning Pandemic is not your classic, dog-eat-dog board game – it places its emphasis on cooperation, rather than crushing your enemies before sullying their honour with a thumb-and-finger L on the forehead. The setup, admittedly, is bleak: four diseases have ravaged the Earth, and it’s the players’ job to work together to find the cures. You may just save the world. At the very least, by leaving Monopoly languishing in the cupboard where it belongs, you’ll definitely save your family harmony.Brooklyn Nine-NineTV show, NetflixThe Lonely Island’s Andy Samberg is Jake Peralta, an affably man-childish detective in the fictional 99th precinct’s weird melting pot of eccentric coworkers, pop culture references and inept crooks. The gags come thick and fast (Google “Brooklyn Nine-Nine I Want It That Way” for an idea of what to expect) the characters are all lovable and, refreshingly, kind and content and tone never ventures beyond 12A. Plus, the majestic Terry Crews is in it. Oh, did we mention it’s funny? Well it is. Very.Mario Party SwitchGame, Nintendo SwitchFor anyone unfamiliar with the series, this is essentially a virtual board game whose cutesy wickle graphics disguise a brutal crucible of tactics, skill and white-hot rage, as you battle through its dozens of infuriating, competitive mini-games until a winner is finally crowned.

Be warned, though, you’ll probably also swear.Lost in SpaceTV show, NetflixA Netflix original that seems to have been buried by the critical adoration achieved by some of its stablemates, Lost in Space is a beautiful, mega-budget 4K TV production aimed squarely at the family market. The Robinson family are part of an expedition to find humanity a home beyond the stars, until all manner of problems leave them ... yep, you guessed it. Far superior to the iffy 90s film, this reboot delivers family drama, a delectably evil baddie in Parker Posey’s Dr Smith, and a giant robot saying: “Danger, Will Robinson!” And, crucially, Matt LeBlanc is nowhere to be seen.Visit Tesco Mobile for more information and content on families and mobile"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53efb5bcbe0e31b0cd8cd53a12a39d55b697f039/1167_388_793_476/master/793.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a83244ae88d43ef66f040b233427c664","title":"teens without screens one familys attempt to rein in mobile phone usage","story":"How would writer  John Lewis and his family fare when they tried to limit their mobile phone usage? We challenged him to limit his family’s mobile usage for a week. Could it bring them closer? This is his diary.SaturdayWe are sitting down to dinner, all four of us, something that only happens a few times a week. My 13-year-old son Harry has his headphones on and is giggling at a YouTube video on his phone, occasionally getting cables caught up in his fork. My 16-year-old daughter Laurie is also multitasking as she eats, scrolling through memes on Instagram and getting flecks of fish curry on her screen.This is no way to eat a meal.My wife and I once tried restricting mobile phone use. We turned off the wifi at night, but my children used their phones in bed and ate through their data allowance in a couple of days. Looking at my family, though, it’s obvious we need to address the situation again. This time, we’ll do it using the “contract” about family phone usage that Tesco Mobile has devised with family tech expert Andy Robertson.“Right,” I announce, in my best Victorian Father voice. “The entire family is going to reduce its reliance on mobiles.”After much mocking laughter, we eventually agree on some basic rules. No phones at the dinner table. We will try to limit our mobile phone use. The children won’t accept friend requests from – or talk online to – anyone they don’t know. And this time, to avoid nocturnal data problems, everyone will leave their phone in another room when it comes to bedtime.SundaySitting on the sofa, I realise that I am baffled by what my children really do while pretending to watch their favourite TV shows.“What are you actually looking at?” I ask my daughter, whose face is glued to her phone.“Just … stuff. Instagram. Tumblr. WhatsApp. I can’t actually watch TV on its own. I have to have something else to do.”“This,” says my wife, “is why I used to smoke.”To distract our children from their phones, we play board games for the evening. It actually works – although, after an hour of hilarity and excitement, the game descends into rage, bitterness and tantrums.MondayWe are on holiday abroad. Within minutes of stopping at a restaurant or museum, the children have worked out the wifi password and are busy scrolling through Instagram and watching YouTube videos.So we pledge to completely avoid phone use when out and about. For a couple of hours, this is great – they engage with the sights, photograph buildings, ask questions and patiently listen as I bluff my answers. And then we get hopelessly lost and end up having to resort to Google Maps to navigate our way around the city.TuesdayIt is evening in the holiday apartment, and we play cards. As the only games we can actually play are Snap and Go Fish, we try to learn the rules to poker. Of course, we have to look them up online, on our phones, and have to repeatedly check back on whether a flush beats a straight.WednesdayWe continue our lengthy poker session. My wife and I are surprised when my son clarifies some of the more arcane rules and then explains, in great detail, how to play a variant of poker called Texas hold ‘em. It turns out that he has been playing a Texas hold ‘em app on his phone for much of the day. We have unwittingly created a gambling expert.ThursdayThanks to this experiment making me engage with my children’s phone usage far more, I realise that I now know what my children actually do on their phones. My son plays ridiculous shoot-em-up games, discovers obscure music on Spotify and YouTube, and watches endless drumming tutorials. He is also adept at quickly looking up information to use as ammunition in an argument, making him invariably right about all sorts of things.My daughter is scrolling through endless memes on social media and watching episodes of John Oliver and Trevor Noah giggling at comedy videos about history or playing logic puzzles or quizzes on the Sporcle website.During our holiday she read an entire playscript in German on her phone. Frankly, this is a relief. My wife and I have long lived in fear that dark forces on the internet could be preying on her, so we’re far happier with the German theatre discovery.FridayThe week is now over. Cutting down on phone use has not been easy. You realise how reliant we are on them for things such as maps and basic information.But I’ve realised something: there’s no problem with this. The problem is the kind of listless, passive reliance on your mobile for the sake of it. Restricting phone use actually reminds you that the internet is quite amazing. You could be learning Italian on Duolingo, teaching yourself how to change the oil in your car using an online tutorial, reading thousands of academic papers, or watching countless arts documentaries.I pick up my phone, flick through social media and consider getting into a furious political argument with someone on Twitter. Instead, I put the phone away and start reading a book. I should do this more often.Photography: Laura McCluskey for Visit Tesco Mobile for more information and content on families and mobile"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95de5f3e8853fc27dfaba7ad64d3315b45fc6d79/0_186_5569_3342/master/5569.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6bb6b021e7ffac120c4e9ccea32b048c","title":"look on the bright side a psychedelic margate home","story":"Cartoon colours clash with animal prints in this flamboyant house inspired by Del Boy and Changing RoomsThe exterior of Amy Exton’s Margate home is painted an innocuous shade of cream. From the outside, there’s no hint of what’s to come. But entering Exton’s house is like stepping into a psychedelic screensaver. Acidic yellows, pinks, blues and purples coat the floors, walls, stairs and ceilings. The effect is disorientating: 3D shapes are rendered 2D and, as the light changes, new colours emerge from every surface. Once your eyes have adjusted to the onslaught, you can start to take in the details: the cherubic lamp stands, porcelain leopards, kitsch side tables and plinths – the kind of objects that remain unsold at car boot sales. “How did this happen?” I ask.“I don’t come from an interior design background,” says Exton, who studied fine art at Central Saint Martins. “I haven’t got all these rules to follow. I’m just kind of doing what I think looks good.” She cites Only Fools and Horses and the 1990s TV series Changing Rooms as the inspiration behind her “trashy aesthetic”. “Most things that I like would look terrible in most interiors, but the whole grey trend just isn’t for me.”Exton’s house – her first, which she purchased two years ago – came to her in shades of “institutional brown”. The building is part of a late 19th-century complex, formerly Princess Mary’s Hospital, used as a tuberculosis sanatorium for children. The wards have been converted for residential use.Exton built sets for music and fashion shoots after graduating (the house is often rented out as a location), but her goal has always been to work in interiors. “I’m not very good at describing my work,” she admits. “I think that’s why I’ve enjoyed doing my first house so much. I can do what I want. I don’t have to answer to anyone. I’ve just gone for it.”And she really has. In the kitchen, she has painted a mural in starbursts of fluorescent pink, orange, blue and green. Slices of animal print are incorporated into the design. “I spent quite a lot of time on that wall,” she admits. “I’ve got my technique down now.” The animal print is handpainted. The rest of the design – which she makes up as she goes along – is the result of rolls of masking tape.Behind the dining table is another mural, this time a tropical beach scene printed on vinyl. Exton has customised it with a wide border of animal print and diagonal stripes. Against one wall is a curved 1970s sofa in pink velvet – a vintage find which started life in the Ivy restaurant in London. “When I first found the house, I immediately went out and bought three sofas,” Exton recalls. “That was before I’d signed anything. I was just so excited to finally have my own place.”The living room is on the first floor. In the right light, the purple of the ceiling reflects on to the coral-pink walls creating a two-tone effect that she compares to a tropical sunset. Her furniture is largely secondhand: the circular green dresser (which features on the cover of Be Bold, a new interiors book by Emily Henson) was found lurking incongruously on a country antiques website. Exton scours secondhand shops and car boot sales for plant stands and lamp bases that she then sprays in block colours. She is currently working on her own homeware range.“My style got madder and madder as I went along,” she admits. In the upstairs bathroom she has installed a vintage pink suite. “This is one of the most photographed rooms in the house,” says Exton. “People just love coming in here and taking photos.” These “#bogshots” (selfies taken in the bathroom mirror and posted on Instagram) led to a mural commission from Radio Margate, an online station, performance space and café-bar.On the top floor are two bedrooms. Exton’s is painted in a relatively safe shade of teal, with upcycled furniture adding blasts of pink and yellow. “The vintage wooden bed is probably the only thing in the house that hasn’t been painted,” she says. Next door is her housemate’s bedroom, currently off-limits because the colour isn’t quite right. “I wanted it purple, but it’s turned out lilac. It’s far too princessy,” says Exton. Luckily, it’s nothing a pot of paint and a reel of masking tape can’t fix."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/916ce019eabde590800754f1f758e7ad9a1da089/0_41_5615_3369/master/5615.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8633958fd931049e27fcdd713bf1ea7c","title":"thank you and goodbye readers you helped make my dream come true","story":"Over four years, you have allowed me to delight in the things that give me joyIt has been my experience that endings are the hardest things to write.

A further click opens up their mail client, with a pre-written email addressed to their MP, and the campaign itself blind-copied in.The campaign, which is estimated to have reached more than 10 million voters, was discovered by the digital campaign group 89up, which shared the details with the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) select committee into fake news.“This advertising is designed to specifically influence MPs,” 89up said in its written evidence. “To put this in context, Ukip has declared just £114,000 since 2018 started.”All that is known about the campaign is what can be found on its website, Twitter and Facebook accounts. Going by the name Mainstream Network, the group writes and publishes news stories on its website with an almost exclusively pro-Brexit slant, shared on its social media accounts. Its website was registered in November 2017, with the first material being published in February 2018.“Mainstream Network has potentially a bigger budget than Ukip, and is aiming to influence MPs, yet there is no transparency whatsoever over who is paying for this website,” said 89up. “Facebook claims to be tackling fake news but iniduals or groups with a political agenda can still remain entirely anonymous on the platform and reach millions of people.”89up suggests the practice of copying in Mainstream Network to the campaign emails may result in a GDPR breach. “The only assumption that can be made about this,” it said, “is that this user’s data (the user’s email) is being stored and used for marketing purposes, eg to target users with bespoke ads on Facebook using the ‘custom audiences’ feature”.“Given that there are no specific data opt-ins on Mainstreamnetwork, it is highly likely that this process and the subsequent likely storing of user emails is a breach of GDPR.”Other than the GDPR compliance, there is no suggestion that anything Mainstream Network or its backers have done is illegal. Except for registered political parties, political communications in the UK are largely unregulated outside election periods. There is no requirement to disclose funding sources or to reveal who paid for or promoted an advertisement.MPs who have been on the receiving end of Mainstream Network’s campaigning say this must change, and that the details of its approach are uniquely 21st century in character.“Over the last couple of weeks, I received a flood of about 50 emails – some quite abusive – urging me to ‘chuck Chequers’ and vote for out-and-out Brexit,” said the Labour MP Paul Farrelly, a member of the DCMS committee. “And that’s only the ones I’ve seen, not any that didn’t get through the spam filters … Usually, it is possible to tell who’s behind email or letter-writing campaigns, but not in this case.”On Tuesday, Facebook announced a new set of rules for political advertising in the UK. Based on similar policies in the US and Brazil, the site now requires political advertisers to prove they have a UK address, and British or European ID, before they can run political adverts. It also requires them to publicly declare who paid for the adverts before they will run, and the site stores a copy of every advert, along with information about spend and audience, in a new ad library.But the rules, which become mandatory on 7 November, would not have significantly affected the Mainstream Network campaign. Advertisers are free to write what they want in the declaration, which means the campaign could simply declare that the adverts were “paid for by Mainstream Network” and provide no further information. And while the site requires the person buying adverts to have a UK address, it sets no requirements on the ultimate source of funds.Farrelly added: “Apart from the anonymity, bile and bias of this website, what is really of concern here is that the campaign with these ads has come at a time when Facebook has introduced a policy for greater political transparency, yet nothing has changed.”Damian Collins, the chair of the DCMS committee, said: “Here we have an example of a clearly sophisticated organisation spending lots of money on a political campaign, and we have absolutely no idea who is behind it. The only people who know who is paying for these adverts is Facebook.“While debate on one of the central issues facing our country is part of a thriving democracy, there is an important question of where campaigning stops and political advertising starts,” Collins added.“Facebook has recently announced a set of changes to increase transparency around political advertising on its platform. This example offers Facebook an opportunity to show it is committed to making that change happen – if you are targeted with a message or asked to lobby your MP, you should know exactly who is behind the organisation asking you to do it.”Mainstream Network has not replied to requests for comment.Rob Leathern, director of product management at Facebook, said: “On 7 November, all advertisers will have new requirements before they can place political ads in the UK, including Mainstream Network.“These advertisers will need to confirm their identity and location through an authorisations process and accurately represent the organization or person paying for the ad in a disclaimer. These steps must happen or the advertiser will be prevented from running ads related to politics on Facebook.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f38b99a4d2aa866c2d107e6a023faf18363dc1d/0_131_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2be16c6c41ec048e83532c91d569b2d3","title":"peoples vote march brexit in pictures","story":"From Brexcrement and Brexshit to a Banksy-inspired placard, protesters get creative"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c19855541ced02838bab31285872b9971805042/83_0_3335_2001/master/3335.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8cc0308d16575eeb64ceace583b51e9c","title":"bepicolombo spacecraft launches on mission to mercury","story":"Experts say planet could offer new insights into how solar system formedA British-built spacecraft fitted with Star Trek-style “impulse engines” is on its way to Mercury, the planet closest to the sun.BepiColombo blasted into space from the European space port at Kourou, French Guiana, at about 2.45am UK time on Saturday. It was carried on top of an Ariane 5, the European Space Agency’s (ESA’s) most powerful rocket.After a tense countdown in French, the rocket rose slowly above a ball of orange flame and thundered into the sky before disappearing into cloud. Experts say BepiColombo could not only shed light on the mysteries of our neighbourhood’s smallest planet, but also offer new insights into how the solar system formed and even provide vital clues as to whether planets found orbiting other stars – so-called exoplanets – could be habitable.Much progress has been made in the matter, Zender said, but there is a snag. “There is one problem really, which is Mercury. Mercury doesn’t fit.”Among the puzzles is the planet’s surprisingly high density and that it is thought to have a core that is at least partly molten. With some exoplanets orbiting very close to stars cooler than our own, finding out more about the first rock from our sun has become a pressing matter.The BepiColombo mission is a €1.6bn (£1.4bn) joint venture between the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Japanese space agency, Jaxa.The mission has a hefty price tag, but is arguably something of a bargain because BepiColombo involves not one orbiter but two. Once the spacecraft has been delivered into orbit around Mercury by the ESA-built Mercury transfer module, it will split to lose a protective sunshield and release the Mercury magnetospheric orbiter, built by Jaxa, and the Mercury planetary orbiter, built by ESA.Mercury is only 58m km from the sun, but it has rarely been in the spotlight. Just wo previous missions have examined the planet’s properties – Nasa’s Mariner 10 probe, launched in 1973, and the more recent Messenger mission, which launched in 2004.The latest endeavour takes its named from the late Giuseppe “Bepi” Colombo, a professor at the University of Padua who was a key figure in devising Mariner 10’s Mercury flybys.Mercury was also found to have an exosphere, a very thin layer above the surface composed of atoms and molecules that have come from the crust and solar wind.Before BepiColombo can examine such phenomena, however, it must negotiate two major hurdles.“The heat is really severe, 450C on one side, but don’t forget the other side is -180C,” said Dr Suzanne Imber, of the University of Leicester, who is a co-investigator on MIXS – one of the Mercury Planetary Orbiter’s 11 instruments – and also worked on Messenger. Our spacecraft “is going from one to the other over a few tens of minutes … our instruments have to operate around room temperature.”The Japanese orbiter will spin 15 times a minute to avoid being toasted, like a kebab on a barbecue, while the European orbiter will be wrapped in a special multi-layer blanket and have a radiator for protection.Getting to Mercury is also a head-scratcher. “Mercury is a small body close to the sun, so you could fly straight towards Mercury and get there in a few months, but you can’t stop because the sun’s gravity sucks you in,” said Imber.The answer is to arrive slowly via an elegant series of laps, with the spacecraft swinging by Earth, Venus and Mercury before entering an orbit in late 2025, then splitting and beginning operations in early 2026.“We are passing once by the Earth, twice Venus and six times Mercury,” said Zender. “We are going so close to the inidual planets that we can use their gravitational forces to change our direction for the next step.”The team also plan to examine features of Venus including its internal structure, its chemical composition and its interaction with solar radiation.Once in orbit around Mercury, the instruments will set to work. An x-ray telescope, MIXS will help to shed light on the makeup of the planet.“We are going to know in really incredible detail what the surface of Mercury is made of,” said Imber, adding that the team can probe deeper down, too. “When you form an impact crater what you find is that layers of material from under the surface are lifted by the impact and land on the surface,” she said.  Prof Nicolas Thomas, the co-project manager of the Bela instrument aboard the Mercury Planetary Orbiter, said he wanted to investigate the planet’s curious surface features.“A planet will shrink as it cools and Mercury has cooled a lot. We think the planet has cooled in such a way that its radius has been reduced by 8km over its history,” he said. “There are huge great cliffs that we suspect have been created by this process where this shrinking has gone on but some bits have shrunk and other bits haven’t shrunk quite so much.”It is a phenomenon Bela will help investigate. “What we do is that we take a seriously large, very scary powerful laser and we fire it up to about 1,000km away from the planet and then we wait for six to 10 milliseconds and we look at the reflected pulse,” said Thomas. By looking at the time it has taken for the light to return, the team can calculate the contours of the surface below, essentially mapping Mercury.The BepiColombo mission is expected to last for two years once the orbiters are in position, but the team say it might continue for longer. Once over, the orbiters will be crashed into the planet’s surface. Prof Emma Bunce of the University of Leicester, who heads the MIXS instrument team, said after watching the launch: “I didn’t know what to expect but it was absolutely amazing, just spectacular, the way it lit up the whole sky and the way the sound eventually reaches you. Quite emotional really.“You think about the instrument you’ve worked for so many years on sitting on top of that rocket and you hope it’s going to be OK.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54660b90ae39aa7580bb07713fa0d1bf0947e11c/0_73_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb3bc8bdc9eff99f3b35ae6b6d1b6bde","title":"moon chunk that fell to earth lands 600000 at auction","story":"A lunar meteorite considered one of the most significant ever found has been sold by a Boston auction house A chunk of the moon that fell to the Earth as a lunar meteorite has been sold at auction for more than $600,000.Boston-based RR Auction announced the $612,500 winning bid for the meteorite, composed of six fragments that fit together like a puzzle, came from a representative working with the Tam Chuc Pagoda complex in Ha Nam Province, Vietnam.The meteorite comes in six pieces that fit together, weighing a total of about 5kg (12lbs) and is known as NWA 11789, and unofficially known as “The Moon Puzzle”.The auction house predicted it would fetch $500,000 at auction.The meteorite was found last year in a remote area of Mauritania in north-west Africa.

Meekle has been living there for the past two months because he doesn’t earn enough from the 33-to-45-hour weeks he works at a nearby retail warehouse to pay the rent for a flat.“The rents in Bristol have rocketed,” he says above the roar of lorries and cars. “I am doing agency work but it could dry up on Monday. It’s all minimum wage stuff.” Meekle’s temporary home is in a ramshackle line of 16 caravans and vans. There are at least seven other vehicle encampments in the city, including in wealthy neighbourhoods such as Clifton Down. Bristol city council estimates that around 200 people are sleeping in vehicles across the city.While some of them enjoy the freedom of life on the road, many are low-paid workers who have been priced out of Bristol, which has in recent years experienced some of the fastest-rising rents and house prices of any city.He will soon be forced to move on to a new road because the council has served all the vans and caravans with eviction notices following complaints of antisocial behaviour.Meekle’s neighbour Tom Burgess, a graffiti artist who also works in home removals, says the van dwellers are the victims of crime, not the perpetrators. “Everyone along here got broken into. It puts you on edge. I wake up in the night when I hear something,” he says. A few vans along, Alex Groiss is waiting for his girlfriend, a carer in Clifton. “She is working with children at the moment – it’s not well paid,” he says. “Even though she has been working in care for three or four years, it’s just above minimum wage.”Another van dweller, Nigel, who has been working as a chef in a nearby pub, says he is not earning enough to pay for a flat along with bills and food. “The noise and pollution are horrible. I’d like to be in a flat, but I’m only earning £600 a month.”Bristol is not the only city where people have resorted to living in vans and caravans. Homelessness charities report people living in vehicles across the country. Petra Salva, director of outreach services at St Mungo’s, whose teams cover London and the south-west, says it is not unusual for her workers to come across vehicles that people are using as homes.“People will find ways of coping with the shortage of genuinely affordable homes and using a vehicle is one option,” she says. “It ranges from people who would be on the street otherwise to people who are surviving on the fringes of the labour market.”Residents living near the slip-road encampment are ided about their van- and caravan-dwelling neighbours. Jon Newey, the director of the nearby St Werburghs Community Centre, which is opposite the encampment, says he has allowed them to use the toilets and charge their phones but has had to draw the line at people filling water tanks and washing themselves. “As a centre we haven’t had any real problems. They are just another part of the community we serve, but we’ve had to set up limitations,” he says.Beth Friedeberg, a charity worker who is sitting in the centre’s cafe, believes living in vehicles is better than being on the streets. “There aren’t enough houses and there’s not enough work for people,” she says.But Hassan Hamed, a lab technician who is waiting to use the centre’s computers, says the van dwellers have made his daughter’s walk to school dangerous. “They are blighting the walkway,” he says. “I cannot trust my daughter to walk to school safely because they are parking on the pavement.”Concerns like these have led Bristol to become the first council to consult on a specific policy to deal with people living in vehicles. The proposal is to tolerate short-term, low-impact encampments but move on those causing disruption.In June the council evicted more than 50 vehicles from Greenbank cemetery on the other side of the M32 after a blaze destroyed two caravans and a car. Local residents complained of noise, drugs, rubbish and people using their gardens as toilets.Paul Smith, Bristol’s cabinet member for housing, says officers will only act where there is evidence of serious antisocial behaviour. “Most people living in vehicles are not causing any antisocial behaviour,” he says. “It is only a concern when you get late-night noise, people feeling under threat, rubbish and waste being disposed of in the street.”Smith says he would like to be able offer them affordable housing in Bristol: “They are mainly single men and we are looking at building a larger number of one-bedroom properties that are suitable for them.”But this feels a long way off for the young people living beside the M32. They are due to go today. Burgess says: “We’ve found another road on an industrial estate. That’s where most of us are going to go.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa823a3e53d29c629cbef9b2e489cba8c0a60d76/0_1208_4136_2482/master/4136.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=496bd9a7fefd33139a48ce0ff77b5613","title":"tech startups stress pressure macho approach to coping","story":"At a mentoring session for founders of early-stage startups last year, Asi Sharabi broached a topic rarely discussed – at least frankly and in public – by the tech community: the daunting personal and psychological challenges faced by (often very young) entrepreneurs.Sharabi is co-founder and chief executive of Wonderbly, which publishes personalised books for children and has raised £17.4m from investors including Google Ventures and German toy and puzzle-maker Ravensburger. He sees the main balancing act as “killing it versus shitting it”. The startup world is awash with testosterone and bravado, and everyone’s expected to “kill it” all the time, the softly spoken entrepreneur explained. “Very rarely do you read about how flawed founders can be.UK-based startups also attract the lion’s share of venture capital (VC) investment, which is crucial for fuelling the sort of growth such businesses need. At nearly £7bn in 2017, VC investment in UK companies exceeded that of Germany, France and Sweden combined.Founding a startup “is a very lonely place to find yourself in”, says Yifhat Arnstein, an executive coach who works with management teams at such tech giants as Facebook, Deliveroo and Farfetch, alongside new founders. “Nobody believes that facade of ‘everything’s great’, and it’s a lot of extra weight on your shoulders. What I find when I come into these businesses is they’re hungry to talk to someone neutral. As soon as I close the door, it all comes out.”Whether people with mental health issues are more likely to be attracted to the white-knuckle ride of entrepreneurship – or that the particular stresses and strains of the tech industry serve as a catalyst – is moot (and unknown), but there’s little doubt that, for VC-backed founders in particular, it can be all but impossible to switch off.Asked if he thinks some founders are almost complicit in not discussing this aspect of entrepreneurship, for fear of perhaps sounding weak, Sharabi, who is 44 and almost too tall for the cramped meeting room in Wonderbly’s Hackney warehouse base, is unequivocal. “I have no doubt ... you’re living in a testosterone-led industry, where it’s all about ‘the gospel of growth’. And, mostly, you only hear the good stories.”James Routledge was one of the first founders to go against the grain. Launching his first startup at 20, while still at university, having raised £767,000 in angel and VC investment, he began to suffer from anxiety, panic attacks and sleepless nights. The business failed. “My heart was constantly dancing or fluttering,” he recalls.He is far from alone in thinking that greater openness can pay off. Cherry Freeman, who co-founded LoveCrafts, a social network and e-commerce site for home-crafters which has raised more than $60m (£46m), says investors increasingly want to work with open, collaborative and emotionally intelligent founders, not least because those entrepreneurs tend to make better leaders and are able to inspire their teams.“Those qualities come only with a high degree of self-awareness and transparency about our strengths and our failings,” she says. “The ability to overcome adversity is such an important part of being a successful founder.”Perceptions are changing here, too, says investor Rory Stirling, formerly of BGF Ventures. He says it’s a mistake for entrepreneurs to think they should avoid showing weakness. “As an investor, I’m looking for founders with unusual or extreme strengths in certain areas, not those with a lack of weakness. A lack of weakness implies ‘a good all-rounder’ – and in my experience these are not the people who change the world.“Building a company isn’t a physical struggle (although it can be physically exhausting) – it’s primarily a mental struggle, and an entrepreneur’s mental stamina is going to be tested, often to the extreme,” he continues. “We need to acknowledge this and as an industry, generally, we need to be better at providing the tools and resources to help entrepreneurs build their mental fitness.”It’s too soon to say whether a few enlightened outliers represent a sea change across an industry with a short attention , which by definition is always on the lookout for the first signs of the next big thing. However, there’s increasing evidence that the issue of mental health is finally being taken seriously and no longer confined to whispered conversations with trusted confidantes.“The industry still has a long way to go in remembering that we’re all human,” says Tazz Gault co-founder and director at StateZero Labs, a blockchain accelerator. “Investors have a responsibility for the wellbeing of the founders they invest in. After all, a healthy founder, both physically and mentally, inevitably leads to a much healthier and long-lasting business.”Upscale is published by Tech Nation on 27 November "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba5fcad101f1e9a9b986a234080c6539a0ac33b5/0_247_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6cdd21b20471803d950bbd43470dbc2","title":"cracksman treble john gosden champion stakes ascot frankie dettori horse racing","story":"Aidan O’Brien handed John Gosden the trophy to mark his third British trainers’ championship after Cracksman’s emphatic success in the Champion Stakes here on Saturday, and though officially the season does not end until 31 December, there was no point in waiting any longer. Three winners on Champions Day confirmed that Gosden is now as pre-eminent among British trainers as O’Brien has long been in Ireland, and though two of Saturday’s winners are now going to stud, it is easy to see the next generation at Gosden’s stable picking up where the current one left off.Cracksman had not been seen on a track since his defeat at odds-on in the Prince of Wales’s Stakes at Royal Ascot in June, but Gosden had him primed to perfection for the last race of his career and with a set of blinkers added for the first time. The four-year-old took a little time to settle, but accelerated six lengths clear of Crystal Ocean once Frankie Dettori gave him his head with two furlongs to run.Dettori was playing to the crowd as he came past the grandstand with victory already secure for the 5-6 favourite and it is likely to be many years before another horse wins consecutive runnings of the Champion Stakes by a combined total of 13 lengths.“He was very lethargic in the summer,” Dettori said. “Like one of those ponies of your kids’ that you have to drag everywhere. Cool weather, autumn and a bit of rain and he was back to his best today.“I was able to put him where I wanted him, usually he makes my life difficult but today I had a beautiful position.This was Cracksman’s third Group One win of the season and took Gosden’s prize-money total in Britain to £8,240,761, within sight of O’Brien’s record total of £8.34m last season and almost double the earnings of Sir Michael Stoute, the next British-based trainer in the list, with £4.5m.With Dettori, Gosden has formed an irresistible partnership over the past four seasons, adding a win in the Derby and three in the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe, and Saturday’s treble on British racing’s most valuable afternoon sealed the best season of his 39 years with a licence.Gosden’s outstanding stayer Straarius, an even-money chance, opened the card with victory in the Group Two Long Distance Cup under a brave ride by Dettori, who worked his way around the inside on the home turn before holding off Thomas Hobson in the closing stages. Dettori’s mount leaned into the runner-up and the rider picked up a three-day ban as a result, but it will not start until the day after he rides Enable, this year’s Arc winner, at the Breeders’ Cup on 3 November.The bookies were spared a potential catastrophe when Lah Ti Dar, the even-money favourite for the Champions Fillies \u0026amp Mares’ Stakes, was third behind O’Brien’s Magical, but Gosden still dominated proceedings on Champions Day as few have done in the past as he ended with a 10-1 treble.“Roaring Lion was beyond brave because he was never enjoying the ground and had the guts to win it. Cracksman had been showing this at home. The vibes have been pretty strong. I just knew that if we focused his mind he would fly, and he flew. When Cracksman is in the zone, he is a very good horse. He is Frankel’s best son and it is good to see him back with a bang.”Oisin Murphy was close to tears as he was led back to the winner’s enclosure after the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes here as joy mingled with relief and sheer nervous exhaustion.He had to nurse and coax Roaring Lion over every inch of the straight mile on soft ground that the three-year-old clearly loathed, but Murphy knew that he was on the best horse and made it count as he finally edged ahead of I Can Fly, a 33-1 outsider, to win by a neck.Roaring Lion will now retire to stud at the end of a sequence of four Group One wins with his versatility underlined by this successful drop back from 10 furlongs to a mile for all that it was hard work throughout. Murphy, meanwhile, has his first Champions Day winner, and in the colours of Sheikh Fahad al-Thani, the owner who retains him.“I was never on the bridle throughout the race but he wanted it and showed his toughness and resolution,” Murphy said. “What a fantastic stallion he’s going to make.“I didn’t really get to enjoy it today because it was nip and tuck through the last furlong and my horse had no petrol left. But he stuck his head out and I’m just very relieved we could get the job done.”John Gosden, Roaring Lion’s trainer, turned to a different kind of horsepower to sum up the performance: “He showed his class, and his jockey showed his class,” he said. “Oisin didn’t panic. He could have panicked at the two and started throwing everything at it, but he nursed and nursed and got him there.“The horse and he have grown in confidence together. It’s like a motor racing driver with his car, when they get in tune with one another, and he knew that the horse was not travelling at any stage. But he produced him beautifully to win the race.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c04e7b1c997db5c1695f000fe1025d5340a328d6/0_30_2970_1783/master/2970.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9bc4e8e7138f855df155cdcbb0aff46b","title":"danny cipriani sent off munster rory scannell gloucester","story":"Danny Cipriani’s bad week got considerably worse when the fly-half rejected by England was sent off for a high tackle during Gloucester’s Champions Cup defeat at Munster.Cipriani caught Rory Scannell in the face with his shoulder and as soon as the incident was referred to the TMO the Gloucester man knew he would be sent off under the current directive against aggressive contact with an opponent’s head.

On balance neither side deserved to lose a frenetic 10-try thriller but, for the second Saturday in a row, a late Bath penalty miss deprived them of a crucial win in Pool 1.On this occasion it was Bath’s replacement fly-half, Alex Davies, who missed from a wide angle, with Freddie Burns having hobbled off injured six minutes earlier.It proved the decisive moment of a topsy-turvy contest that left Wasps’ director of rugby, Dai Young, with mixed feelings. “I don’t know whether to be angry or relieved,” said Young, having watched his initially lacklustre team fight back from 21-7 down at half-time to secure three much-needed points.Very little at Wasps is predictable at the moment, with last week’s 52-3 drubbing by Leinster still fresh in the memory. Christian Wade’s decision to quit rugby to try his hand at American football has been another untimely distraction, with the club in no hurry to wave farewell to a key contracted player on the eve of the November internationals. Supporters are entitled to some answers but the club are still refusing to comment on what they insist is a legally sensitive matter. “Hopefully it will be cleared up soon rather than later,” said Young with a sigh.Todd Blackadder, meanwhile, does not expect Craig’s fanciful appeal for a Toulouse rematch to be successful, preferring instead to praise Burns’s character in bouncing back from his agonising misjudgment in failing to ground the ball when clean through for the winning score a week ago. The fly-half slotted a perfect five conversions from the tee here but a damaged knee denied him the chance to deliver the match-winning postscript when Wasps’ Juan de Jongh was penalised for not rolling away on the floor with under two minutes remaining.Instead it was left to Will Chudley, the former Exeter scrum-half belatedly making his competitive debut for his new club, and the winger Joe Cokanasiga, a member of England’s squad for next month’s autumn series, to leave the most lasting impression. Chudley injected much-needed tactical nous into Bath’s game and inside the first three minutes sent the powerful Cokanasiga surging to the line.Further scores for Max Wright and an intercept effort for Semesa Rokoduguni left Wasps up against it even after Bath had been reduced to 14 men when François Louw was sent to the sin-bin for a tip tackle late in the first half. In a one-sided third quarter, however, the hosts scored three converted tries inside nine minutes through Joe Simpson, Zurabi Zhvania and a bullocking Ashley Johnson to take a 28-21 lead.Charlie Ewels responded with a galloping try of his own to draw Bath level again before a close-range 64th-minute score by Louw once more gave Bath the edge. Could they cling on?With nine minutes left a thrilling series of attacking thrusts from Wasps ended with Rob Miller and Joe Simpson setting up Thomas Young for a breathless score, converted once again by Lima Sopoaga.The range of crowd emotions that greeted poor Davis’s missed penalty, however, were rather less striking than the booing that started up each time Eddie Jones’s face appeared on the big screen in the first half. If there was a slight pantomime element – it did eventually morph into ironic cheering – it was hard to recall it happening before. On and off the field these are increasingly febrile times in English union."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e582dc11979e39ab0756581ebadd070770078fa5/0_197_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=507a254108c1eba23be0a99486a34c95","title":"strictly come dancing 2018 week five seann walsh katya jones perform as it happens","story":"Alfonso Ribeiro sits in for Bruno on the panel as the contest continues.

Alfonso is continuing to make this all about him, and Seann lost the energy half way through. Craig thought Seann’s footwork was very messy, but it was a lively, vibrant performance. Darcey thought it was light and fast, but Seann needs to listen to Katya more and regain his focus. Sean is pretending to be a busker, until Katya persuades him to dance with a guitar jammed firmly between them. Ah, it’s gone, that’s now less weird. This is a perfectly serviceable Quickstep - a bit bouncy and the odd mistake in places, but definitely not the worst Quickstep we’ve ever seen. Hold on to your underwear, it’s SEANN AND KATYA.

It was A-MAY-ZING.So Ashley is quite good at the Rumba and has some lovely hip action. Quite a lot of dragging and shots of Ashley’s crotch, and all seems a bit fast and spiky for my liking, without a huge amount of Rumba basic. But what do I know. I’m on my sofa under a blanket in some polar bear pyjamas.Next up it’s ASHLEY AND PASHA! This week they’re dancing the Rumba to ‘Something About The Way You Look Tonight’ by Elton John. Because anything Faye can do, Ashley can do better. This is a lovely song, will be interesting to see if Pashley go romantic and ethereal, or full on Rumba filth. I always hope for the latter and am invariably disappointed.Scores: 6,7,8,8 - a total of 29 for Graeme and Oti.Good toothy Tango from Graeme and Oti, really enjoyed that and am finding the buckets of guyliner oddly attractive.

Church bells were rung in towns and villages across the UK, for the first time since the war began, both as a symbolic gesture and to let people know the war was over.Though this was a joyous moment for the allies at least, the devastating loss of life affected many families and communities in Britain and across the world.

Now a minority have turned back, using transport organised by Guatemalan security forces.“I’m going back because I’ve had enough, and this might be my only chance to go back safely, guarded by policemen,” said 17-year-old Byron Espina from Copán. Espina worked as a coffee picker in a small village called La Entrada, making only pennies, he said, and had hoped to find work in the US.Free buses started arriving late on Friday night, just hours after Mexican riot police had hurled teargas bombs into the frustrated crowd after some migrants broke through a riot-shield cordon to enter Mexican territory. Mexico’s president, Enrique Peña Nieto, said on Saturday that the caravan of people could seek asylum or enter with the right travel documents, but “irregular entry” would not be tolerated. Fearing further repression and long delays, some started boarding the buses destined for the Honduran border town Agua Caliente, where police have stopped hundreds of migrants from leaving the country to join the exodus north.The escalating intervention by security forces is seen as a direct response to threats by President Trump to cut off millions of dollars of aid to Central America and Mexico if they fail to stop the caravan – the second this year – reaching the US border.Migration is not a crime, and a regional agreement allows free movement for citizens of Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua travelling with national ID cards.The director of the Americas for Amnesty International, Erika Guevara Rosas, tweeted: “Honduran migrant caravan is not a security threat, but an act of survival by 100s of people escaping extreme violence, poverty, exclusion, and the inability of their government to protect their rights. The response to this human drama should be one of solidarity and compassion.”The migrants and refugees are mostly fleeing a toxic mix of violence, poverty and corruption. On Friday night at least eight people were killed during shooting in a bar in Tegucigalpa, Honduras’s capital, one of dozens of similar incidents so far this year. Fewer than one in 10 crimes are prosecuted. Honduras is the most unequal country in the region: two-thirds of people live in poverty.The bridge connecting Guatemala and Mexico over the Suchiate river has become a makeshift refugee camp, with thousands of people, including entire families, forced to sleep, eat, and play outside, just metres from growing piles of rubbish.Despite the risks, most are determined to continue. “This uncertainty is part of the trip,” said Fresbindo Carvajal, 24, from Tegucigalpa, who walks with a cane due to a congenital defect in one leg. “I’m still on my way up. No doubt. It’s better to suffer for a moment than a whole lifetime. And if we go back to Honduras we’ll suffer until the day we die. Even if we have to survive on beans and coffee, I’m going.”Protests in support of migration have broken out in cities across Honduras, including outside the US embassy in Tegucigalpawhere journalist and ex-congressman Bartolo Fuentes – who was illegally detained and deported from Guatemala last week while accompanying the caravan – spoke to the crowd. “I have seen mothers cry about the bodies of their children. Parents receive the coffins. I hope this stops. Meanwhile, we must accompany our fellow countrymen,” he said on Friday.Marta Sánchez, founder of the Mesoamerican Migrant Movement, which organises an annual caravan of mothers searching for their children who disappeared while trying to reach the US, said: “This is not a caravan, it’s an exodus.“It’s a popular uprising against the government by people who can take no more of the terrible conditions in Honduras.

But hurdles remain before the change can be formalised.A referendum on the agreement several weeks ago failed to pass the turnout threshold of 50 percent, leaving it up to the Skopje parliament to settle the issue.The procedure to complete constitutional changes is lengthy and requires several rounds of voting, with Friday’s being just the first stage. The procedure should be completed by January at the latest.“Today is a historic day for the country,” Prime Minister Zoran Zaev said. “Macedonia will be part of the European family our dreams and visions for better life in a better country will be fulfilled.”Once Macedonia formally changes the constitution, the Greek parliament will also have to vote on the deal.Defence Minister Panos Kammenos, who heads a small right-wing party that props up the government in the legislature, has threatened to quit the coalition if the Greek vote goes ahead.“A great day for democracy in Skopje,” Johannes Hahn, the EU’s commissioner in charge of enlargement, wrote on his Twitter account.Russia and the US have traded allegations of interfering in Macedonia’s affairs.Last month Washington accused Moscow of running a disinformation campaign to sour the public on the deal ahead of a referendum on the changes.Russia, which opposes Macedonia’s NATO aspirations, on Thursday fired back.“There is a continuation of the crudest interference of the US and EU in Skopje’s internal affairs, the level of which has already surpassed conceivable boundaries,” the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement."},{"url":null,"title":"college open","story":"Open days offer prospective students a unique opportunity to sample life on campusWhat you need to know to make sure you take full advantage of your open day opportunityOpen days give you a great chance to gauge how good a fit your course and college choice will be"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"President said he took jet to Northern Ireland because he could not be picked up at BorderWell-known Italian restaurant on Dame Street to close doors for last time next monthJim Nicholson tells UUP members he voted \u0026lsquowith the head not with the heart\u0026rsquoLabour to bring forward citizenship Bill in attempt to help people born in State remainUUP chief says Northern politics \u0026lsquodeeply broken\u0026rsquo with no return of devolution in sightVaradkar earlier said customs posts could cause risk of return to violence post-BrexitBepiColombo mission to examine closest planet to sun where temperatures pass 400 degreesMusician and painter embraced island life after being adopted from Dublin aged fourShepherd Machaya is due to be deported to Zimbabwe after his asylum application was refusedFor just 6km, the road from Castleblayney to Dundalk dips into Northern IrelandAbout 25 per cent of all sexual offences are carried out by children, conference hearsDelays reduced to between five and 10 minutes by 9pm on FridayMinister rejects allegations that housing policy is focused on \u0026lsquobenefits not bricks\u0026rsquoKerry farmer Michael Ferris convicted of manslaughter of Anthony O\u0026rsquoMahonyNational Transport Authority introduces changes to help reach BusConnects flat fareBorder businesses feel their way in the dark as \u0026lsquoBrexpo\u0026rsquo get-ready tour reaches MonaghanTravelling salesman jailed for five years for \u0026lsquoopportunistic rape\u0026rsquoT\u0026aacutenaiste asks Saudi envoy for \u0026lsquoindependent and credible inquiry\u0026rsquo into killingGarda\u0026iacute launch high visibility operation to reduce speeding"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3660278.1539269071!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit the truck driver and 20 tonnes of frozen chicken","story":"Simon Carswell travels with truck driver Stephen Heasley to find out how post-Brexit customs checks could affect food supplies. Video: Simon Carswell\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tHaulier Stephen Heasley  at Manfreight  in Portadown, Co Armagh. Photograph: Liam McBurney for The Stephen Heasley carries out a few final checks at the back of the lorry to make sure the load is secure.As a cold mist drifts down over him from the minus-22-degree air inside, he pulls at a metal bar that will keep the 20-plus tonnes of frozen chicken in his refrigerated lorry in place for the 620km journey – lasting 12 bumpy hours – to the east midlands of England.The chicken has come from a processing plant in Dungannon, Co Tyrone and before that from Northern Irish farms. Our destination is a cold-storage facility outside Grantham in Lincolnshire. Grantham is probably best known as the birthplace of Margaret Thatcher, but it’s also one of the locations where Northern Irish chickens are dismembered, sent for repackaging and distributed to supermarket chains such as Tesco, Sainsburys and Aldi across the United Kingdom and Ireland.It is another type of dismembering that Heasley and other hauliers fear most: the chopping-up of delicately balanced supply chains. These ensure that animals reared in one island and processed in another can be prepared for customers across both jurisdictions, guaranteeing that products maintain the commercially viable shelf life of five to six days that keeps supplies flowing and money changing hands.The UK voted to leave the European Union 28 months ago and yet, with less than six months to go to “Brexit Day” (the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm British time on Friday, March 29th, 2019), British and European politicians have not agreed an exit deal. Such a deal would protect those supply chains while both sides hammer out a longer-term agreement governing future trading between the world’s second-largest economic bloc and its fifth-largest economy.Heasley – a 43-year-old from Lisburn, Co Antrim – knows the road ahead better than most. He has made the journey from Portadown, Co Armagh, across the Northern Ireland-Republic of Ireland Border and on to Dublin Port, Holyhead and then England many, many times in his two-decade career driving lorries.“Watch yourself, there’s a bump coming up,” he says, pointing into the distance to a ridge you still can’t see, minutes after we have pulled out of the haulage yard of Manfreight, the Portadown company he works for.You tend to feel most things on the road in a 44-tonne, 500-horsepower Volvo FH4 lorry, particularly with a load of between £40,000 (€46,000) and £60,000 (€68,000) worth of frozen chickens in the back.Heasley and hauliers like him feel Brexit more keenly than most of us, but they know too that the political road ahead is difficult to navigate.Transport companies such as Manfreight have developed decades-long supply routes, carefully managed on delicate profit margins and strictly regulated man-hours for the company’s 180 drivers. For these businesses, which rely on certainty, Brexit is chaos. Nobody knows what will happen, and planning ahead is complex.“There is nothing an average man or company can do because they don’t know what is going to happen,” says Heasley, 11 kilometres from what is right now an invisible border.“They don’t know what they can do. They just don’t want delays.”From Portadown, it is about 140km to Dublin Port. Heasley knows he can make the 8.40pm Stena Line to Holyhead in plenty of time. There is little traffic on the road this Wednesday evening.Less than an hour into our journey, as we approach the Border, the Volvo truck is powering ahead steadily at 56mph, or 90kmh. Suddenly, the continuous white line on the side of the road becomes a broken yellow one, and roadside signs turn bilingual, in Irish and English. Speeds and distances now appear in kilometres rather than miles. These are the only indicators that we have crossed the Border at Carrickcarnan, Co Louth.“Other than that, you wouldn’t know the difference,” says Heasley.Brexit has left a dark cloud of uncertainty over this border road and the rest of the 499km frontier from Carlingford Lough to Lough Foyle.While the EU and UK have said they want to avoid a hard border post-Brexit, they still have not agreed a plan to achieve this. Both have agreed that within the treaty covering the UK’s exit from the EU there must be a “backstop” – a guarantee to have no hard border unless and until a future trade deal offers a better solution to avoid one – but no backstop has been agreed.It has become the most intractable part of the Brexit negotiations, threatening to scupper an overall exit deal and heightening the pressure on EU and UK negotiators to agree some compromise for this week’s crunch EU summit in Brussels.“Nobody is actually sure what’s going to happen with the Border,” says Heasley, eyes fixed on the road ahead. “We’re hoping for transport companies’ sake and the customers’ sake that there are no border crossing checks and no security, because it will have an impact on us as drivers and the loads we are carrying.”He explains that under EU rules heavy goods vehicle (HGV) drivers must have a 11-hour rest every day, though it can be reduced to nine hours, three times a week. That means from the moment a driver starts driving, they have a 15-hour period – a “spread-over,” Heasley calls it – to get their goods to a destination.And there are plenty of goods heading to destinations on these roads. The Revenue Commissioners estimates that 13,000 commercial vehicles cross the Border every day. The UK’s Freight Transport Association has warned that a bad or no-deal Brexit could lead to “near-paralysis of freight” at the Border.Some Northern Irish hauliers have tried to Brexit-proof their businesses. Manfreight has opened an office in Clonshaugh, north of Dublin. Others are unwilling to invest without knowing what Brexit will likely bring.“It is that lack of clarity, people are unwilling to take a gamble,” says Seamus Leheny, policy manager at the Freight Transport Association in Northern Ireland.Driving across the Border, we have about an hour and a half to make the 8.40pm ferry. If we miss that boat, the next one from Dublin Port to Holyhead is at 2.15am. This would mean pulling out of the port at Holyhead on the other side of the Irish Sea at around 6.15am. With more than four hours driving still to go to reach Grantham – and with Heasley’s 15-hour spread-over expiring at 9am – he would not get there in time.“That is what a driver is up against,” he says. “If I was out of time, they would have to find another driver to lift that food. It might not be our man it might be a subbie. You have all that additional cost either way.”The margin of error is extremely narrow. Any kind of delay on the Irish Border after Brexit could knock a tight schedule for a haulier like Heasley out.“The boat waits for no man. It is not interested because some customs man kept me for an hour or two up the road,” he says.Heasley’s colleague Henry Totten, a 75-year-old who has been driving since he was 21, knows about delays at the Border better than most from his days transporting goods north and south at the height of the Troubles. Checks on the goods he was hauling had to be carried out by customs agents on either side of the Border, in both Newry and Dundalk, and then at the Border itself, adding up to five hours to a journey time.“You were wasting half a day no matter what way you looked at it,” he says.Carrying “groupage” – a mix of goods collected from different customers to create an economic full-load – made customs checks even more complicated, he recalls.“You could have sat there all day. The customs official could have said, ‘I want to see such and such an article,’ and you would have to take half the load off to get to it,” says Totten.Now he can complete a run from Northern Ireland to Cork and back in a single day.“It is the best thing since penicillin,” says Totten of the invisible border that has been in place for more than 20 years. “You have no stops to do.”We make good time to Dublin. There was just a two-minute slow-down at an M1 toll booth north of Dublin city and some light traffic heading into Dublin Port.Heasley drives into the holding lorry park at the port with 28 minutes to spare before the ferry leaves.The port is Ireland’s busiest for freight by some distance. Central Statistics Office figures show that 992,295 loaded freight vehicles and trailers passed through the port in 2017. It is a key transit point to access the UK from Ireland and over the so-called UK “land-bridge” to continental Europe.The Freight Transport Association estimates that 60 per cent of the 475,000 freight containers shipped to Britain have their final destination in Britain and that most of the remainder ends up being transported on to other parts of the EU.Welsh first minister Carwyn Jones said on a visit to Dublin this week that some 70 per cent of goods moving between Ireland and Britain pass through Holyhead and Pembroke Dock, the other Welsh port for freight transportation. “Any kind of delay is bad. It is not just bad in terms of being able to export from Ireland into Great Britain, but onward traffic going through Dover into the continent. This point has been made to me by Irish haulage companies,” Jones says.Any collapse in Brexit talks could hurt Ireland’s trade with the UK and the rest of the EU. There is lots at stake: Ireland exported €14.8 billion of goods to the UK in 2016 – 12.5 per cent of all the country’s exports, while it imported €20.5 billion – 28 per cent of all imports coming into the country, according to the Central Statistics Office.As Heasley drives his lorry into the port, an official tells him that all the “plug-ins” on the boat have been taken. This means he cannot plug into an electricity mains to keep his refrigerator running. Trucks are prohibited from running their own engines for the duration of the roughly 3½-hour sailing to Wales.Heasley’s chickens are frozen so it is not a problem on this trip, but if he was carrying fresh “just-in-time” products such as dairy items – yoghurts, ice cream and the like – or “something that is a bit vulnerable”, he would need a plug-in. Otherwise, “a lollipop would run off a stick,” he says.At the check-in hut at the port, Heasley discovers he is not booked onto the ferry. There has been a mix-up. He makes a phone call back to Manfreight and, a few minutes later, Heasley has our tickets in his hand.Eighteen minutes after arriving at the port – and with no checks of his goods on board – he drives onto the ferry at 8.30pm, the third-last lorry onto the boat with 10 minutes to spare before departure.Upstairs, we tuck into a meal of meatballs and chips in the Truckers’ Restaurant, surrounded by grey-looking drivers dressed in checked shirts, combat T-shirts and baseball caps.Heasley says that some of the chicken we are transporting will end up being served in fast-food restaurants back in Ireland after being processed and breaded in another factory before being distributed to customers. This is how circular supply chains work in Britain and Ireland. The economies are more closely intertwined than many consumers realise.He explains the meticulous choreography of supply chains: hauliers often have a set time to deliver food produce to a distribution centre in time for other lorries to transport it on to other processing centres.Brexit and border hold-ups could mean missing a crucial delivery window, landing additional costs on the haulier. Regular delays might even lead to the loss of contracts to suppliers operating closer to the distribution centre. It is all about maintaining the critical shelf life of products. Fail to do so, and costs could increase and availability of products could fall.“Down the line, everybody will pay for it,” says Heasley. “It is going to have an impact across the board.”A day before our journey, Heasley’s boss, Chris Slowey, Manfreight’s owner, explains that drivers are the biggest commodity in the haulage business, and a driver being delayed for one 24-hour cycle a week because of Brexit would mean a requirement for 20 per cent more drivers when there are shortages of drivers generally.“If each driver of ours loses a day, it would effectively mean we would have to renegotiate all our rates with our customers,” he says, explaining the havoc Brexit could cause freight operators.“From an exam to a marriage, you have a period of preparation because you know what is coming. With Brexit there are so many unknowns,” he says.On the ferry over dinner, Heasley explains other challenges lorry drivers face on the road: diesel stolen from tanks while drivers sleep in their cabs “curtain sider” lorries being knifed open and goods stolen toilet emergencies.An unintended consequence of Brexit-related delays at borders could lead to a boom in sales of Lucozade and Oasis drinks bottles, both popular with lorry drivers who have to answer the call of nature on the road. “They have a wider neck,” Heasley explains. He makes clear this is not something he resorts to himself.Four hours after driving onto the ferry in Dublin, Heasley drives down the ramp at Holyhead. Apart from a short delay as a result of congestion from hundreds of trucks disembarking from two ferries arriving at the same time in Wales, we are out of the port within 13 minutes. Only one piece of paperwork is handed in to a port official.“Everything’s smooth. Everything’s all right,” says Heasley as he heads for the dual-carriageway and the M56 to take us to the M6, the motorway spine running down the west of England from the Scottish border.Heasley explains that the majority of Manfreight’s traffic goes “over the top” via ports at Larne and Cairnryan, through Scotland and down into England. This route makes sense for deliveries in the north of England because there is less driving time required, but a lower speed limit in Scotland is a big downside.The strict limits on driving times determines everything, however.“Going through Dublin tends to be easier,” says Heasley. “If a man’s going to the south of England, it just means it brings you out in the middle of England so you have less driving time.”Barrelling down near-empty roads as we cross into England, Heasley says he was not among the 56 per cent of Northern Irish voters who elected to remain in the EU in the June 2016 referendum. He voted Leave along with other “lorry men” because of strict EU rules on drivers and their hours, and the heavy fixed penalties that enforce them.The damage he saw to lorries at Calais port in France during the migrant crisis also encouraged him to vote Leave. Information shared on lorry driver groups on Facebook about what was happening to the lorries and drivers helped to sway his vote, he says.“People never knew when they voted what the impact of Brexit was going to be,” he says.He points to the British morning TV interview with Brexiteer Nigel Farage the day after the referendum, when Farage admitted that the Leave campaign misled the public about EU money going to the health service post-Brexit.Does he regret voting to leave now?“Aye,” says Heasley. “I believe Brexit is going to impact on our cost of living, so I do. It is going to be more expensive for a man to run a haulage company now than it was previously. People don’t understand that. I never understood that at the time.”And if he had the opportunity to vote again? “I wouldn’t have voted Leave,” he says.As Heasley explains the challenges around the EU regulations, he grimaces – and it has nothing to do with the regulations. “That’s a rabbit I just killed there,” he says.Our early-morning discussion turns to roadkill, the perils of speeding, his advice for trainee drivers and his favourite route (dawn on the West Pennines, he says).“I killed a deer one time on the A75 in Scotland . . . bigger than a dog,” he says.Heasley pulls into a services stop near Crewe in England, still almost two hours from our destination in Grantham. He has hit his four-hour driving limit so, under EU regulations, he has to take a 45-minute break.Inside, we grab a tea and coffee and some chocolate. Heasley explains the dietary toll and the poor physical shape this gruelling work life leaves some lorry men in. Heasley sometimes likes to walk up and down factory yards for exercise after “tipping” his loads.After Heasley’s compulsory 45-minute rest-up and a quick check that the temperature around the chickens is still well below freezing, we are back on the road.Still in darkness, Heasley navigates a final dangerous junction, waiting a few minutes for a safe gap to cross two lanes of fast-moving oncoming traffic. The morning commuters are on the road. A little after 6am, we pull in to our destination: the cold store in Grantham.Heasley exchanges paperwork at a check-in hut and pulls around the back. He opens the back door for the first time since Portadown and reverses the six-axle lorry slowly up to a hatch for the chickens to be unloaded.It is completed in 19 minutes, leaving him with more than two hours still to go within his driving limit. That is enough time to head north and make his next collection point for his return back to Portadown “over the top” via Scotland.“Smooth and no delays,” he says of the 12-hour, 22-minute door-to-door trip.Brexit will likely make this journey rougher, he acknowledges, given the potential for delays at the Irish Border or at Holyhead once the UK is no longer in the the EU.“Come March it is a different story, all uncertain,” he says, before starting the next leg of his journey.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Alan Betson The N53 Castleblayney to Dundalk road slices through the southern tip of Co Armagh.Travelling from Monaghan, the road enters Northern Ireland where it crosses Ballnacarry Bridge straddling the Fane river. A mere six kilometres later, it leaves the North at the exact spot on the map where the boundaries of Armagh, Monaghan and Louth come together.For the six kilometres that the N53 is inside Northern Ireland, it is known as Concession Road and is festooned with no fewer than nine fuel outlets, enterprises ranging from substantial filling stations to small fuel depots selling commercial and agricultural diesel. There are other businesses too, including off-licences, car and tractor dealers, furniture and kitchen outlets and firework sellers.The name Concession Road comes from the fact that for decades – long before the modern Troubles and the Belfast Agreement – there were no customs checks at either end. Southern vehicles could enter and leave Northern Ireland along the N53 without being checked. That was the concession.Those living within the North, most of them on or around Concession Road and many clustered around the village of Culloville, were not supposed to cross the Border using the N53, though many surely did.Instead, with their NI vehicle registration plates, they were supposed to use a manned crossing with all the usual customs posts and checks.One such existed on the R179, the road that runs due south from Culloville to another small Border crossing, Kingham’s Bridge over the Fane, beside derelict 19th-century corn and flax mill buildings, about 400m from the village crossroads. On this road, the full bureaucracy of Border checks and inspections was applied to travellers.On the northern side, the Border post was blown up by the IRA in November 1971. On the southern side, what locals refer to as Culloville south, there is a ribbon of homes along the road but no commercial outlets. What used to be the Garda station is now a neglected, boarded up, two-storey house.“This used to be a flax hole,” Martin Watters says of the boggy, flood plain around Kingham’s Bridge and the Fane river valley. The flax was soaked for up to 14 days to separate the fibres that would be milled into linen.Watters and his brother Séamus run Watters Electrical, a substantial and successful appliance business on Concession Road with customers throughout Ireland.In the space of just a few minutes’ observation last week, many vehicles flew in both directions across Ballnacarry’s pretty six-arch bridge. Many of the drivers were probably oblivious they were crossing a frontier that is now taxing British and European Union negotiation skills.There were big articulated lorries, low-loaders with diggers, refrigerated trucks and transit vans, a huge scrap metal truck and numerous saloon and estate cars, with a roughly equal number of northern and southern registration plates.Noeleen O’Hanlon and her family look out across the bridge, the river and its flood plain from their well-kept bungalow and garden.“We don’t know what’s going to happen,” she says of Brexit. She’s not overly worried about the possible imposition of a Border and customs post where there never was one but is anxious nonetheless at the uncertainty of it all.Just around the corner from her and still in the North, is Mary McMahon, a renowned maker of Carrickmacross lace who has lived in the area for all of her long years. “I hope there’s no Border,” she says looking across her front garden and down at the busy road.Between Ballnacarry and entering Co Louth at the other end of Concession Road, the vehicles pass Hoey’s Fuels, Casey’s Top service station, R \u0026amp J Fuels, A \u0026amp N Fuels, CFL Fuels (clean energy, they promise), PLP Fuels (also offering Colombian coal for €14 a bag), Dev-Oil, Blessing’s and O’Neill’s Nisa Local (together with a supermarket in which half the wall space, plus a large part of the floor area is taken up with displays of spirits, wine and beer).The fuel outlets advertise kerosene (marketed as “kero”), petrol, diesel and red diesel (supposed to be used only in agricultural and construction machinery). Between the fuel outlets are various other enterprises.They include Ballytrain Plant Sales and yard filled with JCBs Watters Electrical (which shares a yard with Dynamite Fireworks Superstore that turns out to be a cargo container with a door) the Dev-Oil complex that includes a bar and lounge and off-licence O’Neill’s Tractors APS Auto Parts and Autocare. The general shops in Culloville include a Spar attached to the Top station, another fireworks outlet, Hughes Kitchens, GP Motors and Silkwood Furnishings.Dev-Oil is run by Eamon Devlin, a warm, irrepressible, larger-than-life character with a past to match.“I’m a kind of smuggler myself,” he says ushering me into his office having gotten a mug of tea from his filling station-cum-supermarket. A flashing sign advertises litres of spirits for €19.99 and a case of Prosecco for €31.99.Devlin drives a white Range Rover sports model with personalised plates (E17 DEV). A heavy smoker with a tanned face and on his second liver (“alcohol” he explains), Devlin has diamond rings on both hands, comes from Crossmaglen and is friends with businessman Sean Quinn, as well as IRA veteran and fuel launderer and smuggler Slab Murphy.There’s a photo in his office showing Devlin and Armagh GAA trainer Joe Kernan flanking Murphy who is holding the International Rules trophy. Devlin has taken part in demonstrations of support for Quinn, describing the Cavan-based businessman, formerly Ireland’s richest man, as his “best mate”.Other photos in the office show former taoiseach Bertie Ahern and former US president Bill Clinton in Dundalk in 2000 Devlin’s former home in Castleblayney (a 900sq m spread with an indoor swimming pool and a Rolls Royce in the drive), and – pride of place – his lawyer son Eamon, managing partner with MJ Hudson, a London-headquartered advisor firm to fund managers.“He’s about 150 solicitors working for him,” says Devlin – a nightmare vista for the father surely.Devlin’s other four sons work closer to home. One runs the farm, another the fuel station, and a third runs a waste recycling business behind it. At one stage in his career, Devlin, who left school aged 14, employed 300 construction workers building schools and factories.South Armagh and Concession Road is a place where people are often closely related and the Border, and all that is connected to it, is a backdrop to just about everything.Devlin’s sister Sue is married to Séamus Watters, and his own wife Kay is a daughter of Jack McCann, killed in the 1972 IRA bombing of the Newry customs clearing centre. The huge Dev-Oil fuel operation, hospitality service and off-licence does “90 per cent of our trade with the Republic”, he says.“Personally,” he says, “I think it’s going to be a hard border, customs back again and check points and the devil know’s what, which we don’t want.”But that said, he thinks technology will do away with most of the delays. He says the British didn’t think things through.Pointing to the hill that separates – by only a few hundred metres – Concession Road from the Border, he says, “EU migrants will come into the South and walk over the back of that and they’ll be in the UK”.He doesn’t think British prime minister Theresa May is up to the challenge.“I’d have her 100 times over Margaret Thatcher but it’s a pity David Cameron didn’t stay on,” he says.Now aged 69 and having survived in business for more than 50 years, using the hated Border to his advantage, Devlin reckons that whatever happens next March when the UK is due to leave the EU, life will carry on much as before.“It’s not going to hurt us that much,” he predicts.He fears that any restrictions on movement, such as customs posts or other frontier checks, will provoke an inevitable reaction.“Once you start hemming people in again, they won’t accept it. That’s ordinary decent people. I’m not talking about dissidents.”A roadside poster from Sinn Féin links the civil rights march of 1968 to contemporary issues. “Don’t let the DUPTories take away your rights through Brexit,” it says.Further down the road outside GP Motors, its owner Patrick O’Meara surveys the collection of small white vans, all bought from English leasing firms after about three years’ use and which he is re-selling. They’ll all go to buyers from the South, he says.As he chats about Brexit and the uncertainty of it all, an unmarked Mitsubishi jeep glides by, heading towards Ballnacarry Bridge.“The police,” says O’Meara, “they patrol up and down every now and then.”Just checking there’s nothing unusual going on along Concession Road.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Matt KavanaghThe One of the oldest and most traditional Italian restaurants in Ireland will close its doors for the last time next month with its owner of more than 40 years deciding its pasta time to take a break. For years after it opened its doors in 1963, Nicos Restaurant on Dublin’s Dame Street was one of the few places in Ireland where decent Italian food could be found. It played host to an almost endless stream of politicians and celebrities and lived through booms and busts and Celtic Tigers and cataclysmic crashes.But even though Nicos remains as busy as it ever was, its time is up and last orders will be taken on the evening of November 10th after which owner Emilio Cirillo will retire from the restaurant he bought with his partner Graziano Romeri in 1977. Nicos was born 55 years ago when the first owner Ruggero Nico resigned from his job as a butler in the Italian Embassy in Dublin and opened a family restaurant at 53 Dame Street. At the time, the number of Italian restaurants in the city could be counted on one hand and Nico’s quickly became hugely popular among the Italian community living in Dublin as well as Ireland’s political elite, with Charlie Haughey and Brian Lenihan among the more well-known visitors from Leinster House.It was also the restaurant of choice among academics working in Trinity College as well as scores of opera singers who regularly travelled over from Italy to perform in the Gaiety’s opera seasons.Nico ran the restaurant for a decade before deciding to return to Italy to run a leather business with his brother.But although Nico was gone, his name lived on and after he returned to his home country in 1973 the restaurant changed hands twice before Emilio Cirillo and Graziano Romeri acquired it in 1977The pair had been working together in another Italian restaurant called Bernardos – Mr Romeri was the chef and Cirillo was a waiter – before they decided to take the plunge and plant deeper roots in their adopted country. Mr Romeri was born north of Milan and he met his Irish wife while working in a kitchen in Switzerland, with the pair moving to Dublin in 1969. Mr Cirillo was born outside Naples and he met his wife – who was also Irish – in London. The couple relocated to Dublin in 1971.“I think it is time, in fact I think I should have retired 10 years ago when Graziano did” Mr Cirillo told The . “I will miss it as it has been part of my life for almost 50 years but you have to make decisions in life and I am nearly 70 so it is time to go.”While he has plans to lease the premises he said he had no idea as yet who would take over, but he confirmed that the place – once part of Dublin in the rare old times – will be gone for good.

It’s time to prove you are,” he added.Mr Swann said the Renewable Heat Incentive inquiry demonstrated just how “shambolic” the last Northern Executive was. He said coverage of the inquiry was “not a political farce on television, but rather an insight into the inner workings of the Sinn FéinDUP Executive who operated in a state of almost permanent paranoia and self-interest”.When he reflected on “how unionism has been dragged into the gutter by the DUP” he felt angry.“It’s grim that the DUP have created a situation where Sinn Féin of all people are able to call for ‘integrity in government’ and gifted them the opportunity to pull down the institutions,” he added.“Sinn Féin, whose main game-plan after all these years still seems to be to run the place into the ground in a hope that people will submit and limp into a united Ireland.” He added: “For two parties that now quote the Belfast Agreement when it suits them, I sometimes wonder if they’ve ever got past the front cover. Because over the last 10 years we’ve watched their own warped interpretation lead to a race to the bottom as they ran Northern Ireland into the ground.”He said Sinn Féin lacked any “self-awareness when it comes to their own role in the current political paralysis here” and also seemed “utterly incapable of showing any sensitivity towards the victims of IRA violence”. “You cannot preach reconciliation while in the next breath lauding sectarian killers and shouting ‘up the rebels’,” he added. Mr Swann said politics was “deeply broken” and was pessimistic about the prospects of bringing back the Assembly and Executive. “I am not a man given to extravagant language so let me be straight with you: listening to the rhetoric of Sinn Féin and some within the DUP it is clear that we are not going to see the restoration of devolution anytime soon.” On Brexit, Mr Swann was critical of the Irish Government and said there could be no toleration of a resolution that would weaken the United Kingdom. “We want a good relationship with our neighbours in the Republic of Ireland, but it`s very hard to maintain that when you continually poke us in the eye. Work with us, not against us,” he said.The current Brussels proposals would make Northern Ireland a “protectorate” of an unaccountable EU, he added.Mr Swann said it would be “economic vandalism to impose a border on our most important trading route which is between Northern Ireland and Great Britain”.He added that he had a message for Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, the Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney and Irish ministers: “Every day that you trample over the Belfast Agreement and the principle of consent, you do further damage to relationships across these islands. Breaking the Belfast Agreement to facilitate the backstop risks destroying what has taken decades to build.”On the past, Mr Swann said the UUP “will not allow history to be rewritten so that the murders of our party members, our elected representatives, our friends are portrayed as anything other than the barbaric, bloodthirsty, sectarian murders that they were”.Mr Swann was scathing of the DUP and sought to draw distinction between it and his party on social and other issues. “Let me be very clear,” he said to unionists generally, “if you somehow have become confused and think that sectarianism, racism or homophobia are tenets of unionism, then I am not at all sorry to say that the Ulster Unionist Party is not the party for you.”“Nigel Dodds says there’s a battle for the union. I’m inclined to think it’s a battle to save the union from the DUP,” added Mr Swann."},{"url":null,"title":"varadkar brexit is the political equivalent to climate change","story":"  October 18, 2018Varadkar explains \u0026ldquohow far we have come in 30 years, from violence to peace.

Photograph: Emmanuel DunandAFPGetty ImagesTheresa May returned to London on Friday after three days in Brussels that brought her no closer to a Brexit deal and left many of her own MPs at Westminster unhappier than ever. There was some comfort for the prime minister from her fellow EU leaders, who didn’t rule out convening a special summit next month if negotiations make sudden progress. The leaders also decided not to hold a special no-deal summit and to avoid big public announcements about their own preparations for a no-deal Brexit, which could be viewed as provocative or threatening in London.Downing Street seized on Angela Merkel’s reported comments at a dinner of the 27 remaining member states on Wednesday evening when she suggested that the EU and Ireland should show more flexibility over the backstop. Was this the long-awaited intervention by the EU’s “grown-ups” to instruct Michel Barnier to make more concessions over the backstop?\u0026nbspNot if you listen to Emmanuel Macron, who said it was up to Britain to propose a solution for the backstop.“The EU has already demonstrated our flexibility, but there are limits. We cannot jeopardise the single market, the four fundamental liberties, or Ireland. It is no longer a technical issue but one of the political capacity of the UK to find a solution,” he said.The EU leaders not only left Barnier’s mandate unchanged but praised his handling of the negotiations, proposing no change of direction. May’s fellow leaders are conscious of her limited room for manoeuvre at Westminster and they believe that no other potential prime minister would have a better chance of concluding a deal on Brexit.Some senior EU figures are convinced, however, that there is no Brexit deal that will be able to command a majority in the House of Commons, leaving a no-deal Brexit as the most likely outcome.The proposal to extend the transition period by up to a year has angered Conservatives of all stripes and renewed speculation about May’s leadership. Her next big test comes with the budget later this month and with Brexit still unresolved, she can probably rely on the support of the DUP to get it through the Commons.In the meantime, there is little expectation of progress in the negotiations, making mid-December the earliest likely moment to conclude a Brexit deal. After, the prime minister will face the formidable challenge of constructing a parliamentary majority behind whatever she agrees with the EU.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph:  Stephanie LecocqEPAOne of Theresa May’s key allies called on Conservatives to unite behind her on Friday after MPs on all sides of the party criticised a proposal to extend the post-Brexit transition period by a year. Foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt said Conservatives should consider how remaining united had strengthened the hand of other EU countries in the negotiations.“The great strength of the EU in these negotiations is that the 27 EU nations have remained united. And we now need to do the same behind Theresa May to maximise her negotiating leverage in Brussels,” he said.Ms May said in Brussels this week that she was willing to consider extending the transition period, which is due to end in December 2020, by up to a year. This would provide more time to put in place a new customs arrangement with the EU, so that the Northern Ireland backstop would never have to come into operation.Jacob Rees-Mogg said that he and his fellow Conservative Brexiteers in the European Research Group (ERG) would vote against any legislation to authorise further payments into the EU budget during an extended transition.“If the government is saying to us we will pay £39 billion plus, for the extension, £15 billion or £16 billion more per annum, and we don’t have anything in return other than a waffly political declaration, I think that will be very hard to get through the House of Commons. I think it will be very hard for anyone to justify to their constituents,” he told the BBC.Former Remainers have also criticised the proposal and Scottish secretary David Mundell, who campaigned against Brexit in 2016, has reportedly warned the prime minister that he could resign over it. Extending the transition would mean that Britain would still be in the Common Fisheries Policy, which is deeply unpopular among Scottish fishermen, when the next Scottish Parliament elections are held in 2021.Some Conservative Brexiteers at Westminster are so unhappy with Ms May’s handling of the Brexit negotiations that they want to move against her and replace her with former Brexit secretary David Davis. The president of Toyota said on Friday that a no-deal Brexit should be avoided at all costs, warning it could affect Japanese car manufacturers in Britain and across the EU. Akio Toyoda said apprehension was growing among Japanese car makers that Britain could leave the EU without a withdrawal agreement.“It is necessary that an unimpaired trade environment between the United Kingdom and the European Union be maintained and that the automobile industry’s activities remain predicated on shared standards, including those regulating vehicle certification,” he said.More than 100,000 people are expected in central London on Saturday for a march and rally calling for a second referendum on Brexit. The rally will hear speeches from television celebrities and sports stars as well as anti-Brexit politicians from all the main parties, including Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable. “Tragically, Brexit ides one generation from another. A substantial majority of my generation voted to leave. A substantial majority of the young. Your generation is being betrayed by mine. By those who look to the past, who see Britain as a museum,”\u0026nbspSir Vince is expected to say.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Simon DawsonReuters.Hundreds of thousands of supporters of the European Union marched through London on Saturday in the biggest demonstration so far to demand that the British government holds a public vote on the terms of Brexit.The protesters waved the blue and gold flag of the EU and held up “Bollocks to Brexit” banners under sunny skies to call for another referendum on the eventual deal on how Britain will leave the world’s biggest trading bloc.The march comes after another tumultuous week for prime minister Theresa May in which she failed to agree a orce deal with EU leaders in Brussels and infuriated members of her own party by making further concessions in the talks.With just over five months until the UK is due to leave there is no clarity about what a future trade deal with the EU will look like and some rebels in Mrs May’s Conservative Party have threatened to vote down a deal if she clinches one.James McGrory, one of the organisers of the march, said voters should have the chance to change their minds because the decision will impact their lives for generations.“People think the Brexit negotiations are a total mess, they have no faith in the government to deliver the promises that were made, partly because they cannot be delivered,” he said.At the march, demonstrators carried placards saying “Brexit is pants”, “Time for an EU turn” and “European and proud.”Organisers said about 670,000 people took part in the march, which would make it the largest in Britain since a demonstration against the Iraq war in 2003.The “People’s Vote” campaign, which includes several pro-EU groups, said they had stewards stationed at regular intervals to estimate the size of the crowd. The police did not provide an independent estimate of numbers participating.Protesters originally gathered near Hyde Park and then walked past Downing Street and finished outside parliament where they listened to politicians from all main political parties.Britain’s 2016 referendum saw 52 per cent vote in favour of leaving the European Union. But the past two years have been politically fraught as the government has struggled to agree on a plan and there are fears that Britain could leave the bloc without a deal.Some opinion polls have shown a slight shift in favour of remaining in the European Union, but there has yet to be a decisive change in attitudes and many in Britain say they have become increasingly bored by Brexit.The prime minister has repeatedly ruled out holding a second referendum. The opposition Labour party’s Brexit spokesman said last month his party open to a second referendum with the option of staying in the bloc in certain circumstances.In Belfast, around 2,000 people gathered on Saturday to oppose Brexit.Brendan Heading, a 39-year-old IT worker, said he was worried the decision to leave the EU would damage the economy and could lead to the break up of the United Kingdom.“I feel that Brexit threatens prosperity and stability,” he said. “People should have the opportunity to vote for an alternative based on what we now know.”Brexit supporters held their own rally in the town of Harrogate in the north of England.Richard Tice, vice-chairman of Leave Means Leave and one of the speakers at the event, described the people on the march in London as “losers” and said a second referendum would trigger a constitutional crisis.“We had a vote, we voted to leave, the idea to have a second referendum would be incredibly damaging,” he said.“People need to be under no illusions as to how people feel about what is a significant potential for a total betrayal of democracy in this country.” - ReutersDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

What about giving me one for playing a straight man?”Campaign groups have pointed out that 52 straight people have received Oscar nominations for playing gay characters, including both Blanchett and Rooney Mara for Carol.Blanchett, who recently starred in Ocean’s 8, said playing someone with thoughts and experiences different from her own is one of the joys of her job.She said: “Part of being an actor to me, it’s an anthropological exercise. So you get to examine a timeframe, a set of experiences, an historical event that you didn’t know anything about.“But also I\u0027m about to play a character whose political persuasions are entirely different to my own, but part of the pleasure is trying to work out what makes her tick.”She also told the festival that she would like to be a part of more LGBT films, and hopes they are getting easier to make.“Carol was a real labour of love for me. I’d read the Patricia Highsmith story ages ago, when I was in high school. And the film, I think now would be made in a heartbeat, but eight years ago, it was a very difficult film to get up,” explained. “Two women, both of whom are of lesbian-ish persuasion in the 1950s, which is like ‘who wants to go and see that? Only 12-year-old boys go to movies.\u0027 Thank goodness we’re changing the demographic of the critics who write for Rotten Tomatoes.” “For me if something is difficult to make,” she said, “it’s like a red rag to a bull.

Part 2, spawned one of the world\u0027s most successful film franchises, grossing an estimated £6 billion worldwide, according to Forbes.But the 29-year-old admitted he is not immediately associated with J.K Rowling\u0027s most famous character among younger fans of her books.Radcliffe said: I do have a thing sometimes where I meet kids now and their parents will bring them up to me and they\u0027ll be like \u0027this is Harry Potter\u0027 and the kids will be like \u0027no it\u0027s not\u0027.Last month marked the 20th anniversary of the release of the first Harry Potter book in the US, 15 months after it hit the shelves in British bookshops.Radcliffe, who turns 30 next July, was 11 when he was cast in the first installment of the franchise, which catapulted him to global fame.He added: It is very strange but also genuinely lovely when somebody comes up and says \u0027you were a huge part of my childhood\u0027.For me The Simpsons was a massive thing and the idea that I could occupy a similar place in someone\u0027s else life is so crazy and wonderful.I always say I\u0027m incredibly lucky to have got famous with Harry Potter because it is a genuinely beloved thing.Radcliffe is currently based in New York where he is performing in new Broadway play The Life of a Fact, based on a 2012 book of the same name about an essay examining the suicide of a 16-year-old boy in Las Vegas. Strictly Come Dancing 2018, week 5 live: Ashley Roberts rumbas to top of scoreboardRecord numbers of gambling addicts were hospitalised last year, new NHS figures revealComment: What next for the House of Saud?Turkey \u0026#39will not allow a cover up\u0026#39 as Saudi Arabia admits Jamal Khashoggi was killed at consulateMigrant caravan vows to remain on border crossing without food or water until Mexican authorities grant accessMega Millions lottery jackpot climbs to $1.6 billion -

Set in the 1970s, it stars Florence Pugh as a young actress recruited by Mossad to infiltrate the PLO.The result, according to the cast, was a resounding success, with all agreeing that the language barrier was swiftly overcome.“Park Chan-wook doesn’t speak English, although I think he understands more than he lets on, said Charles Dance, who plays a British intelligence officer. Having a director from a totally different culture is a great idea and the fact that he doesn’t speak English is not a hindrance at all. He has a wonderful eye.”Daniel Litman, who plays a Mossad agent, said: Director Park is an amazing person. He doesn’t speak English, he speaks Korean, and yet you listen to him even though you don’t understand what he’s saying.”Park approached the production company responsible for Le Carre adaptations after reading a new Korean translation of The Little Drummer Girl. He hoped to adapt it for the big screen, but was persuaded to make it for television.The director, who made his English language debut in 2013 with Stoker, starring Nicole Kidman, said being Korean gives him an understanding of Le Carre\u0027s works.Korea is probably one of the last ided nations, the root of which is found in the Cold War.

The result snuffs out the Liberal-National coalition\u0026#39s one-seat majority The result will leave Mr Morrison’s Liberal-National Coalition with 75 MPs in the 150-seat House of Representatives, forcing it to rely on cross-bench MPs to avoid a no-confidence vote.Mr Morrison became leader in August after the Liberal party ousted former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull following a bitter internal battle. The switch meant Australia – which has become known as the coup capital of the world - has had four prime ministers deposed by their party in the past eight years.Independent candidate Kerryn Phelps delivers her victory speechVoters in Wentworth, where Mr Turnbull was the popular former member, vented their fury at the ballot box.The Liberal party suffered a swing against it of 22 per cent, believed to be the worst ever in an Australian by-election.The result places intense pressure on Mr Morrison, whose party will grow nervous ahead of a general election, due early next year. Admitting that “Liberals are angry”, Mr Morrison said it was a “tough day” but pledged to work with the cross-bench.“Tonight is a night when we listen, learn and accept the blows,” he said. The Liberal Party has paid a big price tonight for the events of several months ago.”But the result will also be seen as a judgment of Mr Morrison’s leadership. He campaigned heavily in the seat and made a desperate bid to win the seat’s sizable Jewish vote by suddenly announcing this week that he would consider following US president Donald Trump’s decision to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, left, speaks next to Liberal candidate Dave Sharma The move was widely criticised and angered Palestinians and Indonesia, Australia’s Muslim-majority northern neighbour, but appears to have failed to sway voters.Campaign staff for Dr Phelps said the biggest issue cited by voters was the coalition’s reluctance to take action on climate change.Political commentator David Crowe said the Liberal party would now face internal recriminations that would leave it further ided. “This was a swift and savage message to Scott Morrison that puts him in a diabolical position in Parliament and sets him on course for catastrophe at the next election,” he wrote in The Sydney Morning Herald.“He governs with an unsteady party room of Liberal MPs who will bicker over anything and make their leader’s job impossible.”The Labor opposition party urged the government to call an election. The next ballot is due to be held early next year.Please review our commenting policyStrictly Come Dancing 2018, week 5 live: Ashley Roberts rumbas to top of scoreboardHarry Potter star reveals he is no longer recognised by children because at 29 he’s stopped looking like the boy wizard Record numbers of gambling addicts were hospitalised last year, new NHS figures revealComment: What next for the House of Saud?Turkey \u0026#39will not allow a cover up\u0026#39 as Saudi Arabia admits Jamal Khashoggi was killed at consulateMigrant caravan vows to remain on border crossing without food or water until Mexican authorities grant accessMega Millions lottery jackpot climbs to $1.6 billion - the largest in US historyOver 50s make better bar staff than millennials, says Wolseley bossThe Little Drummer Girl Stars reveal they hung off director’s every word - even though all of them were in Korean\u0026#34Outrageous\u0026#34 for Bercow\u0026#39s Brexit role to trump bullying claims, says Amber Rudd as Speaker steps down as inquiry chairmanCate Blanchett blames reality television for backlash against straight actors playing LGBT rolesBollywood megastar pays off loans of 850 India farmersVIP paedophile accuser \u0026#39Nick\u0026#39 appears in court over claims he lied to the police \u0026#39More than 500,000\u0026#39 anti-Brexit protesters march through LondonComment: Thirty years on from the Lawson Budget, the Tories need to rediscover their faith in tax cutsFrench rocker Johnny Hallyday\u0026#39s posthumous album sells 300,000 copies on first day of releaseRoyal tour: Duke of Sussex urges the public to honour the military as he opens Invictus Games in SydneyNew treatment offers up to ten months extra life for women with deadly breast cancerWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 20 october 2018","story":"Britain\u0027s Queen Elizabeth looks around the Fenwick department store at The Lexicon shopping centre during a visit to Bracknell, Britain.Strictly Come Dancing 2018, week 5 live: Ashley Roberts rumbas to top of scoreboard, Seann Walsh stuck at bottomHarry Potter star reveals he is no longer recognised by children because at 29 he’s stopped looking like the boy wizard Record numbers of gambling addicts were hospitalised last year, new NHS figures revealComment: What next for the House of Saud?Turkey \u0026#39will not allow a cover up\u0026#39 as Saudi Arabia admits Jamal Khashoggi was killed at consulateMigrant caravan vows to remain on border crossing without food or water until Mexican authorities grant accessMega Millions lottery jackpot climbs to $1.6 billion - the largest in US historyOver 50s make better bar staff than millennials, says Wolseley bossThe Little Drummer Girl Stars reveal they hung off director’s every word - even though all of them were in Korean\u0026#34Outrageous\u0026#34 for Bercow\u0026#39s Brexit role to trump bullying claims, says Amber Rudd as Speaker steps down as inquiry chairmanCate Blanchett blames reality television for backlash against straight actors playing LGBT rolesBollywood megastar pays off loans of 850 India farmersVIP paedophile accuser \u0026#39Nick\u0026#39 appears in court over claims he lied to the police \u0026#39More than 500,000\u0026#39 anti-Brexit protesters march through LondonComment: Thirty years on from the Lawson Budget, the Tories need to rediscover their faith in tax cutsFrench rocker Johnny Hallyday\u0026#39s posthumous album sells 300,000 copies on first day of releaseRoyal tour: Duke of Sussex urges the public to honour the military as he opens Invictus Games in SydneyNew treatment offers up to ten months extra life for women with deadly breast cancerWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/10/20/TELEMMGLPICT000178359301_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"saudi arabias liberal shift always pr spin","story":"The Khashoggi killing has shown the world the kingdom’s true face\u2028– and it is grotesqueThe Saudis have our measure, I’m afraid.

That company – whose handset is often hailed as a challenger to the\u0026nbspiPhone – has spoken about how it is aiming to go mainstream with its latest handset and take on rivals like Apple.It will also bring an end to a busy period of launches, all scheduled before the holiday season, that has also included new Amazon Echos, phones from rivals including Samsung and Huawei, as well as Apple\u0027s own launch of three updated phones and the brand new Apple Watch Series 4.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

More recently, a stencil of Girl with Balloon sold for £860,000 at auction, only to double in value after the work’s frame – designed by Banksy – began to shred the piece.\u0026nbspOne of the biggest signs of Banksy’s growing\u0026nbspiconic status came in 2014, when young adults abroad named the artist as one of the people they most associated with UK culture alongside William Shakespeare, The Beatles and Queen Elizabeth II.\u0026nbspBelow, you can flick through a gallery of the artist’s works, including some of his most iconic works, such as Kissing Coppers and\u0026nbspRage, the Flower Thrower.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Banksy artworks – in pictures Show all 73Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Seen on the side of building on Wilder Street in BristolSprayed onto a black wooden board in a blocked off doorway on Clement Street, Bristol, within sight of the city\u0027s bustling centreA Banksy piece in California depicting a child wielding a machine gun, in black and white surrounded by colored flowersIn 2004, Banksy printed ‘one million pounds’ worth of his \u0027Tenners\u0027Banksy headed to Palestinian territories and created images on Israel\u0027s highly controversial West Bank barrier673 \u0027Love is in the Bin\u0027During Sotheby\u0027s Contemporary Art Sale on 5th October the Banksy artwork \u0027Girl with Balloon\u0027 shredded through the bottom of the frame as it was sold.

The audible vehicle alert system (AVAS) was designed to warn visually impaired pedestrians when an electric vehicle is approaching, as the cars are almost silent when operating at lower speeds. Jaguar had originally planned to make the I-Pace sound like a “sci-fi spacecraft”, but in testing the carmaker found that the sound caused pedestrians to look up at the sky, instead of in the direction of the vehicle. Electric vehicles already able to cut greenhouse gas emissions by halfUK needs six-fold increase in electric vehicle charging points by 2020Electric vehicle sales held back by ‘deceptive’ car dealershipsUK provides millions to help build more electric vehicle batteriesThe company then developed a new sound, which is emitted from a speaker located behind the front grille. The alert can be heard in every direction, and cannot be switched off. Jaguar engineers worked for four years to develop the AVAS, and consulted with charity Guide Dogs for the Blind to “ensure real people are at the heart of our product testing”.Iain Suffield, a technical specialist at Jaguar, said: “The absence of traditional engine noise from electric vehicles creates a problem for vulnerable pedestrians, such as the blind or visually impaired. This is especially true at low speeds in town centres and car parks. We developed the audible vehicle alert system for the I-Pace to ensure the safety of all road users.”Support free-thinking journalism and subscribe to Independent MindsShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

In Settings, hit the Privacy tab. From here, you can control who gets to see your future posts and friends list. Choose from Public, Friends, Only Me and Custom in the dropdown menu.Annoyingly, changing this has no effect on who’s able to see your past Facebook posts. Instead, on the Privacy page, you have to click on Limit Past Posts, then select Limit Old Posts and finally hit Confirm on the pop-up.39 Make yourself harder to findYou can stop completely random people from adding you by selecting Friends of Friends from the dropdown menu in the Who can send you friend requests? section of the Privacy page. It’s also worth limiting who can find your Facebook profile with your number and email address. 49 Control access to your TimelineYou can limit who gets to post things on your Timeline and who gets to see posts on your Timeline too. In Settings, go to Timeline and Tagging and edit the sections you want to lock down. When you block someone, they won’t be able to see things you post on your Timeline, tag you, invite you to events or groups, start conversations with you or add you as a friend. To do it, go to Settings and Blocking. Annoyingly, you have to block people on Messenger separately. One of Facebook’s handiest privacy features is the ability to review posts you’re tagged in before they appear on your Timeline. They’ll still be visible on the News Feed while they’re fresh, but won’t be tied to your profile forever. In Timeline and Tagging, enable Timeline review controls. 79 Clean up your appsYou can view a list of all of the apps you’ve connected to your Facebook account by going to Settings and Apps. The list might be longer than you expected it to be. It’s worth tidying this up to ensure things you no longer use lose access to your personal information. 89 Change your ad preferencesYou can view a list of everything Facebook thinks you’re into and tinker with your ad preferences by going to Settings and Adverts.

It’s a hell of a lot of information, which you should download to ensure you never over-share on the social network again.19 Lock your profile downIf you haven’t done this already, do it now. In Settings, hit the Privacy tab. From here, you can control who gets to see your future posts and friends list. Choose from Public, Friends, Only Me and Custom in the dropdown menu.Annoyingly, changing this has no effect on who’s able to see your past Facebook posts. Instead, on the Privacy page, you have to click on Limit Past Posts, then select Limit Old Posts and finally hit Confirm on the pop-up.39 Make yourself harder to findYou can stop completely random people from adding you by selecting Friends of Friends from the dropdown menu in the Who can send you friend requests? section of the Privacy page. It’s also worth limiting who can find your Facebook profile with your number and email address. 49 Control access to your TimelineYou can limit who gets to post things on your Timeline and who gets to see posts on your Timeline too. In Settings, go to Timeline and Tagging and edit the sections you want to lock down. When you block someone, they won’t be able to see things you post on your Timeline, tag you, invite you to events or groups, start conversations with you or add you as a friend. To do it, go to Settings and Blocking. Annoyingly, you have to block people on Messenger separately. One of Facebook’s handiest privacy features is the ability to review posts you’re tagged in before they appear on your Timeline. They’ll still be visible on the News Feed while they’re fresh, but won’t be tied to your profile forever. In Timeline and Tagging, enable Timeline review controls. 79 Clean up your appsYou can view a list of all of the apps you’ve connected to your Facebook account by going to Settings and Apps.

They have a social and financial responsibility to be transparent – that\u0027s why we\u0027re demanding independence and accountability in the company\u0027s boardroom, said New York City Comnptroller\u0026nbspScott Stringer.An independent board chair is essential to moving Facebook forward from this mess, and to reestablish trust with Americans and investors alike.The proposal will be put to a vote at the company\u0027s annual shareholder meeting in May 2019, however it will be largely symbolic due to the control that Mr Zuckerberg has over the company\u0027s board.Mr Zuckerberg\u0027s reign at Facebook has previously been compared to a dictatorship because he owns a majority of voting rights to the firm.In an op-ed earlier this year, a member of the California State Teachers\u0027 Retirement System (CalSTRS), which holds shares in Facebook, called for the company to make changes to reflect its size.Facebook has grown at an unbelievable pace. The capital structure has changed and it is time for its governance to catch up, CalSTRS\u0026nbspinvestment officer Aeisha Mastagni wrote in\u0026nbspThe Financial Times.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

By 2010, the energy-producing kites were being built with rigid wings that could harness more power from a higher lift.The most recent version of the Makani kite was first flown in test flights in December 2016, performing loop-the-loops in a wide circle in the skies that produced up to 600 kW – enough electricity to power around 300 homes.It is estimated that wind power has the potential to meet the world\u0027s energy need 100-times over,\u0026nbspalthough currently only four\u0026nbspper cent of the world\u0027s electricity is generated from wind.Makani believes that it\u0027s possible to unlock additional wind resources that aren\u0027t accessible or cost effective today, the project\u0027s website states.\u0026nbspOur low mass opens up new possibilities for wind power in deepwater offshore sites. We continue to design, prototype and test energy kites so that more people around the world can have access to clean, affordable wind power.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It also comes in a whole host of looks, with Apple re-introducing brighter colours to its range.Beyond the design, the features of the iPhone Xr are almost the same as its more expensive sibling. It still features the beefed up A12 bionic processor and the improved camera.But it also removes some of the more expensive features, too. The Xr has an LCD screen rather than the richer OLED found on the Xs, and features only one camera on the back instead of two.The Xr starts at $749 in the US, or roughly in the same in pounds and euros. The same carriers that offered deals on the Xs are doing so for the Xr.The handset will actually go on sale – and arrive with people who pre-order it – just a few days before Apple\u0027s next big launch event. On 30 October in New York, it is expected to show off new updates to the iPad\u0026nbspPro and its Macs.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The audible vehicle alert system (AVAS) was designed to warn visually impaired pedestrians when an electric vehicle is approaching, as the cars are almost silent when operating at lower speeds. Jaguar had originally planned to make the I-Pace sound like a “sci-fi spacecraft”, but in testing the carmaker found that the sound caused pedestrians to look up at the sky, instead of in the direction of the vehicle. Electric vehicles already able to cut greenhouse gas emissions by halfUK needs six-fold increase in electric vehicle charging points by 2020Electric vehicle sales held back by ‘deceptive’ car dealershipsUK provides millions to help build more electric vehicle batteriesThe company then developed a new sound, which is emitted from a speaker located behind the front grille. The alert can be heard in every direction, and cannot be switched off. Jaguar engineers worked for four years to develop the AVAS, and consulted with charity Guide Dogs for the Blind to “ensure real people are at the heart of our product testing”.Iain Suffield, a technical specialist at Jaguar, said: “The absence of traditional engine noise from electric vehicles creates a problem for vulnerable pedestrians, such as the blind or visually impaired. This is especially true at low speeds in town centres and car parks. We developed the audible vehicle alert system for the I-Pace to ensure the safety of all road users.”Support free-thinking journalism and subscribe to Independent MindsShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But arguments as to where it begins rage quietly in the background all the time. Anywhere upwards of the Watford Gap, goes the hoary old joke, if you’re from London.Research last year conducted by Liverpool University suggested that the north now begins somewhere in Leicestershire, having moved south slightly from Derbyshire. To a northerner from Lancashire or Yorkshire, both those places seem to be more the Midlands… but aren’t Midlanders really just northerners anyway?The north-south ide in schools is real – and it’s more complex thanWe in the north wear northernness like a badge of pride. In 2005, The Wedding Present released a single called\u0026nbsp“I’m From Further North Than You”. The band is from Leeds, which is squarely in the north. Yet it’s considerably further south than Carlisle, the most northerly city in England.It would take you the best part of three hours to drive from Carlisle to Sheffield. Sheffield is indisputably in the north, yet skirts those Peak District lands, the Nottinghams and Chesterfields which form the gateway to the Midlands.iStock)Last summer, website The Tab drew up a map showing the north-south ide according to the number of shops of baked goods purveyor Greggs in any particular area, and according to this metric, Sheffield was put in the south.Ridiculous, of course, as anyone who watched the opening episode of\u0026nbspDoctor Who earlier this month will know. The new – and first female – Doctor is played by Jodie Whittaker, who hails from Huddersfield. The entire episode was set in Sheffield, and was as northern as you like – too northern, according to some commentators on Twitter. And heaven knows what the large contingent of American Whovians made of such joyous sight gags as a drunk throwing the salad out of his kebab at a menacing alien.If the boundaries are blurred, then northernness as a concept is perhaps even harder to pin down… at least from the outside. If you’re northern, you know it. If you’re not sure, then you probably aren’t.I have lived in the north all my life, first in Lancashire (and the bits re-designated Greater Manchester after local government reform in 1974), and then in Yorkshire. There is a rumour that northerners are warm and friendly, and we are. Or some of us, at least. We’re not exactly all dancing around like Munchkins there is still a fairly large contingent of people who will rip you off or rough you up or be generally as horrid as criminals are in London.But, by and large, the general populace does have what feels like a greater empathy for others than we, as northerners, often see on our sojourns down south. Up here in the north we genuinely smile at strangers on the street often even talk to them. I remember one of my first trips to the capital, to see Wigan play in the Rugby League Challenge Cup final at Wembley. A contingent of Wiganers were standing in Euston station, asking passersby how best to get to Wembley. They were roundly ignored, much to their puzzlement. A little while later I saw a different group handing out song sheets to stony-faced passengers on the Tube, offering to teach them some Wigan chants.We have space to breathe, in the north. The air’s a lot clearer than it used to be, thanks to various environmental acts and, oh, the fact that most of the heavy industry the country used to rely on us for has long since been closed down. We can get a decent-sized place to live. One of a northerner’s favourite TV shows is the famed comedy programme Location, Location, Location, which features Londoners with more money than sense cooing over properties the size of our toilets (which are all indoors these days, by\u0026nbspthe way) and which cost four or five times more than our actual houses.I am being facetious, of course. But it does feel that there is a thing we can call northernness, which might comprise warmth, and friendliness, and humour and grit, but which is much more than the sum of those cliched parts, and much harder to properly define.Oli Bentley is the creative director of a design studio based in Leeds, called Split. He has taken it upon himself to gather, like wool, various notions of northernness from writers and creatives for a project that was initially part of Leeds’ bid to become the European Capital of Culture in 2023.A bid which, of course, was thoroughly torpedoed by Brexit, and the news earlier this year that British cities will not be welcome to apply for the accolade after we leave the EU next year.Undaunted, those driving the Leeds bid decided to build on the legacy of the hard work carried out in the city by holding a year-long celebration of culture in 2023. One of the first projects out of the trap is the book Bentley has curated, called These Northern Types.Bentley is entrenched in the north. He studied design at Cumbria Institute of the Arts, up there in Carlisle, and while studying at Leeds College of Music after that he set up his Split business from his bedsit. So what is northernness?“Northernness is a myth,” asserts Bentley. “As a designer, I spend much of my time working with identities – specifically, visual identities for companies, institutions, iniduals, bands and arts organisations: brands. I think it is this daily involvement with the perceptions of identities that made me fascinated by this multifaceted, community-owned, slippery thing we call ‘northern identity’. That, and the realisation that, as a lifelong proud northerner, I was beginning to feel unsure about what that actually meant.”So Bentley went on a journey to rediscover, or perhaps discover for the first time, what northernness really is, if it actually exists, and he went to writers and artists and musicians for their take on it.That great northern actor\u0026nbspWarren Clarke\u0026nbsponce played the role of a corrupt copper in Red Riding, the TV adaptation of writer David Peace’s The Red Riding Quartet. The books are an astonishing slice of Yorkshire noir, interconnected narratives which weave in and out of the Yorkshire Ripper murders and the subsequent hunt for their perpetrator, Peter Sutcliffe.Clarke played chief superintendent Bill Molloy, a gruff, no-nonsense copper who you wouldn’t exactly say exuded warmth and friendliness, but instead another aspect of northernness: determination, and the recognition that London is a long way away. Presiding over a group of colleagues in a clandestine meeting, Molloy proposes a toast: “To the north, where we do what we want.”Molloy and his compatriots meant it for nefarious purposes, but it’s a mantra that endures for less sinister reasons. Here in the north we can’t rely on anyone else when we do, they rip the rug from under us. We commit with all our hearts and souls and lives to digging coal or tempering steel, and then someone in London closes the pits and the foundries and there’s nothing else for us to do. It is an irony that the north voted, on the whole, for Brexit a lot of European money was pumped, over the years, into communities ravaged by the death of industrialisation. But the majority Leave vote was born from that suspicion of outside forces exerting too much influence on a region that has been bitten and burned many times.The Capital of Culture being torpedoed and rising as a legacy project is an example of that determination, as is Bentley’s curating of the book These Northern Types. It is, as you’d expect from someone who trained in design, an artefact as much as a text it comprises 17 inidually-bound books, collected together, and created by some of the most interesting thinkers in the north today.In his introduction to the book, Bentley writes: “The focus of this project is, at times, less about location, and more about class – an issue that touches nearly every chapter. Or they are about what it is to be ‘other’ to ‘the position of civility... always taken by the seat of power’.“About living in the other half of the country from the centres of power, finance, media, intellectualism and culture – a situation shared not only with communities from Wales to Dorset to Scotland, but with communities all over the globe.”These Northern Types offers a taste of the north that is unparalleled since someone in Wigan decided to put a meat and potato pie between a barm cake. It is beautiful to look at yet uncompromising and direct. In the essay “Does It Still Matter Where We Come From?”, Dr Katy Wright addresses whether there is, in fact, any need to align yourself to northernness or anything else.She writes: “For many – though by no means all – northernness has involved a sense of marginalisation, abandonment and peripherality, which has often been accompanied by experiences of misrecognition, and stereotypes projected from outside. These have involved portraying northerners as, variously, uneducated, opinionated, mean with money, unsophisticated or conservative. Struggling northern towns and cities like Hull, Scunthorpe, Barnsley and Morecambe provide the punchlines to unfunny jokes about ‘crap towns’ and shitholes.”It is, after all, grim up north. At first it was grim because of the industry that roosted here like dark ravens, the sooty chimneys of Dickens’ Coketown (a thinly disguised Preston), the blackened faces of the miners, the clang-and-heat of the Hephaestan steel forges, the hypnotic rattle of the cotton looms. And then it was grim because the industry was torn down. Grim because of the grit and we have grit because of the grimness.Boff Whalley was the guitarist in agit-popsters Chumbawamba now he is a playwright and the founder of the Commoners Choir. His piece is about northern grit, and how the elements haven’t just formed our dramatic landscape, but do the same to us.“So much of northern culture – historical, social and political – has sprung from our weather,” he writes. “The Smiths were The Smiths and not the Beach Boys because they were born into a land of dripping raincoats and stone doorways that you huddle into. Ted Hughes thrived on the bleak grey swirl of Yorkshire uplands. Our favourite fiction, from the Brontes to Alan Sillitoe to Ken Loach, is peppered with the drama of rain. Many of Turner’s paintings are suffused with storms, mists and fogs (he climbed the hill above what’s now my home town at the foot of the Yorkshire Dales to make endless studies for his great painterly skies) English films – from Billy Elliot to The Full Monty – are drenched in the melancholy of rain. And what comes of all this dour, dull weather? Resilience. Resolve. Gritting your teeth. Grit.”Grim… grit… here’s another one for you. Graft. That means hard work. It’s also the name of the typeface Oli Bentley put together for the book and for anyone else who wants to use it. A typeface for the north. Bentley himself questioned the point of the exercise, other than being a nice little artistic project. Then he had another idea: “Let’s use the typeface to work with local community groups across the north. We bring the letters, they bring the words. Then we put these words up in the places they’re from. This led to the idea of printing giant outdoor posters – the sort you can easily and cheaply flypost. To work with local writers to amplify voices – not just listen, but help them be heard.”Because being heard is something the north struggles with. When we complain that we’re being left behind, we get thrown bones such as the Northern Powerhouse project, an admittedly ambitious plan to boost the economy of the north, put into place by the Conservative-Liberal coalition, much lauded and trumpeted, and then quietly… well, if not abandoned, then at least put on the shelf with the other exciting new initiatives that were going to transform the north, until such time as anyone south of wherever the north’s border is these days cares enough to put money into it. And meanwhile transport – one of the major tenets of the Northern Powerhouse – continues to struggle, with train services especially a bone of particular contention. They don’t call Northern Rail “Northern Fail” for nothing these days.Boff Whalley mentioned The Smiths and, indeed, music is part of the fabric of the north. Benjamin Myers is an author who this year won the Walter Scott Prize for his novel The Gallows Pole. It brought him £25,000, but his win was largely ignored by the London-centric publishing press. For the book, Myers writes about music, as well, and in doing so explodes a myth about living in the north that is prevalent. His piece is a paean to watching bands, and then forming one, a familiar rite of passage: “You gig round the north, the four of you, with your bad hair and bumfluff ’taches. You play es and established venues you play political benefits and school halls and nightclubs and student unions.Emmerdale\u0026nbsprolling hills, you know (Getty)“Being in a band forces you to be an adult at 15 as you deal with clueless promoters and jealous death metal bands, American rock stars and patronising regional DJs. You ward off stage-invading Nazi skinheads and cynical producers. You duck flying bottles and you get thrown out of your own shows for being underage.“You come from that part of the north that rarely gets written about – neither the gritty towns and cities of economic decline nor the dales and vales and uplands, but somewhere in between: the lower-middle-class suburbs. Here is a seemingly endless maze of culs-de-sac and alleyways, tarmac and green spaces, where aspiration exists, and creative seeds are sown, yet which broader culture barely seems to acknowledge, as if the north is either terraced houses or Dales farmlands, Corrie or Emmerdale. It’s not that black and white though most live in a grey-area Britain.”Are we seeing the resurgence of Nazism? This graphic novel thinks soSpoiler alert: Have fractured viewing habits ruined the suspense?Dacre Stoker on resurrecting his great-grand-uncle’s vampireThrough the works in These Northern Types, only a fraction of which are referenced here, several things seem to emerge. There is something called northernness, but it’s difficult to pin down. We’re just like everybody else, but completely different. We don’t even know where the north begins, nor can we agree on what it really means to be northern.It’s almost as if the ideas of northernness are laid down by other people, and none of them are what we really feel. But we can’t voice how we truly are inside, because to examine it too closely would make it seem less distinct, less real.The north is a place made up of iniduals, bound by an ethereal quality that is at once a myth and, conversely, as real as grit and graft. Northernness is perhaps something everyone here has, and is, but in subtly and uniquely different ways. The north makes us, and northernness is what we make it. So raise your glasses please, to the north: where we do – and can be – what we want.‘These Northern Types’ is out now, priced £32, from splitNorth of EnglandCapital of CultureShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Normally these kinds of structures are known at lower redshifts, which means when the Universe has had much more time to evolve and construct such huge things. It was a surprise to see something this evolved when the Universe was relatively young!The structure, which is known by scientists as Hyperion, was spotted by a team of scientists who used the European Southern Observatory\u0027s Very Large Telescope to peer into the early universe and look for galaxies forming. It was then they spotted Hyperion, a colossal mass that is more than a million billion times that of the Sun.Vast cosmic explosions could be flinging gold across the universeIt is not only huge but very complex. Hyperion is made up of at least seven high-density regions, which are strung together by threads of galaxies. That structure is different to the kind of superclusters we usually see closer to us, even though the size is similar.Superclusters closer to Earth tend to a much more concentrated distribution of mass with clear structural features, explains Brian Lemaux, an astronomer from University of California, Davis and LAM, and a member of the team behind this result. But in Hyperion, the mass is distributed much more uniformly in a series of connected blobs, populated by loose associations of galaxies.The difference is probably a consequence of the fact that the closer by superclusters have had billions of years of being pushed into denser regions by galaxies. Hyperion, which is much younger, has been subject to that process much less.Eventually, Hyperion will probably evolve into something similar to those structures: the kind that make up the Sloan Great Wall, or the Virgo Supercluster in which our own galaxy sits. Understanding how that process happens could allow us to peer into the past of our own galaxy and understand how it might have formed.Understanding Hyperion and how it compares to similar recent structures can give insights into how the Universe developed in the past and will evolve into the future, and allows us the opportunity to challenge some models of supercluster formation, said\u0026nbspCucciati. Unearthing this cosmic titan helps uncover the history of these large-scale structures.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Smaller craft have previously employed ion thrusters to reach asteroids and the moon.The ion drive will be used not to accelerate the spacecraft but to act as a brake as it falls into the grip of the sun\u0027s powerful gravity.A complex series of fly-bys past the Earth, Venus and Mercury will further reduce its velocity.Even so, BepiColumbo will reach a top speed of 60 kilometres (37 miles) per second.The European Space Agency\u0027s Mercury Planet Orbiter (MPO), which will survey the planet\u0027s surface and probe its chemistry, was built by satellite company Airbus Defence and Space in Stevenage.Airbus also constructed the power unit carrying the orbiters, the Mercury Transfer Module (MTM), in the UK. The ion thrusters were supplied by British defence technology company QinetiQ.One of the European orbiter\u0027s 11 instruments, the Mercury Imaging X-ray Spectrometer (Mixs) was designed and built at the University of Leicester.The Japanese space agency Jaxa\u0027s Mercury Magnetosphere Orbiter (MMO) will study the planet\u0027s internal structure and enveloping magnetic field.A major challenge for mission planners was ensuring the spacecraft could withstand searing temperatures of more than 350C so close to the sun.Protective measures include a heat shield, novel ceramic and titanium insulation, ammonia-filled heat pipes, and in the case of the Japanese orbiter, spinning.Dr Graham Turnock, chief executive of the UK Space Agency, said: UK scientists, engineers and technicians have played a vital role in developing BepiColombo and the incredibly sophisticated set of scientific instruments on board.The international collaboration involved in this mission shows how our leading role in the European Space Agency is ensuring the UK thrives in the new space age, bringing real benefits to UK companies and scientists.Only two spacecraft have previously visited Mercury. Nasa\u0027s Mariner 10 flew past the planet three times in 1974-75 and the American space agency\u0027s Messenger probe orbited Mercury from 2011 to 2015, taking photos of the surface.Dr Jerry Bolter, project manager at Airbus Defence and Space in Stevenage, said: The scientists describe Messenger as the hors d\u0027oeuvre and Bepi asThe spacecraft was named after the late Guiseppe Bepi Colombo, an Italian scientist and engineer who played a leading role in the 1974 Mariner 10 mission to Mercury.Paolo Ferri, head of missions at the European Space Operations Centre (ESOC) in Darmstadt, Germany, said: Mercury is a planet of extremes, and getting there requires some equally extreme techniques, navigation solutions and operations expertise.Additional reporting by Press AssociationShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

If people find that what they are about to get is what they want then I\u0026nbspas a democrat would accept it.But what worries me is I think we are about to deliver a Brexit that I think, in fact, very few people want.Ms May faced a major Tory backlash after she\u0026nbspsignalled that she would consider extending the transition to allow more time for UK and EU negotiators to hammer out problems around the future relationship, including the vexed issue of\u0026nbspthe Irish border.Mr Grieve, who leads a band of pro-EU Tory rebels, said\u0026nbspit was likely that the transition period would be “extended well beyond three years as we try to thrash out the continuing relationship”.He added: That highlights for me why in fact we are embarked on the project which is totally different from what people might have had any reason to expect in 2016.We are in the most extraordinary situation where we remain tied to all of the rules of the EU without any ability to influence the input.”Mr Grieve also condemned Ms May for appearing to go back on her pledge to offer MPs a meaningful vote on any Brexit deal, saying their plans were\u0026nbsp“utterly flawed”.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Anti-Brexit campaigners lowering a banner off Westminster Bridge in London before taking part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendumMembers of a grooming gang who abused vulnerable girls in Huddersfield have been jailed for a total of more than 220 years.Theresa May leaves after a news conference at the European Union leaders summit in BrusselsPolice officers with a bomb disposal robot on Victoria Embankment opposite Scotland Yard police headquarters in central London after emergency services were alerted to reports of a suspicious packageScottish Power will become the first major UK energy company to generate the entirety of its power from wind after selling its remaining gas and hydro stations to Drax in a £702 million dealPrime Minister Theresa May peers into a hot water urn during a meeting at a social group in Vauxhall from a charity working to combat loneliness at the launch of the first loneliness strategy.

Organizer Yanny Bruere raised more than 58,000 pounds ($75,000) through the Crowdfunder website for the 29-foot (8.8-meter) blimp as part of a campaign to oust Khan from his post. Khan angered some people in the British capital and elsewhere last month when he allowed a balloon caricaturing Donald Trump as an angry baby to float above the city while the U.S. president was in England.Conservative MP Damian Collins, the chair of the Committee said: “Here we have an example of a clearly sophisticated organisation spending lots of money on a political campaign, and we have absolutely no idea who is behind it. The only people who know who is paying for these adverts is Facebook.“While debate on one of the central issues facing our country is part of a thriving democracy, there is an important question of where campaigning stops and political advertising starts. Facebook has recently announced a set of changes to increase transparency around political advertising on its platform.He added: “This example offers Facebook an opportunity to show it is committed to making that change happen - if you are targeted with a message or asked to do lobby your MP, you should know exactly who is behind the organisation asking you to do it.”Many of the Facebook adverts lead users to send a template email to their MP that calls on them to “respect the referendum result and bin the Chequers deal before it’s too late”.The email claims the plan “would result in us having no real control over our borders, unable to make our own trade arrangements and still subject to European laws”.Among the 700 pages on the Mainstream Network website are those specifically targeted at voters in a range of key constituencies, containing tailored local messaging.Evidence submitted to the committee suggested the site was “a potentially highly sophisticated pro-Brexit campaign” backed by “a substantial amount of money”.89up suggested the website was likely in breach of laws on non-party political campaigning.Labour MP and DCMS committee member Jo Stevens, who backs the anti-Brexit Best for Britain campaign, said: “Facebook can now add facilitating alleged breaches of the new data protection rules to its long list of corporate scandals.“Getting Facebook to come clean about their role in influencing elections and referendums has been like trying to get blood out of a stone. It’s time for Mark Zuckerberg to take responsibility and come to Parliament to answer our questions.”Facebook pages for Women\u0027s March are elaborate scam to sell t-shirtsFacebook builds \u0027war room\u0027 to try and stop election interferencFacebook cracks down on \u0027dark ads\u0027 to prevent political propagandaFacebook says 30 million user accounts were stolen in huge hackThe new questions over advertising on Facebook come after the tech giant was accused of fraud by a group of advertisers in the US, who claimed it had intentionally inflated viewing figures for adverts.

It was a joint enterprise between forceful campaigning and the internal rot inherent in the arguments for Leave.The seeds of the fightback were laid as early as August 2016, when the Open Britain campaign group was set up pledging to highlight the problems with Brexit, work out why the Leave campaign had won such support and shape the critical parliamentary debate to come.MPs who have publicly backed a second referendum on EU membershipIt determinedly chipped away at the dogma underpinning Brexit, but it was not until Open Britain teamed up with a string of other groups to launch the People’s Vote campaign in April this year, that it became clear there was now a formidable campaign network mobilising.That was then turbocharged\u0026nbspin July when\u0026nbspThe Independent launched its Final Say campaign, with hundreds of thousands flocking to its petition in days, proving that those wanting a rethink on Brexit had not only found a voice, but were prepared to stand up for the cause en masse – something any elected politician ignores at their peril.Since then unions, celebrities and political figures have increasingly come out in support of a new referendum. The number of MPs publicly backing the idea\u0026nbspexceeds 100, with others doing so privately and even more conceding it may be inevitable regardless of their own personal support.Labour as a party has been pushed to build the possibility of a new referendum into its overall policy plan, meaning the prospect of it now happening is impossible to ignore.Meanwhile, the weaknesses of those pushing Brexit forward have been continually exposed, sometime brutally\u0026nbspfirst by a general election, then by negotiations in Brussels and unceasingly by ision at almost every level of the Conservative Party.The prime minister may yet win a deal in Brussels, but she then faces the prospect of it falling to shreds as she drags it across the splintered backbenches in a bid to gain distant-looking parliamentary approval.It is not often that an MP comes out and calls his own party a “shit show”, but the contortions of Ms May’s Brexit policy led an angry Johnny Mercer to do just that this week.On Saturday thousands of people will also make their anger public as they take to the streets of London to demand another referendum,\u0026nbspsomething they believe to be a rare sensible option in the nonsensical era of Brexit politics.If it comes to pass, they will be able to say they were there on the day that secured Britain its Final Say.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

She also held bilateral meetings with the leaders of\u0026nbspSingapore\u0026nbspand Korea.The EU and Singapore are set to sign a trade deal that will reduce barriers between the two countries.

And the truth is, whether you are from a Remain or Leave area, the problems are the same.\u0026nbspWhether you are from Liverpool, Lincoln, Llanduno, Livingston in Scotland or Lambeth, where I am, Brexit is not going to make those problems better, it is going to make them worse.The deal on the table is nowhere near as good as the deal we\u0027ve got now.Green Party MP Caroline Lucas described the huge crowd was a beautiful sight.She told those gathered:What a movement we have become.The Green Party is proud to be part of this amazing movement for a People\u0027s Vote, because we know that democracy didn\u0027t end on the 23rd June 2016.That referendum wasn\u0027t the end of the story it was the start of something new.\u0026nbspShe said Brexit would make our poorest communities even poorer and more powerless.We must have that People\u0027s Vote, but we must also re-programme an economy that fails so many, that is based on such inequality, that condemns us to climate breakdown.You can watch The Independent editor\u0026nbspChristian Broughton\u0027s speech here:The Independent\u0027s editor Christian Broughton has addressed the crowd gathered in Parliament Square. He said:\u0026nbspTheresa May says that the Final Say referendum will be a politicians\u0027 vote, not a people\u0027s vote, but we can all remember what some politicians\u0026nbsptold us in 2016.\u0026nbspWe, the people, can all now see what\u0027s really coming. And\u0026nbspfrom where I\u0027m standing it looks like a People\u0027s Vote to me.When we started the Final Say campaign in July, our politics team\u0026nbsphoped we might get as many as 20,000\u0026nbspsignatures on our change.org petition.\u0026nbspWell, this morning I checked: we had\u0026nbsp940,000 signatures. And I\u0027m pretty sure that by the end of today there\u0027ll be a few more.\u0026nbspWe have to keep on showing up and signing up.\u0026nbspOnly The Independent\u0026nbspcould start this campaign because it\u0027s not tied to any political party.\u0026nbspWe trust our readers,\u0026nbspwe\u0026nbsptrust our reporters and we tell it honestly as it is.Mr Broughton then introduced politicians from across the political spectrum, including\u0026nbspCaroline Lucas, Chuka\u0026nbspUmunna, and Vince Cable.Actor Andy Serkis is marching alongside thousands in central London, with his 14-year-old son Louis and wife Lorraine Ashbourne.The Lord Of The Rings actor said he is supporting the protest as he believes there should be a second referendum “now that people are more informed”.\u0026nbspThe 54-year-old said: “The will of the people doesn\u0027t have to stand still, it\u0027s not an immovable thing that is fixed.\u0026nbsp“The will of the people is now, it\u0027s people expressing their points of view in a more informed state.”\u0026nbspMr Serkis also expressed concern for the film industry if the UK were to leave the EU.\u0026nbspHe said: “There\u0027s free movement between the European countries and we\u0027ve attracted a lot of industry here as a result and that could be seriously damaged, which is the same for a lot of industries.”\u0026nbspPABrexit must not be allowed to undermine workers\u0027 rights, says Jeremy Corbyn\u0026nbspAs crowds rallied in London\u0026nbspto demand a vote on the EU referendum, Jeremy Corbyn told United Nations chiefs in Geneva Brexit must not be allowed to undermine workers\u0027 rights.The Labour leader said he would work with other countries to resist attempts to reduce protections for UK staff.Mr Corbyn was in the Swiss city to meet Michelle Bachelet, UN high commissioner for human rights, and Guy Ryder, director-general of the International Labour Organisation.He said: Britain is leaving the EU, but we must and will work together with those in other countries to resist the pressure to undermine rights and protections at work.Tax dodging, speculation and unaccountable corporate power have created economic inequality on a vast scale and sucked wealth and jobs out of community after community.Average pay in Britain is now lower than a decade ago and workers have faced a concerted attack on their rights under this Tory Government.We are determined to secure stronger rights at work and fair rules for business as we leave the EU as part of a new economic settlement which delivers for the many, not the few.PASadiq Kahn addresses\u0026nbspthe crowd\u0026nbspin Parliament Square\u0026nbspLondon mayor Sadiq Khan has said there should be another referendum because young people\u0027s future is on the line.\u0026nbspWhat a day, what a turnout, he told the crowd gathered in Parliament Square,\u0026nbspdescribing the event as an historic moment.\u0026nbspIt was absolutely right that it was young people\u0026nbspleading this march because it\u0027s their future that\u0027s on the line, he said.\u0026nbspYoung people\u0027s voices wasn\u0027t heard during the EU referendum campaign, but their voices are being heard loud and clear today.\u0026nbspThe government doesn\u0027t have a mandate to gamble with our future. Are we going to stand by and let them?\u0026nbspHe was met with shouts of,\u0026nbspNo.\u0026nbspTelevision personality and chef Delia Smith told the crowd: I\u0027m so afraid of what\u0027s happening to our beloved country and the people making grave decisions on our behalf.\u0026nbspWhen the vote happened, we were not fully informed. Now we know: dire consequences. That can be summed up in two words: Unmitigated chaos.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe counter protest in Harrogate is underway where the audience is hearing\u0026nbspfrom speakers including former Ukip leader Nigel Farage,\u0026nbspleader of Bro-Brexit campaign group Leave Means Leave, Richard Tice, and Labour MP Kate Hooey.\u0026nbspMs Hooey said “Our country should always come above our party.\u0026nbsp“We shouldn\u0027t really be here. We had a clear vote to leave, we know that people knew what they were voting for, even though we are being told people were stupid and racist.“It is not a question about leave or remain, it is a question of being democratic, or anti-democratic.“I get very angry when I see the London elite making their views as if they know what is going on in the rest of the country. They should get out of London more.”Please allow a moment for the live blog to loadThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But the Bible saysI be a fool, I be a fool for Christ,” Chris said.Weve had people healed just in the past few months, even a little baby of about nine months old, who had a fever and couldnt stop vomiting.Ive been healed twice. When I broke my ribs in a car wreck, I remember walking into church in so much pain and I could hardly breathe and somebody put their hands on my ribs and I walked out a dferent person.“When I was on drugs I wasnt even living. All that dope, all that alcohol, all those parties and things that I would go and think ‘boy Im having fun.“It wasnt even until God come into my le that I actually knew what it was like to live.“Out of all the dope Ive ever done I tell people theres no greater feeling than the power of God moving, on you and through you.“When God moves on you to take up those serpents, words can’t describe that feeling. It aint me. Its the power of God.”Services at the House of the Lord Jesus are similar to those practiced by other Pentecostal faiths - except that followers here use snakes, fire and poison in their worship.They are held every Sunday and can last between  minutes to four hours long depending on how many people feel “overcome with the spirit”, want to testy about their experiences or be healed.The snakes are always brought to the service in their wooden boxes but arent always brought out.Chris had explained earlier how he wouldn’t take out the snakes unless he felt the “holy spirit was with him” a sensation he says “is better felt than described”.Throughout it all, the snake never bites anyone around it or attempts to, and almost looks leless, until Chris puts it down on the pulpit and it coils into a ball.During the fascinating spectacle, the frenzied churchgoers clap, dance, scream and shout some even appear to speak in tongues.Afterwards Chris, who suffers from liver problems and is unable to work, is exhausted, sweating and breathless.He tells me afterwards he had to rush to the bathroom to vomit mid-service: “Sometimes the spirit comes on so strong it makes you sick,” he says.Three people come forward to be healed or to ask for prayers for loved ones. The congregations gathers around them and lay their hands on them.“Outside of believing in the five signs of the Gospel I dont think we’re much dferent from any other church.“When God moves in that way we participate in taking up the serpents and whatever  he may ask it to be, fire, poison, pray for the sick, speak in tongues, cast out devils.“We don’t worship the snake, we worship the Lord Jesus Christ, but in the Bible Luke tells us that he gives us power to tread on the scorpions and serpents and nothing shall hurt us by no means.James Bowman, , a mechanic from West Virginia, said he came to the church for the first time two months ago after seeing a video of a service online and believes “finding Jesus” has finally cured him from his lelong alcoholism.“It was the serpents that attracted me here,” he said.“I was a full blown alcoholic but as soon as I saw him lt those snakes that was it for me and I haven’t touched a drop of alcohol since and I don’t plan to. I’ve got my le back.”James now brings his we Crystal, , to the church - along with their three grandchildren, Elaila, , Justin, , and Aubrey, , who sit in the front row mesmerised and unafraid during the snake-handling service.Pastor Chris was just  years old when he saw his dad receive a fatal bite from a rattlesnake as he was preaching.Mack Ray Wolford died a slow and painful death as the snake’s poison coursed round his body stopping his blood from clotting, causing him to haemorrhage to death - taking his last breathe around nine hours later.Almost  years later, Chris watched as his beloved brother Mack “Randy” Wolford die in the same way – bitten by a deadly rattlesnake while he was preaching during an outdoor service.Chris tearfully recalls trying to give his brother - who he described as his “best friend” - CPR and how blood gushed out of his lungs with every compression.“I hated to lose my dad. I loved my dad. And I loved my brother more than anything. He was my pastor, my brother, my best friend. “I mean there wasnt a day that went by that I didnt call him or he didnt call me - we were very, very close. Not a day goes by I don’t think about him but he found something that was worth dying for, something that he loved more than he loved his self. “The day he got bit - and it was the same with my father - when we asked ‘do you want to go to the hospital ’ They could - we dont force nobody not to go. But they chose not to go. They were willing to give their lives for what they believe. “I tell people this,it aint worth dying for, it aint worth having and it aint worth believing in.“With my father and my brother, they kept the faith. They fought a good fight, they kept the faith, they finished the race, the course and theyre at peace or with the Lord now.“And I dont even thinkthey could come back, theyd want to come back. I believe that they’re just happy where they are.“The night he died - my brother - I remember sitting at his feet and I told him, I promised, that wed see each other again, that its not going to be the last time we saw each other and Im going to do my best to keep that promise. So one day we can meet on the other side.”And Chris, who has been bitten several times, the last time just two months ago, says that while he doesn’t want to die from a serpent bite, he would be willing to die for his beliefshe had to.“Its not for us to question why these things happen - it’s to believe,” he said.“I watched my father die that way, I watched my brother die that way and its a hard way to die, but I hopeits ever asked from me from the Lord, Im willing to do it.“I’d rather go that way than with a needle in my arm.” Chris’s we Judy comes in part-way through the service and stands at the back.She also lost a family member - her brother - who got bitten while serpent handling and she is terried of losing her husband the same way.“Of course every Sunday I worry it might be the last time I see him. I worry about him getting bit.“I’d rather he could worship God another way - without drinking that poison or holding those snakes. “But it’s his choice and there ain’t nothing I can do to change that.”Chris keeps around half a dozen fully grown snakes in the basement underneath his church - including venomous timber rattlesnakes and copperhead snakes.He also has around four babies after he was given a pregnant snake. Usually the snakes are caught from the surrounding countryside, and kept with heat lamps in glass cages and fed mice.A picture of Jesus watches over the snake den. Chris rejects any claims he mistreats the snakes - and has past inspections from local authorities.“We take good care of these snakes. Some of them I reared since they were babies.“If any of them refuse to eat we put them back out in the wild - some of them just won’t eat in captivity and we don’t want them to die so we turn them back out.”Bizarrely Chris seems terried of the snakes when he uses his snake hook to display them for the camera.The jittery snakes rattle and hiss at every opportunity - the very opposite of how the rattlesnake in the service limply allowed itself to be swing around. “You can see how scared I am of them when God is not with me,” he says.“But when the Spirit is with you all fear just goes.“Anything is possible with the Lord.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Are these niggling doubts our subconscious trying to tell us something One respondent even went back home to check they had turned the hob off to find a fire engine outside and a house full of smoke confirming that they had left it on.A quarter of those polled, via OnePoll, have ed home from work to find they have left a window open while almost one in five have gone back to their car only to find they had left it unlocked.More than one in twenty have also opened their front door to find the iron or their hair straighteners still switched on.But while most niggling worries have usually proved to be unfounded,  per cent are glad to have gone back to check their home.Four in  even went as far as to say they would feel anxious all daythey weren’t able to go back and check something while another  per cent would feel on edge.A spokesman for Independent Network, added: “As a company we are very tuned into how homeowners live their home lives and how busy they are, but even we were surprised by some of the results!

It was those paid-for photos that led to him having “health problems” and failing to walk his daughter down the aisle.After appearing on every TV and radio outlet that would pay for her bile-fuelled rants, Samantha recently tried to gain entrance to Buckingham Palace to meet Meghan.She was, quite rightly, told by grim-faced security staff to bog off.None of Samantha’s vitriol has stuck and most of the world has fallen almost as head-over-heels in love with Meghan as her besotted husband — especially since the news broke that they are expecting.Given that no one is interested in Samantha’s hysterical attacks on her sister, she wants to bury the hatchet.She has apologised for any past tensions and exclaimed that she’s jumping with joy at the baby news.It’s too little too late, and I’m sure Meghan would agree.Samantha has crossed the line too many times to be forgiven now.If she had shown any loyalty she might have been invited to the ­wedding and welcomed into the royal fold. But instead of acting as a peace-maker, Samantha stirred bad feeling between Meghan and her estranged father.A loving sister would have tried to build bridges, unite family ­factions and show solidarity with Meghan.I’m sure the new Duchess of Sussex would have ­welcomed having family members around her as she adjusted to le in the royal goldfish bowl.In the end, Meghan had only ONE close relative at her wedding, her mum Doria.Along with the absence of the late Princess Diana, it was the day’s only sad note.Samantha could have had a starring role as a loyal sister helping Meghan adjust from successful actress to worldwide megastar.The media would have fallen over themselves to talk to her for insights into her famous sister, but not any more. We are all very tired of Samantha’s negativity and venom.No one has any time for her any more, and for such an attention-seeker that has got to hurt.If she had been kind to Meghan, Samantha would still be relevant. TV stations, magazines and newspapers would be asking her about the mum-to-be and she would be at the heart of all the pregnancy coverage.Instead of being a loyal, loving and supportive source of information about Meghan, Samantha is now ­dismissed as jealous, irrelevant and malicious. No one cares about her opinion any more.Meanwhile, Meghan has won over Australia with a charm offensive that shows no sign of flagging. She and Harry are a true partnership.Unlike the tension between his parents Princess Diana and Prince Charles, Harry is genuinely delighted to see the enthusiasm and love for his we during this tour.Charles would famously get the hump because everyone wanted to meet Diana on royal walkabouts.In contrast, Harry and Meghan are relaxed, spontaneous and genuinely adore each other. It has been good to see them having fun and giving hugs and smiles to the crowds.While Meghan grows in confidence and the public’s affection, Samantha is now an irrelevance.It’s her own fault and she has to live with it. She will always have her nose pressed against the window pane of whatever palace her little sister is in at the time.Still, Sam, there’s always panto, eh ONE of the great joys of my le was watching Disney movies with my daughter when she was growing up.We watched my childhood favourites Dumbo, Bambi and Snow White, then I sat through Beauty And The Beast and The Little Mermaid about two thousand and ten times.So I was bemused to hear that Keira Knightley has banned her three-year-old daughter from ­watching some Disney movies such as Cinderella because the characters are “rescued” by men.This is rather joyless.Cinders might have been wooed by a man dumb enough not to recognise the love of his le until her foot fitted inside a glass slipper, but Belle from Beauty And The Beast is a book-loving, independent girl who tells the handsome but horrible Gaston to sling his hook and falls for the Beast because of the man he is inside. Pocahontas, Tiana, Merida, Rapunzel and especially Mulan are all kick-ass, feisty females.Disney remade Cinderella in  and she was a very dferent character.Keira doesn’t have to let her daughter watch Cinderella when there are so many alternatives available, but she also doesn’t need to be so blinking sanctimonious about it.So Joanna in The Cry is actually in court accused of murdering her sleazebag of a husband after they faked the kidnapping of their dead baby.It’s the last episode tomorrow, when we will find out what the heck has been going on.ButJoanna, played by Jenna Coleman, left, really did kill husband Alistair, I reckon it’s justiable homicide.The ghastly toad sat with his eyemask on and earplugs in, leaving her to deal with a screeching baby all through that epic flight to Australia.Surely on those grounds alone no court would convict her.I ADORED Freddie Mercury and would have gladly given a year of my le to be a fly on the wall at one of his notoriously extravagant and outrageous parties.He was a complete one-off, so I was always rather sceptical and a bit concerned about any film that would try to depict his extraordinary le and capture his sheer showmanship.Thankfully, the makers of new film Bohemian Rhapsody found the ridiculously talented American actor Rami Malek.He doesn’t so much play the part of Freddie but rather inhabits his body and brings him back to le.It’s an Oscar-worthy performance that is both funny and deeply moving and Rami is backed up by the perfectly cast three other members of Queen.Gwilym Lee as Brian May is so uncannily like the ace guitarist that his we Anita Dobson thought she had actually gone back in time, as he’s the spitting image of Brian when the two of them met.The Live Aid sequence, recreating the moment when Freddie and the band blew everyone away with their barnstorming performance, gave me goosebumps.I blubbed a lot during this movie, as well as laughing out loud.It also had me rushing to download all the original Queen albums and rediscovering tracks like Keep Yourself Alive and Doing All Right, as well as the classics such as Killer Queen and We Are The Champions.It’s a cracking film and a love letter to one of the greatest entertainers and most charismatic rock stars of all time. WELL, what a shock and surprise that Girls Aloud’s Nadine Coyle and Cheryl were never best pals. . . said no one ever.It was clear that these two, below in , never really hit it off right from the start when the girls won TV talent show Popstars: The Rivals in  against boyband One True Voice.Back then Nadine was very much the star and lead vocalist, which led to tensions in the group.The girls split into two factions – Nadine and Sarah Harding on one side and Cheryl, Nicola Roberts and ­Kimberley Walsh on the other.Tellingly, Nadine said the girls have never had a big fall-out because they were never really friends in the first place.This is what tends to happen when boy and girl bands are thrown together in a reality show and don’t have a shared history. Cracks appear and there are resentments over who is ­perceived as being ­centre stage.A notable exception are the hugely ­likeable Little Mix, who put all their energies into their music and also to ensuring they give out positive messages about self-esteem and body confidence to their legions of fans.These girls have become genuinely good friends who have each other’s backs and who know that they are stronger together than they would bethey had to stand alone.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In other words, will it give the UK a genuine opportunity to leave.Just putting the word temporary in front of the phrase ­”customs union” — a solution favoured by some at the heart of Government — won’t be enough for these Secretaries of State.One tells me that it has “got to be legally binding and enforceable. Something that is vague and not enforceable won’t get through Parliament”. All of this makes the newest face at the Cabinet table, the Attorney General Geoffrey Cox, absolutely crucial.Cox is a Brexiteer and one of the finest dozen legal brains in the country. Ministers will defer to him on whether this escape clause is worth the paper it’s written on.As one of those helping to ­coordinate the Brexiteers in government tells me, Cox values his reputation too much to try to spin ministers a line. They are confident he will give them an honest assessment of the escape clause’s worth.“Anything will have to go through the AG,” I’m told by one Government source.Cox’s influence will run throughout this process. I understand that the bulk of the Pizza Club of Cabinet ministers who met on Monday night have agreed not to back the final Brexit deal until they have seen the legal advice.I am told that Michael Gove made clear at Cabinet this week that he couldn’t back any Northern Irish backstop until he had been shown “clear, ­written legal advice” on it.This insistence on seeing the legal advice is meant to prevent a repeat of what happened last December when No gave Brexiteer Cabinet ­ministers assurances about what the backstop meant which were not borne out by events.So, the question becomes: Will the EU be prepared to engage with the UK or will Michel Barnier simply say “non, non” Well, there is a cautious ­optimism in No that the political will to do a deal is beginning to be there on the European side. There is a realisation thatthe EU rejects everything May proposes, there will be no agreement reached — and that will mean a hard border in Ireland, which is what everyone is trying to avoid.Interestingly, there is also a sense thatagreement can be reached on the backstop, then the deal has a better chance of passing through Parliament thanOne of those who has read the draft political declaration tells me that the UK EU future relationship is more to the taste of Tory Brexiteers than expected.May must find a way to get the EU to accept an escape clause, for without that she’ll lose more Cabinet Ministers and her position will be even more vulnerable.GAVIN BARWELL, the Prime Minister’s chief of staff, had the Government’s junior ministers in on Tuesday. He wanted to talk them through Theresa May’s domestic agenda as outlined in her conference speech.He wanted to emphasise that the Government would prioritise its domestic agenda as soon as the meaningful vote on Brexit was through the Commons.Barwell’s comments fit with an expectation in Cabinet that Mrs May will attempt to relaunch her premiership with a domestic focus as soon as the Commons has voted on her Brexit deal.The aim is to create a rationale for keeping May on as Prime Minister after Brexit day. Influential Cabinet ministers are also expecting Mrs May to reshuffle her Cabinet at that point.The thinking is that a freshened-up Cabinet would give the Government a new, post-Brexit feel without a need to replace the Prime Minister. But the chances of Mrs May staying on long after Brexit day in March  have lowered signicantly in the past few days.Before this week, some Tory MPs argued that Mrs May should stay until the Brexit transition was done in December . They said this would mean that a new leader would be able to come in as a fresh face after Brexit and in time for the next General Election.However, the news that the transition could be extended cuts against that argument, as the transition could take you to months away from the next election.Privately, Tories from the Cabinet down acknowledge thatthe transition can be extended, then the case for keeping Mrs May until the end of it is weaker.Rather, it would be better to get a new leader soon after March  to give them a chance to make an impact on both Brexit and domestic policy before the  General Election.THE European Union likes to say that an Irish backstop is needed to protect the Good Friday agreement.But what that ignores is that by changing the nature of Northern Ireland’s relationship with the rest of the UK without consent, the backstop risks being in breach of that agreement.THERESA MAY’S declaration in her party conference speech that austerity is over has raised expectations of big pay rises across the public sector.At Cabinet this week, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Liz Truss, was keen to hose down this idea. She emphasised that public sector pay deals should be based on retention – eg. how many staff were leaving because the pay isn’t good enough, geographic factors and helping the lowest paid most.I’m told that Mrs Truss told the Cabinet that: “Some pay review bodies have ignored affordability requirements.”I understand Mrs May agreed the Government should get away from the idea of a single figure for public sector pay. Meanwhile, preparations for the Budget continue.This is meant to be a small Budget yet one ­Government source warns it is going to be “bloody contentious”.  Why  Because it will set the baseline for departmental spending ahead of next year’s spending review.THE biggest risk of a leadership challenge to Theresa May comes from cock-up, not conspiracy.The danger for her is not that Brexit ultras organise  letters and send them in simultaneously, forcing a confidence vote in her, but that enough despairing ToryMPs send in their letters and the party stumbles into a vote on Mrs May’s future. One of those involved in discussions about whether to try to remove Mrs May tells me the Brexit ultras “are not as organised as you might think”.If there was a confidence vote, Mrs May would probably survive it. But after this week, it would be closer than it would have been before.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I think that fear was all I felt. My nose used to block my sight. I had to hold my nose down to be able to see.”Villagers in his hometown Bondoukou had thought he was cursed and avoided him.“People said I was some kind of monster,” he said. “Saying that maybe it was something I had eaten which made me like this, but my cheeks just kept getting bigger and bigger.He underwent six months of chemotherapy, radiotherapy and stem cell replacement last year.He said: “Three days after I began chemo I realised I didn’t need to hold my nose down anymore to see.“I am very happy because when I go out I don’t cry. I am happy to meet people. I go out, I have fun, I play around. I have no problems. I am very happy.”Doctors are working on reconstructing his face since they eradicated the cancer.Specialist Dr Franc Ionna said: “There’s a flaw in the development of the facial bones. He has an alteration of the facial bone.“There’s a dissymmetry the left side is dferent to the right. One side has too much bone on the other is a deficit.”Prosper’s bones are still recovering from the impact of radiotherapy.The surgeon spent three hours emoving the cancer-damaged skin and releasing scar tissue hardened by the radiotherapy.Dr Ionna said: “I had an endless series of dficulties due to him having gone through radiotherapy the tissues were very stf just like a wall.”Prosper ed to his home in the Ivory Coast three weeks after his surgery.He is no longer shunned by the community and his mother.Burkitt lymphoma is a form of non-Hodgkins lymphoma in which cancer starts in the immune cells.It is named after British surgeon Denis Burkitt, who first identied the disease in  among children in Africa.It is common in young children who have malaria and Epstein-Barr virus, a common virus that also causes glandular fever.It occurs when the bodys immune cells start attacking itself.Burkitt lymphoma is uncommon – about  people are diagnosed with this type of lymphoma every year in the UK.The most common symptom is one or more lumps that develop quickly.It is the fastest growing human tumour and is fatalleft untreated.But intensive chemotherapy can improve survival rates.As treatment is intense patients are likely to need to stay in hospital while undergoing treatment.Prosper said: “My face has changed. It’s not finished, but it’s changed. I have also changed. I am not like before.“Before leaving, I couldn’t see a thing. It’s my country, but today as I arrive I’m new to it.

Nobody was talking about a bad deal, or no deal whatsoever. The public should have a say on the outcomes, with the option of staying in the EU.The TV chef said people were not fully informed when they voted but now understood the dire consequences.The only way we can avoid this total madness and win back our future has to be a Peoples Vote.Andrew Adonis, a Labour member of the House of Lords, said: This weeks fresh chaos and confusion over Brexit negotiations has exposed how even the best deal now available will be a bad one for Britain...In a video message of support, Nicola Sturgeon, the First Minister of Scotland, said: Let me say this loudly and clearly,the issue comes before the House of Commons, SNP MPs will support a Peoples Vote which includes the option to remain in the EU.She added: The Tory governments handling of these negotiations has been chaotic, incompetent and shambolic.Having spent two years telling us that no deal was better than a bad deal, the Prime Minister is now preparing to pile pressure on MPs to vote for a bad or blindfold deal on the grounds that no deal would be catastrophic.She is trying to scare the UK into the frying pan out of fear of the fire. It is a scandal and it should not be accepted.Voters will neither forgive nor forget allow this miserable Brexit to proceed without people being given the final say.Simon Chater is part of the Devon for Europe group which arranged eight coaches to bring campaigners to London for the event.The -year-old from South Devon said: This is the first time in my le Ive been political.He said  people had travelled in coaches arranged by the group, with some leaving Devon at am.The march is being spearheaded by a group of young people leading the march.Emma Stevens and her friend Emily Longman, both , were two of the people behind the Peoples Vote March banner.Miss Stevens said:  We dont want the other European countries to hold the same view [of leaving the EU].Miss Longman added:  Were both Spanish students due to study abroad next year, but no one knows what will happen with Erasmus funding.While the huge protest was going off in Leave Means Leave rally was taking place in Harrogate where the former Ukip leader Nigel Farage was speaking.Actor and comedian David Schneider tweeted a photo of himself with Chris Addison and Armando Iannucci all taking part in the march.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn did not take part in the march as he was meeting Michelle Bachelet, the first female President of Chile, in Geneva.The campaign group was launched at the Electric Ballroom in Camden, London, on April , , and is supported by Open Britain, the European Movement UK and Britain for Europe, amongst others.The group is campaigning for a “final say on the Brexit deal”.It seems Rachel Johnson, the sister of key Brexit politician Boris, attended the rally with Shappi Khorsandi While the demonstrators want a second referendum vote, Prime Minister Theresa May had previously ruled out another public vote on the issue.Britain is scheduled to leave the EU on March , but negotiations have been plagued by disagreements, particularly over the issue of the Republic of Ireland-Northern Ireland border, which will be the U.K.s only land frontier with the EU after Brexit. There are growing fears of a no-deal exit, which could create chaos at the borders and in the economy.Explaining the reason for the march, the group said: Whether you voted leave or remain, nobody voted to make this country worse off, to harm jobs, to damage the NHS, to affect the future of millions of young people, or to make this country more ided.The more the shape of the final Brexit deal becomes clear, the more it is clear that it will do nothing to improve social justice, reduce inequality, increase our standard of living, or create a better future for future generations.We are demanding our democratic voice be heard on Brexit.

Draped in EU flags, they chanted b******s to Brexit and Peoples Vote as they were led by brass groups, a samba band, a woman shaking tambourines and a Theresa May drag queen.  Placards branded Boris Johnson a w***er, c**kwomble, liar and a c*** while others declared F**k Farage, Brexsh**, Lies wreck lives and also stop fracking you c***s. One proclaimed Theresa May is a reptile while another simply showed Tory Brexiteer Jacob Rees Mogg in a top hat with the word LOL. Others declared Brexit is a death cult and Brexit is borderline insanity - showing a map of Northern Ireland. Racist a***holes should stay in Nigel Farages pants and not voting booths, said another. Organisers faced an angry backlash online after an official bus was pictured carrying a placard that said: UK now in so much trouble government appointed suicide minister. Dont top yourself. Another placard declared: Hitler would be proud of this Brexit, with the X replaced by a swastika. Director of communications for Peoples Vote, Tom Baldwin, tweeted: This is not anything authorised by the Peoples Vote campaign. Nor would it be, because it is completely inappropriate. Elsewhere, demonstrations are also taking place in Manchester with police saying an EDL protest and counter campaign is also under way. In a statement released prior to the march, organisers said the campaign would use the biggest, loudest and most important demonstration on Brexit to unleash a postal tidal wave on MPs in Parliament.  The crowd was told it is time to send MPs the message that they will not be forgiventhey allow a bad deal to be rammed through Parliament or blind-fold the public about Brexits long-term costs. The march is part of the #WriteThisWrong campaign, in which , postcards will be distributed with the words Brexit has already become a dog’s dinner – the whole process is going badly wrong. And it’s only going to get worse. It was planned to be led by , young people in pink T-shirts from across the country. But so crowded was the march that they ended up almost an hour behind the front of the column of protesters.  The rally at Parliament Square was due to begin at .pm, but by .pm the tail end of the march was only just flowing through Piccadilly. A giant banner declaring stop Tory Brexit had to be carried by  people. Others proclaimed Pulling out never works and Brexit is Raabish - mocking the Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab. And a woman pushed her baby in a pram that bore the slogan: Literally crapping myself about Brexit. London Mayor Sadiq Khan and celebrity chef Delia Smith are among those who spoke at the event, along with MPs from Labour, Conservative, Liberal Democrat, Green Party, the SNP and Plaid Cymru. Mayor of London Mr Khan, speaking ahead of his  appearance, said: Today will go down as an historic moment in our democracy. A moment when in their thousands, people from every corner of our country and every section of our society will take to the streets - coming to make our voice heard.  Weve heard some complain that a public vote would be undemocratic and unpatriotic. But the opposite is true. Theres nothing more democratic - nothing more British - than trusting the people to have the final say on our future. The lies, the mistruths and the deceptions of the referendum campaign have now been exposed, and its clear the will of the people is changing. No one voted to leave the EU to make themselves poorer. No one voted to make le harder for our children and grandchildren. No one voted to see our NHS damaged. And no one voted for the shambles that this Government has created. Emma Stevens and Emily Longman are two of the students leading the march behind a Peoples Vote banner. Miss Longman, , said she was four months too young to vote in the referendum. She said: Were both Spanish students due to study abroad next year, but no one knows what will happen with Erasmus funding. Miss Stevens, also , said: We dont want the other European countries to hold the same view [of leaving the EU]. Marchers will be encouraged to write a personal message on the other side of the postcard and address it to their MP before handing them to People’s Vote volunteers for delivery direct to the House of Commons next week.  The campaign will also launch an innovative new email tool, integrated into the People’s Vote website, where people can put in their postcodes to find their MP and write personalised text to their elected representatives. A leading campaigner for the Peoples Vote, Andrew Adonis, said: Brexit becoming a dog’s dinner. This week’s fresh chaos and confusion over Brexit negotiations has exposed how even the best deal now available will be a bad one for Britain. It’s a mess that nobody voted for and the reason we’re in such a growing crisis is that those cheerleading for Brexit know the promises they made can never be kept.  So this campaign is about using the people power writing to their MP get a People’s Vote to address the wrongs of this botched Brexit process. This is about making sure MPs understand how strong feelings are running on this vital issue. If they are wavering, they need to know there is a political price to be paid for doing the wrong thing. Voters will neither forgive nor forgetMPs allow this miserable Brexit to proceed without people being given the final say. Simon Chater is part of the Devon for Europe group, which arranged eight coaches to bring campaigners to London for the event. The -year-old from South Devon said: This is the first time in my le Ive been political. He said  people had travelled in coaches arranged by the group, with some leaving Devon at am.  Carmen Smith, a For our Futures Sake Supporter from Wales, who is due to speak at the event, said: Today will see a vast march and rally of people from every corner of the country and all walks of le demanding their right to have the final say on Brexit. The People’s Vote March for The Future is going to be the biggest and loudest demonstration on Brexit yet. The biggest problems are still to be negotiated, many of the consequences are still being concealed and,we carry on like this, the arguments will never end. That’s why the People’s Vote March for the Future will be led by thousands of young people – students, apprentices and everyone starting out in le – whose voices have too often been ignored. Democracy means you don’t have to accept this. Time is short. The issue is urgent. The Brexit Elite has shown they can’t sort it out. But you can – by demanding a People’s Vote. Joe Trickey, from Croydon, is celebrating his rd birthday at the march. He said: I believe very strongly in the EU as a place of peace and strength. Going out puts us in isolation and leaving isnt about trade deals, its about our values.  Mr Trickey is protesting alongside his daughter, who is holding a sign about his birthday, and plans to celebrate afterwards with a glass of wine. A spokesman for politan Police: We are aware of a march and rally which is due to take place on Saturday,  October in central London. An appropriate and proportionate policing plan is in place. We have been engaging with the event organisers and Police Liaison Teams will be out on the ground on the day.

Jack, five, and Thomas,  months, both have cerebral palsy and require extra care and attention, but Mark and Deb shower them with all the love and support they could possibly need. As soon as Deb tentatively suggested adopting children with special needs to Mark he didn’t hesitate. And that is despite his own experience of adoption when he struggled through his teenage years desperately wondering why his birth mother had given him up.  Mark, , explains: “I have always known I was adopted, there was never a time that it was dropped as a bombshell. I later found out that my dad had been adopted too, but he never spoke about it at all. “But I was going through a period of questioning everything - why was I adopted  How could someone carry a baby for nine months and give it away  It was the rejection mentality - I’d only just been born and she didn’t want me. When Mark got to the age of  he knew he had to find out his birth family history and approached social services. When he read the file he discovered his birth mum was only  when he had him and had decided she couldn’t give him the le that she felt he deserved and had no option but to have him adopted. He said: “Reading that, and reading the letters between her and her social worker, and that her mother was begging the social workers to talk her out of it, that completely changed my view of myself.  “Instead of thinking what was wrong with me for her to give me up, it became she put me first - she gave me up to give me the best chance in le regardless of how she felt. What a sacrice she made for me. That was absolutely true love. It changed who I was overnight - somebody loved me so much to give me a decent start I had to make the most of it.” But Mark still felt her had to keep his news to himself and didnt tell his adoptive parents. Even when he traced his birth mum and started to build a relationship with her, he didn’t say a word. He sent a letter to his birth mum’s last known address and miraculously her brother still lived there and passed the letter on. Then  years after she gave her much-loved son up for adoption, mum Melita finally saw him again. Mark says: “When she opened the door and I looked at someone who actually looked like me for the first time in my le was amazing. We just hugged for what seemed like forever.” Mark, from Cheltenham, discovered he had a half-brother two years younger than him, and when Melita, , married her long-term partner Mark drove her to the wedding and was a witness, and was also best man at his half brother’s wedding.  But he still hadn’t told his birth parents Ivan and Jean Mulley. He says: “At first I didn’t want to tell them in case nothing came of it, but then the longer it went on the harder it was to say anything.” Unfortunately his dad passed away in  without ever knowing that Mark, , had found his birth mum. And it was only when he and Deb, , started their own adoption journey that they were advised by experts that he needed to tell his adoptive mum that he was in contact with his birth mum. “It was hard telling her,” says Mark. “I explained to her that she was my mum, she would always be my mum and nothing would change.” Eventually Jean and Melita met for the first time -with Jean bringing pictures of Mark from throughout his le to show Melita how her little baby boy had grown. Mark said: “It was so lovely to see them walking along together, arm in arm, chatting away. Unfortunately that was the only time they met. My mum passed away in  but she knew everything and was happy about the situation.” Having been through all that, Mark, a chaplain at a dementia care centre, was perfectly placed to become an adoptive parent himself. We Deb, , had always wanted to adopt from being a little girl. Both of them had worked with people with disabilities and felt they could give a child with additional needs a great le. “Debs has got experience and expertise on additional needs, I have got the adoption experience. We work together as a team,” says Mark. Speaking about their boys, Mark’s voice fills with pride. “Both boys are wonderful, they are so positive and happy,” he smiles. “Our oldest boy uses a wheelchair, and he has just blossomed.  He settled in with us straight away and is absolutely bright as a button. “He can’t verbally communicate well and his words are dficult to understandyou don’t know him, which is frustrating for him - you can see him give us an exasperated look when we ask him to repeat himself and when we finally get it he gives us a big cheer. He is always one step ahead of us and his memory is amazing. “Our youngest boy has been with us since June. He can almost sit on his own, they don’t know whether he will be likely to walk or not, the physio is assessing him. But he has already surpassed all his predictions. We were told he was likely to be blind, but he can see well. They said he would never cope with cuddles and being touched, but he loves cuddles. “They have to prepare you for the worst, but he is doing incredibly well. Becoming their parents is absolutely the best thing we have ever done. And adopting more children in the future is more than a possibility for us.

Becky Deans obsession with the sugary treat started when she first had a taste of the fizzy drink at the age of . She revealed how she would have a can as soon as she woke up and would carry on throughout the day. The mum was forced to minimise the intake of her favourite sugar-filled drink when she started fainting on her way to work and was diagnosed with aneamia. “It was always my go-to drink and it would literally be the only thing I would drink,” the -year-old said.  “I would need it the minute I got up and then one between breakfast and dinner. “Then, I would have one with dinner and I would always have a bottle with me at work. I used to buy a -pack from the supermarket which I would get through within a week and I was drinking maybe eight cans a day at most. “I made a joke about it even though people would say to me, ‘you should start drinking something ’. But I had been drinking it for so long I found it was the only thing I could sip.” In spite of this, Ms Dean was still hooked by the fizzy diet drink and it took her another five years to finally tackle her crippling habit.  “It was great to drink in terms of it being low in calories but it was still having an effect on my teeth, for example. Earlier this year, Ms Dean found herself fainting on the way to work and tests discovered she was anaemic. Doctors advised her to look at making several lestyle changes, including cutting down her Coca Cola consumption. She then made a drastic decision by going cold turkey. “I recently found out I was anaemic and there was a couple of times where I had fainted en route to work, she said. I was always tired and as I was in the middle of making health changes anyway, so I thought this was something I could cut out.” To put her addiction to the test, Ms Dean went the whole month of September without drinking a single can of Coke - much to the surprise of her friends and family.  She motivated herself by deciding to donate the money she saved from not buying Coke to the NSPCC. But it was not an easy challenge. She stocked up on a “multitude” of other drinks, including smoothies, juices, flavoured water and cups of tea, and gave all her remaining Coke Zero cans to her partner Sean Rouen.“I found it really hard,” Ms Dean said. “It was super hard and I felt like I was getting more headaches and for the first week feeling even more tired too without Coke.“I found a nice flavoured water which was infused with cucumber and another infused with jasmine. Those were nice, cold and refreshing and I used them as substitutes for my thirst for Coke Zero.” After  long days, Ms Dean managed to complete the fundraiser and for the first time in almost  years she was able to abstain from drinking Coke.  However, rather than eliminate Coke from her le completely, the mum decided to cut down her consumption and drink it in moderation going forward. “I knew after that month there was no way I could go back to the amount I was drinking. I don’t gulp cans like I used to and there have been some days where I’ve just had a small can with my tea. “It has not taken over - I won’t let it, and I’ve convinced myself it doesn’t taste as good as what it used to.” She said: “Picking a charity spurred me on and the thought of the money going to someone  was more of an incentive. “I knew I was never going to give it up for le because that is unachievable. But I needed to do something drastic and set myself a strict challenge with a start date and finish date, and this was it.” What Coca-Cola says  Coca-Cola has always denied that either the caffeine or the sugar in its drinks are addictive. There are mg of caffeine in a ml can of Coca-Cola, compared with ml in a mug of instant coffee. Speaking to Thein , the multinational firm said the company has used caffeine as a “safe ingredient” for more than  years in its product. It added that people who are “addicted to sugar” are not being scientically robust. Coca-Cola has been contacted for an additional comment in response to Ms Dean’s story.

Every expectant mum is dferent in terms of when her baby bump starts to show. For first time mums its often around the  week mark - but it can show sooner than that or in even a few weeks later down the line. A hint of Meghans bump can be seen in recent photos, here is how its grown month on month.  In July, Meghan must have just fallen pregnant with her first baby, so wasnt showing any signs of a bump at this early stage. The couple had been married for around two months before Meghan became pregnant - and royal fans had been eagerly awaiting the smallest hint ever since the pair tied the knot in May.  In early August, the royal couple attended the wedding of Harrys close friends, Charlie van Straubenzee and Daisy Jenks, in Surrey. Meghans bump wasnt showing just yet, and wore a loose blouse and a floaty pleated skirt that revealed no signs of her pregnancy.  In September the Duchess may well have been starting to show early signs of her baby bump. If so she was very clever at covering her bump with tummy-skimming outfits, billowing dresses and peplum tops. The Duchess looked stunning in a rather roomy Jason Wu dress for a gala concert in September that left plenty of space for a blossoming baby bump.  Just days after the announcement of Meghans pregnancy on  October, she has since emerged in Australia wearing outfits that showed her small bump.

I was aged , and hours earlier we’d been told my mum, Heulwen, had suffered a brain aneurysm and was only being kept alive by a le support machine. It was the most painful moment of my le. The doctors were trying to be patient and thoughtful, but there was urgency to their request they couldn’t mask. I remember one saying: “We know what a dficult time this is for you. We’re very sorry, but we need to discuss whether you will agree to donating Heulwen’s organs.” I didn’t completely understand, possibly because of my age, but I did know it felt like they were physically ripping my heart out. I lashed out, horried they were even asking us the question so soon, at such a sensitive time but now I know they were just doing their job. Much of the rest of the conversation is a blur, but as a family my grandad Gordon, now , dad Simon, , uncle Hywel, , my sisters Hanna, , Beth, , and I decided that, yes, we should donate.  My  year-old mum was not on the organ donation register, but she’d happened to tell my uncle six months earlier that she would like to be a donorthe time ever came. I’m sure she didn’t think that time would come so very soon. We had to say goodbye then. I gave her a final hug, and remember she was so warm, while at the same time I knew she wasn’t really there anymore. Then we left the hospital and as soon as I got home, I instantly got changed and binned the clothes I’d been wearing for the last  hours. Le slowly limped on but I didn’t think about organ donation again, instead choosing to block out the memory of that terrible day in January . But when the Mirror launched the Change the Law for Le campaign in , calling for everyone in the UK to be a potential organ donor unless they choose to opt out, I began to wonder about the people who might have benefitted from my mum’s donation. Were the operations even successful or was it all a waste of time  Was it just one person  Did they have children  Was it a child who was helped  So I decided to write to the NHS donor family care service.  I wasn’t feeling particularly optimistic that I’d be able to find anything out, yet within three days they sent me letters from  addressed to my dad and to me that I’d never seen before - because at the time I just didn’t want to know. It took me a week to prepare myself to read the letters and then it was on a train to Wales, aptly, because that’s where my mum was from, that I decided to open them. Incredibly the letters told me my mum saved six people’s lives. Thanks to her four other mums and a man in his fties had been given le-saving transplants. Her liver was given to a -year-old mum-of-three and one of her kidneys was given to a -year-old single mum with a young daughter. Before the transplant, this mum had been on dialysis for many years and could now spend more time with her little girl. My mum’s second kidney was donated to a -year-old woman who lives with her son, daughter and own mother. She too was confined to a le on dialysis before the transplant.  A -year-old man was given one of my mum’s lungs, and without it he would have died. Before this, he was living alone and struggling to cope on his own at home. The second lung was given to a -year-old woman, married and with two grown up children. But it was a letter dated two months later that touched me the most. Dated March , , it said: “A few weeks ago a five-year-old boy underwent le saving surgery and was transplanted with one of Heulwen’s heart valves. “This little boy was born with severe heart problems and prior to his operation was very unwell. “We can only imagine the dference this operation will make to this boy’s le and to his family.” I now know a little bit of my mum lives on in those six people, something that will now comfort me forever. The immediate years after her death were the most dficult of my le. But I was carried through by the love and support of my family, especially my dad, my sisters, and and my friends. As we pulled each other through, there were still moments of light and laughter while we adapted to le without mum. One Sunday, two weeks after she died, we were remembering how good mum’s gravy was with the roast while dad tried to replicate her recipe. It ended up looking like hot chocolate, which he then accidentally spilt all over the kitchen. We all laughed and cried at the same time.  We remembered how my mum, an animal lover like me, would allow our pet guinea-pigs to run around our living room driving my dad mad. And my favourite memory of the short time I had with mum was just me and her, watching Corrie together. We got a golden retriever called Bruce, who was extremely disobedient but brought us so much happiness during that dark time, always comforting me when the grief would come. And my dad became both parents to three teenages girls. To my great embarrassment, he found it amusing to ask me very loudly over from the next aisle in the supermarket which tampons he should buy for us. My mum was born in Swansea, was very proud to be Welsh, and later went on to work as a speech therapist in St Albans, Hertfordshire, where I grew up. Her real passion was art and music, something she always tried to pass on to me and my sisters. We miss her everyday but are comforted by her incredible legacy. Changing the law to an opt-out system won’t make a death any less painful and, as I know only too well, families might feel outraged when they are asked to donate in that devastating moment. But this is why it’s so important to talk to your loved ones about organ donation andyou, like me, have decided to join the organ donor register.

He and the Duchess of Sussex also visited Macarthur Girls High School on the fourth day of their Royal Tour in Australia, and were impressed by what they saw.

This project has led to a number of historic discoveries.The latest finding was uncovered by Highways England workers, Cambridgeshire Live reports.And the patch of land near Fenstanton where the bones were discovered is believed to be an ancient river. Some remains of a woolly rhino were also found by the highway crew and the parts are set to undergo a study by specialists to determine their exact age.  A Highways England spokesman said: The remains of a woolly mammoth dating back to the ice age are among the latest remarkable finds from the team working on the A Cambridge to Huntingdon project. The woolly mammoth which was around the same size as an African Elephant roamed Eurasia thousands of years ago before its extinction. Its fur meant it was perfectly adapted to the cold environment during the last ice age. Mammoths, which are thought to have weighed up to eight tonnes, became extinct in around ,BC.Scientists believe their extinction was a result of climate change and being hunted by humans.Remains of the woolly mammoth have been found on most continents except for Australasia and South America.  The spokesman continued: Operatives also discovered the remains of a woolly rhino, both at least , years old, during excavations for construction materials near Fenstanton in what was once an ancient river. They are the latest in a series of fantastic finds from the team building the new road, with other remarkable discoveries including Prehistoric Henges, Iron Age settlements, Roman pottery kilns, three Anglo-Saxon villages, and a deserted medieval village. Palaeontologist Dean Lomax has labelled the discoveries as exciting and quite uncommon. He said: Woolly mammoth and woolly rhino were once a common part of the wildle here in the UK, during the Ice Age. We know this because their fossils have been found at ious fossil sites across the UK. However, recent discoveries like this are quite uncommon and it is exciting that they have been uncovered during road works. It would be interesting to discover whether this is a one-off discovery or whether more iniduals are preserved in the same area. It is also important that these specimens are appropriately cared for and conserved. These types of bone, especially mammoth tusk, can deteriorate quite poorlyleft untreated so great care should be taken with these remains. The pound.billion A project is due to open in December .

Nathan Phillips, , and Luke, , lost their mum Anita to cancer in . She was . The boys and their devastated dad, David, pulled together. But further heartbreak was to come when, just three months ago, shymotorcyclist David, , died in a head-on collision with a truck. Luke was on the back of the bike and was severely injured. Part of his foot had to be amputated and David’s fate was kept from him as he battled for survival.  In that cruel moment, le changed forever for the brothers. Yet it has drawn them even closer together. And for Nathan there is no more partying or going out with his mates. He says: “I’ve got to focus on looking after Luke now. “When he was first in hospital we had to keep telling him Dad was okay.  “The doctors saidwe’d told him straight away he’d have panicked and he wouldn’t have been able to go into surgery. “His foot got stuck under the wheel of the lorry. He had to have half his big toe and all of his little toe amputated. “He lost a lot of the skin on his foot, he needed a skin graft from the top of his leg on to his foot.” The accident happened in Mancetter, Warwickshire – a few miles from the family’s Nuneaton home. Luke was left in a coma at Birmingham Children’s Hospital. And even after he came round Nathan was only able to tell him about their dad once he had stabilised.  He adds: “It was pretty hard seeing Luke like that. “He thought Dad was okay when he was in AE. We had to keep telling him it was all right. “Telling Luke that Dad died was the worst thing I’ve ever had to do.” As he stands beside Luke, Nathan vows to take on the role of mum and dad – as well as big brother. His love and sheer shydetermination to help Luke cope would make Anita and David proud.  Nathan has nursed Luke on the path to recovery while still grieving himself. He managed to get himself a better paid job – swapping pot-washing work for a position at Aldi. Then he got to grips with running a household – paying bills, doing the chores, looking after them both. Speaking for the first time, Nathan goes on: “I think it has taught me to make the most of every day, don’t let little things upset you and just enjoy the days as they come. “I don’t want to be upset or angry about losing Mum and Dad. I’ve got to focus on looking after Luke now. “We respect each other a lot more, I think. I have to do things like wake him up early for school – but he’s all right about it.  “He still gets his moments where he says ‘I miss Mum and Dad’ or ‘I wish Dad was here’ – you know, to give him a hug before bed. “But we do stuff together to make sure things work out.” Household chores have included redecorating their home. Nathan continues: “I used to spend more time with my mates. “I’d be out in my car all the time or on my Xbox. I can still do those things now – but not so much. “I’ve got the washing up, to do, the laundry, the shopping, making sure Luke’s unorm and my work stuff is sorted. I feel asI have been left to do everything by myself.  “It’s nobody’s fault, it’s just how the world is. “It has just meant I’ve had to mature a bit quicker. “Before losing my mum I had a normal le – no worries, going around doing my own thing, not having to worry about anyone but myself.” The brothers have fond memories of mum Anita, who was a sales assistant at Morrison’s.  And the pain is still raw after losing dad David, who worked as a CADoperator. But somehow, the tragic experience of the past two years has brought the brothers closer, Nathan says. He explains: “It has been tough now and then. Our relationship was always good but has grown dramatically since then. “He’s always been a good lad and never misbehaved. We argue now and again, but nothing serious.”  Despite the physical and psychological trauma, Nathan says Luke is doing well. He is back at school – in Year Eight – and is off his crutches. As for Nathan, he has given up the le of a typical -year-old. He says: “It’s just not an option. I work, I look after Luke and I see my girlfriend. “Sometimes me and my girlfriend will go outLuke’s at a friend’s house. I get a lot less time to myself.”  Nathan is Luke’s , but does get help from aunties and uncles. However, grandparents on both sides have passed away. After hearing their story the local community has rallied round, setting up a crowdfunding campaign and donating thousands to help the boys. Kindhearted friends and family set an initial target of pound,. But that has been surpassed and the total currently stands at pound,. Nathan is hugely appreciative. And every penny will be put to good use.  He says of the appeal: “It’s been brilliant, it’s going really well. “My next door neighbour Wayne did a sponsored bike ride and raised pound, from that. “It’ll make le easier.

One person has created a fantastic map that illustrates the ongoing ide over the issue, tracking the spots where people say scone to rhyme with bone and those who say scone to rhyme with gone.

The Duke of Sussex managed to calm his apparent nerves to pay homage to the Invictus generation at the ceremony at Sydney Opera House. He honoured the one Invictus generation - service personnel, veterans and war dead. The duke thanked the hosts for the welcome and said he and Meghan are so happy to celebrate the personal joy of our newest addition with you all. He added that he was proud to introduce his we to them.  Harry, , said mental toughness is being honest about how we feel. He said: ​With the help of medical science,​ ​the Invictus generation has not only survived injuries that in past conflicts would have been fatal, but has also chosen to fight back from the darkest of places to be here tonight. They have shown us the true meaning of resilience. When they have been open about their hidden emotional and mental wounds, the Invictus generation has shown us that in today’s world being tough means being honest about how we feel - both inside and out. He later added: You are going to put on one hell of a show over the next week.  The grand opening got under way after being delayed by a tropical storm that rocked Sydney. Impressive lightning flashed overhead at the Opera House in the hour before the ceremony was due to start, as a storm brought eerie dark clouds, strong winds and heavy rain. Spectators were forced to flee for cover until it passed and Prince Harry admitted he was worried the ceremony would have to be cancelled. Technical equipment was damaged adding to the delay of the ceremony, according to organisers who were concerned about health and safety.  But the the heavy rain came to a sudden stop shortly before the couple were escorted into the venue by Premier of New South Wales Gladys Berejiklian. I was a bit worried, Prince Harry told the Premier as they walked across the room. Thankfully it looks like the sky is clearing now. Meghan, who was wearing a Stella McCartney dress and coat by X-Files actress Gillian Anderson for Winser London, smiled as the Premier told the couple there a lot of people looking forward to meeting you. Prince Harry was pictured practising his speech hours before the ceremony on stage in front of we Meghan Markle as dark clouds swirled overhead. He then appeared nervous as the royal couple took their seats ahead of the ceremony, while a lively Meghan chatted to her neighbour.  Created by Prince Harry, the Invictus Games is an international sporting event for injured or sick service personnel and veterans from  nations. The opening ceremony started an hour late - at .pm local time- following the storm. Crowds gave a huge cheer for the duke and duchess as the ceremony began, said Russell Myers, the Mirrors royal correspondent. Sydney Opera House earlier said the weather would not stop the opening ceremony from taking place. In a series of tweets, it said: Tonights Invictus Opening Ceremony is a signicant event for everyone involved but particularly for the competitors and their accompanying family and friends who have been looking forward to being on the forecourt of the Sydney Opera House for a fabulous Aussie welcome.  The Duke and Duchess of Sussex - currently a third of the way through a -day tour of Australia, Fiji, Tonga and New Zealand - attended a reception ahead of the ceremony at the opera houses famous Bennelong Restaurant earlier today. They were joined there by competitors and their families, as well as New South Wales premier Gladys Berejiklian and Olympic swimmer Ian Thorpe OAM , who acted as Master of Ceremonies. Political figures, Invictus ambassadors and even royalty had gathered to meet the couple. Jordan’s Princess Dina Mired and Prince Mired bin Ra’ad were among guests who had broken into small groups to meet the Sussexes during their short visit. Invictus friends and family ambassador Leesa Kwok, , gted the duchess a small knitted yellow flower when they met.  This is so beautul, she remarked. Kwok, whose husband Jamie Tanner is competing for Australia in the wheelchair rugby and tennis events, told Meghan how , of the hand-knitted were made especially for the games by a group of elderly war widows from Aged Care . Meghan was really touched by the story and said the flower was really pretty, said Kwok. I had actually met them both last year in Toronto and gave one of the flowers and he asked ‘Can I have another one for my gran ’ so it was lovely to share a third one with his we. The flowers are made as a show of support to the friends, family and close supporters - it’s something for them to wear and show their pride.  Meghan was interested to hear the backstory. She has this amazing ability to connect and make you feel like you’re the only person in the room. We also spoke about the impact that Invictus Games has had not just on the lives of those competing but the friends and families who stick by during dficult times. When I was telling Meghan she stopped and said, ‘Hold on, I want my husband to hear this too’. They’re both so lovely, so caring. In the event of severe weather for the Opening Ceremony plans are in place to relocate people under cover until it is safe for them to resume their seats.  Earlier in the day Kwok’s son Danyan Jones had raced a remote control truck against Harry at Cockatoo Island during the Jaguar Land Rover Driving Challenge event. Harry was pleased to hear he would be wearing his medal to the opening ceremony, added Kwok. Prince Harry had a laugh with Olympic gold cyclist and Invictus Ambassador Anna Meares when she showed him a newspaper article from  when she beat Britain’s Victoria Pendleton in the  Olympic Games. There is a photo of Harry with his head in his hands the moment I won the cycling event and we had a good laugh about it, says -year-old Meares. I’d actually started by chatting to Meghan and I congratulated her on the baby. She’s beautul. But then I said ‘it’s great chatting but what I really want to do is take the Mickey out of your husband,’ and she laughed and said ‘well here he is!’. They’re a great couple - really fun.  The duke and duchess spoke to a number of other guests including retired Australian swimmer Ian Thorpe and Australian Prime Minster Scott Morrison and his we Jenner. After  minutes they were escorted out of the room to another area of the venue ahead of the Invictus Opening Ceremony The duke, along with the Royal Foundation and Ministry of Defence, founded the games in , inspired by his visit to the US Warrior Games in . The first event was held in London, followed by Orlando in , Toronto in  and Sydney this year. No games were held in  to allow Orlando planners time to raise funds.

British video producer Ian Wilson and brother Jack touched down in the capital Phnom Penh on Tuesday after claiming to have found the plane on Google Maps . The MH flight had been en route from Kuala Lumpar to Beijing when it vanished on March ,  with  passengers and  crew members on boad. Ian and Jack started their trek to the site yesterday but have been warned to stay away as the site is reportedly surrounded by armed illegal loggers high on crystal meth. Theyve been warned the area of mountainous terrain between Chrok La Eang Waterfalls is re with danger.  According to the Daily Star , an unnamed expat emailed Wilson to say: The real danger you have is not so much the terrain, but the illegal loggers who are operating in the area and would not be pleased to see white guys wandering around with recording equipment. I dont want you to get into a potentially dangerous situation, either in the jungle or with these guys . The aircraft in the Google Maps image is believed to be one that was captured in flight but Wilson is convinced its the doomed MH plane.  The finders fee for the plane currently stands at poundmillion. The official search for the main wreckage of the plane, with some scraps found, was recently called off. The plane turned off course and disappeared from the radar never to be seen again and investigators presume it crashed in the Indian Ocean, west of Australia. But some theorists claim Captain Ahmad deliberately crashed the plane - a theory that has never been substatinated.  Investigators have suggested the possibility of hijacking but there is no psychological or criminal evidence to suggest any of the crew deliberately crashed the plane. Three pieces of wreckage believed to be from MH have been found from as far north as Tanzania and as far south as South Africa. Investigators have considered more than  theories about what could have happened to the plane and have worked extensively since the plane vanished. However, despite releasing a ,-page report , they admitted they still cannot say what happened.

Speaking to the Irish Daily Mirror , mum Tara said: I went in to him around am. I usually give him a soother and he goes back asleep for an hour, but he kept crying. “So I took him out and changed him but when I went to feed him, I found the tooth in his mouth. It had grown overnight.” Tara took him straight to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda but doctors were also baffled at the sight of the fang.  She added: “They were debating whether it was a tooth or not. They kept calling other doctors in - they didn’t know what to do.” After calling Dublins Temple Street Childrens Hospital for advice, Tara was put in touch with a dentist in Drogheda who would see Oscar. She said: “We got an appointment and brought him in. I had to hold him and hold his arms down while she took the tooth out.” But the drama didn’t stop there as the fang ended up flying up the babys nose.  Tara: “The suction caused the tooth to go up his nose - I had to wind him to get it out, but he was okay. “There were dentists coming in to take pictures of the tooth and everything. We took it home to show Oscar when he gets older. “We were terried at first but now we’re seeing the funny side. Me and my husband were laughing about it, it’s mad - especially at this time of the year!” Most babies will have their first tooth poke through at any time from  to  months of age but this can y wildly from child to child.

The -year-old had stepped down from the  in  following a sexual harassment complaint by a researcher at Pachauris Delhi-based The Energy and Resources Institute . An Indian court has ordered the trial, which Mr Pachauri has asked to be speedy due to his age, his counsel Ashish Dikshit told Reuters today.  India is also considering tightening sexual harassment laws, officials told Reuters last week. The Delhi court has charged Mr Pachauri under sections of the Indian Penal code including sexual harassment and outraging the modesty of a woman. The trial begins on January , his counsel said.

defeat.For him, though, it’s all about what McIntyre can do for the team he remains an avid fan of and not about what happened in the distant past.He’s hopeful his fellow-Dee supporters adopt the same attitude and get right behind the new gaffer.“Thanks for bringing that up, it’s not one of the derbies I prefer to recall but I do remember Jim scoring that winner and it wasn’t a nice feeling,” he said.“He was always a dangerous player we had to watch out for in derbies and you have to be honest about it, a lot of Dundee fans won’t have forgotten that.“But now it’s about what he can do for our club and I’m surehe can get a few quick wins and get the team up the table a bit the fans will be right behind him.“He’s not the first manager, even in Dundee, who’s taken over at a team that were his rivals when he was a player, it’s part of football and it’s not something that stopped them going on to have success.“And going on to manage a club you were a favourite at is no guarantee of success – sadly we’ve just seen that with Neil McCann.“I was sorry to see him go because he’s someone I like as a person, who I knew had a real feeling for Dundee and wanted to play good football but things just didn’t work out.“Now the board have turned to Jim and, as well as being a manager whose teams can play attractive stuff, he’s one who knows the importance of results. Particularly right now, he’ll be working to get them and get Dundee out of this hole they’re in and, as time passes, he’ll worry about how it looks.”Soutar points outDundee drew up a profile of the man they needed, McIntyre would be one of those who came closest to ticking all the necessary boxes.“Jim’s now an experienced manager with knowledge of the Premiership and he’s been successful. I know he got the sack at another of my old clubs, Ross County, last year, but it was a harsh decision.“I’ve a lot of time for Roy McGregorand he’s a man who hasn’t made many mistakes up there.“Getting rid of Jim and Billy Dodds was one and I think when he looks back on that he’d probably agree.“As for Jim himself, he is a proud man who will work very hard to put things right a Dundee.“What happened at County will have hurt him and he’ll be determined to prove he still has a lot to offer – I think he has.“In the past he’s got the best out of players and while he’s inheriting a few good ones at Dens, I think it’s fair to say there are a few others who’ve under-achieved.”Soutar’s also convinced Dundee are getting a man whose stock in Scottish football remains high, and rightly so.“While he’s been out of the game he’s been linked with a few clubs andsome of them chose to go another way, I know he knocked back a few offers because they weren’t right for him.“He’s wanted to get back in at a club where he feels he can achieve something in the top ision and Dundee fans can be happy he thinks we fit that bill.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/10/5bc99e098fe91-846x564.jpg ","title":"found at car wheel with open buckfast","story":"A man has admitted getting behind the wheel of a car while more than four times the alcohol limit.Paul Milne, , was found slumped in his parked car with a bottle of Buckfast and vodka on Clepington Road on July  this year.He admitted being in charge of the vehicle after having  mics of alcohol in mls of breath, exceeding the limit of  mics.Dundee Sherf Court heard that the police were alerted to Milne by two delivery drivers who were concerned about his appearance while within the vehicle.Fiscal depute Charmaine Gilmartin told Sherf Alastair Brown: “Two takeaway drivers saw the accused’s vehicle parked on Clepington Road and they thought they had seen alcohol within the car.“They brought it to the attention of police officers who attended five minutes later who traced him within the car.“His head was slumped forward and the keys were in the ignition.“They could see an open bottle of Buckfast and a bottle of vodka in the car.“He smelled strongly of alcohol and was unsteady on his feet.”Milne failed a roadside breath test and later provided the reading at police headquarters.Solicitor Kevin Hampton said Milne, formerly of Strathmartine Road but now residing at Jericho House on Artillery Lane, had struggled with alcoholism and was taking active steps to tackle his drinking.He said: “There’s a long-standing alcohol problem which he now seems to be tackling and is doing quite well.“He got to the stage where he realised he was out of control.“He has taken the steps to move into Jericho House and that is where he is residing at the moment.”Sentence was deferred on Milne until November  in order to gather criminal justice social work reports.He was additionally disqualied from driving in the interim."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/10/5bc99da315efe-376x564.jpg ","title":"mums horror as brick misses baby by inches","story":"A young mum has described the terrying moment a brick smashed through her window and landed only inches from her baby’s head.Roxanne Montague was in her living room with her -month-old son Mason when the object came crashing into her home.The -year-old said she had heard shouting outside her house on Ballantrae Road in Douglas moments before the missile smashed through the glass.Roxanne said: “It was terrying.

So it’s proved with the former Scotland star at Dens Park.That he had very definite ideas on how the game should be played was clear, as was the fact he was unlikely to change them.He demanded his team focused on a passing game all over the pitch, making it clear he’d accept responsibilityit meant risks taken in playing the ball out from the back at times led to goals being conceded. Inevitably it did.In fairness to McCann, his arrival did bring about a speedy and necessary improvement and wins over Motherwell and Kilmarnock followed by a draw with Ross County were enough to save the team from relegation in the   season.Two defeats would follow before the end of the campaign and while they were largely irrelevant to a relieved support, they did perhaps suggest to the caretaker boss that, long-term, the changes he wanted to make were going to be too big an ask.That led to a confusing summer that initially saw him announce he did not want the job, moves be made for then-St Mirren boss Jack Ross, before McCann had a change of mind and was appointed on a permanent basis.Crucially, that saw time wasted in undertaking what was a clearly necessary rebuilding of the squad. That left him playing catch-up when it came to new signings.It meant despite talk of better to come, with the exception of a brief spell around February, hopes of a top-six challenge gave way to another battle for survival.It was achieved via three wins from the first four post-split fixtures but, even so, it was clear better was expected this season.Another summer of signings this year gave some hope that would be the case but, although progression from the Betfred Cup group stage was secured, a home defeat at the hands of Championship Dunfermline and a lack of goals were worrying.Performances in opening league games against St Mirren and Aberdeen were decent but both ended in defeat.Then an inept and ill-disciplined display against Ayr in the last  of the Betfred Cup that saw three goals conceded and two red cards had the alarm bells ringing.After that the defeats continued coming. There was brief respite via a solitary success at Hamilton last month but he departs having lost eight of his last nine fixtures.If that was not bad enough, his time in charge saw stories of discord in the dressing-room and bust-ups with ious players during his time in charge didn’t help.Most notably was the argument that led to star goalie Scott Bain’s time at Dens coming to an abrupt end. Now McCann and assistant Graham Gartland have paid the price."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/10/DNic_UNESCO_V-846x564.jpg ","title":"unesco delegates from across the world visit dundee","story":"Dozens of delegates from fellow Unesco cities of design across the world have been given a tour of Dundee’s new £ million VA museum.Hailing from as far afield as Australia, Canada, China and South Africa, the visitors were in Tayside as part of a collaboration between design-savvy cities.Of all the  cities to hold the accolade, the delegates voted to visit Dundee, which was named a Unesco city of design in  and is the only place in the UK with the honour.Robin Jutzen, who works in enterprise and investment for the City of Cape Town, was among the international visitors.He last visited Dundee more than  years ago on a school rugby tour aged  and noted the “out-standing change” since.“The transformation from then to now is utterly astounding,” he said.“The VA itself is amazing.

People just blamed her for things.“One of the worst things that she was accused of was by her neighbour. She said that she made her husband so sick that he died.“Apparently, Janet wanted a piece of land that he owned, and when he died the neighbour blamed Janet.”The accusations didn’t stop with her, though, as her son Thomas Leyis – considered to be “master of the convent” – was strangled at the stake and then burnt to ashes after also being convicted of witchcraft.Janet’s husband John Leyis and their three daughters Elspet, Janet and Violet were absolved of witchcraft charges but banished from Aberdeen up to a distance of  miles away, for “keeping company” with Jane and Thomas, with all four trials taking place between February and March .In April  alone, at least eight people were strangled at the stake and then burnt – including Marioun Grant, Christen Reid, Katharine Gerard, Helene Frasser, Issobel Richie, Margaret Og, Helene Rogie and Issobell Ogie.Those cleared of charges faced punishment as they were banished from the city anyway.

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

An astute, respected and independent body, its remit would be to act for the long term greater good of the Ayrshire coast and its stakeholders - and issue unorm guidelines to prevent North, East and South Ayrshire councils peppering our seascapes with all kinds of piecemeal shoreline developments. Sadly, such a badly-needed supervisory power is still only a figment of my imagination. But had it existed – it would have poured over builder McCarthy and Stone’s ‘Legoland’ plans for the former Malcolm Sargent House site at Prestwick . . . before hobbing them into the nearest bin! As it is, neighbouring Prestwick Golf Club have taken the legal ‘ last resort’ and petitioned for a judicial review of South Ayrshire Council’s decision to grant planning approval. Successfully overturning SAC’s November  decision is the legal equivalent of holing a  footer on Prestwick’s th green. Only six per cent of inidual judicial reviews succeed. But they can take comfort in the classic  judicial review when planning permission for wind turbines was challenged because they were in the flight path of ospreys nesting hundreds of miles away! Lord Hope ruled that while no inidual with land interests had objected to the turbines, the “natural environment” is everyone’s interest. He memorably pronounced: “The osprey has no means of protecting itself. If its interests are to be protected, someone needs speak on its behalf”. Prestwick’s Golf Club’s members are scattered across the county, the country and the world. Not a single one of them has inidual land interests affected by the proposed development. But the  Tom Morris designed links - its fairways, dunes, greens, unique location, backcloth, traditions and history - cannot protect itself. In the spirit of Lord Hope’s ruling, its members are “speaking on its behalf”. And I say good luck to them. As I also said, their chances on paper are slim. Butit hits the Court of Session, and the man in the big seat has a Royal and Ancient tie under his robe – or bits of Muirfield on the golf shoes in the boot of his Jag - well . . . you just never know! Prestwick’s members are no fools either – they hope their legal move will get everyone back around the table for complete rethink on the scale of McCarthy and Stone’s plans. The builder will no doubt deny any adverse reflection on Prestwick – but you can bet the proximity of the historic links will be in the first paragraph in any of their sales brochures! McCarthy and Stone made a pound million profit in . Their average UK apartment price is almost pound, - and they’re planning  of them at Prestwick . . . that’s pound. million. With those numbers at stake – McCarthy and Stone will be putting all kinds of pressure on South Ayrshire Council not to cave in. Prestwick Golf Club doesn’t have a problem with the site being developed – but rightly ask that any development be appropriate in design and scale to its noble and historic surroundings. And that’s something McCarthy and Stone can easily afford. Prestwick Golf Club is a legendary place for winners.

This is when you learn your people skills.

It’s the tipple sought after and enjoyed by millions across the globe but made closer to home than you think – in the heart of Girvan. And it’s at the newly developed multi-million pound Hendrick’s Gin Palace where the magic and wonder begins. The most signicant development since launch in , Hendrick’s Gin has been impressively expanded to meet the global demand for the ever popular drink. William Grant  Sons, the family owned independent global spirts company, has invested pound million in the glorious expansion, adding six new distillers to work under Hendrick’s Master Distiller, Lesley Gracie’s watchful eye. Innovation has always been in the brand’s DNA, echoing the ethos of Lewis Carroll who cried “curiouser and curiouser”. And it’s this spirit of invention and Alice in Wonderland-esque manner that carries through to the custom-designed complex which is encased in an enchanted walled garden, leading to a magnicent “Victorian inspired” palm house.  Surrounded by two botanical hot houses, the palm house is used to “cultivate unusual botanicals and flora from around the world”. An inner sanctum that is Lesley’s laboratory features a “curious flavour library, a lecture theatre that encourages scholarly learnings and a suitably stylish bar”. And, of course, there are two stunning new still houses. The Hendrick’s family of stills now stands at a proud six – four Bennett stills including the original antique copper pot from  and three precise replicas. The Bennett stills were handcrafted by local manufacturers Carrick Engineering and construction of the distillery was all done by local contractors and builders helping to capture the home of Hendrick’s gin right down to the foundations. The three replica stills are guarded and overlooked by a stunning stained glass ceiling – perhaps spied by Alice herself as she keeked through the looking glass. Master distiller Lesley continues that sense of wonder with every drop she makes.  Lesley said: “I’ve been distilling Hendrick’s for almost  years and during that time, my team and I have had the opportunity to explore and experiment on a small scale. “However, I’m thrilled and excited to take full advantage of our wonderful new distillery and begin working on a line of experimental liquids, some of which will hopefully blossom into future releases and potential new expressions of Hendrick’s.” Pamela Selby, the Global Brand Director for Hendrick’s added: “The Hendrick’s Gin Palace in its design and experience, is intended to inspire curiosity, open minds and serve as a  for invention. “It pulls back the curtain on the wondrous production method and showcases the many layers of Hendrick’s that it has become celebrated for, some humorous, others curiously intellectual, detailed and deeply meaningful. “It represents the confidence we have in the brand that helped to kick-start the ginaissance and leading role it has played ever since.” And with no end in sight for the beloved ginaissance – long may it live. At Alice in Wonderland’s top table it’s time for tea, but at the glorious Hendrick’s Palace it’s always gin o’clock.

RoundThe Pupils never really got going in this cup-tie, ending the game as second best to a moderately talented visiting side.Kinross were fortunate to be confronted by a uncharacteristically tame performance from the McFadyen sponsored home favourites.Lacking the key elements of drive, determination and quick controlled possession, the home side, playing with a threadbare squad due to injury and call-offs  used the long ball far too often in the first half.During the first twenty minutes the Pupils had territorial advantage, but were never able to string enough passes together to make a telling impact on the game.With the visitors hardly an attacking force, the home crowd was shocked when Kinross unexpectedly grabbed the lead shortly before half time.It’s ironic given that the Pupils back four seemed to be on top of their game, that one mistake should prove so costly.There seemed little danger, but the ball was lost in a crucial area and turned across goal for the incoming forward to score with the visitor’s only shot of the whole first half.The second half began disastrously for the home side, a through ball exposing the last line of defence whose first real action was to pick the ball out of the net.Given what went before, it was unimaginable that the Pupils were two goals behind at this stage the visitor’s ‘smash and grab’ tactics a complete contradiction to their earlier failure to attack.With the confidence of an unexpected but comfortable two goal cushion, the Fe League side turned the screw by controlling possession from the back.Mistakes had cost the home side dear, and, for the first time in the match the visitors looked like a team heading for the next round of the Scottish Cup!The home side tried desperately to retrieve the situation, but gaps appeared at the back as they threw caution to the wind.The keeper, young Alastair Ferguson, saved the day by fisting clear inside the six yard box, a timely intervention which kept the Pupils in the game at a crucial stage.Almost immediately, the home side were awarded a penalty kick on the back of a wild challenge in the box, and Gary Grumoli drove the ball into the net.Sensing blood, the Pupils powered forward at last using the ball to good effect with some fine possession football.However, it proved a  dawn and only a prequel to another defensive mistake which resulted in the visitor’s restoring their two goal cushion via a poacher’s finish from point blank range.In a breathtaking finish, the Pupils gained a second penalty with minutes remaining however, resisting the urge to change the kicker, Gary Grumoli placed his second effort to the keeper’s opposite side, only to see his kick saved dramatically.It was the final act of an uninspiring, but ultimately exciting game.The Pupils will try to put the cup disappointment behind them when they travel to play old foes, Hillington, in a league fixture tomorrow.Ellis Robertson played a solid game in the centre. _cpupilsvkinrossRyan

My wee daughter wanted to have an ldquoapple shower and so we stood under the trees. The mere touch of a branch resulted in a cascade of fruit. It was a wonderful ritual of autumn and I loved my kidsrsquo joy in it all, but within me there was a nagging feeling. As Irsquove got older, the oncoming of winter has had a depressive effect on me.Is it a process that affects us more as we get older, with each autumn marking the slow closing of yet another year To be sure, autumn is a beautul time of year and many people tell me it is their favourite season. I can understand that. The woods are magical, the sunsets seem more spectacular than at other times and itrsquos a time of harvest and forage. Our house is full of conkers, apples and colourful leaves collected on walks.Another part of the magic is the migrating birds. I heard the geese above me the other day, honking and flying in formation as they headed for Aberlady. They arrive at this time of year with winter on their tails. The assembly of pink-footed geese there at this time of year is a truly spectacular sight and sound. Tens of thousands of them gather at Aberlady Bay during their migration south.It almost has the atmosphere of an airport countless numbers of honking birds arriving from Iceland and Greenland, joining an already crowded bay. There are thousands of excited geese mingling together, sharing flight stories and looking forward to the next stage of their journey. Many feed in nearby fields before taking off once again to venture further south.As they fly over us their honking sounds like cackling witches. I often hear them when in the woods, as I did the other day. I looked up to see them through the branches of balding autumn trees, flying in their characteristic V flight formations. It seemed their honking was warning me of something: ldquoWinter is cominghellipwinter is coming.Some people of course follow the example of the geese and head for a kinder climate as winter approaches. But for most of us itrsquos a case of ritual and preparation. Hallowersquoen, really a later development of the Celtic Samhain festival, is one such ritual.But for me now, despite my love of autumnrsquos display, it cloaks my senses with a sense of melancholy which I find increasingly dficult to throw off.I spend as much time outdoors as possible in the other seasons but the darkness of winter forces me to retreat into my home. Hence we will soon be decorating our wee house with cosy and colourful lights to ward off winterrsquos dark blanket. But this dark blanket can cover our emotions as well, not so easily warded off.Many people I know likewise dread winter because of its depressive effect on their mental health. They wish that, like the geese, they could find a way of escaping the worst of it. I have often wished I was a bear who could hibernate away the winter months.But we are not bears or geese, and in my own battles with the oncoming of winter I have come to understand more than ever the importance of social connections and preparing for them. The truth is winter can be a time of flowering and rebirth, just like spring but in a dferent way ndash the flowering of friendship and rebirth of social connections perhaps lost or waned in the flurry of summer activities.In the past it was so self-evident. People huddled in each otherrsquos homes around the fire, keeping each other company. Like so many things these traditions have now been commercialised, yet the simple antidote of social connection in the approaching dark times remains as powerful as it ever was for us.It should be a time for visiting and getting together making time for friends and coming together in defiance of the darkness. And thinking especially of those for whom the cold and dark becomes an enforcer of confinement because of age or vulnerability.Winter should be a time of visiting and welcoming. This, I think, is an antidote to that depressive winter effect. Maybe thatrsquos why the geese honk so much.

The use of recycling boxes rather than bins and the introduction of food waste caddies has helped the county produce high-quality waste with fewer contaminants, meaning less has to be sent for treatment.Now Mr Reid wants to bring a similar approach to travel in the county as East Lothian prepares for an influx of new residents due to a plethora of new housing developments.And he revealed talks were under way to try and replace the councilrsquos refuse collection vehicles with electric versions as it looks to lead by example.He said: ldquoThe public bought into recycling because we gave them options such as the food waste bins and also because they knew it was the right thing to do.ldquoActive travel will be an evolution but we need to give people access to it. We need to provide cycle paths and safe walkways we need train services to be on time. If we can develop plans to provide these services then people will automatically select not to take the car, just as they will select electric vehicles as they become cheaper too.ldquoIt is about getting the message out and empowering people to be able to do it.The introduction of electric bin lorries would be a huge step towards improving the environment and changing public perception.Some such lorries are being trialled in England by waste recycling firms, with one company in Sheffield introducing two vehicles which are powered by burning non-recyclable rubbish as they collect it. Others are being tested using rechargeable lithium-ion batteries.An East Lothian Council spokesperson said: ldquoWe are actively working with partners to deliver one of the first fully electric refuse

Mr Mundell is not a member of Mrs Mayrsquos inner team.At the EU summit on Thursday, Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission President, said a transition period extension would afford both sides more time to agree a trade deal and so avoid a backstop he added it \"probably will happen\".When the Scottish Secretary got wind of this possibility, he telephoned Downing Street and spoke to a top official, making clear his deep concern.A source close to Mr Mundell insisted there was no threat of resignation and suggestions to this effect were being ldquoovercooked, noting how there was at present no clarity about an extension. ldquoIts just an idea that has not been fleshed out,\" he said.However, one MP said there was deep alarm among Scottish Conservatives.ldquoThis is a red line for us, he declared. ldquoIf fishing were included in the extension period ndash and Brussels would want it to be - there is absolutely no way we could support it. It would mean us voting against the Government and David Mundell would probably resign.The backbencher said the Government had to know the  Scottish Conservative MPs were ldquowilling to flex their muscleswe are pushed into a corner.He added: ldquoFishing is a totemic issue in Scotland and I can see myself going through the lobbies against the Governmentneed be which is not something I ever thought I would hear myself say.Another Scottish Tory MP was equally adamant that he too would vote against the Governmentfishing were not exempted from a transition extension. ldquoYes, I would. I have already told the whips. All  of us feel the same way. I donrsquot know of any colleague who would not hold the line on this.A third MP pointed out how the Government had initially given its word that the UK would take back control of its fishing waters from December  but then it was pushed back to December  due to the transition period any further extension to December  would cost the party seats in Scotland. ldquoPeople would rightly feel betrayed by such a move, he declared.Simon Collins of the Shetland Fishermenrsquos Association made a similar point, saying the industry should ldquonot be let down again as it was under the s Heath Government and that the UK Government had given it a ldquocast-iron guarantee that Britain would become an independent coastal state on Brexit Day and leave the EUrsquos Common Fisheries Policy.ldquoIn March this year, we were told there is going to be an implementation period and yoursquore stuck shadowing the CFP until the end of .

We have today written history.ldquoWe have sent the most complex stack of spacecraft that ever have been conceived into space, and to a very long journey to an environment which is truly out of the Earth truly out of this world.The Mercury Transfer Module , carrying the orbiters, was built in Stevenage by the Defence and Space ision of aerospace company Airbus.Key elements of ESAs Mercury Planet Orbiter were also assembled by Airbus in the UK.Scientists hope the pound. billion mission will unravel some of Mercuryrsquos many mysteries, such as the reason for its oversized iron core, its spectacular volcanic vents, and tantalising hints of water ice in shadowy parts of the scorching hot planet.The answers they get will shed new light on the origins and evolution of the solar system.A key feature of BepiColombo is that it is the first interplanetary mission to employ advanced electric ion propulsion technology.Four Star Trek-style ldquoimpulse engines, two firing at a time, will emit beams of electrically charged, or ldquoionised, xenon gas.After years of planning, training and simulations, here is the moment that #BepiColombo## left Earth#on its mission to explore #Mercury#https:t.co jpXUiQRgUl pic nzStdPcmdash ESA OperationsOctober , They will be used not to accelerate the craft but to act as a brake against the sunrsquos enormous gravity.A series of fly-bys past the Earth, Venus, and Mercury will also help to reduce BepiColomborsquos velocity by km per second.At top speed after launch, the spacecraft will be moving at kmper second.One of the biggest challenges for mission planners was ensuring the spacecraft could withstand searing temperatures of more than C so close to the sun.Protective measures include a heat shield, novel ceramic and titanium insulation, ammonia-filled ldquoheat pipes, and in the case of the Japanese orbiter, ldquoroast-on-a-spit spinning.A suite of  instruments on the MPO will map the surface of Mercury and probe its chemical composition for up to two years.FIRST SIGNAL RECEIVED# from #BepiColombo##, detected by @ESAs antenna at #NewNorcia, Australia#.With these first words#, engineers at #ESOC# can monitor the status  execution of the autonomous activities onboard the spacecraft pic JkYppgAOCmdash ESA OperationsOctober , Meanwhile, the Japanese space agency Jaxarsquos Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiterrsquos five instruments will focus on the planetrsquos unusual lopsided magnetic field.One of BepiColomborsquos main instruments, the Mercury Imaging X-ray Spectrometer , was designed and built at the University of Leicester.The ion thrusters were supplied by the UK defence technology company QinetiQ.Only two spacecraft have previously visited Mercury.

Now we have to see what happens in the future, but I am optimistic.Around  minutes after the launch came confirmation that BepiColombo had separated from the last stage of the Ariane  rocket.Then came the news that the  metre wide solar  had deployed successfully, which was a critical early point of the mission."},{"url":null,"title":"uk-us-cyber-accord-to-be-announced-by-defence-secretary","story":"Gavin Williamson is expected to reveal the agreement during a Trafalgar Night dinner onboard HMS Queen Elizabeth, which is currently anchored two miles from Manhattan in New York.During his speech on Saturday, he will also reveal that the new Atlantic Future Forum will take place on Monday, bringing US and UK industry and military together amid the changing face of warfare, and fight against cyber threats.ldquoSome believe it is not the place for our armed forces to operate outside deployed conflict zones many thousands of miles from the UK mainland, he will say.ldquoThey are wrong.

Well of course we didnrsquot know what we were voting for, as Britain had never previously conducted a vote on whether or not to remain in the EU. Andyou insist that those who voted to leave the EU were largely ignorant about the consequences and ramications of Brexit then the same could also be said for many who voted to Remain.How easily many Remainers choose to overlook the behaviour of the EU in bending Greece to its will, encouraged by German banks who expressed disgust at the profligacy and corruption they claimed led that country into financial distress. These same banks have since made euro. billion in interest payments on Greek bonds since . The German governmentrsquos own figures showed that Germany made euro.bn in interest payments on these bonds ndash purchased in a deal to keep the Greek economy afloat ndash while paying Greece less than eurobn. There are benefits to be had from being in the EU but, as ever, some benefit more than others.Some Remainers also become haughty when citing their reasons for holding a second referendum. In this they can barely conceal their liberal disdain for those of their fellows who unconscionably voted to leave. They portray them as a bunch of ignorant, racist and ill-educated northerners who were incapable of understanding the consequences of Brexit. Their barely-concealed glee at every presentiment of evil that may yet afflict those northern communities has been sickening.Yet, like their manufactured concerns for the future of Ireland Irsquove rarely heard any of the metropolitan elites previously profess to be overly-vexed by the challenges faced by working-class communities in Englandrsquos north-west or north-east. Where were they when the fishing fleets on Humberside disappeared, sacriced to enable the US to spy on Soviet submarines from the Icelandic coast  And beyond some hand-wringing and anti-Thatcher sloganising what did they actually do when the mines all shut and the car factories fell silent  Each time I see Gordon Brown wade into Brexit on his white charger I can still hear him say: ldquoBritish jobs for British workers. You also contributed to this, big man.Nothing wersquove seen in the British political and social landscape makes me think that a second EU referendum would bring a dferent result from the first one. The social problems encountered by Englandrsquos most disadvantaged communities are profound and figured massively in their reasons for choosing to exit the EU. These problems remain deep-rooted and those who think their reasons for voting Leave were forged solely on the big, fat NHS lie on the side of Boris Johnsonrsquos battle-buses are deluding themselves. And anyway,wersquore seriously talking about re-running the EU referendum on the claim that the idiot punters were fed myths and lies then letrsquos also have a look at every General Election held in the UK since the dawn of universal suffrage.Irsquom aware too that those of us who seek a second referendum on Scottish independence are on shaky ground here. Many of the reasons put forward for rejecting a second EU referendum might, with some justication, also apply to the prospect of a second Scottish one. And, having previously stated some obvious flaws in the arguments of recalcitrant Remainers Irsquoll refrain from pointing out the response which immediately comes to mind when Nicola Sturgeon talks about the craziness of leaving the worldrsquos most successful and robust trading confederation. Yet, there are some obvious dferences too which arguably justy a second independence referendum and a mandate too.Since September,  there have been three General Elections on either side of the Border: one for Holyrood and two for Westminster. In addition there has been a local government election. In Scotland the SNP, the only party campaigning for a second referendum, has triumphed in each of these elections comfortably. Four years on from the first referendum on Scottish independence there remains a pro-Yes majority at Holyrood. These alone constitute a mandate in anyonersquos language.Equally, there can be little doubt that the social and political terrain of the UK, as it affects Scottish citizens, has changed materially and that these changes have been profound and dramatic. As such, these take us well beyond any questions about not respecting the democratic vote of the first independence referendum. Wersquore not talking about seeking a second vote for fear of what might happen as a result of the first one but because of what actually has happened. The vote to leave the EU could stand alone here in justying a second independence referendum simply because two-thirds of Scots voted to remain.The most profound reason, though, has been evident for some time and will become critically so following Brexit, no matter what sort of deal is reached with the EU. While England has been in convulsions for a decade over the amount of migrants coming through its borders Scottish governments since  have been united behind one policy: we want them the more the merrier and we need to find ways of attracting them and persuading them to stay. They donrsquot need to earn poundk-a-year for the privilege and they wonrsquot need to know through which eye Harold had his brain skewered in . We need them because our population is ageing and there arenrsquot enough Scots paying enough to fund their care. When free movement of EU citizens stops post-Brexit the nation which voted overwhelmingly to permit will be worst affected by it.Unlike a second EU vote the second independence referendum will not be a choice between mere predicted scenarios. Instead it will determinewe wish to remain in a Union which has already changed dramatically.        name : ballot,target: ballot_,params:.push"},{"url":null,"title":"artificial-intelligence-could-help-create-more-specific-alzheimers-treatment","story":"Medics have devised a new algorithm that can automatically spot dferent patterns of progression in patients suffering from a range of dementias, including Alzheimerrsquos disease.The algorithm, called Subtype and Stage Inference ndash or SuStaIn, uses medical images to show doctors what stage the disease has reached and identy whether patients will respond better to certain treatments.Researchers said the algorithm was able to identy three separate subtypes of Alzheimerrsquos disease from MRI scans of people with dementia, and said this ldquosubtyping would be possible very early in the disease process.The ability to identy the subtypes early on in the disease process and using non-invasive MRI scanning means there is a better chance of identying the best treatment for iniduals, scientists said.ldquoOne key reason for the failure of drug trials in Alzheimerrsquos disease is the broad mixture of very dferent patients they test a treatment with a strong effect on a particular subgroup of patients may show no overall effect on the full population so fail the drug trial, said Professor Daniel Alexander at the UCL Centre for Medical Image Computing.ldquoThis new algorithm has the unique ability to reveal groups of patients with dferent iants of disease.Professor Jonathan Schott, from the UCL Institute of Neurology, said understanding how dferent diseases evolve over time is ldquocritical for the design of treatments and providing information to patients about their prognosis.ldquoThis is a major challenge for diseases that evolve over years,not decades, and where there may be substantial dferences in the underlying pathology, and pattern and rates of progression between patients, Professor Scott said.ldquoThis work shows that it is possible to tease out dferent disease patterns ndash some hitherto unknown ndash from single MRI scans taken from patients with a range of dferent dementias.The researchers are now looking for ways to apply the algorithm to other diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.It is believed the algorithm could be used by the NHS within the next few years.

However, that is not the approach adopted by Highland Council.Mrs Ross said: \"Having raised issues with the council regarding their approach to considering equalities and human rights in their budget process, particularly around the closure of public toilets, it was encouraging to hear that many councils around Scotland have placed such an approach at the heart of their budgeting.

However, creating this blueprint for the town will help the council and community work together to achieve as much as we can.”The council is now working to help community groups to find external grant funding to bring forward their ideas.To read the full document and for updates visitwww.yourkirkwall and the Your Kirkwall Facebook and Twitter feeds.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It is a neurological disease which results in changes in animals# mental state, abnormalities of posture and movement and of sensation. The clinical disease usually lasts for several weeks and it is characteristically progressive and fatal.According to The World Organisation for Animal Health statistics very few cases of BSE — fewer than  each year since  — are reported in the UK.Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing said: “Following confirmation of a case of classical BSE in Aberdeenshire, I have activated the Scottish Government’s response plan to protect our valuable farming industry, including establishing a precautionary movement ban being placed on the farm.“While it is important to stress that this is standard procedure until we have a clear understanding of the disease#s origin, this is further proof that our surveillance system for detecting this type of disease is working. Be assured that the Scottish Government and its partners stand ready to respond to any further confirmed cases of the disease in Scotland.”Chief Veterinary Officer Sheila Voas said: “While it is too early to tell where the disease came from in this case, its detection is proof that our surveillance system is doing its job. We are working closely with the Animal and Plant Health Agency to answer this question, and in the meantime, I would urge any farmer who has concerns to immediately seek veterinary advice.Ian McWatt, Director of Operations in Food Standards Scotland said: “There are strict controls in place to protect consumers from the risk of BSE, including controls on animal feed, and removal of the parts of cattle most likely to carry BSE infectivity.“Consumers can be reassured that these important protection measures remain in place and that Food Standards Scotland Official Veterinarians and Meat Hygiene Inspectors working in all abattoirs in Scotland will continue to ensure that in respect of BSE controls, the safety of consumers remains a priority. We will continue to work closely with Scottish Government, other agencies and industry at this time.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

At peak times the queues waiting for a window can stretch back  cars in each direction.Highland Council has now given an update on the worksrsquo progress, and urged the public to plan their journeys carefully to avoid missing one of the windows when the ersion is operating.Cllr Allan Henderson, the chairman of the councilrsquos environment, development and infrastructure committee, said: \"We have worked closely with Network Rail and our contractor to keep disruption to road users to a minimum when the road rail ersion is in place but inevitably there will be times when road users will face longer waits so we urge people to plan their travel carefully.\"Questions and answers about the works have also been published online following public meetings. They are available at www.highland.gov.ukMeanwhile, Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch MSP, Kate Forbes, has called for train services between Strathcarron and Kyle to be suspended during the works to reduce the disruption.

I see a bright future for the town, now things are starting to move forward,\" she said.This was echoed by long-serving Invergordon hairdresser Sharon Mitchell. She agreed more houses were desperately needed but said more shops must follow because the town centre was sorely lacking its yesteryear \"buzz\".\"It used to be thriving here but itrsquos Alness thatrsquos thriving now. If theyrsquore going to be building more houses we need more shops.\"The celebrated land deal cost pound,.The council said this was funded through grants from the Scottish Government.A spokeswoman said no decision had been taken as to the timescale for development or of the mix of tenure for the land, which is identied within the Inner Moray Firth Development Plan as having capacity for  homes,She said it is likely that the development will include housing for mid-market rent and shared equity as well as housing for social rent by the council or Albyn Housing Society.Ms Mitchell, who has been running Sharonrsquos Unisex Hair Studio on King Street for more than  years, said the council should make the homes available for purchase under a LIFT Scheme, known otherwise as a Low-cost Initiative for First Time Buyers.Under this shared equity scheme, of which there are two dferent models, the Scottish Government is this year providing pound million to help people buy a home, within certain price thresholds, for sale on the open market.

Led by Sir Euan Brown and designed by Sir David Chipperfield, the centre will replace the Queen’s Hall as the Scottish Chamber Orchestra’s base and has financial backing from International Festival benefactor Carol Grigor and her Dunard Fund. Dunard is also bank-rolling opposition to the hotel plan for the old Royal High School and is at the heart of the scheme to turn it into a new home for the St Mary’s Music School, also with a public performance hall.Sold as a key component in securing the Edinburgh Festival’s place at the top of the global cultural league, and with an internationally renowned architect on board, Impact’s well-connected team might not have expected to encounter much resistance, but this week The Scotsman revealed the Architectural Heritage Society of Scotland had lodged an objection because the new building will “tower above” Dundas House. “The proposal is too large and too tall for such a restricted plot ... and as such represents an overdevelopment of the site,” said the AHSS submission to the city council. : First look at Edinburgh’s new £m concert hallIf this is bad news for Impact, it’s good news for the new St James Centre whose developer, TH Real Estate , has been making a similar point for some months, arguing that the height of the hall will steal the view of St Andrew Square and George Street which their hotel was expecting to enjoy and was part of the design brief.THRE is also unhappy that large equipment trucks could access the concert hall through the currently pedestrianised Multrees Walk, something which was actually supported by the Edinburgh Design Panel when it met to discuss Impact last year. The alternative, for THRE to provide access through the St James Centre’s underground services entrance, received a predictably cool reception.It now appears that behind-the-scenes negotiations have failed, with St James development chief Martin Perry writing a letter to locals urging them to object. In turn, Impact is now said to be consulting its lawyers about its contents. “It is not proper for their letter to include inaccuracies which may mislead others,” Impact chair, Sir Euan Brown, told The Times. “This is extremely disappointing and we are taking appropriate action.” What those inaccuracies are is unclear, although it’s hard for THRE to argue about the adverse effect of the concert hall’s height on the city skyline when there will be no more dramatic alteration than the golden ribbon walnut whip turd design of the hotel at the heart of St James. But Impact faces its own challenge in arguing that such a massive construction, largely in concrete, is compatible with the surroundings when it has taken over a decade to get rid of the concrete monstrosity which was St Andrew’s House.: Edinburgh’s new concert hall is condemned by critics for being ‘too large and too tall’The Cockburn Association, so often at the heart of opposition to contemporary construction in the World Heritage site, has given its blessing and that means much hangs on the position of Historic Environment Scotland and the World Heritage Trust, whose director Adam Wilkinson has been keeping his head lower down on this issue than his prominent opposition to the Royal High School hotel scheme.At least the AHSS is being consistent in its opposition to both the Royal High hotel and the concert hall, because it’s not dficult to argue that the, well, ‘impact’ on the main High School building and Dundas House from the proposed modern additions is similar. It might be left to the members of the city council’s planning committee, of which I’m one, to decide what happens. As it stands, my mind is entirely open.ltblobgt Before that, this Wednesday my planning colleagues and I must decide whether to grant permission to the Gleneagles club and hotel proposal for the grand old Bank of Scotland office next door to Dundas House. Which means I can’t say anything about it.\u2028Who will empty my bin With some understatement, Edinburgh council’s head of place management, Gareth Barwell, informed councillors this week that changes to the council’s waste service “had been disruptive for many residents”. Those residents who still wonder when their bins will be emptied, as opposed to what it says in the council’s recent letter, might read “disruptive” as “utterly shambolic”. As for the new garden waste system which now costs £ a bin, mine is still outside on the street.SNP-Labour coalition rt deepens by the day\u2028Amidst the chaos, the rt between some Labour councillors and the SNP on Edinburgh council’s coalition administration is becoming deeper by the day, and is being played out publicly through the letters page of the Evening News. Now Cllrs Scott Arthur and Gordon Munro have not only accused colleagues of failing to speak up about Scottish Government funding cuts, but of interpreting opposition to education cuts as open attacks. Tellingly, they quote the council partnership agreement which requires the administration to lobby the Scottish Government to ensure adequate funding for local services and contrast the current leadership’s silence with ex-SNP leader Sandy Howat’s public criticism.This week they and their Labour colleagues face a further dilemma over a Conservative motion to examine options for suspending Primary One testing. Opposition puts them at odds with the national party so for once in this council, the local leadership might actually have to stand up for themselves and publicly reject SNP policy.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4817147.1539938228!/image/image.jpg","title":"leader comment glasgow people s palace closure would be symbol of austerity","story":"If a -year-old promise is broken and Glasgow#s People#s Palace closes, it would be a powerful symbol that austerity is still very much with us, despite Theresa May#s claim the end is in sight.As he opened the People’s Palace in , Lord Rosebery, a former Prime Minister, told a crowd of several thousand assembled on Glasgow Green that it would be “open to the people for ever and ever”, describing the building as “a palace of pleasure and imagination around which the people may place their affections and which may give them a home on which their memory may rest”.It may have survived two World Wars, economic recessions and a decade of austerity, but Rosebery’s optimistic pledge could be about to be broken. The adjoining Winter Gardens glasshouse needs multi-million-pound repairs and is to close indefinitely at the end of this year. A knock-on effect may also be the closure of the palace, although Glasgow City Council still hopes to prevent this.: Glasgow’s People’s Palace and Winter Gardens to close ‘indefinitely’Councillors all over Scotland will sympathise, given the pressures they have been under in recent years.Local authority spending on frontline services like school support, children’s services, rubbish disposal and social care has fallen by nearly £ million over the past five years – a . per cent cut that has been contrasted with the . per cent reduction in the Scottish Government’s revenue budget. The figures prompted local government body Cosla to complain in May that councils had “suffered the brunt of cuts” and had “no room left to manoeuvre in terms of budgets”.The Scottish Government, meanwhile, has sought to leave such complaints at the door of Theresa May according to Bute House, this is Tory, not SNP, austerity.For her part, the Prime Minister recently made an even more optimistic pledge than her predecessor, declaring the end of austerity was within our grasp –only the right Brexit deal could be struck.However, the closure of the People’s Palace would be a powerful symbol that our economic woes are very much still with us and that it is the “people” who continue to pay the highest price. The museum is famously home to Sir Billy Connolly’s ‘big banana boots’, but it also details the lives of everyday working-class Scots. One of its highlights is the Single End display, showing a typical single-roomed house of the s, where a family would eat, sleep, cook and wash. It acts as a reminder that austerity today is still an improvement on the past, but also a warning of how much worse le can be.

No such information exists on the website.Mr Collins said: “While debate on one of the central issues facing our country is part of a thriving democracy, there is an important question of where campaigning stops and political advertising starts.“Facebook has recently announced a set of changes to increase transparency around political advertising on its .“This example offers Facebook an opportunity to show it is committed to making that change happen -you are targeted with a message or asked to lobby your MP, you should know exactly who is behind the organisation asking you to do it.”Rob Leathern, director of product management at Facebook, said: “On November , all advertisers will have new requirements before they can place political ads in the UK, including Mainstream Network.“These advertisers will need to confirm their identity and location through an authorisations process and accurately represent the organisation or person paying for the ad in a disclaimer.“These steps must happen or the advertiser will be prevented from running ads related to politics on Facebook.

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the th anniversary of the Milne Cup.Sadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.Many supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.While it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.But despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The - scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.Molloy’s introduction  minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubtanyone  in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.But the damage had been done in the first half – at - down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.Some have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.I felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.Two years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a - defeat in Kirkwall.There is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s th birthday.It’s just a pity we have to wait a whole  months until a chance of revenge.: : : : : : : :A couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.There are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.A score of - was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.The Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.A few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.I would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.: : : : : : : :Orkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening#s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John CouttsThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over  guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.Unfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.The speeches which followed,anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.It was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.Sinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous  game when he hit the back of the net five times in the - victory.: : : : : : : :And finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.On Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.Helped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.Robert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did -odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.The others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.The final score was a - win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate - football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"big turnout to welcome the eighth serene to whalsay ","story":"The latest Serene arrives at the pier at Symbister.

Given these turbines will be placed on high ground, to suggest they will dominate the landscape is an understatement # just what the tourists come to Shetland to see.As long as they#re not in Bressay or Sandness.Only one and a half times the size of big ben# just little things# pfffffff.Absolutely ridiculous!I’ve seen wind turbines with these extra large blades between Stirling and Edinburgh. They are enormous and look awful.Worth recalling that the perceived size of the blade sweepincreases as the square of the radiuse.g. increasing the bladeby . times doubles the perceived size of the blade sweep, or, increasing bladeby % increases perceived size by %John, the longer blades will increase the electrical power that each turbine can generate, giving VE more revenue.That’s as may be, but revenue does not equal profit, and by the time the unsustainable level of subsidy has been removed, the SCT have been suckered in to paying for the export cable, and SSE have ensured their pound of flesh is as great as they can get away with,Shetland will never see its money back.More of nothing is still only nothing.If they are increasing the height of the turbines,does this mean that they would need to increase the size and depth of the anchor points at what extra cost and who will pay Presumably, these are the latest models with towers and foundations redesigned, accordingly The changes should improve cost-effectiveness and presumably, VE’s intention is to improve competitiveness for the auction, which requires cutting costs to the bone and squeezing every last drop of revenue from the project to keep it viable.Given that the last round of auctions produced winning ‘strike prices’ of £. MWh, exactly half what VE insisted they needed for viability , it makes you wonder, would winning an auction capture their fabled “pot of gold at Rainbow’s End” or would it be merely a poisoned chalice that provides little or no# or worse# William, the size and cost of the foundations must be increased to accommodate more powerful wind turbines.Larger Turbines require loads more concrete poured into the blanket bog all previous calculations EIA are out the window.If turbine technology has #advanced considerably# why can#t they make them smaller, considerably The “technology advance” is to produce turbines with increased electrical capacity, requiring longer blades and larger fondations. The thought is that one MW turbine will cost less to install, own, and maintain than two MW turbines.Mr Innes, Project Director for Viking Energy, is quoted where as saying #Viking is now competing against a new generation of wind farms, including those offshore, where tip heights of m or more are now available.#In that case why doesn#t he just put these turbines offshore as well.Kay. Just a thought.Aircraft technology has advanced too and ‘planes get bigger and bigger. I suspect that miniaturisation , so beloved of the Japanese, whose watches, cameras , radios and a host of other products lead one to believe that for items to improve in performance , they need to get smaller. True in many instances but not all. That said, Japanese wind driven turbines might solve a few problems.A point of interest regarding Japan andCO free energy . Japan is planning on using nuclear, not wind power, as a major source of electricity production. One may understand that Japan has greater first-hand knowledge of nuclear atomic contamination than any other country on Earth having being subjected two atomic bombs and the Fukushima accident. Using that real information on real nuclear contamination, not the Green lunacy crank disinformation, so prevalent in Scotland. Japan has a knowledge-led, intelligent energy policy. As ofMay , there are  operable reactors in Japan. Of these, nine reactors in  power plants Additionally, five reactors have been approved for a start, and further  have start applications under review. It never ceases to amaze me how ignorance and fear shape energy policy. Japan is fully aware of the risks of nuclear I reference “the Liberal Democratic Party cabinet in April , calls nuclear power #the country#s most important power source#.[Japan is now aiming for #a realistic and balanced energy structure#. The Japanese Government targets for wind power deployment are set at only .% of electricity production by  . That is a total figure, onshore and offshore.What a huge shame The Scottish Government is unwilling to do the same, it would save our countryside from so much uglly devastation. Why #..Well you don`t need a rocket scientist to figure that one out.Ifthis horrendous project does go ahead it`ll be past its sell by the time it is finished and will be made obsolete by newer, more efficient and cleaner technology.When is the plug going to be pulled on this nonsense before any more money is lost to it If Viking want to increase the turbine size, it is not unreasonable to anticipate that the other windfarm developers will do the same.The floodgates are being opened and, instead of being a world-class destination for wildle  scenery, Shetland will become a world-class example of crass development without regard to the obvious damage to environment, health and wellbeing, not to mention income from tourism.Renewable energy should be pursued, but in Shetland’s case the cost of the VE project has already been far higher – in every sense – than the imagined benefits.I maybe wrong, but wind farm technology appears to be the cheapest form of producing electricityin regard to other alternative sources of producing electricity.I am pretty sure wave and tidal energy could also be tapped into within Shetland, but economics seem to be based on the cheapest alternative compared to wave or tidal resources being the better, possibly, and signicantly less intrusive than the massive wind turbines scaring the Shetland landscape and more than likely tourists remembering the islands not for its beauty but#.well, it is self explanatory.The potential economic damage caused by the wind turbines I am pretty sure would outweigh any positive contribution the islands may have in regard to tourism or other positive attributes the islands may have.Time, no doubt, will be the final answer#.. watch this space, as they say.David. Just to be a bit more optimistic about wind farms , there is every likelihood that visitors to Shetland will already be familiar with rotating blades .It is a fast growing energy generation procedure so would not come as a shock.The other thing is ,such equipment would almost certainly not be visible from all corners of Shetland.People would get used to them just as they are used to the island hopping planes.It’s a bit unfortunate that severe condemnation is a reactionto newish ideas and inventions.I take onboard your points, Haydn, but I think what is putting people off the VEP, is the shear cost of what it could possibly be. I have heard a figure not far short of kicking on the door of £. Billion, and possibly more, and how many decades would this take to bring VEP into the black in terms of revenue One should also look into the potential running and maintenance costs per year for such a project  Would the revenue created be enough to off-set such costs or would VE require more funding from the SCT, to balance its books It seems very evident, the more information people in Shetland know about VEP, the more people are put off the whole idea in terms of economics and what little benefit the islands may reap from it  I have heard a figure of around £ million a year###.poor investmentthe projected costs are to be believed. Aof around. of % does not bode well.I have to take issue with you here Haydn, The proposed VE turbines will now be meres high and constructed on hills. The high point some meters plus above sea level. That would be the line of sight from sea level of about  miles. Precious little of Shetland would not see the VE turbines!! I note you claim #that severe condemnation is a reactionto newish ideas and inventions#. I would respectfully point out wind turbines are hardly a new idea! Many consider them at the point of being an obsolete technologyNow for cutting-edge ideas, look to tidal generation and modular nuclear reactors. The latter , I believe you are openly condemning, something about us all glowing in the dark was your comment!!! Now that was Scaremongering nonsense. Rosatom,Russias vehicle for nuclear expansion,has about % of new nuclear plant contracts in the bag,mainly in emerging and third world countries .If Chernobyl is anything to go by and what Russia the culprit did in rectyingthe mess,novichok is going to be a piddle in the ocean in comparison.Read an article this morning.Wish I could remember which paper that said Germany#s  year old wind turbines are coming to the end of their usefulness and no longer qualy for subsidies. No recycling as the blades are made from fibre glass.Their plan is to dump them on third world nations so creating more waste rather than cleaning the mess up themselves. Viking energy should sit up and take not it but will have cloth ears when it comes to profit. Remember, as you sow,so shall ye reap.Germany, by nature of its fragmented political system with government by weak coalitions only resulted in the Green Partyexercising much influence beyond their electoral mandate. Nuclear power was cut back as a political gesture to the Greens, that had nothing to do with the science of the matter. The result was a massive increase in coal-fired electrical generation and also the importation of Natural Gas. Germany is now the worlds largest importer of Natural Gas! and the German motor industries disingenuous diesel emission data is almost legendary!!!.Deaths from atmospheric pollution in Germany are massive and this year the EU is taking Germany to court for breaking all EU guidelines. It is indeed very ironic that the Scotish Government does so much to praise the use of Wind power and exploit all its rural communities to that end while it does all in its ability to expandGas Exportation from the North Sea,. It likewise imports Gasto Grangemouth and at all times try and use North Sea oil revenue to promote Nationalist agendas. The logic escapes me, perhaps you could explain Grahm,!!!Billy , I understand where you are coming from when stating that  year old turbines in Germany are coming to the end of their lives , but is this surprising   Since technological advances in vast areas of activity are so rapid it would be most unlikely for things to suddenly stand still.Try selling a  year old car , TV. washing machine ,vacuum cleaner , racing bike etc etc. Virtually worthless . Fighter ‘planes cost £millions EACH so should we have stuck with the Tiger Moth to save money   Times change continuously.No doubt some would like the world to stop to enable them to get off so that they could abandon their mortgage and live in a cave in a cosy corner of the Moon. All very whimsical but I’m sure you get the drt.Interesting comment Haydn. I am unable to find any substantive advance in Wind Turbines as technology over the last  years. They are larger yes, but no less polluting and even more damaging to the environment. The most recent research would indicate that disturbance in airflow patterns and friction around the rotating blades not only creates more noise pollution but results in substantive heat creation. That heat creation in itself would and does contribute to global warming new research has shown. Reference #Hard University’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences# would indicate wind power in theU.S. with wind alone would warm the planet a quarter-degree Celsius! If this research is proved correct, we will be decommissioning and scrapping wind turbines far sooner than the protagonist advocate. There are already far better ways of generating clean electricity than  meter high turbines, sadly too many have staked their reputations on the wind myth and will resist accepting they have been wrongFair enough Ian. I must confess that I was unaware of the likely height of the proposed turbine blades.I’m not so sure about Japan and others having a reducing intention to set up more turbines though. As for the comment I made about nuclear radiation causing people to glow in the dark —— you surely cannot be serious !!!!That was no more than a figure of speech.I hope you are merely poking fun at such a prospect.I know that glow worms emit light as do other creatures in the sea but it’s silly to think that the effects on iniduals who have been subjected to radiation for medical reasons would then walk about looking like Beacons.Give me a break Ian!Ian.—- Your comments on October th at -.Plenty of food for thought in your missive .Thanks.It is a balance between providing energy safely and economically, but our conventional methods of using fossil fuels has brought to the fore due to the impact such energy has had on the environment.However, whilst we are being side-tracked about the impact of fossil fuels, nobody has every mentioned the impact on the planet caused by agriculture. Agriculture, I believe, causes  times more green house gases than all of transportation put together Not only does agriculture produce more green houses gases than transportation, it is the greatest cause of environmental destruction than any other industry. As our population grows, this will become more evident, as we see species upon species being put on the # endangered species list # or # become extinct #. This man-made catastrophe will impact on other species and it will eventually impact the very existence of humans on the planet as nature takes revenge through disease, drought and other natural impacts.Progress in providing alternative energy may be a positive start, but at what price will this be to the planet and le,this progress is purely based on the man-made concept of monetary value and this of profit David Spence, the single most signicant threats to humanity are overpopulation and our leaders, scientic, religious and political leader#s, utter cowardice to dare to mention such an undeniable fact. World population is set to double in  years. Energy needs, food supply, pollution are all driven by human population density. It makes no odds how many windmills we build whatever their size! Atmospheric pollution, global warming or starvation awaits and will kill all our children#s children as long as human overbreeding continues. It is hard to take the Greens cranks, politicians and doom-mongers of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change seriously when their reports fail to state, or take into account the blindingly obvious.David. Your warning shots make me feel that I should grabfew bottles of whisky 🥃 go back to bed and snooze my way through the day even though there’s a hot Indian summer outside.!!Seriously , weare facing a dire situation which will impact on my grandsons far more than on me —— or you. When you say ‘Agriculture’ I’m assuming that you are including livestock.The greenhouse gas emissions from the planet’s animal le must be enormous and that’s whether or not they are raised for their meat .Also, to take your point, such vast amounts of money are tied into food production , it’s hard to seeany measures at all, however well intentioned, , will enable us to eradicate the decline of le in its widest sense.Time to grab that whisky bottle I think 🤔. Cheers.Is there going to be a remake of #Dad#s Army#  Only, a number of contributors seem to be vying for the part of Private Fraser: #Wur do-oO-MM-ED!# LOL 🙂# You stupid Boy, Pike##.sorry, John # lolI take your points Haydn and Ian, but according to predicted human population expansion, it is estimated the global population will be around  billion by the year  Other dynamics affecting population growth, as you know, is requiring more land not only for agriculture but for accommodation and expanded space for for other amenities related.Not doubt, I think, there may come a critical point where demand for the expansion of the population, not including technological advancement, will determine how we live and finding a balance between our own demands to this of the natural world and other le The driving force for this expansion is predominantly based on economics and technological advances, and as long as this is the precedent, this could bring into conflict what we want and what nature will will allow In the food chain, I suspect we will become more use to # processed food # as technological progress will find better ways of growing alternative foods, whether biologically or chemically, as an answer to keep a balance between our demands and this of a coexisting relationship with the natural laws which govern le itself, including humans.You are quite right John, there are people who seem to be dominating these columns and I fear that I am a guilty one —— as well as the others.Perhaps I should take a break and ease off.The trouble is, there are interesting and important problems out there which should be aired rather than be allowed to fester.Maybe a bit more humour would help to make the rough stuff a little more palatable.So, step forward anyone of a Dad’s Army disposition !! How about you John  Sadly my sense of humour is a little lacking here! £ million plus SCT funds gone.  meter high windmills on s of tons of concrete bases all over Shetland. All of this for what  The delusional idea that such a project will save the planet. VE is and always has been a money making project under the guise of the #Green Idyle#. The advocates being the usual shetland suspects, utterly unqualied in scientic justication and reason, highly qualied in political posturing and self-interest. No, there is nothing here of humour. I do believe we are rapidly destroying our planet bitthe findings of# The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change# are valid, windmills on Shetland are an irrelevancy, which will only increase our problems. Their construction will release vast quantities of CO their verywill warm the air around them. It goes a bit beyond Dad,s Army humour, about as funny as Donald Trump#s program of clean coal, Scotland importing fracked gas from the USA and Shetland shipping in wood for burning by deforesting Canada and Eastern Europe!!! It is long past a laughing matter. It is just Green idiocy at its most typical.Ian,I assume you mean “s of tonnes of concrete” per turbine base  Given that a single, typical .MW turbine needs over a thousand tonnes of steel-reinforced concrete , then VE turbines, whose blades will sweep  times the area , at . times the height, must surely need bases several times bigger than that # perhaps, - tonnes, each The accompanying destruction of the land these machines are sited on is also alarming # here is a quote from the link, again, for the small, .MW machine: Given the limited cerebral ability of most politicians this obviously did not prove too dficult LOL!Humour is a coping mechanism.If you can laugh 😆 in the face of adversity you become bullet proof. Only the brave and stoical can achieve that. Dwelling on negatives perpetuates negativity. Goodness knows, there are ample supplies of that in these columns.£ million plus SCT funds have not “gone” Ian. Money does not simply disappear. Whatever the total sum, a decent chunk will of course have found its way into the pay packet pockets of some of those with most to gain from the project. However, so long as the cash gets into the hands of the worthist members of the local community, deserving entrepreneurs intent on bettering their community, who could possibly disagree  Try to be more charitable Ian.If there was anything whfy about all this Tavish Scott would have long since ensured it was properly addressed. Just look how fearlessly he locked horns with the powerful vested interests south who were forever conspiring to keep Shetland in its box. Tavish has already clearly stated he is in favour of democratic reform of SCT, just notit requires him to stand up against anyone local.You`re right there Peter, the money hasn`t just gone it`s been squandered!Squandered or plundered John  Aren’t the controls on the access to Shetland’s charitable funds so weak that any dedicated self serving group with a plausible plan could arrange over time to help themselves  Viking by name#We’ve got to get away from the notion that the funds exist to secure Shetland’s economic future.

The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

A lot of visitor experiences are going to be marred.\"Adam Gough, CairnGorm Mountain representative, who had told of the need for the slopes aimed at beginners and intermediates, was clearly stunned by the rejection.Asked immediately after the decisionan appeal was likely, he said that a statement would be issued later.CNPA head planner Gavin Miles had stressed from the outset the application had to be determined on planning issues ndash landscaping impacts in particular ndash and not on its commercial merits, which had generated much argument.He said the business case was a matter for Natural Retreats.Mr Miles told the committee the articial slope would not extend the ski area in any signicant way but the footprint of obvious development would increase.He commented: \"Initially the team were very concerned about the landscaping but as more information was given to us by the applicants it was considered that in the long term planting would mitigate against that.

Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service.

In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. This is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27481  ","story":"• Mícheál Mac Donncha and Robert Ballagh Mícheál Mac Donnchaby Robert Ballagh published by Head of Zeus. back in the late s. For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athomethat’s what they wish.” test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27483  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinWe are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27484  ","story":"• RUC unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons Mícheál Mac DonnchaCivil Rights campaigners in Derry had been pressing for a march in their city which had long been a byword for unionist sectarianism and discrimination.Using gerrymandered electoral boundaries and a corrupt voting system which allowed wealthier citizens to have multiple votes in local elections, the unionists maintained a majority of members on the council in a city with a nationalist majority.Nationalists lived in very poor housing conditions and were affected disproportionately by the % unemployment rate in the city.Unionists had long regarded the old walled town as a citadel that could never be surrendered and their dominance was symbolised by the walls towering over the crumbling th century terraced streets of the nationalist Bogside. The last time nationalists had attempted to hold a parade inside the walls was on St Patrick’s Day  – when they were batoned by the RUC.Housing was a massive issue in Derry and the Derry Housing Action Committeeprovided the focus for leadership as the Civil Rights campaign took off. The DHAC had organised a James Connolly commemoration in the city in July  which was banned by the unionist government.The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Associationagreed to hold a march in Derry on  October. The loyalist Apprentice Boys organisation immediately announced a counter-demonstration with the purpose of forcing the unionist government’s hand to ban the Civil Rights march. But the regime at Stormont did not require forcing because the Home Affairs Minister was ultra-unionist William Craig, who promptly imposed the ban.NICRA held an emergency meeting with the DHAC. Many on the NICRA Executive and some Derry nationalist figures, including John Hume, wanted to cancel the march, but the majority of Derry activists were determined to defy the ban. They won out and the march was to proceed as planned.It was a relatively small march, beginning on Craigavon Bridge with several hundred people. The objective was the Diamond in the city centre.The march was stopped in Duke Street by the RUC. A meeting was held with speakers including Gerry Fitt, Betty Sinclair, Eddie McAteer, Ivan Cooper, Austin Currie and Eamonn McCann. Three Westminster Labour MPs were also present.After the meeting, the marchers found themselves hemmed in on all sides by the RUC. They could not disperse and after a tense stand-off the RUC, oblivious to the presence of TV cameras and photographers, unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons, boots and fists. Water cannons were then used.Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, then a young People’s Democracy activist, recalled:“Quite deliberately, they hosed in the upstairs windows and shopfronts, and they went right across Craigavon Bridge, hosing all the onlookers. The police just went mad.”The RUC attack in Duke Street brought the Civil Rights struggle in Ireland to a world audience for the first time. It was a complete eye-opener to many people in the  Counties and in Britain. But most profound was its effect on young nationalists.Derry man Mickey Devine , the last of the ten Hunger Strikers to die in the H-Blocks of Long Kesh in , recalled:“Like every young person in Derry, my whole way of thinking was tossed upside down by the events of  October . I didn’t even know there was a Civil Rights march I saw it on television.“But that night I was down the town smashing shop windows and stoning the RUC. I developed an intense hatred of the RUC. As a child I had always known not to talk to them or to have anything to do with them, but this was dferent.The RUC attacked the Civil Rights march in Duke Street, Derry, on  October .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27485  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering and pain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contested narratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.- Declan KearneyThis week the NIO consultation on dealing with the legacy of thepast in the north of Ireland closed.It will inform a legislative process and bringforward future legacy legislation.Failure to deal with the past remains one of the most signicantimpediments to political progress here.It is a barrier to the development of a comprehensivereconciliation and healing process in this society.British state policy has been the primary factor in preventinglegacy issues from being addressed or resolved.Powerful sections of the British military and intelligence systemhave never embraced the peace process. They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past. There isno single narrative despite the attempts of the British state and politicalunionism to assert otherwise.The past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering andpain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future.

permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster.

Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in .

With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27489  ","story":" Michael McMonagleThirty years ago today the British government, fearful of the growth of Sinn Féin, introduced the broadcasting ban to stop Sinn Féin representatives being heard on television and radio. The ban was introduced by the British governments Home Secretary, Douglas Hurd on October , . The ban was brought in an attempt to halt the growth of Sinn Féin in the north and to prevent a wider audience hearing a republican analysis of the ongoing conflict at the time. It prevented Sinn Féin representatives from appearing on television and radio interviews. When it was first introduced many broadcasters were unsure of how it should be implemented and effectively blocked all republicans from the broadcast media, even those who were not members of Sinn Féin. Broadcasters and journalists unions disliked the ban because of the disruption it caused and some sought ways to get around it, the most well known being the actors voice compromise where actors were brought in to speak the words of Sinn Féin representatives. This led to the bizarre situation where viewers could see Sinn Féin representatives on their screens but could not hear their voices. Several actors who went on to have successful stage and screen careers started out by providing the voices for Gerry Adams, Martin McGuinness and others. Of course, this was not the first time Sinn Féin representatives had been banned from the airwaves the Irish government used a similar tactic  years earlier. Section  of the Broadcasting Act, introduced in , banned Sinn Féin representatives from the media. RTÉ went further and extended the ban to all expressions of republican opinion, including popular ballads. As the peace process progressed the ban appeared more and more ludicrous, forcing the British government to abandon it in . Following the lting of the ban, Raymond McCartney became the first Sinn Féin representative to have his own voice heard in a  television interview. test"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1093314.jpg--.jpg?1539853794000\n","title":"is kilrea road sliding away","story":"Concerns have been raised about a section of the Kilrea Road where subsidence has caused the footpath to crack. TUV Councillor Timothy Gaston was contacted by local residents about the problem as they feared the footpath and road were not structurally safe.Councillor Gaston fears that the problem is now getting worse and is urging the Roads Department to act. Speaking to the , Councillor Gaston said: “I was contacted by local residents bout the footpath, and as the time has gone on, the problem has just got worse. “I got in contact with the Roads Department and they have been carrying out work to find the source of the problem.“The issue has now been flagged to the structural department from the maintenance department, and tests were carried out on the footpath and road just last week.” The heart of the problem lies with a tree that is growing through a wall at the edge of the footpath. However, there is also some natural subsidence that also needs to be addressed.Councillor Gaston wishes to give some reassurance to the public about the current safety of the footpath and boundary wall.He said: “The Department have said the wall is in no immediate danger of collapsing, but obviously there is a danger of this in the future, so I am eagerly and actively pushing that a solution be reached, before the problem gets any worse.” Many residents have expressed a fear thatthe situation persists, the road may have to be closed indefinitely, which is something Councillor Gaston is also keen to avoid. “There is a fear that part of the road might actually come away, so I am urging officials to act quickly to get a plan in place and be proactive about a solution so as work can be carried out in a controlled way, and the road will only have to be closed for necessary work, not indefinitely.”No plan for the road has been made to date, however officials are currently assessing the wall, footpath and road, and work on devising a plan is underway.

Frank’s story is one of a number which has been put together for the release of a tribute book of testimonies from family members and friends of Thomas and Gerard which is to be launched this weekend in Sailortown.Frank, who is now -years-old worked for Casey’s for over twenty years, recalls that day when fate determined who was in the yard that morning when the gunmen arrived.“My main job in Casey’s was to drive the old Bedford TK lorry, making deliveries to pubs, clubs and off licences. I always had one of the young lads on board as a helper,” explained Frank.“Every Wednesday for thirteen years I delivered to Casey’s off licences in Derry and Coleraine. They would ring in their orders on Monday. We would load up the old reliable Bedford on Tuesday and drive up to them on Wednesday morning.“On the day of the shooting that routine was changed which was fortunate for me and whoever was to go with me in the lorry that day. “The off licence in Derry, was due to be sold that Wednesday. If the sale went through, it meant that we would not be delivering to Derry, only Coleraine.It wasn’t until mid-afternoon that word came through that the sale went ahead. Frances Donnelly asked meI wanted to go on up to Coleraine that afternoon. As it was getting a bit late, I knew that we would not get back to the yard until after seven, so I told her that Thursday would be better. Frances gave me a choice that day and the choice that I made, saved my le.“On the Thursday morning we done a bit of tidying up around the yard and got ready to leave with the drink order.I didn’t know who was coming with me, it could have been any of the three lads, Thomas, another lad called Paul McDonald, and of course Gerard .“The owner, Sam Casey needed some pallets fixed, so that meant that Thomas was not going to go with me, because he was the best man for repairing pallets. That left two of lads to pick from, Paul and Gerard.“For some reason none of them wanted to go out that day and to settle matters Paul tossed a coin to see who had first choice, Gerard won the toss and he chose to stay in the yard. “It wasn’t really a big deal for Paul, he went into the store, got his jacket and that was us, we got into the lorry and left the yard, heading for Coleraine.”Frank and Paul headed off for Coleraine but little did they know what was to happen back in Belfast.“We found out later that we had only left the yard shortly before the gunmen arrived. For me, it was just another normal day. We were oblivious to the fact that while we were happily cruising along the motorway that gunmen had slaughtered our work colleagues and friends, back in Casey’s.“About an hour and a half after leaving Belfast I went into the off licence to speak to the manager. I took a phone call – ‘Frank, they are all dead’. I didn’t catch on what he meant, but it soon became clear and he asked who was with me. I told him that Paul was with me. “That confirmed to Vincent  that it was Thomas and Gerard who had been shot. Vincent was married to Marie, one of Sam Casey’s daughters, who worked in the upstairs office along with her sister Frances. Vincent happened to go in to the yard, unaware of what had happened, he saw one of his workers lying dead and when he went upstairs to the office he was met with an absolute blood bath. His we and her sister had been brutally murdered. “I drove back to Belfast in the lorry along with Paul, but I have absolutely no memory of the journey or the conversation between us, but I do remember going to the yard and getting the gates opened so I could drive the lorry in. “When I got into the yard there was blood everywhere, even on the fork lt. There was no one about, but I had no sooner got the lorry parked up, when newspaper reporters started to arrive outside, looking for interviews.“Thomas was seriously wounded and after treatment in hospital, was released after about two weeks. I know that Sam Casey was elated at the fact that Thomas had survived and was on the mend. Sam’s elation soon turned to deep sadness, Thomas died from his wounds exactly three weeks after he was shot.“The gunmen who went into the yard that day and shot my friends down like dogs have to bear the absolute responsibility, but fate played a role, as to who was in the yard when the murderers arrived.“The destiny of at least nine people was decided that day. The survival of the workers who would normally have been in the yard every single Thursday and the slaughter of those who happened to be there, was a matter of “s and buts” and for Gerard it was the outcome of a simple toss of a coin. “Yes, the outcome of the toss of a coin sealed Gerard’s fate, but saved the le of another worker. For Thomas, it was his skills at repairing wooden pallets that meant that he was working in the yard that morning.“I also think of the salesman who had been in the yard on business that morning and left just as we were driving out the gate. “Sam Casey, whose two daughters were murdered, would also have been in the yard that morning had he not have been in the Mater Hospital where he was recovering from a minor operation.”The tribute book will be launched this Sundayin the Mission to Seafarers Centre in Sailortown, soon after a plaque unveiling at pm at St Joseph’s Church in Sailortown."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"sailortown tribute","story":"A TRIBUTE afternoon is to take place in Sailortown this weekend to remember two men who died in a UVF sectarian shooting,  years ago.Gerard ‘Coke’ Grogan,  and Thomas ‘Tucker’ Osborne,  were killed in the shooting at their workplace, Casey’s Bottling Plant in Millfield on October , .

A number of openings in the glasshouses were also repaired with broken panes replaced.Consultants have been appointed to conduct a series of studies at the forest park and in addition to the Arboretum and Annesley Garden, have been focusing on the parkrsquos bioersity and built heritage, traffic and car parking as part of the funding application process.Earlier this year, a study highlighted a wider entrance to the sprawling forest park and the development of an interpretative centre beside the Walled Garden.Council officials say that while they recognise the parkrsquos undoubted heritage signicance, parts of it require investment to preserve and help promote an area which has ldquoexceptional tourism and recreational potential.Initial restoration work will focus on the -acre walled garden which is at the centre of the acclaimed arboretum, Bothy Yard and pathways which wind their way through the Rhododendron Wood..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Beaches among top with bathing water in Europe  ","story":"FOUR local beaches continue to enjoy some of the best bathing water quality in Europe, it has been revealed.Kilclief, Ballyhornan, Tyrella and Murlough are among a group of  beaches which have come top of the excellent water quality class, but it is a case of must do better for Newcastle beach where the water quality is labelled ldquosufficient.Tyrella and Murlough already hold the prestigious blue flag awards for the quality of their beaches with those who live along the Lecale coastline mdash who have been working to improve both Kilclief and Ballyhornan mdash delighted the beaches were identied for inspection for the first time, with the water quality included in the excellent category alongside beaches like Castlerock, Benone, Portballintrae and Portstewart.The districtrsquos beaches provide an excellent opportunity for people to get out and explore the arearsquos unique geological heritage and enjoy a wide range of activities which are available.Blue flag status assures visitors that the beaches have excellent water quality, are clean and that the environment is safe and accessible.The latest water quality figures published by the Department of the Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairsshow that the local beaches rank alongside some of the Provincersquos best, in particular, those along the North Coast and North Downrsquos so-called gold coast.A total of  bathing waters around the Provincersquos coastline have met strict European standards for quality, with  of these classied as excellent, which is the prerequisite for the coveted blue flag award.A further six beaches met the lsquogoodrsquo standards and the rest mdash including Newcastle mdash were placed in the lsquosufficientrsquo standard category alongside Crawfordsburn, Carnlough and Cloughey.David Small, head of DAERArsquos Environment, Marine and Fisheries Group, has welcomed the publication of the latest water quality results.He said: ldquoThis is a superb result for our beaches, especially given the changeable weather our coastline is often subject to. But, more importantly, itrsquos good news for our holidaymakers and bathers who can confidently enjoy our fabulous beaches.ldquoWe take great pride in these results and know that maintaining them will take a sustained effort.

The newly-formed Ballynahinch United played in a local summer league which involved teams such as Montalto, Drumaness Mills, Plessey, Saintfield, Magheradroll and another called the Bachelors, who apparently had an Italian playing for them.The club made their competitive debut in Division  of the Newcastle and District League in September  when they travelled to Ballykinlar Army Camp to take on the Light Infantry.This fixture would prove to be quite an ordeal in many ways with the team being beaten - as player and car owner Ted McKibbin had to make double journeys to ferry players to and from Ballykinlar.Not a single league victory was recorded that season, although they won a number of friendly games.Although the   season started more optimistically with a - draw away to Down Olympic, it was a further seven games until they defeated the RAF at Bishopscourt -. During the summer of  the team won all eight games to win the Kilmore and District Summer League.Things improved signicantly in the   season as they were promoted as runners-up in Division  and also won the Enterprise Cup, which was played on a league basis, beating Saintfield AYC ndash in the replay after a - draw in the first match.The Swts were formed for the   season and they played in the Willowfield League recording their first win against Saintfield United on October , .Having been promoted to Division  of the Newcastle  District League, they won it at the first attempt and with the Swts moving to the Newcastle League for the   season, both teams performed a unique double by winning Divisions  and  while United reached and lost the Harry Clarke Cup final.United went to the Northern Amateur Football League for the   season and were promoted from Division B and they also reached the Irish Junior Cup only to lose to Moyola Park. They won the Division A title in  In the   season they lost the Irish Junior Cup final to st Bangor Old Boys while the Swts were probably the first reserve team to reach the Harry Clarke Cup Final which they lost after a replay to Downshire Hospital.Consecutive Cochrane Corry Cup finals were lost in   and  , as well as a second County Antrim Junior Shield final in .Manager Billy Hamilton, who had guided the team through the s so successfully, stood down at the end of the   season and then went on to become secretary of the County Antrim Football Association for a number of years. The playing strength within the club led to the formation of the Albion, in .In the mid s Ballynahinch Recreation folded. United took over the Millbridge playing fields and undertook signicant development work which led to it being admitted to Division C of the Northern Amateur Football League.Under the management of Bobbie Reid, they played their first games at intermediate level in the   season while the Swts switched to the NAFL reserve section, However the Albion remained in the Newcastle League.Success came quickly when Brian McKibbenrsquos team won the Border Regiment Cup in the   season after extra-time and penalties. Brian stood down as manager in  and through the efforts of Gerry McCormick and Cyril Lennon mid-table league positions were achieved.Under the leadership of club chairman Campbell Allen, great strides were being made with improvements to the drainage of the pitch, erection of tubular steel fencing around the pitch, construction of new dugouts and the erection of floodlighting to the training pitch with the clubhouse being substantially refurbished.For the   season Noel Dean was recruited as manager and he steered the team to their first and only promotion at intermediate level when they moved from Division B to A as runners-up to Dromara Village.The following season a mid-table position was achieved together with a memorable midweek Irish Cup replay defeat of Harland  Wolff Welders at Millbridge.Dean stepped down during the season and he was replaced by Michael Savage, who led the team to the final of the Clarence Cup which they were awarded as a result of Knockbreda Parish fielding an ineligible player.That same season the Swts, under manager Geoffrey Smith, lost the Purdy Cup final while Davy Teggartyrsquos Albion won the Bignian Cup and were also promoted to Division  as runners-up. Sadly, this team broke up and there followed a decade of struggle during which managers Eamon Wilson, Norman McCullough, Davy Teggarty and Alan Brown worked tirelessly to halt the downward trend.The occasional bit of encouragement came along with the Albion reaching two successive Shimna Cup finals in   and   only to lose out in penalty shoot-outs while in   the Albion won the Donard Dairy Shield defeating Castlewellan IIIs ndash.Campbell Allen stepped down due to business commitments and the current chairman Gilbert Cromie took over.In May  the club were awarded the honour of hosting the Britton Rosebowl International between the NAFL and the Scottish Amateur League at Millbridge.Nigel Neale managed the team for the   season, but resigned with ten matches remaining. Experienced first teamer Alan Stevens took over, assisted by John Jones, and they led the team to one of their highest finishes in years.Former manager Cyril Lennon came in for the   season and United enjoyed their highest league position for years. Stuart Buchanan came in as manager of the Swts and led them to the Newcastle  District League Division A title.The following season United again narrowly missed out on promotion, as well as reaching the quarter-finals of the Intermediate Cup when they were defeated by Harland  Wolff Welders at Millbridge. The Swts re-entered the Northern Amateur League and were promoted as runners-up in Division E to Bangor Rangers.Much to everyonersquos disappointment, Cyril Lennon stepped down and Steven Bell took over along with John Jones and they led the team to a very respectable fourth place in Division B. United were awarded the North East Referees Association Merit Award for Fair Play at the AGM of the NAFL.The Swts continued their good form to finish runners-up to Downpatrick IIs in NAFL D, but manager Stuart Buchanan stepped down due to study commitments.In the summer of  the club celebrated its th anniversary which a special former playersrsquo night and a friendly match against Irish Premier League side Lisburn Distillery. The Albion managed by Johnny Reid won Division  of the Newcastle  District League.In   the club was awarded a % grant from the IFA to undertake an upgrading of its facilities to meet new Intermediate regulations.Steven Bell stood down in January . A new management team of Colin Murray and John Jones took over the role and they guided the first team to a fourth place finish on goal dference. Much to the clubrsquos disappointment the Albion had to be withdrawn from the Newcastle League due to a reduction in the clubrsquos player pool.In the   season the club embarked on its usual Irish Cup campaign little knowing that it would reach the fth round for the first time and be drawn against Premier Division side Coleraine. This brought about a wonderful adventure during which the club was able to garner a massive support which necessitated the ordering of two double decker buses for supporters as well as a bus for the team.Everything was done as professionally as possible and despite a heavy defeat, although the score was - at half time, the players and their management gained enormous respect.In more recent times the team has been managed by Keith Hamilton, Scott Brashaw and Ross Hayes as caretaker managers, Alan Davis and Paul Allison. In the current season, former player Glynn Robinson and Dale Davidson have taken on the role and have made a promising start with good results in both league and cup competition.Over the last  years the club has been involved in a number of proposed amalgamation initiatives involving Ballynahinch Recreation, Ballynahinch Olympic and Temple Rangers, but none materialised.One amalgamation that did happen was with Ballynahinch Youth Football Club, which now means that the club includes male and female from age six years forward and a ladiesrsquo senior team. This fits in superbly with the clubrsquos ethos of being inclusive to all within the local community which has been something that is reflected in its history from day one.It also brought to the club an outstanding group of coaches and administrators which has invigorated the club.No club could everwithout committed iniduals being involved in its organisation and the club has had a cadre of them over five decades.The passing of the clubrsquos elder statesman, Billy Hamilton senior, in December  brought to an end outstanding service not only within the club as a player and administrator, but also within the leagues and governing bodies.Billy was no stranger to working hard on the ground, putting up nets and marking the pitch both at Feersquos Field in Dromara and Millbridge, aided and abetted by club president Winston Brown, who works away in the background and has done so for  years.Jimmy Brown has toiled tirelessly and selflessly for well over  years, keeping Millbridge well-manicured as well as using his building, plumbing and plastering skills to maximum effect.In addition to Billy senior, the Hamilton family have made an outstanding contribution with Billy junior managing for over a decade. Graham scored hundreds of goals over those early years while Wilson mdash better known to all as Chico mdash played for all three teams and continues to serve as a committee member to the present day.We can never forget the contribution that Sally Hamilton has made as she continues to attend the home matches and has made the sandwiches served to visiting teams at the Millbridge for decades. In addition to managing the team and being involved administratively with the club, Bobbie Reid has served as the clubrsquos Newcastle League representative for many years. Last, but not least, there is Davy Teggarty, who has fulfilled every role possible.While all of these iniduals and others have helped over the years we are most fortunate to have a new generation who have stepped forward and will see the club move forward for which we are extremely thankful..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Peace lantern walk marking WWI end 100th anniversary  ","story":"A UNIQUE peace lantern walk is to be held in Killyleagh to mark the th anniversary of the end of the First World War.The lantern will be carried in a relay chain from Shrigley to Killyleagh, and through its main streets, before a flame from it is used to light a gas beacon at the front of Killyleagh Castle on Remembrance night.A Killyleagh veteran, who is one of Northern Irelandrsquos last RAF survivors from the Second World War, has been given the honour of carrying the lantern on the final relay before the Beacon of Light is lit.Martin lsquoTinarsquo Charters, who is aged  and who survived more than  bombing missions as a rear gunner in Halax and Lancaster bombers in the Second World War, will light the beacon to mark the moment the guns finally fell silent in  after four years of the world at war.The Bomber Command veteran who still walks up to six miles a day and is one of Killyleaghrsquos most instantly recognisable residents, will be joined in the final relay of the cross-community walk by local schoolchildren and  unsung heroes from the local community.The Killyleagh Beacon of Light will be among the first of around  bonfires and beacons to be lit across Northern Ireland at pm at the end of Remembrance Sunday, as part of the Battlersquos Over commemorations on Sunday, November .Chris Hagan, the chairman of the Killyleagh Remembers the Great War project, revealed that an original candle and lantern, used on the th anniversary of the start of the war, will be used as part of a chain to light the beacon.ldquoWe extinguished a candle lantern in August  to mark  years from the beginning of the war, he said. ldquoIn remembrance of the end of the war and the millions who were killed or came home dreadfully wounded, the lantern will be lit again.ldquoThere were two bonfires lit in Killyleagh on the night the war ended at the Castle Square and at the Cross.

Armagh were largely at full strength with influential number  Neil Faloon passed fit.Armagh took an early lead with a penalty from promising young out-half Cormac Fox.The game then became entrenched around the halfway line with both sides either unwilling or unable to put any width on the ball due to the conditions.Armagh edged the possession and territory, but with defences well drilled on both sides it looked like only a mistake would provide any try-scoring opportunity on either side.There were a few fumbles from speculative kicks on both sides but defences were able to scramble into place and snuff out any chances relatively comfortably to leave the half-time score at -.The second half brought more of the same. Ballynahinch had to withstand a period of sustained Armagh possession, but did so without any major alarms.However, they were unable to stamp any real authority of their own on proceedings and as the match drted into its later stages it seemed that Armagh had done enough to escape with a famous win.Former Armagh man Richard Reaney had other ideas and he converted a penalty in the final minute to earn the home side a draw.Armagh will be happier with the result, but the Ballynahinch players and coaches will take the two points and move on to the tricky trip to Old Belvedere next week.The final round of the Celtic Cup took place last weekend, freeing up Ulster squad members for club rugby, but it remains to be seen how soon they become available.

It is getting to the point where we have to go to Delamont outside Killyleagh with the kids to make sure they are okay and can play safely.Downpatrick councillor Cadogan Enright, who has organised tomorrowrsquos meeting, said the town centre issues were affecting the whole community.ldquoI have also been approached by residents in the Quoile Fold where senior citizens expressed concern that they are afraid to go out for milk in the evenings, he said.ldquoIt is my understanding that those involved in the anti-social behaviour are known to police so itldquoThe fact this trouble has been going on for months is wholly unacceptable.ldquoRepresentatives of residentsrsquo groups have been invited to attend tomorrowrsquos meeting to reflect how what is happening in the town centre is also spilling over into the areas where they live.Confirming the attendance of representatives from Downpatrick Youth Initiatives at tomorrowrsquos meeting, Cllr Enright said the organisation also wanted to ensure the young people it was responsible for could play safely in the town centre and surrounding area..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/ource srcset=/resources/images/8744468.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"And while a little young to be enjoying a champagne celebration, Maisie will be ing to her Upper StrattonTHE.

A bomb had damaged Enniskillen Townhall, and for a while the Council moved out to the Ardhowen.Pardon the pun, but there were times when Council meetings were ldquoas good as a play, as my granny used to say. Reporting the meetings for the paper was enjoyable, and I remember on one occasion two Councillors had a, er, lively exchange of views and we all held our breath as John Joe McCusker marched down the chamber to confront Jim Lunny.Of course it all ended amicably. The two men, both Nationalists and both with a mischievous sense of humour, were very dferent characters ndash genuine characters and not the fictional types which would tread the boards later at the same venue. I got to know them both and enjoyed their company.Jim Lunny was a great campaigner for retaining townland names, and John Joe fought his corner for his area. I recall them both having a sense of community, and not only would they do their best for Fermanagh in their day, both were also conscious of the need to pass things on to future generations.So they were very supportive of the then Chief Executive, Gerry Burns, a public servant with real vision, when he was the driving force to transform the Ardhowen into the beautul ldquoTheatre by the Lakes. And the architecture-award winning building became the envy of many places at home and abroad.Pardon the clicheacute, but the ldquojewel in the crown was an apt description, but more than just being a beautul building in a beautul setting, the Ardhowen under the dedicated and expert guidance of people like Eamonn Bradley and others, gave a real boost to the arts and entertainment.Enniskillen, and indeed Fermanagh generally, has a fine tradition in amateur drama and itrsquos gratying to see the likes of Adrian Dunbar and Ciaran McMenamin go on to have distinguished careers. About four years ago, I had the pleasure of chairing the Xchange summer school at the Ardhowen when Adrian spoke of his passion for the arts and as a regular visitor to his home town he still boosts the arts here. As does Ciaran, who engaged locals at such events as the film club. The range of activities at the Ardhowen is ied and we are, indeed, fortunate to have such a venue.Itrsquos starting to show its age, though. Even so, I cannot imagine that the people who got the theatre project up and running  years ago would have expected that already the Council is undertaking an exercise to look at the future of the theatre. Some of the options include an upgrade or extension, but worryingly another option is to build another theatre on another site.All this has been well reported by Colm Bradley in this newspaper.The situation has led to a number of people expressing doubts about the future of the Ardhowen, and Fermanagh Film Clubrsquos Jules Caithness wrote about ldquograve concern at the fog of uncertainty over the theatre which he said had been ldquohorribly neglected.The Council attempted to downplay this by saying they have ldquono plans to sell the Ardhowen site.No plans  Whatthey go for the option of a new theatre on a new site  What happens to the Ardhowen site then  Irsquod have preferred a straightforward, no wersquore not selling it. Itrsquos a uniquely beautul site and wersquod be mad to sell it.Irsquom told a meeting was held in August of ldquostakeholders which unsettled some of those present, and that no Councillors were present.Irsquom wondering how the succeeding Councils over the years allowed the building to get into such a state of repair, to the point where they now need to spend a large sum of money.So much money, in fact, that it exceeds the threshold that an ldquoeconomic appraisal is required.Irsquom sure some bean counter will weigh it all up but how do you place on a balance sheet the richness of cultural experience which the Ardhowen has brought to Fermanagh over three decades, and the reputation our centre of excellence has across Ireland In the current climate, I think the way we are governed isnrsquot as ldquoopen and accountable as it should be. There is certainly a massive disconnect between the people and those in authority at Stormont, though one would expect thatany public body would have the ear of the public it would be the local Council.Some decisions have implications for years to come. I still get annoyed when I walk past the old ldquostreets area opposite the police station in Enniskillen and see a lot of public sector buildingswhere once stood a thriving community of people living in homes on the island.OK, housing conditions were awful, but homes should have been built there instead of what the planners did with the area.So, please members of Fermanagh and Omagh District Council, consider carefully what you do with the Ardhowen. Itrsquos not really yours, and itrsquos not totally a matter of money.Part of the problem, apparently, is a lack of car parking. Aside from the fact that this would suggest itrsquos a popular venue, surely itrsquos not beyond the Council to sort that one out There are other problems, of course, and I fully accept that these are stringent times.Butyoursquore looking for feedback, Councillors, mine is that you should recognise what a magnicent asset you have on your hands. Pluck the jewel out of the crown and abandon it at your peril. In fact, find the money, go the whole hog and turn the ldquotheatre by the lakes into an even greater asset which will build on what has already been achieved and be lauded for years to come.Your predecessors, McCusker, Lunny and Burns among other, had the foresight to do that.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was a conflict in which his uncle, Charlie Dunbar had been persuaded to volunteer for ldquoto fight for his religion.But the experience of what Charlie saw left a deep scar and changed him forever.Adrian was the focus of the ldquoWho Do You Think You Are  on RTE on Sunday evening, and it was a fascinating watch.As we all get a little older, many of us seem to have an increasing interest in our own past, especially our own family history. In Ireland, family is still a powerfully symbolic and emotive part of our DNA, and the programme often reveals some interesting context for inidual celebrities.As Adrian said: ldquoAll of us are interested in our backgrounds where we come from and what yoursquore born into. Those things shape who you are.Therersquos no doubt that we will have been particularly interested in Dunbarrsquos journey into his background after all hersquos one of our own.But the interest in the programme went much deeper and much more meaningful. With several little vignettes showing the complexity of identity in Ireland.A word used frequently these days in all sorts of context is binary, meaning only two parts or ision into two groups. Itrsquos particularly apt to the world view of Northern Ireland. Protestant equals Unionist British, Catholic equals Nationalist Irish, would be the perception.It isnrsquot the case, of course, and shouldnrsquot be. But the troubled th century in Ireland, particularly the last quarter of it, saw both groups driven further into a silo mentality.Irsquove always felt that there was a certain irony in the fact that a violent Republican campaign to achieve Irish unity did, actually, create more ision.Now, the current circumstance of changing demographics in the north combined with the Brexit crisis are focusing on identity as we go forward.Adrian Dunbar is a clever inidual and, indeed, a perceptive one and the story of his family background in the programme was punctuated with comments which should evoke some thought about the past, present and future.Adrian was brought up in Enniskillen in a mainly Nationalist area, though for a few years the family moved to Portadown, Garvaghey Road in fact, where he recalls loyalist paramilitaries parading close by in a show of strength to people in Nationalist areas to know their place. The memory of two communities living apart is eloquently described by Adrian as ldquosocial engineering to suit sectarianism. While Enniskillen was much less hostile, the time, the place and the neighbourhood environment where he and his siblings grew up were far from ideal recruiting ground for the British military.And yet, on his mother Pauline Camplingrsquos side, there is an incredibly strong link and a history of service going back three generations.Adrian visited St. Michaelrsquos Church where Frankie Roofe was able to give him intriguing detail of his great-great-grandfather coming to Enniskillen as a soldier from England and converting from Church of England to Catholicism.Recounting some of the history of the Inniskilling Fusiliers, when the regiment ldquoheld the line for Wellington at Waterloo about half of the  men were killed, Adrian himself pointed out that about a third of the men spoke only in Irish. Itrsquos a quirk of how history develops that hundreds of years later the native tongue of men who died serving the British Army is somehow portrayed controversially as anti-British.Adrianrsquos grandfather, Walter Campling served in the Inniskillings, and three of his sonshad distinguished service in the British military in world war.The programme shows Adrian coming home to Enniskillen to discuss this with his brother Liam.Interestingly, though, Liam said that because they were brought up in Nationalist areas they didnrsquot go round talking about their ancestorsrsquo British military service. And Adrian himself said that the idea that he and his siblings would have followed the tradition of their three previous generations had gone.Such service to the British military by Catholic Nationalist families was common, as a look at the names of both communities on the Enniskillen War Memorial show.Yet, it was a feature not talked about in recent history and illustrates the complexities of identity that weave their way through our communities.Conversely, of course, the perception suggests that all Protestants consider themselves ldquoas British as Finchley and thatrsquos just as much an oversimplication. Surely the two identities donrsquot slot handily into their own homogeneous monolith There were a couple of telling moments, I thought, in the Dunbar programme.His uncle Charlie, whom Adrian remembers fondly dishing out sixpences, had been convinced in the late s to join the Irish brigade fighting for the fascist Franco in the Spanish Civil War under the guise of fighting to preserve the Catholic religion against the evils of Communism.On hearing some of the shocking atrocities that his uncle witnessed, Adrian reflected: ldquoPeople do a lot of things in the name of religion, donrsquot they  Sadly, as we know only too well in the north.And he added: ldquoThe combination of religion and politics is not a good one.And there was another line which struck me. Adrian was shown a photo of Queen Victoriarsquos state visit to Dublin in  when the city was still under British rule.He was shown the regimental band, including his grandfather, and considering the protest and fight for independence in Ireland which was about to change everything, Adrian referred to his grandfather and other comrades as being ldquoon the wrong side of history.A century on from that Royal visit, the country saw a war of independence, a civil war, decades of conflict in this part of the island and more recently more Royal visits by the current Queen both north and south of the Border.And now itrsquos a pertinent question to ask what side of history the ious identities are on now.The confusion and uncertainty over future membership of the European Union has thrown the subject of identity to the forefront, and there is the suggestionthat the issue of Irish unity is firmly on the agenda.To be honest, I donrsquot think evena Border poll was held that it would result in unity just now.But herersquos a thing. On Sky News last week, journalist Adam Boulton was interviewing Scottish Deputy First Minister, John Swiney and his opening question was: ldquoWhat do you think is more likely to happen first, a united Ireland or an independent Scotland The fact that he asked it seriously is telling, as is Swineyrsquos serious reply which began, ldquoItrsquos a close run thinghellip.In the current political climate, the DUP say they are engaged in a ldquobattle for the Union. Aside from the fact that all politics here seems to boil down to that, in this case the DUP may well be right.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I have been moved to tears by so many honest and heart-wrenching accounts.I canrsquot even begin to imagine the pain of losing a child at any stage of le it is inconceivable for those who have never suffered such a loss. But sadly, itrsquos more common that we imagine.It is estimated that one in four pregnancies in the UK ends in miscarriage, defined as a loss of pregnancy up to a gestation of  weeks and  days. A loss after that is considered stillbirth and in  there were , stillbirths ndash thatrsquos nine babies stillborn every day ndash and , neonatal deaths.As part of baby loss awareness week, bereaved parents, along with their families and friends have been coming together, joining with others across the world, to commemorate their babiesrsquo lives.The campaign was started  years ago and yet the fact remains that in our society, it is really only in the last couple of years that we have started to talk openly about baby loss.Indeed it remains a subject that few of us feel completely comfortable navigating. I will admit that before I became a mother three years ago, I had conversations with women who lost their baby during pregnancy and I know I didnrsquot handle those conversations very well.Maybe there isnrsquot a right thing to say, but I recognise now that that I, like so many of us do, shied away from much,any, conversation. Despite knowing that the phrase ldquoIrsquom so sorry was lacking, I refrained from empathising any further or asking questions because I felt I didnrsquot have the right words, I was afraid of saying too much, of saying the wrong thing, of being insensitive, and most of all I was afraid of upsetting that mother.But what I have learned since is that many women ndash and men ndash who have said goodbye to a child in pregnancy or during birth, want to talk about the loss. They donrsquot want you to cross the street to avoid them. Many want you to askthat baby had a name, or when his or her birthday would have been. Of course, itrsquos hard to know any of this unless we have the opportunity to have open and transparent conversations about such a sensitive and dficult issue.Talking about the subject of death is still quite taboo in our society, particularly when it is the death of a baby. But we shouldnrsquot underestimate the importance of talking about baby loss. Not only does it help those who are grieving, helping them to process what has happened, to stop blaming themselves and feel less alone in what can be an emotional and physical rollercoaster, it also gives us all the opportunity to develop the tools and language to discuss this emotive subject with greater understanding, helping to normalise something that is common - and indeed normal - but not talked about enough.Itrsquos ironic and perhaps a cruel reality of social norms that women are encouraged not to tell people about pregnancy until after the first trimester when sickness abates and the risk of miscarriage is greatly reduced. Surely the early stage is when pregnant women need compassion and understanding. The expectation to remain silent during the first  weeks of pregnancy means many couples faced with loss are left to grieve without the support that they need. After all, it doesnrsquot matter whether the loss of a baby is at eight weeks gestation or  weeks, the trauma felt by those who loved and wanted each child are the same. They had imagined their new family they had probably considered whether that baby was a boy or a girl and all sorts of other exciting plans.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster village ed to his old parish... bearing an extraordinary gt.Henry and Susan Livingston came from New York state to Killinchy to trace the footsteps of their ancestor Rev John Livingston – a Scottish-born Presbyterian minister who was one of the early Plantation settlers, and who established the village’s parish church.   Rev John Livingston In honour of their connection to the area – with Henry being John Livingston’s th great grandchild – the Americans gave the church a fully-restored pipe organ dating back to .The le of ancestor John Livingston was remarkable, and included an abortive effort to take about  would-be colonists from Ulster to America– believed to be the firstsuch attempted sailing from the Province.He became rector of newly-created Killinchy Parish Church – the first Protestant congregation in the village – while in his late s in .The current rector of the church, Stanley Gamble, said nothing like today’s plethora of Protestant denominations existed in John Livingston’s time instead it was essentially just the reformed faith, or the Roman one. Over time the parish church became Presbyterian, and then later Church of Ireland as it is today.   Harrison  Harrison  restored organ in Killinchy Parish Church The current church was built in , but on the same site of John Livingston’s original one.Rev Gamble said the US visitors, who both worked in Brown Brothers Harriman Bankhad travelled to Northern Ireland last year on a kind of pilgrimage to John Livingston’s former home.“They discovered the parish church, and me, and made the offer of installing the organ in his memory,” he said.The instrument was recovered from a defunct Methodist church in northern England.Originally made by Harrison  Harrison, and restored by the Pipe Organ Preservation Company, their gtwas formally presented at a gathering on September .“We had a little house organ – but it wasn’t much cop,” Rev Gamble said. “Harrison  Harrison is like the Rolls-Royce of organs.”The Americans’ visit was marked by the first-ever Livingston Days festival , and Rev Gamble said he aims to keep it going as a regular thing in the parish.Ex police chief: The peace process has ‘destroyed’ prospects of justice for Troubles victims Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“We’re eternally grateful to Susan and Henry Livingston for their generosity. They’ve opened a new chapter of cultural and musical le in this parish,” said Rev Gamble.In terms of how John Livingston had ended up in Killinchy in the first place, Queen’s University Belfast professor Laurence Kirkpatrick said he was one of a wave of unemployed ministers dispatched by King James I to Ireland to the Plantation.But as a result of theological ructions he was “temporarily suspended, reinstated, suspended again and finally deposed in November ”.“These clerics, originally drafted into Ulster as part of Government policy, were now persecuted as part of a changing Government policy,” he said. Whilst his own plan to emigrate ultimately failed, his children moved to Massachusetts, where grandson Johannes Livingston married Mary Winthrop – beginning the line of descendents including Henry and Susan.John Livingston’s bid to emigrate was not plain sailing.The ship, Eaglewing, left Groomsport on September , , but Prof Kirkpatrick said: “Severe Atlantic storms damaged the ship and the group decided God was telling them toto Ireland.“They arrived back in Ulster on November .“A baby boy was born during the voyage to a couple from the Killinchy congregation and Livingston baptized him the following Sunday, naming him ‘Seaborn’.”John Livingston himself died in  in Amsterdam, about a decade after Charles II had exiled him over a theological dispute.try catch     .               ..

The idea that it was [Treasury funding] almost seemed to people to remove the risk – but we are in charge of public money”.Mr Woods was also scathing about how members of DETI’s energy ision reacted to his enquiries.Two civil servants – Stuart Wightman and Seamus Hughes – did not provide him with a copy of a ‘handover note’ which had been given to them when they joined energy ision and which signicantly undermined the story which they were telling him at that point.Mr Woods said it was “one of the lowest levels of cooperation I’ve experienced” and led to the department beginning an investigation ahead of potential disciplinary proceedings, a process which has been put on hold while the public inquiry is ongoing.Ex police chief: The peace process has ‘destroyed’ prospects of justice for Troubles victims Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch     .               ..

Many moons ago I did diddle off and leave a dining room wall a third painted and the job to someone  to finish because I got bored and this has turned in to, ldquoWell, you see, Alison, you donrsquot do DIY. Well, fasten my tool belt and hand me a power drill because I now do do DIY.I unscrewed and moved a shelf just yesterday as it needed doing and no one  was doing it anytime soon. Shelf is now in itsrsquo new position, with books on it and it hasnrsquot gone wonky or fallen off over night, so unless it is the shelf-master of delayed action, I am assuming in situ it will stay and a good DIY job I have done.I was recently approached about a new writing project in a field and a genre I had never thought to write and my initial thought was, ldquoOh, Irsquom not sure I can. I agonised about whether I would do a good job and whether I would do the brilliant project idea, justice. But after urging from close friends and my children, I said yes.It is now well underway and feed-back is great and I love it. I am immeasurably proud and it is turning in to something that I am beyond giddy to be involved with.With lsquoback to schoolrsquo upon us and that feeling in September forever associated with change, next steps and new challenges, it got me thinking about all the children set to start St. Cyres and Stanwell, primary schools, Universities, colleges and the like and how many times we are all guilty of telling ourselves that we canrsquot, we shouldnrsquot andwe do, we wonrsquot be any good.This is my appeal to all students, be they tiny tots taking first steps in to Reception, tweenagers embarking on lsquobig schoolrsquo or those with a bit more experience, but often no fewer anxieties heading to further and higher education - go for it, try it take advantage of the chance to learn and the opportunities it opens up.Le is short and it is certainly too short to listen to voices that limit you or put you down. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here.

It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing. Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business speaks to Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI and some of those burgeoning firms it has developed strong relationships with over the decades Long-term support is very much at the heart of the decades of partnership between Bank of Ireland and its business customers.And whether it’s offering a wide range of financial assistance, growth support or general advice, the bank has formed le-long partnerships with companies from right across the sectors, and from the large to the very small.It’s been there for three of its longest-running customers – with a combined almost -year history – from the start, and played a key role as a partner in each of their own growth stories.Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI at Bank of Ireland UK, told Ulster Business:“We base our business on a relationship management model – we spend a lot of time with the businesses, we know the owners and their management teams, their growth objectives and ambitions and understand the businesses.“That enables us to provide the right suite of products – challenging business plans, providing funding and help. There’s also the chance to introduce them to potential customers, signpost to expert advice, and become a partner to that customer, rather than just be a funder. It’s very much a partnership approach.“We provide lending facilities to business from the very small micro firm, right through their le-cycle, their growth phase, and scaling up to small and medium-sized businesses.”And for Gavin, it’s all about offering a range of services and assistance “under one roof”.“We have the ability to lend up to £m for business customers. There is the consistency to our approach, and that’s really important in the Northern Ireland market.”Partnership is a phrase that continues to raise its head in Bank of Ireland, regarding both its relationships with business customers, and the longevity and generational nature of the companies it’s developed long-term relationships with.“We would have many instances where a mother and father have built a business, and now the second generation is taking on the management,” Gavin said. “We are involved across both generations, and we are very privileged to be part of that family and business development.”“It’s in our interest that the company continues to grow and thrive and we have been very important in that role.”Nowhere is that more evident than with the hugely successful family-owned McKeever Hotel Group.What started out as a family restaurant business in Randalstown, Co Antrim back in , has blossomed into a burgeoning food and hospitality business boasting five hotels across Northern Ireland and Donegal.And the McKeever Hotel Group is still very much a family affair. In the last  years, the breadth of the business has grown to include Corrs Corner in Newtownabbey, the Dunsilly Hotel in Antrim, Ballymena’s the Adair Arms, Dillons in Letterkenny, and its latest hotel, the Dunadry in Antrim.Today, Eugene McKeever, along with his we Catherine, daughter Bridgene and son Eddie, run the thriving hotel empire which employs around  part-time and full-time staff.“The family business started in  when my parents opened the first restaurant in Randalstown – my dad was a chef and mum was teaching,” Bridgene, who is marketing director, said.“They then bought Corrs Corner. That’s when Bank of Ireland really become involved in the company and helped us out.“We have been supported by Bank of Ireland in a number of ways.”That includes the multi-million pound funding for the refurbishment of the Dunadry Hotel, in addition to funding support provided for the acquisition in .“Bank of Ireland has been with the company during its entire history. In , with the Adair Arms, we were one of the few people back then who were buying, due to the recession,” she said.“There has always been trust and the faith with the bank. My dad has always said – speak to your bank manager, and be honest with them.”The McKeever Hotel Group’s single biggest investment has been with the -bedroom Dunadry.Gavin says that one of Bank of Ireland’s core objectives is to help “customers to thrive”.“In doing that, it covers a lot of dferent things, and it’s not just about being profitable,” he said.“We specically tailor our packages to the customer needs. Their success, is our success and we are very privileged to be part of that growth story.”Eamon McCay started his cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff, boasting a turnover of £m.And he’s been helped along the way by Bank of Ireland amid ongoing expansion and growth. It’s a relationship which has so far lasted more than  years, and shows no signs of slowing down.“I started Frylite in , delivering fresh oil and collecting used oil. I combined all of the areas in one,” Eamon says.And that initial  sq ft building has grown to five depots across Ireland, with a further site on the cards for yet more expansion. “We supply our vegetable oils to hotels, fast food outlets, commercial businesses, bakeries, industrial food service sector… it’s been gradual growth.”A depot in Galway in  was followed by another two years later in Dublin, with Coleraine and Cork following a short time later. And its Strabane base is now a , sq ft building on a four-acre site.Since , Bank of Ireland has provided facilities to the business including invoice discounting, asset finance and term and cash flow ending, and also previously used stockline facility.Speaking about his strong relationship with Bank of Ireland, Eamon says a commercial finance package ensured the businesses growth.“The bank have gotten to know the business. I felt like I have had a partner, which is invested in the business. Building good relationships is one of the values,” he said.But it’s not just about providing help and finance to customers. Bank of Ireland is sponsor of Catalyst Inc’s Invent competition and is also working with organisations such as the NI Chamber and CBI to showcase and help companies improve skills, digital prowess and scale exports.Another business with a more than two-decade relationship with Bank of Ireland is Pinnacle.And just some of the Sage Platinum Reseller’s top customers include everyone from the Irish Football Associationand Ulster Rugby to Titanic Belfast and Mash Direct.The software partner, which was set up in Belfast in , now boasts a team of more than  experienced providers of Sage business management software solutions, IT services and support.“Going from humble beginnings, the company has grown into a £m business,” Fran McKee, Pinnacle’s marketing director said.The firm, which is headed by founder Ken Montgomery, has been supported by Bank of Ireland through its stages of growth, which has included organic expansion and acquisition. “We have a solid partnership with Bank of Ireland, which has nurtured our business since its inception in .”The firm offers businesses solutions from simple to more complex business needs with Sage. It now has  offices across the UK and Ireland, but according to Fran, there is “massive growth on the agenda”.“We want to be a £m business within the next few years and as well as growing our Sage ision we want to also grow our IT services offering and with the bank’s support we’ll achieve our growth ambitions.  You can come to us as a one-stop-shop for IT and software requirements.“Customers today are very focused on providing a good service as well as achieving their growth ambitions, so they want to have the software in place to help them make decisions and run their businesses effectively.”And Gavin says the key message is that Bank of Ireland is a “proven and consistent funding partner for businesses over a long period of time.”“We work hard to build a great rapport and great trust with our clients and these long term relationships are testament to that. It is exciting to share the journey of young and small businesses to growth and expansion and we’re keen to help the next generation seize new opportunities for their businesses.” ■View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Premier.jpg","title":"premier inn looking at two new ni hotels","story":"Posted on Wednesday October  by John Mulgrew Premier Inn is eyeing up opening new hotels in Newry and Enniskillen as it seeks to expand across Northern Ireland, Ulster Business can reveal.The hotel chain, which has seven hotels here, is seeking developer opportunities in the two new locations, alongside growth in Dublin.The company, owned by Whitbread, has said it secured  new hotels in the UK during the last financial year, and has the same aspirations this year.It also says it is looking for “property partners and freehold development sites in Dublin and other major cities” as it seeks to grow Premier Inn across Ireland.Meanwhile, a new report from PwC says hotel prices in Belfast are rising five times faster than the UK average.In June , the average cost of an overnight stay in Belfast was £. but has now grown to £..Belfast is now the fourth most expensive city to stay in the UK, outside London.PwC Northern Ireland partner, Martin Cowie, said: “The influx of high-quality rooms to the market have driven and continue to support improved RevPAR and ADR for the city. “Though the full impact hasn’t been realised with easyHotel and the George Best Hotel yet to open as well as Signature Living’s new hotel at the Crumlin Road courthouse which just received planning permission, demand continues to be driven by inbound tourism, domestic holidays and events.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Pete-2.jpg","title":"in focus peter hannan on beef brexit and business","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Peter Hannan tells John Mulgrew about turning away the big retailers, growing trade by % and that he doesn’t believe Brexit will happen once people see what’s at the edge of the clf Like many in his industry, Peter Hannan is no fan of Brexit.But the top-end beef and red meat supplier also doesn’t think it’s going to happen, given how disastrous the post-Brexit landscape is painted, now that it’s been starkly laid out in front of everyone.The Kildare-born businessman runs Hannan Meats, based in Moira. He’s become something of a star of the Northern Ireland food scene in the last decade – buoyed on by dry-aged beef and an array of the UK’s best and brightest using his produce.He’s aged beef for , days – yes, more than three years – although purely experimental, boosted turnover by around % in the last two or three years, picked up more three-star awards from the Great Taste Awards than almost any other food firm, and now plans to expand into Dublin as his next venture, by the end of the year. Anyone who’s met the Meat Merchant – the moniker given to his retail business in Moira – will know that the -year-old is a personable, larger-than-le character, whose own personality contributes as much to his business and brand, as does his meat.“Our main areas of growth in the last three years have been into the UK, Republic of Ireland and the continent. We haven’t been looking at doing more at home here, because we have a presence, and we think it’s very adequate. We don’t push that, or cold call. We think the clients that we have in Northern Ireland are the best, and we aren’t looking to expand on that.”France is also becoming a growing market for the company, and Pete says business there is growing “very rapidly”.He’s also recently signed a deal to supply all of the Hastings Hotels’ spots.“We have approaches from all sortsover the years,” Pete says. “We are primarily a food service company, so dealing with any of the multiples – doing it a lot more, or not doing it as well has never been on our radar. We’ve had them drive in to the yard here – four suits getting out of a black-windowed car. You are watching on the camera and say ‘oh, that’s somebody’.“Everyone has dferent ideas. We just don’t believe they are the type of partner that we would want. We don’t want to do  tonnes a week of commercial product.”But a few years ago, he did the highest-profile grocer of its kind in the UK – arguably the world.“Five years ago we started to deal with Fortnum  Mason, and they are truly magnicent to deal with,” he said. “That was a turning point because, regardless of what anybody says, the best front window for food in the world is Fortnum  Mason.”According to Pete, business in the five years since the relationship began has increased by ,% – or around  times.What started as a meat wholesale business, blossomed thanks to the success of Hannan Meats’ Himalayan salt-aged Glenarm beef, and has grown into a business with a wide-iety of products – many of which have been done for the first time in NI.Aside from selling lesser-known cuts of beef, such as hanger and rump cap, Pete’s business has ersied into dry-aging lamb, and curing both pork and beef in a sugar-pit – producing hugely flavoured bacon and cured-beef.It doesn’t take long for Pete to start naming some of the greatest chefs which call Hannan Meats their beef supplier. That includes Angela Harrnett and Mark Hix. He was one of the first UK restaurateurs to exclusively use Peter’s dry-aged beef across all of his restaurants – it all started when Pete met Mark outside one of his eateries and gave him an honest retort to whether he had enjoyed his meal. The beef wasn’t up to scratch.But it’s not all just awards, top chefs, suppliers, restaurants and celebrity-backing. Pete says turnover is up around % in the last two to three years – sitting at around £m.“We have lots of other things going on in the background. Taking our next step forward is something we have been considering. We are at a crossroads as to where we take the business next. We are now at a point, do we go forward with the likes of our Meat Merchant , do we take that to a city  Dublin would be next on the radar.”On Brexit, he doesn’t think it’s going to happen – given a clearer image of what le outside the EU could look like.“No doubt, all of us in business have been reluctant to make decisions because there is no clarity,” he said. “Personally, I don’t think we will Brexit. We need to go and apologise, and say ‘as we were’ and just get on. It was a hell of a bad idea. It was sold based on rubbish information, and that’s why people made a rubbish decision.“Now that we have a bit of clarity – Theresa May is bringing us to the clf edge, and saying ‘that’s how far down it is – have a look,you tell me to jump, I’ll jump… but we don’t have to’.“This whole thing about immigration. The thing about bringing , people into this country every year needed to be explained to take that issue off the table. If you want your fruit picked,you want doctors and nurses in the NHS, for example...you want any of those things, then let’s put up the barriers. Unless we take those people in, we don’t have have those things done.“… we shouldn’t be in this position, and I don’t think we will be for much longer. Once Theresa May brings these things to the clf, no one will say that they want to jump.“I think there is a huge head of steam. People will say ‘we won’t take that deal’.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"pinnacle marks  years with huge bash in portugal","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Belfast firm Pinnacle – a leading provider of Sage software and IT solutions – has celebrated  years in business by taking more than  of its staff to Portugal for an an all-expenses paid trip.The company, which has branches throughout the UK and Republic of Ireland, flew its workers to a five-star resort in Vilamoura, to mark the occasion.The five-star celebrations included welcome lunch overlooking the Vilamoura Marina, followed by spa treatments and water sports.

I grew up in an era where comedians actually had the benefit of free speech and you simply switched off or walked outyou didn’t find them funny. Common sense used to prevail and adults were able to admonish children as part of their development process. Today the world is dferent, everyone’s opinion matters evenit is illogical, ill-conceived and does not stand the scrutiny of even the most cursory of cross examinations. Politicians have always manipulated the message to try and persuade the electorate that the policy they are peddling today is for our benefit. Once elected they then change tack, claim they never supported the policy that they were elected for and blame the opposition. One of my clients’ recently told me to stop wasting my time writing about Brexit because nobody cares and the subject is now boring. I tend to agree that the subject has been over discussed but sadly it appears to have been under considered by almost all associated with our path to European exit. Local, national and European politicians have patently no clue as to how to deliver a workable and practical orce with both sides predicting a range of dire consequences for the UK economy whether we stay or go. As ever the true position will never be visible to the vast majority of voters and, therefore, we will probably never have the chance to understand our exit deal, whether or not we get the chance to vote on it. Never has the duplicitous nature of politicians been more evident than this shambles we are now watching. Businesses do not have the luxury of endlessly debating a myriad of options, we need to make decisions and act upon them. If we don’t then jobs are lost and families suffer. Locally we are pathetically represented by a group of politicians who appear not to want to undertake the jobs they were elected to do. Maybe I am just cynical but it appears to me that they are hiding in the shadows hoping that someone comes up with a plan for which they have no actual responsibility. That way,it works they can quietly move forward asthey were a part of it,it fails then it was not their fault. Do we not deserve better than this  I read an article in another publication recently, penned by one of my competitors, in which he invoked property professionals to be more optimistic and sell the positives of the NI market. I have spent my entire  year career trying to sell the positives of investing in NI. I have stayed here, built a business, paid taxes, employed many people and hopefully delivered pleasing results for our clients. It would be really nicefor once our politicians could simply deliver us a viable business oriented solution that made le easier rather than the constant uncertainty we face. Imagine business owners delightthe punchline to the gag was “went to the pub and agreed a workable plan”. Now that would make me smile.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Rocket.jpg","title":"how to make a business rocket","story":"Posted on Wednesday  October  by Ulster Business How does a growing company help its expansion plans really take off  John Mulgrew takes a look at the options available to SMEs here when it comes to fundingWhat does a burgeoning small business do when it’s time to scale up There a numerous options for companies right across the business spectrum – and the options across the traditional banking world are plentul.But there’s additional assistance that can be garnered from less traditional sources, with feedback and support also coming from outside the conventional sphere.David Nelson, partner at KPMG private enterprise, a global professional services firm, says it “works with companies of all sizes and at every stage of their development -  from start-ups to established family businesses.”.“Our people understand what it takes for companies to be successful at every stage of development – from idea to exit – and will help them make the right decisions at every step of the way,” he said.“So the support we give to our clients ranges from business planning and raising capital through to help with expanding internationally, MA, tax advice, RD incentives, technical accounting matters and complying with regulatory requirements.”According to First Trust Bank’s head of business banking, Seamus McGuckin, there are “ious funding options available to assist SMEs as they grow”.“… be that asset finance, invoice discounting, revolving working capital, loan financing or overdraft facilities.“First and foremost, however the more important support we can offer our clients is our expertise and commitment to understanding their needs and then delivering a service to match. It’s through getting to know our clients and their business that we can best share our knowledge and advice around the type of financial support they need.“At First Trust Bank, having listened to what our customers wanted, we invested in six new business centres across Northern Ireland to support fast, local decision making. We also established a Small Business Centre to meet the needs of our smaller customers. Now firmly embedded in their respective communities, these centres – coupled with our expert sectoral advisors – are on hand to help business owners identy opportunity and risks and how best to mitigate or capitalise upon them.”Richard Donnan, head of Northern Ireland at Ulster Bank, says it “is strongly committed to supporting businesses of all sizes, from micro firms right through to large corporates”.“Our latest results show a % in small business drawdowns, and we continue to work hard through initiatives such as our Boost initiative and our Entrepreneur Accelerator to build mutually beneficial relationships with firms across Northern Ireland. “A key focus for the bank is the development of digital services that make it simpler, easier and safer for customers to bank with us. “Our digitally active customer base grew by % year-on-year and we are continuing to respond to that change, for example, by introducing our Business Growth Enablers and through the development of our digital s such as our mobile app.”But it’s not all bank financing. The Growth Loan Fund offers assistance to Northern Ireland-based companies who demonstrate growth, and tend to work within the manufacturing, engineering or tradable services sectors. “Loans will be typically unsecured and personal guarantees will not be sought. The loans provided are expected to be complementary to existing sources of finance, including banks, trade finance sources and equity investors.”Some of the companies availing of the finance include Belfast-based BLK BOX Fitness, which secured £, to grow its online  and boost exports, along with Fermanagh gin-maker Boatyard Distillery.Meanwhile, the BGF was set up in  with £.bn and has since backed close to  companies. Last year, BGF was the UK’s top institutional investor and ranked the seventh most active private investor in the world by number of investments. Upstream is a Belfast-based alternative finance company specialising in SME funding, and has also now introduced a trade finance option for clients. The market-first solution unlocks the ability for businesses to finance their working capital needs end to end, from supplier to buyer.Niall Harkin is director of customer journeys at Danske Bank. He says “personal engagement is still really important” when dealing with small and medium-sized firms looking at expansion.“That’s why last year we introduced a team of  dedicated small business advisers back in to key branches across Northern Ireland, giving customers access to expertise in their local area to discuss business plans and explore funding options,” he said.“Meanwhile, teams of experienced relationship managers supported by specialists in areas such as cash management, markets and trade finance, support our larger SME customers.“At the same time, we’re investing heavily in our digital offering, and recently added the capability for SMEs to get lending decisions in a matter of minutes in ious situations. ‘future financing’ makes the whole credit process much easier for our customers. For an overdraft, we’ve seen approvals in four minutes and access to money well within  hours. “In the future, customers should be able to go online and request an overdraft increase on a smartphone at home.”But aside from the financial support, businesses here can also turn to the support from hubs. That includes Ormeau Baths’s Barclays Eagle Labs – which is located at the south Belfast listed building – and the Ignite NI Propel Pre-Accelerator. The options are out there and available for companies wishing to take that next step, whether traditional banking or alternative streams are the way to go.

The Northern Ireland Hotels Federation said a \"shudder\" was going through the industry, which comprises  hotels and , bedrooms. In Belfast, , rooms were added over the past year, thanks to new construction of six new venues, including the Hampton by Hilton and the Grand Central, and extensions to two existing hotels. The federation said the market was going through a \"stutter\" with occupancy and room rates going down. \"It is important to note that demand for hotel rooms has grown over the last year, but it hasnt kept pace with the increase in supply,\" it added. A separate report by PwC put the cost of an overnight stay in a Belfast hotel at £. The federation predicted a signicant fall in demand next year and , with demand unlikely to catch up with supply until . On day two of industry event Hospitality Exchange, federation chief executive Janice Gault said: \"Market snapshots indicate a stormy  with volatility in the market. Overall analysis shows a reduction in occupancy levels and a decline in rate.\" She said Northern Ireland needed a new tourism selling point - suggesting something like Failte Irelands Wild Atlantic Way promotion, but for the north west and west coast. \"Demand is growing, but this needs to be accelerated with a number of interventions, including increased promotion, a bigger marketing budget and a proposition of scale for Northern Ireland along the lines of the Wild Atlantic Way,\" she added. \"Measures like this will allow the market to adapt to and absorb new supply. There has been a seismic change and a response of equal measure is required to create new business.\" Ms Gault said challenges for the sector included skills and staff, as well as Brexit, which had led to \"considerable uncertainty\". \"Added to this are the issues around tax, in particular VAT, access constraints and capacity at key attractions,\" she said. \"You can see why the market is experiencing a shudder as we come to the end of an era of exceptional trading.\" And while  would be quiet in comparison to the flurry of openings in , it was \"far from dormant\", the federation said. There are to be new openings in Londonderry and Newry and Mourne, while ventures on the north coast are now \"dependent on what has become a protracted planning process\". But Ms Gault said that despite some problems, the hotel sector \"has strong prospects\". However, drawing in more visitors was paramount. \"We need to increase the size of the tourism cake to ensure that each hotel gets a good slice of business,\" she said. \"Having spent in the region of £m, the hotel sector is keen to see aon this investment and a realisation of the industrys potential.\" A full briefing on the forecast takes place this morning at a business breakfast at Hospitality Exchange, which is taking place at the Crowne Plaza, Belfast. Industry STR Global figures for June revealed that occupancy rates in Belfast were down by around % after , new rooms were added.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
