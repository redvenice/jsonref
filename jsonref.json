They are committed to introducing balanced and proportionate measures in an attempt to reverse the decline.’The MSC change in labelling is not expected to see prices going up. Consumers wanting to eat sustainably are predicted to switch to imported cod instead.

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.Let’s open with a bang, as safereturndoubtful recommends Smonk by Tom Franklin:Smonk opens with a real bang, the first four chapters are amongst the most savage and grotesque as I have read in fiction. It’s 1911 in Alabama and EO Smonk and Evavangeline, both thoroughly despicable characters, are running amok on separate paths of destruction, sharing some bit characters in their storylines, but otherwise remaining oblivious of each other’s existence as they move toward the day of reckoning… Alone, as a blood-bath western this would have limited appeal, but with the imagery created by his terse character descriptions and his deft application of black humour make it stand-out as an outstanding work in the southern gothic genre.Death in Captivity by Michael Gilbert has inspired Kincaid to make a “major shout-out for the British Library’s crime series”:Just a few more pages to go with Someone (a snitch?) is found dead in an uncompleted escape tunnel in an Italian prison camp. Who did it? The Allies are in Sicily. When will they invade Italy, and where? Will the Germans show up in the POW camp? So many what will happens when.My Sister, the Serial Killer by Oyinkan Braithwaite has won over jimitron5000:There were a couple of things, namely the garish green on the cover and the positive review by a bookseller whose tastes seem diametrically opposed to mine, that told me I shouldn’t like it. But I did, I really enjoyed it. Although the title suggests plenty of murder in the book, it more an exploration of family loyalty and sisterly binds. Punchy and sprinkled with humour, it is a good quick read.JG Farrell’s Singapore Grip is “marvellous, as you would expect from this author,” writes SydneyH:The main thing I’ll take from it is the foolhardiness of engaging in war with Germany and Japan simultaneously, the two countries most likely to be extremely competent and efficient at it – though there obviously wasn’t much choice in the matter. After the strike on America’s fleet in Pearl Harbour, Japan were in control of the Asia Pacific, and there wasn’t much that Britain, Australia and India could do about it, especially after key battleships were sunk. The bombing of Singapore is something I was not familiar with, so it was all very interesting. If the novel isn’t quite as satisfying as Troubles, it’s probably because of the emphasis on the economic pressures that led to the tensions in the region. Also, I felt that the ending left too many tales unfinished.Pseudaletia is persevering with The Flounder by Gunter Grass:… A book I have started twice but never got past about page five. I dug it out, and I think this time it has ‘taken’. I really enjoy the mix of real and surreal. I’m not far enough into it to talk about it’s meaning, etc, but so far it’s entertaining and thoughtful.We Don’t Die of Love by Stephen May has won over pubbore:A lovely little book about masculinity in crisis. A man pushing 60 struggles to find a purpose after his wife leaves and he finds his business under threat. A bit like Nick Hornby, if he wrote about older working class men in the post-industrial north - sad, real, ultimately hopeful.Vasily Grossman’s Stalingrad is “very long” says paulburns, but that “doesn’t matter”:It’s a stunning achievement, one of the great literary masterpieces to come out of Russia in the twentieth century. Through the lives of several families, (not just the Shaposhnikovs, for those of you who have read Life and Fate ) and various iniduals, Grossman tells the story of the opening stages of the Battle for Stalingrad and its effect on the whole of Soviet society. His scope is epic and for the most part, transcends the limits of Socialist Realism imposed on him by the cultural elite. A lot of my pleasure came from how I was surprised by how Grossman portrayed events (and I thought I knew the battle of Stalingrad pretty well) so I’m refusing to engage in a series of spoilers. Read and enjoy. Delight! In a strange way it might make some weeks of this terrible year easier to bear.Finally, Vesca has just finished Robinson by the great Muriel Spark:It’s not as dark than others of hers I’ve read, which may be because it’s only her second book. Our heroine wakes up on a privately owned island after a plane crash. She and two very different men are the only survivors. Other than that there’s only a young boy and the owner and resident, Robinson. But who is Robinson?Now I want to know too.If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

That double blow came just days after Northern Irish businessman Darren Donnelly also withdrew from making a potential bid for the firm.The accounting group Deloitte, which had been running the sales auction for the company, is understood to have been lined up as an administrator. Sources close to Wrights Group, the company behind Wrightbus, indicated that an announcement concerning its administration would likely be made on Wednesday morning.Wrightbus, which was founded in 1946 as Robert Wright \u0026amp Son Coachbuilders and began life working on lorries, has been struggling with its finances for months and made two rounds of redundancies last year with 95 jobs going in February and June.It had some recent successes in selling its products, including a Transport for London (TfL) order for 20 brand new hydrogen-powered buses, which cost around £500,000 each and only emit water as exhaust in May.However, Johnson’s successor as mayor, Sadiq Khan, cancelled further purchases of the New Routemasters in 2016 and the company’s finances came increasingly under pressure as the UK bus market slowed.Bus operators had ordered a large number of vehicles in recent years to meet new emissions standards, but have now taken a cautious approach to new orders.The collapse of Harland and Wolff is just the latest blow to manufacturing in Northern Ireland, under pressure from firms offering cheaper labour costs abroad and weak economic environment.Multiple factories have closed there in recent years, with fears of more to come if the UK leaves the EU without a deal.The manufacturing sector is disproportionately large in Northern Ireland compared with the rest of the UK. A study from Oxford Economics found it accounts for about a third of the economy, compared to only a tenth of the overall UK output.The same study suggests that the sector supports 214,000 jobs directly and indirectly, or a quarter of all employment.Much of Northern Ireland’s manufacturing – from linen to shipbuilding – has fallen prey to the same forces of globalisation faced by the rest of the UK. Added to that is the new threat of a no-deal Brexit.The government’s own forecasts suggest a no-deal Brexit could lead to a sharp rise in unemployment, with at least 40,000 jobs at risk, based on EU export exposure. Many of those jobs will be focused in manufacturing, heavily reliant on frictionless exports across the Irish border.In its last set of accounts, for the 12 months to December 2017, Wrights Group made sales of £227m and a profit of £1.5m – figures down from £264m and £10.7m from the year before. The financial position of the company is thought to have deteriorated significantly since the last financial update.Before the potential bidders pulled out of talks last week, the company had raised staff hopes that a deal was imminent. On Thursday, Wrightbus management told employees it was “now in a race to complete a final deal with credible bidders”.It added: “This ongoing business and its employees are our number one priority and we are confident that a positive outcome can be delivered over the next few days.”On Tuesday, Wrights Group said it did not have anybody available to comment.

Eighty new Argos outlets will be opened inside supermarkets.The reorganisation is likely to cost hundreds of jobs ﻿and was announced as the grocer revealed a further fall in sales.The supermarket group said it was aiming to reduce costs by £500m over five years and cut debts by £750m as a result of rejigging its store estate.It also plans to stop selling mortgages through its banking operation.Homeloan sales will stop immediately as Sainsbury’s said it wanted to halt capital injections into its bank by next year. The company, which began offering mortgages in 2017, has pumped hundreds of millions of pounds into the bank since taking full ownership in 2014.Sainsbury’s exit from mortgages comes after Tesco and Which pulled out of the market in May amid a price war in the mortgage sector which has been hit by a slowdown in the housing market.It said pretax profits in the first half of its financial year would be £50m lower partly because of unseasonable weather and higher marketing costs. The group nevertheless expects to deliver full year profits in line with expectations.Mike Coupe, the chief executive of Sainsbury’s, said: “Sales momentum was stronger in all areas and we further improved our performance relative to our competitors, particularly in grocery. We have focused on reducing prices on every day food and grocery products and expanding our range of value brands, which have been very popular with customers. At the same time, we are investing significantly in our supermarkets, driving consistent improvements to service and availability.“Argos continued to grow market share in key categories, but sales were impacted by reduced promotional activity and the timing of new product releases in gaming and toys.”He said clothing sales had been boosted by clearance sales and strong online growth and its Tu clothing brand continued to take market share."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4363e4dc091d7834c6ef541a40d769bdf787834/0_206_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=69b7cf41f4e9a04d675a10fbb4c71c06","title":"wrightbus goes into administration 1400 jobs routemaster northern ireland","story":"Collapse puts more than 1,400 jobs at risk and is second major UK insolvency this weekThe maker of the revived Routemaster bus and one of Northern Ireland’s biggest employers has collapsed into administration, putting 1,400 jobs at the firm at risk.The failure of Wrightbus, which comes after a breakdown in 11th-hour rescue talks, represents the UK’s second significant insolvency of the week, following the demise of the holiday group Thomas Cook.The Ballymena-based engineering company had been scrambling to find a buyer.At the end of last week, an expected sale evaporated when the Chinese engineering group Weichai and a firm led by the JCB heir, Jo Bamford, pulled out of talks. That double blow came just days after Northern Irish businessman Darren Donnelly also withdrew from making a potential bid for the firm.The original Routemaster bus was mostly withdrawn from service in London to comply with the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. The original 1956 design was not accessible for wheelchair users, and was difficult for people with limited mobility or with pushchairs.Boris Johnson, then the Conservative mayoral candidate for London, announces he is contemplating introducing a modern-day Routemaster.Now elected mayor, Johnson announces the New Bus for London competition to design it. The requirements are for a low-floor red double-decker bus with at least one internal staircase, a rear open platform, and one other entranceexit with doors.Six manufacturers are invited to compete to design and build the new bus, with Northern Ireland-based vehicle manufacturer Wrightbus awarded the contract in December.\u0026nbsp The final design is unveiled the following May.Johnson drives an early prototype of his bus in a public demonstration.The new bus goes into service for the first time, on the No 38 route between Clapton and Victoria.Johnson commits to ordering 600 of the buses at an anticipated cost of about £160m.Modifications to the design of the rear doors mean the buses will be operated with only a driver, and the “hop onhop off” rear platform will be closed while the bus is not at a stop. This breaks Johnson’s election promise that the buses would be operated by two crew members and removes the unique “hop onhop off” flexibility the original Routemaster had brought to London’s streets, the main reason for introducing the new design.Tfl spends an additional £2m fitting opening windows on the top deck of the buses, which Londoner nicknamed ‘Roastmasters’ for how hot they get inside. Temperatures had been recorded as high as 32.5C, higher than the legal limit for transporting live cattle.Sadiq Khan, Johnson’s successor as London mayor, declines to order further new routemaster buses.A TfL response to n freedom of information request reveals that the total capital cost of the vehicles is about £346m - approximately £430,000 per bus, nearly double the cost of purchasing conventional buses.It is announced that Wrightbus, the bus manufacturer Johnson contracted to build the buses, is goes into administration.The accounting group Deloitte, which had been running the sales auction for the company, has been appointed as the administrator of the business.The firm’s collapse came after Boris Johnson told parliament his government would do “everything we can” to help Wrightbus. Ian Paisley, the MP for North Antrim, also told the  last week he believed the government had already demonstrated it could help the stricken manufacturer without breaching state aid rules by directing state-controlled companies to place orders with Wrightbus.However, a government source strenuously denied that any such assurances had been given. A source close to the company’s board also denied that government support had been offered.“Boris Johnson as his hobby makes buses out of wooden crates. What he needs to do is stop with his hobby and engage now straight away in a rescue plan to save these jobs and save this area. What future is there for young people in Ballymena?”Unite added that it estimated a further 1,700 jobs were now at risk in the supply chain. One Wrightbus supplier added: “There’s going to be a lot of debt out there. There’s a lot of local suppliers. For Ballymena and everything it’s not good.”Sir William Wright, the head of the family owners of Wrightbus, advocated Britain leaving the EU during the 2016 referendum. He also nominated Paisley as the Democratic Unionist party’s Westminster candidate. The DUP is a staunch backer of Brexit.The parent company also donated more than £16.1m to charity between 2012 and 2017. Those donations helped to fund the expansion of Green Pastures, an influential evangelical church in Ballymena run by Wright’s son.Despite the donations, Wrightbus has been struggling with its finances for months and made two rounds of redundancies last year, with 95 jobs going in both February and June. It had some recent sales successes, including a Transport for London (TfL) order in May for 20 hydrogen-powered buses, which cost about £500,000 each and only emit water as exhaust.However, the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, cancelled further purchases of the New Routemasters in 2016, which had been launched with a huge fanfare when Johnson was running the city in 2012.The UK bus market has since slowed.

She and her partner Carsten Borck, an artist, knew they had to leave their residence in Italy soon and weren’t looking forward to moving back to their native Berlin.“I thought: ‘Why not Görlitz?’” said Bodenmüller, a freelance journalist .Görlitz, Germany’s easternmost city, is a well-preserved gem that has played the part of quaint Mitteleuropean burg in Hollywood films from The Grand Budapest Hotel to Inglourious Basterds to The Reader. But its pastel-coloured old town, which draws 140,000 tourists a year, hides a darker reality.City officials decided they needed to do something to reverse this trend, and hit upon the idea of offering a free one-month stay, no strings attached.Other cities had already been experimenting with the idea of luring new residents by offering to cover their housing. Detroit was the first big city to try it, launching an innovative programme of paying promising young professionals to live and work in the city for a year, and today the idea is being used everywhere from the Greek island of Antikythera to Candela, Italy, and Tulsa, Oklahoma, which offers $10,000 to digital workers to move there for a year.The proportion of workers who conduct their business remotely is growing. Already, millions of people spend much of their adult lives hopscotching from one place to another, perhaps including the occasional work-tourism visit to Medellín or Tokyo. The officials behind Görlitz’s programme figured it could both attract some of those nomadic workers and give them the chance to learn some lessons on how to reverse its population decline.“When we applied we thought the project was about convincing people to move to Görlitz,” Borck said over borscht at a restaurant overlooking the Neisse River. “But now we have the feeling it doesn’t matter whether we stay here after these four weeks or not. We’re just the laboratory mice for this science experiment.”The Görlitz-based Interdisciplinary Centre for Ecological and Revitalising Urban Transformation (IZS), which is overseeing Testing the City, as the federally funded project is known, received more than 150 applications. Two-thirds were from larger cities, and several came from outside Germany, including from Hungary, the Czech Republic, the US and the UK.The 54 iniduals and groups participating are singles, couples and families ranging from their 20s to 60s, including digital entrepreneurs, a film-maker, a model, visual artists and musicians. Each is assigned to one of three project-maintained apartments and offered free use of one of three spaces for work.Though the municipality hopes that some will permanently relocate to Görlitz, the main intention is for ISZ to use participant interviews and questionnaires to inform a national urban development policy to help revive Germany’s smaller cities. “Our aim is to learn more about what people need, and if they move, what is their motivation,” said IZS head Robert Knippschild.Görlitz is a fascinating place to test these theories. The city has around 7,000 vacant apartments, and unemployment is a third higher than the national average. This, in part, is why Görlitz has taken in 1,200 refugees. But surveys have shown immigration to be the most urgent issue for residents of eastern Germany, where the far right has taken hold.“It was a tough campaign,” said Ursu, a Romanian immigrant who played lead trumpet in the local philharmonic orchestra before turning to politics. He says he wants to put the animosity of the election in the past, and sees Testing the City as part of a budding revival which includes a new data analysis centre employing 120 scientists and engineers, a Siemens hydrogen technologies innovation campus that will employ another 100, and a €36m (£32m) facelift for the art nouveau municipal hall.Ursu believes the key to creating jobs is a more welcoming society. “I’ve said to the people, you must think about whether you want to have an open city, a European city, or a closed city,” he said.This is not a settled question in Görlitz. A July report on the project by the German news outlet Deutsche Welle attracted sharp comments online. “The incentive to lure you here is just the desperate attempt of our city to fight the shrinking population,” said YouTube user Polter Geist. “They hope your leftwing alternative garbage will appeal to the youth.”During their stay, Bodenmüller and Borck have sought to engage with these issues directly. Borck staged a show of his work at the Europa Haus gallery, with posters asking passersby questions such as “Am I welcome here?” and “How do I know you are not a Nazi?”.The couple said they spent a lot of time talking to locals and found a city of extremes. “In other places you generally have people from different groups talking to each other,” said Bodenmüller, who has lived in Berlin, Munich and several smaller towns. “But here there is no centre – there are just the two sides.”Another project participant, Nikolas Kammerer, 34, a photographer from Leipzig, sees the locals as one of the city’s main draws. He found it refreshing that artists and creative workers in Görlitz are not looking to become YouTube stars or Instagram influencers, but instead are laser-focused on producing and collaborating. He credits his month in the city for his first successful commission for the German news outlet Die Zeit: a portrait series of local voters on election day. “In Leipzig I probably wouldn’t have done this,” he said.He also saw the other perspective, at a far-right election rally where the AfD candidate denounced foreigners as criminals and the crowd chanted “Lugen Presse!” (“lying press!”). “It was horrible,” said Kammerer, whose grandmother is from Görlitz. “Most of these far-right people don’t want to talk to the media, which is a problem because I want to have them represented in my work.”With the project about halfway through, four participants have committed to move to Görlitz, including German-Finnish poet Mark Mallon and his wife, Finnish artist Venla Saalo. The couple decided to leave Berlin because of its traffic, pollution and high rents, and settled in Görlitz in April. “Görlitz feels like a lively town with a lot of young people, students, opportunities, empty spaces, and on the other hand peace and remoteness,” they said. “It is a great combination for creative work.”Borck and Bodenmüller like the cheap rents and high density of organic grocery stores and vegetarian restaurants but wish Görlitz had better regional transport and more open-mindedness. They also wished they had more time there.“It’s very intense, to try to meet people, learn the city and do our work in just four weeks,” said Bodenmüller. “If we could stay here longer, we could leave and come back and have a better chance to understand the city.”Knippschild’s early conclusions from the pilot project suggest that cultural offerings and leisure activities are crucial to attracting nomadic workers, as are reliable travel connections and good housing.“People are taking the project seriously, thinking about which phase of life they are in and what they need in terms of housing and living,” he said of the participants. “This is giving us a great deal of insight into the strengths and weaknesses of Görlitz.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70131044a906eaf9750e7c9a6101944a810b2ae0/0_2196_3024_1814/master/3024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=11ab2a57c3366cce530673d8766fcb18","title":"what lies beneath the craze for selfeets of eye catching floors","story":"Cities on Instagram: Hundreds of thousands of people have shared striking floor designs – sometimes from unusual placesFrom brightly patterned tiles to intricate mosaics, sometimes beauty is right under our feet.Hundreds of thousands of Instagrammers have shared photos of eye-catching floors using the #ihavethisthingwithfloors hashtag.

But capitalism is in trouble. Therein lies the paradox of our age. For the first time in human history, a single economic system s the globe. Of course there are differences between capitalism Chinese-style, American-style and Swedish-style. Close up, these differences can seem significant. But viewed through a wider lens, the distinctions blur. As the economist Branco Milanovic writes in his new book, Capitalism Alone, “the entire globe now operates according to the same economic principles – production organized for profit using legally free wage labor and mostly privately owned capital, with decentralized coordination”.After the fall of Soviet communism in 1989, and China’s embrace of the market, crowned by the nation’s entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001, it seemed, for a brief flicker of human history, that the world was converging on a political economy of free markets in liberal democracies. As it turned out, markets spread, but without necessarily bringing more democracy or liberalism along with them.Capitalism without democracy was assumed to be at most a passing phase. Eventually, so western liberal thinking went, China and other Asian nations adopting what Milanovic calls “political capitalism” – free markets, but authoritarian politics – would have to adopt liberal political institutions, too. But, so far, the liberalization thesis remains unproven. China has successfully adopted a market system – and, even more importantly, a market culture – without liberal democratic institutions.Meanwhile, western democracies are in various states of crisis, struggling to contain a resurgent populism. To a large extent, they are reaping what they have sown. After the Berlin Wall fell, the western technocratic and political elite became complacent, hubristic, and arrogant. Over dinner in cosmopolitan cities, they discussed Fukuyama’s The End of History, pushed further and faster towards freer trade and more porous borders, and insisted that inequality was being sanitized by meritocracy. The elite reformed our leftwing parties into Third Way parties, who swept to power: this was the era of Clinton, Blair and Schroeder. Yes, there were problems, but nothing beyond the reach of centrist technocratic solutions a little retraining here, some social liberalization there.“Looking back, the era since the fall of the Berlin Wall seems like one of complacency, or opportunities lost,” said the novelist Kazuo Ishiguro in his 2017 Nobel lecture. “Enormous inequalities – of wealth and opportunity – have been allowed to grow ... and the long years of austerity policies imposed on ordinary people following the scandalous economic crash of 2008 have brought us to a present in which far right ideologies and tribal nationalisms proliferate. Racism is once again on the rise, stirring beneath our civilised streets like a buried monster awakening.”Western liberals thought they had won, because they looked around the world at burgeoning markets. But they missed the fact that they were losing, slowly but steadily, in their own backyards. As soon as working class voters were given outlets for their anger – Donald Trump, Brexit – it poured out of them. The populist stew is of course a complex concoction, mixing misanthropy and nativism with genuine concerns about economic prospects.Political leaders, disoriented by the backlash, are tempted by cultural explanations, as Hillary Clinton’s unfortunate description of some of Trump’s supporters as “deplorables”. The phrase was taken out of context before being bounced around every social media echo chamber. But today Trump’s most ardent followers wear “deplorable” as a badge of honor. A decade ago, Barack Obama worried about folks who “cling to guns or religion”. When voters feel that they are being looked down on, they are sure to become angry.Ishiguro’s accusation (a self-accusation, too, I should add) of complacency is exactly right. We made the economic arguments for free trade, automation and immigration on the grounds that on net, and in the long run, these are good for the economy. True, as a matter of economic fact. But what we paid insufficient attention to was the necessary implication that right now, some real people will lose out.Policies to offer really substantial help to those most affected by change rarely made it to the top of the political agenda. Bill Clinton did too little to invest in workers even as he pursued free trade and sound money. Tony Blair did too little to manage immigration from other EU countries. And to be clear, at the time, I was emphatically on their side. But we were wrong. Here is just one example of the misdirection of resources. Before the passage of Trump’s 2017 tax law, for every $1 the US government was spending on trade adjustment assistance for workers, it was spending almost $25 on tax subsidies to the endowments of elite colleges. Against a backdrop of rising inequality, this was unconscionable.The question now, as posed by Bill Galston and others in this series, is whether the political leadership can be found to reform the political economy of nations like the US and UK, in the same spirit as during the 1930s and the postwar years. Right now is a bad time to answer that question, of course. The bilateral buffoonery of Trump and Boris Johnson suggests that things are going to get much worse before there is much chance they will get better.For liberal democracy to recover, we will have to recast prevailing liberal philosophy, politics and economic policy. Philosophically, liberals will have to start by eating many slices of humble pie. It turned out to be a terrible mistake to assume that capitalism and democracy naturally go hand in hand. Perhaps an understandable one, given a certain historical view. Liberal democracy and liberal capitalism were, after all, twins, born of the European Enlightenment. But as history has shown repeatedly, they can be separated. It is simply wishful thinking to believe that some deep natural processes drive liberal causes. They have to be fought for, over and over and over again. Plato’s line about democracy being “a wonderfully pleasant way of carrying on in the short run” used to be a modernists’ laugh-line. But we’re not laughing now.Politically, the challenge is to reassert the authority of government over the market, not in order to cramp competition but in order to see it flourish. The corruption of government by powerful businesses is not a weird anomaly. It is precisely where market incentives lead the currency of political economy is not money but power.“The fundamental concept in social science is Power,” wrote the British philosopher Bertrand Russell, “in the same sense in which Energy is the fundamental concept in physics”. Writing in the pre-dawn of the second world war (his essay was published in 1938), Russell delineated various kinds of power: economic power, priestly power, hereditary power, power over opinion, naked power, and so on.A free society, Russell insisted, requires institutions and cultures that keep each one of these forms of power in check, and stop them being converted easily one to the other. If economic power or priestly power can be readily turned into political power, for instance, we should be wary of the likely result. Democracies have to be constantly patrolling the borders between different sources of power. Separation of powers is a political principle, not just a constitutional one. Russell was concerned about power because he was a liberal. In fact, he was John Stuart Mill’s secular godson. (Both of them spent time in jail for their beliefs, but that’s another story.)The concatenation of political and economic power, especially in the US, is intrinsically damaging, as Matt Stoller showed in this series. The airline industry is a case in point. As Thomas Phillipon in The Great Reversal and Binyamin Applebaum in The Economists’ Hour both point out, it was under-regulated in the 1930s, over-regulated in the 1970s, and under-regulated again since. One of the most used measures of economic concentration, the snappily named “Herfindahl-Hirschman Index”, rose and fell in line with the extent to which the government enforced competition.Muscular regulation is often required to ensure genuine competition – but all too often, the political right has a knee-jerk reaction against regulation, and the political left has a knee-jerk reaction against competition. A competitive free market is a good thing. But like tabby cats, it does not exist in the wild.Once again, what matters here is power. Democratic political systems and capitalist economic systems share an important and attractive feature, of diffusing power. When every vote counts equally, politicians are obliged to serve the people. When every dollar counts equally, companies are obliged to serve the people, too.This diffusive feature is actually what puts the “liberal” in liberal democracy and liberal capitalism. At heart, both are massive power-sharing agreements. Capitalism works best when it acts in a centrifugal manner to disperse power, less well when it tends towards concentration. Right now, capitalism in many nations, including the US, is tending more towards centripetal than centrifugal capitalism – as many of the essays in this series have shown, including from Ganesh Sitaranam.Economic power is being concentrated geographically. Today 25 cities, most of them on the coasts, account for more than half of the US economy. Between 1960 and 1980, economic activity was dispersing across regions, reducing spatial inequality. Since 1980, the trend has been the other way, with activity becoming more concentrated in the coastal cities.In terms of policy, the liberal consensus that growth would automatically spread and be shared has been shattered. New measures of distributional growth, as proposed by Heather Boushey, are badly needed. More broadly, both social and economic policy will have to shift resources aggressively to provide more support for children in middle and lower-income families, especially in terms of skills and education, as part of what Melissa Kearny dubs “a new social contract”.The potential for well-structured, centrifugal capitalism to bring prosperity and choice continues to be demonstrated on a global scale. But this potential is not being realized within many of the countries that currently dominate the international economic scene.Capitalism in its liberal variant is under serious pressure. But an inwards turn, away from markets, away from trade, away from competition, away from dynamism, would spell dark times indeed, not least for the very people currently most attentive to the bugle call of retreat from the populist movements of left and right. Capitalism may be broken, at least in places. But it is not beyond repair."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6699fafcbe63c373f35b9301b12a73fd257f0107/0_136_4047_2427/master/4047.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eeec5d1c1bdad152322cfd37ab118ac8","title":"greta thunberg showed the world what it means to lead","story":"The climate activist from Sweden was the star of the UN climate summit. Her remarks reminded us what leadership, courage and sacrifice look likeAt the 2019 annual gathering of world leaders at the United Nations, a 16-year-old climate activist took the mantle of global leadership usually reserved for the US president.Donald Trump’s decision to not participate in the UN climate summit illustrated just how devastatingly Trump’s climate-denying policies have undermined America’s role in the world as a force for good, and how his actions could contribute to the destruction of the futures of countless billions. Meanwhile, Greta Thunberg called him – and other world leaders – out for their malign neglect in failing to address the single most existential threat humanity faces, while revealing the energy with which a new generation of leaders is determined to act.Each year, leaders come to New York and remind us of the promise of the United Nations – the notion that the international community can work together to solve shared challenges. The meetings can also showcase the ability of US leadership to encourage countries to tackle serious threats. These gatherings can yield genuine results – commitments to tackle a pandemic like Ebola, for instance. Whether crafting solutions to pressing challenges or inspiring the world to act, UNGA can remind us how much America can achieve when it leads and works together with partners.Not this year. Of course, Trump’s mere presence is more than enough to sap the power of American diplomacy on the world’s greatest diplomatic stage, and this year Trump again came ready to embarrass himself – and America – by roaming the halls of the UN reminding the public that he attempted to force the president of Ukraine into investigating Joe Biden in a move that should be worthy of a unanimous impeachment conviction.And so, Trump refusing to participate in the UN climate summit was little surprise from a president who gutted domestic environmental protections, announced his intention to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement, and is even trying to prevent California from enacting higher emissions standards for automobiles.Enter 16-year-old Greta Thunberg. The climate activist from Sweden – who has helped spark a global movement of young people striking from school to press their leaders to urgently confront climate change – was the star of the show. Her remarks reminded us what leadership, courage and sacrifice look like.Speaking to the assembled world leaders, Thunberg outlined the stakes of inaction on climate change and denounced the world’s focus on “money and fairytales of eternal economic growth.” Thunberg made clear what’s coming: “You are failing us. But the young people are starting to understand your betrayal… We will not let you get away with this… The world is waking up. And change is coming, whether you like it or not.”Read all of what Thunberg said. Watch the passion – and the justified anger – in how she said it. Too many of the world’s leaders – political, corporate, civic – are collectively robbing the world’s youth of their futures. The lack of action means that young people like her have to sacrifice, Thunberg said: “This is all wrong. I shouldn’t be standing here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean. Yet you all come to me for hope? How dare you! You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words.”Thunberg’s sacrifice couldn’t find a stronger contrast than the selfishness of Trump, who only looks out for himself. His egotism was illustrated yet again when he mocked Thunberg’s speech.If politicians can’t find a way to act quickly and on a scale the likes of which the world has never seen in order to mitigate the effects of climate change, the student strikes and marches will pale in comparison to what we are likely to see in the future. If entire generations know as a scientific fact that earth will, in their lifetimes, become violently inhospitable to vast swathes of humanity, what kinds of actions would we expect them to take?Thunberg is right – change is coming. There are leaders of countries and businesses making commitments to tackle climate change. Local governments, like California, are trying to move ahead on their own when their countries abdicate their responsibility. And, as Thunberg exemplifies, younger generations are beginning to mobilize. One poll of US teenagers noted that roughly one in four people ages 13 to 17 have taken action – attended a protest, taken part in a walkout, written to an public official – to advocate for change in climate policy.But time is not on our side, and the longer that the actions of Trump and other leaders defending the use of fossil fuels are allowed to stand, the more catastrophic the results will be for our children.Tackling the climate crisis requires American leadership. America is by far the largest cumulative contributor of emissions since the industrial revolution and is currently the second largest emitter (after China). America has a responsibility to act the worst effects of climate change cannot be averted without US action, and Americans are already feeling the pain of the climate crisis.Furthermore, American leadership, when wielded the right way, can produce results. The United States has the unique ability to bring countries together on climate, as we saw when the US and China (the world’s largest current emitter) struck a deal that created the political momentum that led to the Paris agreement.The speech that Thunberg gave should be echoed by an American president and accompanied by sweeping actions to cut emissions. Unfortunately, right now, such an America lies dormant. In his annual UN speech, Trump yet again trumpeted his nationalist “America First” policies that do nothing but spurn the world. Trump has, for the time being, eviscerated the power of American leadership to do good.But Greta Thunberg and her generation are ready to lead and to sacrifice. The world’s youth won’t accept failure – they have no choice."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4deea5931c69237aeaa9cd56dc79d9764d965c9c/0_334_5508_3305/master/5508.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=56f6387643b8ec48c9020c26b59c4d9c","title":"labour green new deal","story":"The most significant political moment of the last decade happened on Tuesday afternoon, not in the supreme court, but on a packed floor of the Brighton Centre during Labour party conference. Delegates overwhelmingly voted in favour of two motions backing a Green New Deal, a programme that will decarbonise the UK through a “radical policy package to increase social and economic justice”. One of the motions included a target for the UK to achieve net-zero emissions by 2030, and one did not – instead, calling for the UK to act as a world leader on climate change, and to establish a National Climate Service.The 2030 net-zero emissions target now has a very real chance of being included in the Labour party manifesto. Jim Pickard, chief political correspondent for the Financial Times, said the target was “one of the most radical policies by a mainstream political party in my lifetime”.The motions had a tricky journey to the conference floor. On one hand, the GMB union, which represents thousands of workers in the fossil-fuel industry, felt it could not support a 2030 target without a credible transition plan for its members. On the other, Labour for a Green New Deal, a grassroots organisation run on a voluntary basis by young Labour members, felt that the target was non-negotiable, because of the urgency of the situation.And so two separate motions were debated, both were won, and in the end, neither contradicted the other. Instead, the GMB motion could be seen as a challenge to the Labour party and its grassroots activists to come up with a concrete plan to meet the 2030 target. The fact that both motions passed gives the party wriggle room to respond.The response to the 2030 target has ranged from jubilant to muted to panicked. Unsurprisingly, the latter type of reaction came from the CBI, which argued that there is “no credible pathway” to a 2030 target. This is the kind of thinking we can expect to see from an organisation that wants climate catastrophe to be averted without major changes to business as usual. But the whole point of a Green New Deal is to respond to the fact that business as usual risks leading human civilisation to collapse.The reality is the science demands a pathway to net-zero emissions by 2030. If that isn’t possible within the current system, then it’s the system that needs to go, not the target. Perhaps the CBI should ask itself what the future for businesses looks like in a world where extreme weather collapses buildings, where British people are transformed into climate refugees as sea levels rise, and where politics is even more fractious and unstable as our representatives struggle to respond to the consequences. If the CBI has factored all of these features of global heating into its assessments, and has concluded that it doesn’t care, I leave it to the reader to judge the legitimacy of its intervention in the debate.The motions put paid to the idea that unions and climate activists need to be in opposition over the climate crisis. To its enormous credit, Labour for a Green New Deal secured the support of nearly all major unions. In fact, Steve Turner, the assistant general secretary of Unite the Union, took to the conference floor to enthusiastically back both motions, and call for climate reparations for the global south. His position, warmly received by assembled delegates, was more upbeat and radical than that of some environmental NGOs.GMB delegate Joseph Ghayouba spoke passionately about the miners’ strike, a scarring collective memory for the union movement, and a reminder of what happens when governments bring industries to a close without a plan for those working within them. This should be taken as an incentive for activists and unions to work together to flesh out the specifics of policy to ensure that workers, and the unions that represent them, are protected. But the thing that unites organised labour and young activists is a fundamental understanding that the system is broken. A Green New Deal is the opportunity for them to create something new.By the end of this century, society as we understand it will be unrecognisable. Either we will live in a decaying, overheated, brown wasteland like the one the current government is taking us into, or in a world with shorter working hours, cheap public transport, verdant forests and good jobs. These motions were the first step towards the latter. Perhaps one day our grandchildren will ask us where we were when it happened.• Ellie Mae O’Hagan writes about politics and culture for the "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c40e9831a69bc8e097e91aa12fcfcb968961160f/0_254_4288_2573/master/4288.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c27a683005e42e0ec00aabbe58161931","title":"1 of english residents take one fifth of overseas flights survey shows","story":"The new findings bolster calls for a frequent flyer levy, a proposal under which each citizen would be allowed one tax-free flight per year but would pay progressively higher taxes on each additional flight taken.The revelations follow a new report from the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), the government’s official adviser, which urged ministers to put tougher regulations on the international aviation and shipping sectors to keep the economy on track for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.Environmental activists said the new figures showed the UK could cut air traffic and emissions without affecting ordinary holidaymakers.“There is this narrative that tackling the climate change problem from aviation means stopping people from taking holidays or seeing their families – and actually, when you look at this data that is wrong,” said Leo Murray, director of innovation at 10:10 Climate Action.“What we need to do is target a minority of problem flyers and stop them from taking so many flights,” he added.The findings are based on responses from more than 15,000 English residents who participated in the 2018 National Transport Survey and were revealed to the  following a Freedom of Information request.John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK, also endorsed the idea of a frequent flyer levy. “It makes it easier for families to fly once a year, but the escalating tax on further flights means that the people responsible for most of the problem are the ones who end up paying most of the tax – or, ideally, flying a lot less,” he said.Siân Berry, co-leader of the Green party, said the new data showed the UK could cut its air traffic without hitting those who can least afford it. “It’s about people who fly again and again and again.”“A progressive tax on the most frequent flyers is a fair policy that most people would come behind if the government put it forward,” she added.Tuesday’s CCC report suggested a number of policy options to curb demand for flights, including a frequent flyer levy, and said technological improvements alone could not be the solution to the growing emissions problem. There is currently no country in which travellers pay an escalating levy on each flight they take in a year.“In the absence of a true zero-carbon plane, demand cannot continue to grow unfettered over the long-term,” it stated.Emissions from international aviation are not currently included in national carbon budgets such as the UK’s but instead managed by a dedicated UN agency – the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). However, some have said the body is too secretive and close to industry to take on the major polluters.The CCC said international air travel should be included in the UK’s climate strategy like any other business sector.He argued that the UK should take a leading role in cutting emissions from the sector, rather than wait for more comprehensive international agreements to be struck.“There should be no barrier to bringing aviation emissions into the carbon budgets and then putting in place a set of policies that at some stage in the future will be compatible with those international agreements,” Stark said.A DfT spokesperson said: “Tackling climate change is one of the most urgent and pressing challenges that we face. Which is why this government has set a bold 2050 net zero target for the UK and a greener aviation industry will play a key role in that.“The government is funding the future of flight and have announced £5m in funding for new technologies like electric and autonomous aircraft to help us tackle climate change. We are working with our partners to ensure the government takes a leading role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the aviation sector.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0bbfc3e4e54c6eccae9559b88ee613a888e45aab/0_2270_6192_3715/master/6192.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca63f123584df73df98b0e7bd750176f","title":"20 best easy autumn recipes yottam ottolenghi rory oconnell","story":"Yotam Ottolenghi’s comforting curried egg and cauliflower salad and Dan Lepard’s cinnamon cake – more of our favourite seasonal dishesThere is a great joy to be had from the mere mention of a chicken pie. A soft, yielding, delicious, not too onerous recipe that soothes and comforts always.

Stir this well and place a lid on top, lifting to stir from time to time, and let the vegetables cook, steaming until soft and bright.Meanwhile, heat a wide frying pan, add 2-3 tablespoons of olive oil and fry the chicken legs until gently golden, then add them to the vegetables.Pour in the wine and stock, add the herb posy and bay leaves, season with salt and pepper, and place the lid atop and let cook for 45 minutes over the gentlest heat. When the meat is just cooked, turn off the heat and leave to cool, then lift the chicken out and carefully pick the meat from the bones and add back into the pot.Stir the pot of vegetables and chicken and taste for seasoning. Remove the bundle of herbs and the bay leaves. Add the chopped parsley and the finely grated zest of lemon. Mix all this together very well but not so much as to break the meat into smaller pieces.Heat the oven to 180Cgas mark 4 and fill a handsome pie dish with the chicken and vegetables. Roll out the pastry to cover the dish, about 3-5mm thick. Top the dish with the pastry sheet. Crack the egg into a cup and beat with a fork and then add the milk, then brush liberally over the pastry. Use any offcuts to make a decoration, if you’re feeling creative.Bake the pie for 45 minutes until the top is golden brown and piping hot. A mighty bowl of parsley and mustard mash alongside, and a bowl of peas, are a fine accompaniment.

The lean birds can be a little dry so I like to casserole-roast them, finding the result juicier, and with the addition of a few robust flavours, the bird is almost self-saucing.When buying a pheasant, choose the plumpest-looking bird. The addition of cinnamon may seem a little odd, but it adds a delicious scent to the cooking juices. The savoy cabbage puree can be made ahead of time and gently reheated later.Serves 2 savoy cabbage puree serves 4-6rind-less fat streaky bacon 100g olive oil 1 tbsp plump pheasant 1 red wine 150ml, eg cabernet sauvignontinned or bottled tomatoes 100g, finely choppedcinnamon stick ½ rosemary 1 sprig, about 6cm longsea salt and freshly ground black pepperbutter 25g (optional)For the savoy cabbage pureesavoy cabbage 1 head water 1.75 litres sea salt and freshly ground black pepperregular or double cream 25-40ml salted butter 25-40gPreheat the oven at 180Cgas mark 4. Cut the bacon into fine lardons, about 3cm long and 5mm thick. Heat a heavy casserole on a gentle heat until quite hot. Add the olive oil and then the bacon, stirring it regularly with a wooden spoon and allowing it to become slightly crisp and golden. Remove from the casserole and leave to drain on kitchen paper.Dry the breast of the pheasant and place it, breast side down, in the fat remaining in the casserole. Cook gently until the breast is golden. Do not try to rush this stage of the recipe, otherwise you may burn the casserole, in which case the flavour of the sauce at the end will be spoiled. Remove the pheasant from the pan and pour off the excess fat. Replace the casserole on a low heat and add the wine, tomatoes, cinnamon, rosemary and bacon. Place the pheasant on top and season with salt and pepper. Place a piece of greaseproof paper and a tight-fitting lid on the casserole and cook in the oven for 1 hour.For the savoy cabbage puree, remove any damaged outside leaves from the cabbage. However, don’t remove any more of those nice green outside leaves than is necessary, as they are full of flavour and will give lovely bright green flecks to the finished puree. Place the cabbage on a chopping board and cut directly down through the middle of the head, then quarter and remove the hard core. Slice the cabbage against the grain, nice and thinly.Bring the water to the boil and salt well. Add the cabbage and cook uncovered at a simmer until it is just tender. Strain the cabbage well, reserving 100ml of the cooking water. In a blender or using a handheld blender, blend to a coarse puree, adding cream and butter as you see fit. The consistency should be like that of a soft mashed potato. If the puree is a bit firm, add a little of the reserved cooking water to soften it and blend briefly again. Taste and correct the seasoning and serve in a hot dish. A non-stick pan is perfect for reheating it, and a little of the reserved cooking water can be used if the puree has thickened in the meantime.When the bird is cooked, remove the casserole from the oven and reduce the temperature to 100Cgas mark ¼. Put the pheasant on a dish, cover it with greaseproof paper, and put it back into the oven to keep warm. Place the casserole on a gentle heat and bring the juices to a simmer. Taste and decide if the liquid needs to reduce a little to concentrate the flavour. If it already tastes delicious, you are ready to go. I sometimes swirl a little butter into the juices at this stage, just to give the sauce a little more body – however, the sauce should not become too thick and strong.Carve the pheasant neatly and serve with the bubbling sauce and the savoy cabbage puree.From Master It: How to Cook Today by Rory O’Connell (Fourth Estate, £16.99)This is one of the lightest cakes you’ll make with wholemeal flour, but it depends on both beating the eggs to a thick froth and adding a little baking powder. The cake freezes well unfilled so you could bake in advance and wait till the berries look just right.Serves 6-8eggs 4 medium, at room temperaturecaster sugar 200g golden syrup 50g wholemeal flour 150g baking powder ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon 2 tsp cold milk 100ml double cream a small tub blackberries 1 punnet, or blackberry jamicing sugar for dustingLine the base and sides of a deep 20cm round cake tin with non-stick baking paper, and heat the oven to 180Cgas mark 4. Beat the eggs with the sugar and syrup using the whisk attachment on an electric mixer, until pale and thick and the mixture falls like thick ribbons when the beaters are lifted from the bowl. Sift the wholemeal flour, baking powder and cinnamon once, adding back any bran that the sieve collects. Add the milk to the beaten eggs and whisk, then add the flour and whisk once more until just smooth. Pour the mixture into the cake tin and bake in the centre of the oven for 35 minutes, covering the top of the cake with foil for the last 10 minutes if you need to stop it from burning. When a skewer inserted comes out with just a few tiny moist crumbs stuck to it, remove from the oven and leave to cool. Whip the cream lightly, halve the blackberries, then slice the cake into 2 layers and fill with cream and fruit, reassemble the cake and dust lightly with icing sugar or top with extra whipped cream and blackberries.From Short and Sweet by Dan Lepard (Fourth Estate, £25)This is what coronation chicken would taste like if you replaced the chicken with cauliflower and hard-boiled egg.

Mix the cauliflower florets (with any young leaves attached) in a large bowl with the onion, oil, 2 teaspoons of curry powder, ¾ teaspoon of salt and plenty of pepper. Once combined, spread out on a large parchment-lined baking tray and roast for 15 minutes, until soft and golden-brown but still retaining a bite. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool.Fill a medium pan with plenty of water and bring to the boil on a high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-high, then carefully lower in the eggs and boil gently for 10 minutes, until hard-boiled.Drain the eggs, then return them to the same pan filled with running cold water to stop them cooking.Once cool, peel the eggs, place them in a large bowl and break them roughly with the back of a fork to form large chunks.In a separate small bowl, mix together the yogurt, mayonnaise, the remaining 1 teaspoon of curry powder, half the Aleppo chilli flakes, the cumin, the lemon juice and ¼ teaspoon of salt. Add the sauce to the eggs, along with the cauliflower and onion and the tarragon. Mix together well, spoon the mixture on to a large plate, then sprinkle over the remaining chilli flakes and serve, along with the lemon wedges.From Ottolenghi Simple by Yotam Ottolenghi (Ebury Press, £25)I normally eat these deeply savoury baked onions as a side-dish to cold roast beef, and that is probably when they are at their best. But today I have them with a plainly roasted chicken (butter, salt and pepper and a few herbs tucked inside, roasted at 180Cgas mark 4 for 60 minutes till juicy and golden) and it is quite one of the most splendid meals I can remember. Frugal, too, as there is cold chicken left for tomorrow.Serves 4onions 4 medium to large oneswhipping or double cream 300mlgrated parmesan a good handfulSet the oven at 180Cgas mark 4. Peel the onions and bring them to the boil in a deep pot of water. Leave them at a bright simmer for about 25 minutes, until tender. Lift them out with a draining spoon. Slice the onions in half from root to tip and put them cut-side down in an ovenproof dish. Tip the cream over the onions. Season with salt, pepper and the grated cheese and bake for 25-30 minutes, till golden and bubbling.From The Kitchen Diaries by Nigel Slater (Fourth Estate, £30)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e1bad29b41e7562d4b85832a8ede1fbaefdc830/1160_1583_5467_3281/master/5467.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a669058ea6d6b0d8c529238fd4a54fd","title":"how to make wild mushroom risotto recipe felicity cloake masterclass","story":"Autumn brings with it earthier flavours, celebrated in this step-by-step wild mushroom risottoAutumn can seem a very meaty time of year in the kitchen, all hearty stews and roast game, but it’s also mushroom season, when fields and markets are full of chanterelles and penny buns, puffballs and hen of the woods … so long as you know where to look and, more importantly, what to look for. This simple risotto, easily doubled, is a good way to make the most of even the most modest of harvests.20g dried porcini ½ onion or 2 shallots30g parmesan100g fresh chanterelles (or other mushrooms)1.1 litres good chicken or vegetable stock25g butter, plus 2 tbsp extra to finish200g risotto rice – I like carnaroli, but the more widely available arborio or more niche vialone nano will also do120ml white wine 1 garlic cloveA couple of parsley sprigs, to finishThis dish is very versatile. I used chanterelles, but almost any fresh mushrooms will do (in fact, it will be lovely made with just dried porcini alone). If you don’t have stock, soak the porcini in the same amount of hot water instead. You can use dry sherry or vermouth rather than wine. And for a vegan version, replace the butter with olive oil and the cheese with a sprinkle of nutritional yeast.Boil 150ml water and use this to soak the dried mushrooms for at least five minutes. Meanwhile, peel and finely chop the onion or shallots, grate the parmesan and trim and gently brush any dirt off the fresh mushrooms with a damp cloth. If you have large mushrooms, cut them into bite-sized pieces.Bring the stock to a simmer, strain in the mushroom soaking water, and set aside the soaked mushrooms. Taste the stock: you’ll be reducing it further, so it shouldn’t be too salty to begin with – dilute with a little more water, if necessary, then leave on a low heat while you get on with the risotto.Melt the butter in a wide saucepan over a medium-low heat, and gently fry the chopped onion until soft – don’t let it colour. Tip in the rice and cook, stirring, until most of the grains are coated and translucent – this will take a few minutes.Turn up the heat under the pan slightly and, once it’s warmed back up, pour in the wine it should sizzle as it hits the pan. Cook, stirring, until most of the liquid has evaporated, then start adding the stock one ladleful at a time, continuing to stir as you do so, and not adding the next ladle of stock until the pan is almost dry.After about 10 minutes, stir in the soaked dried mushrooms. Keep adding stock and stirring until the rice is done to your liking – this should take another eight to 12 minutes, though exactly how long will depend on your tastes. In theory, the rice should still be firm, but not chalky in the middle if you prefer it softer, however, that’s your prerogative.Once you’re happy with the texture of the rice, correct the consistency of the mixture risotto shouldn’t sit on the plate like a solid lump, but flow across it like a wave, so add a little more stock, if need be, stirring until the rice is loose and creamy. Stir in most of the grated parmesan and a tablespoon of the extra butter, then cover the pan and leave to sit off the heat for five minutes.While the risotto is resting, finely chop or crush the garlic and melt the remaining tablespoon of butter in a frying pan over a medium heat. Fry the garlic for 30 seconds or so, before turning up the heat and adding the fresh mushrooms. Saute for a few minutes until they’re just starting to brown around the edges, then take off the heat.Give the risotto a good stir and season to taste (it probably won’t need any more salt, because the parmesan has a fair bit already). Divide between plates or shallow bowls and top with the fried mushroom mixture. Roughly chop the parsley and sprinkle over the top, then finish with the remaining cheese and eat immediately."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63088881ac89358798d9f0e13b64e26f2172d0bc/0_211_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e36410b531a62940c727934c83e0a085","title":"uk supermarket sales of north sea cod may stop next year","story":"MSC certificate to be suspended in October just two years after it was awardedSustainably caught North Sea cod could disappear from UK supermarket shelves next year after it was announced that certification is being suspended following a dramatic decline in populations.Cod populations in the sea had been thought to be in good health but the latest scientific advice has revealed much lower amounts of fish, putting the fishery at increased risk of collapse.MSC certification, which allows seafood and fish products to carry the label that shows it comes from sustainable fisheries, will be suspended from all MSC-certified fisheries targeting North Sea cod from 24 October.The news deals a blow to the fishing industry, which has introduced measures to avoid catching young fish, such as closing large spawning areas to fishing, trialling new nets, and avoiding areas where cod congregate to avoid catching them when fishing for other species.The loss of certification will mean that it will be harder to sell the cod to UK supermarkets, although that will also depend on what quotas are eventually agreed for the fishery.Erin Priddle, the UK and Ireland programme director for the MSC, said: “The decline in the North Sea cod stock is a worrying development, with the latest stock models suggesting that the fishery has not recovered as well as previously thought.”The latest scientific advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) meant the North Sea cod fishery no longer met the MSC standard, she said. “While this news is devastating for industry, it is a testament to the MSC standard working as it should: to pick up on threats to stock sustainability, as is the case with North Sea cod.”The fishery won its sustainability certification in 2017, when populations were assessed as reaching 152,207 tonnes – the highest since 1982 and a decade since they came close to collapse.Populations were forecast to hit 180,990 tonnes in 2018, but the scientific advice for that year included a far smaller estimate of the amount of cod in the North Sea. This year’s advice from the ICES revealed estimates of only 81,224 tonnes, below the “safe biological level” for the population and putting it at increased danger of collapse.Chris Thorne, oceans campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said: “The MSC withdrawing North Sea cod’s sustainability certificate reflects what we already knew: our cod, like our oceans, are in crisis. Industrial over-fishing has driven stocks of cod in the North Sea to the point of collapse again, but despite this governments continue to ignore the science and allow overfishing to continue.”Aoife Martin, the director of operations at Seafish, the organiser of the annual national fish and chip awards, said: “North Sea cod is still a sustainably managed fishery and fishermen can still catch it within the agreed limits, there will just be less of it available to buy. The decision to reduce the allowed catch is a great example of responsible fisheries management.”Try to buy fish with MSC labels. Sustainable choices include:• Cod from Iceland or Norway.• Haddock.• Hake.• Pollock.• Pacific cod."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c09d4e67fbf18a87822bb5a5cc2a48a11d236a7/0_120_3706_2224/master/3706.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c21719261430e897fe7966909256469a","title":"grimsby chelsea carabao cup","story":"The Lincolnshire side scored a thrilling league victory over Chelsea 36 years ago and are dreaming of a repeat despite the wildly differing paths the clubs have taken sinceAnyone seeking to devise a fiendishly difficult football quiz could do worse than set a series of questions relating to events at Stamford Bridge on 17 December 1983.Samples might include: which of the two managers is now in charge of Ozone FC in India? For bonus points can you name the number of countries and clubs he has coached since leaving England? Or how about: please name the goalscorer who would go on to be awarded an MBE after setting what was a Football League appearances record?Hats off to those who can identify Dave Booth, the Grimsby Town manager who masterminded a 3-2 win against their promotion rivals Chelsea in the old second ision on an afternoon when his side had been 2-0 down with an hour gone. Watched by a crowd of 13,151, it was one of only four league defeats suffered by the late John Neal’s team as they headed for the title and a first return to England’s top flight since 1979.Booth, now 70 and coaching second-tier Ozone FC in Bangalore, would end up in fifth place with Grimsby that season. He was a product of Wakefield’s famous Queen Elizabeth Grammar School, where he played rugby and cricket and was particularly fascinated by geography lessons.That perhaps explains why he resigned from managing Grimsby in 1985 to run an overseas property-development business, returning to UK for a brief stint at Darlington before becoming a confirmed expatriate in 1996.Since kicking off an itinerant coaching career with a side in Brunei playing in the Malaysian League, Booth has since managed 13 clubs in six more countries – India, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, the Males and Vietnam – in addition to two national sides: Myanmar and Laos.As for the goalscorer, the answer is Tony Ford MBE, who struck the 77th-minute winner after a Kerry Dixon penalty and a goal from John Bumstead had seen Chelsea canter into a deceptively comfortable-looking lead. The tide began turning in the 65th minute when Joe Waters reduced the deficit, before Paul Emson’s equaliser and Ford’s decider.Ford made a record 931 league appearances with nine clubs – including a brief loan at Sunderland – over a career which began as a 16-year-old flying winger with Grimsby and concluded as a 42-year-old right-back at Rochdale.Incredible as it may seem today, Canoville and Ford were the first black players to appear for Chelsea and Grimsby respectively. By then both had become depressingly accustomed to the racist abuse, banana-throwing included, that was commonplace at English football grounds in those days but in interviews over the years Ford has said he either “blanked it out” or “ignored it”. He had little choice. Kick it Out did not exist, social attitudes were very different and the idea that footballers might consider walking of the pitch in protest would have been unthinkable.If things have, largely, changed for the better off the pitch, that victory remains a highlight of Ford’s 931 games. “The most important goal of my career was that winner at Stamford Bridge,” he says. “It wasn’t my best goal but we were going for promotion to the first ision and we came from behind to win.”Despite remaining in the top three for most of the second half of that season, Grimsby could not quite secure promotion, finishing fifth on the final day. Exacerbating their pain was the fact that their visitors that afternoon were Chelsea, who exacted revenge for the 3-2 with a title-clinching 1-0 victory in front of 13,000 fans at Blundell Park courtesy of Kerry Dixon’s 34th goal of the season.“I can’t recall the December game at Stamford Bridge,” said Nevin on Tuesday. “But I recall that season’s match-up at Grimsby very well!”If it was of little consolation to Booth’s team that fans in north Lincolnshire had enjoyed their best League campaign since 1934-35, when Grimsby finished fifth in the first ision, at least they did not know how different the two clubs’ subsequent trajectories would be.Michael Jolley’s League Two class of 2019-20 arrive in west London for Wednesday’s Carabao Cup tie against Frank Lampard’s side on the back of a difficult few decades for the club. After bouncing between the second, third and fourth tiers, Grimsby were relegated to the National League in 2010, only regaining Football League status six years later.Chelsea, meanwhile, would suffer one more relegation, in 1988, before immediately returning to the top tier and beginning an upward trajectory which would ultimately lead them to unprecedented success – not to mention wealth – after Roman Abramovich took over the club in 2003.Jolley, as a Cambridge economics graduate and former corporate bond trader in New York, might have expected to end up living in some gilded corner of west London. Instead, the compulsion to coach which would ultimately take Booth to India has left the 42-year-old dreaming of emulating his predecessor’s 1983 triumph."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8690d7e37e8d8dd66462ac28989111c285bed5e1/0_35_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f3db057f275089a05c5081a359b86c6f","title":"guardiola defends bernardo silva mendy tweet fa manchester city","story":"Pep Guardiola has strongly defended Bernardo Silva against accusations of racism following the midfielder’s controversial tweet to his Manchester City teammate Benjamin Mendy.Guardiola was asked for his opinion after his side opened their push for a third consecutive Carabao Cup with a 3-0 win at Preston.Silva posted pictures on social media on Sunday comparing Mendy, with whom he also played at Monaco, to the character on packets of Conguitos chocolates.The anti-discriminatory body Kick It Out called on the Football Association to take action, referring to the contents of the post as a racist stereotype.

While Fifa 20 is mostly very good, the issue of card-purchased loot boxes in its most popular mode, Ultimate Team, has led to calls for the game to be classified as gambling.A recap, for those unaware of the brouhaha: in Ultimate Team, you build a fantasy squad by opening loot box-style packs of inidual player cards. You can use in-game currency to buy these packs, or do so using real money – but the chances of finding Messi, Ronaldo or Salah are … well, we don’t know, because EA doesn’t disclose unambiguous odds. There’s your first problem.The second is that this is a family-rated game, with teenagers around the globe spending money they don’t necessarily have chasing cards they’ll likely never get. In Belgium cash sales ceased in January, but elsewhere it’s business as usual. Some plan to boycott until EA makes pack odds clearer or implements an age rating, as neither is present here.The issue isn’t all weighted one way. For those disciplined enough to avoid micro-transactions, Ultimate Team remains the best mode in all of sports gaming. Squad building challenges – in which you complete puzzles to earn superior cards – rely on skill rather than luck, and savvy use of the transfer market earns top players without spending a penny. A new XP system, where everything you do builds towards rewards such as Wilfried Zaha or Lucas Vázquez, also eliminates fortune from the equation.Plus, for anyone weaned on Panini collections, opening packs is the most euphoric part: to remove any chance of randomly unearthing last season’s top scorer or your club’s cult hero would be to disarm the mode’s magic. Change seems inescapable, but an age gate feels like a more balanced compromise. Finishing your album never felt quite so fun when ordering specific stickers direct from the manufacturer.Judge Fifa for its on-field abilities and you discover a football sim keen to deliver big, memorable moments: crazy, mazy dribbles and thunderbolts arrowed into the top corner. Defending is difficult, and 0-0 draws as rare as a VAR-free Match Of The Day episode. There’s no attempt to match PES 2020’s cerebral passing game: Fifa 20 is all-action all the time. It won’t suit purists, but the just-one-more-game pull at 11pm when you have workcollegeschool the next day is gravity-strong.This is particularly true of Volta mode. Inspired by fan requests to exhume the Fifa Street series, it enables teams of six or fewer players to do battle in small arenas based on real locations. And it’s superb. Claustrophobic pitches prevent pace being overpowered, and passing and shooting are reassuringly snappy – while skill moves are equal parts outrageous and hilarious. You’ll chuckle at some of the celebrations, too. When was the last time a Fifa game successfully delivered humour?Volta is best enjoyed using real-world teams, but its bespoke story mode also hosts light-hearted build-a-player amusement, albeit without the subtle performances that made Alex Hunter’s The Journey tale so likeable across Fifas 17 to 19. That, sadly, is gone – though some of its best elements now inform career mode.For much of Fifa’s history, career mode was the series’ focus, yet this decade it’s taken on the mantle of sacrificial lamb to Ultimate Team’s more immediate dream-team thrills. As such any kind of upgrade is welcome, and being able to converse interactively with squad members and the press – as occurred in The Journey – does break up the match-match-match grind. Variable potential ratings for young players add longevity, too.Whatever your mode of choice, the usual array of authentic teams and kits are included, with a noteworthy exception: Juventus are now exclusive to rival, Pro Evo, and rebranded Piemonte Calcio. Although player faces aren’t affected, it’s certainly curious to see Cristiano Ronaldo charging round in Sunday league garb. Still, one missing licence shouldn’t go down as a game-breaker. The new additions to Fifa 20 elevate it above “standard annual update” fare."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37252f90042469bebd4744ff916e3c52b635ece2/150_1083_5861_3516/master/5861.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25fac11de210fc13693466607f093a8f","title":"switch lite review","story":"Nintendo’s stripped-down version does away with the TV output in favour of pure portability – but the company’s formidable games library remains at your fingertipsThe beloved and impressively fast-selling Switch console is Nintendo’s cleverest idea in some years: a compact games machine that can be played handheld or on a TV, letting you fit in video games wherever you have the time and space for them. The convenience of multiplayer, especially – of being able to snap off a controller and hand it over to a new friend you’ve made in the pub or at a party – is quietly revolutionary in a gaming era dominated by impersonal online play.But let’s be honest: you’re not spending much time in the pub or at parties these days, are you? Perhaps your gaming time is mostly stolen, on train journeys or commutes, in bed before passing out while the kids are sleeping. Perhaps you, like me, are currently trying to sneak in a bit of Link’s Awakening while breastfeeding a week-old baby. I know so many parents, myself included, for whom the Switch was a godsend – it gave us our games back, at a time in life when it’s increasingly difficult to find time for them.It might seem strange to bring out a version of the console that lacks its flagship feature: the Switch Lite can’t output to a TV. But it’s a response to how people actually use it. The Switch’s home-or-on-the-go functionality and Joy-Con features might be supremely cool, but quite a lot of players don’t end up using them much. It is for those players that the Switch Lite exists.The Lite looks like what I imagined a futuristic Game Boy might look like as a kid: understated pastel colours, a large screen (5.5in, a shade smaller than the standard model’s 6.2in) sandwiched between tastefully grey face buttons and sticks, a dinky D-pad that feels nicer to use than the directional buttons of the original Switch model. It is light enough to hold up for an hour or two without getting numb pinkies or tired hands, which makes up for the fact that there’s no kickstand to prop it comfortably on a plane tray-table while you play. It is a simple, purpose-built, attractive-looking games machine, and of course it comes with one of the more exciting and varied selections of games around. Nintendo consoles are never the place to look for slick shooters or cutting-edge visuals, but nothing rivals their games for style, fun and creativity, and the Switch’s 2,500-strong game library includes Overwatch, Fortnite and Doom alongside the company’s own and a huge variety of indie games.Some games won’t work with the Lite, such as mad cardboard invention laboratory Nintendo Labo and party grab-bag 1-2-Switch. Basically, anything that requires you to detach the controllers is out. And for multiplayer, each person would need their own Switch Lite to play, as you can’t detach the controllers to hunt Pokémon together or face off in Mario Kart. But that still leaves you with the great majority of Switch games that are worth playing by yourself, including this year’s new Pokémon (Sword and Shield), Zelda: Link’s Awakening, Luigi’s Mansion 3, Astral Chain and Fire Emblem – not to mention all of the marvellous multi-platform independent games (Hollow Knight, Into the Breach and Undertale, to name but three).If you already own a Switch, it’s easy to set up all your games and data on the Switch Lite – though the secondary console will need an internet connection to verify your downloaded purchases. You can get around this by using game carts rather than downloads, but you still need to transfer saves if you want to use both consoles, a process that is hardly seamless. Having two Nintendo Switches is definitely an indulgence, anyway. The Lite is more appealing as a replacement, if you can live without detachable Joy-Cons and TV output, or as a cheaper way to introduce your kids to the many joys of the Switch. As a purpose-built portable games machine, it’s the finest (and prettiest) option around.• Nintendo Switch Lite is out now, priced £199.99"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98fb84bd47b82738c431125fc0c7ac4a14dfd412/0_366_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e5ae282eb04e2e14d8d57a7296b7c4a","title":"global poverty conference to be held in slum","story":"Inaugural World Poverty Forum – dubbed ‘Davos with the poor’ – to take place in Kenya’s Kibera to ensure voices of poorest are heard A global conference on poverty is to take place in Africa’s largest slum in an effort to make sure the poorest get a voice.The inaugural World Poverty Forum will be announced on Wednesday in New York at the Decade of Action event taking place during UN general assembly week. It is already being dubbed as “Davos with the poor”.Social entrepreneur Kennedy Odede, who was raised in the slum of Kibera, in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, has founded the event to bring world leaders and policymakers together to “change the dynamic” of the way the big global issues are discussed. He said it was about making “worlds collide”.“It is high time that the policymakers come to us, the people and the communities who are doing great work on the ground,” he told the .“Meetings like Davos are all very well, to bring together world leaders, but there is no space for them to interact with the poor and with people doing the work in the communities. So this forum will fill this gap.”The forum is designed to tackle world poverty by reversing the often unequal power dynamics of development conferences, and will take place in January. It will be that rare example, said Odede, of a conference choosing its location to give a real voice to the poorest in finding solutions to their own problems.“We will have a 5050 split of influential leaders and of community leaders from Kibera, from Africa, from India, from Brazil, who have been left out of the conversations for too long.“This is not about people helicoptering in. They will come with humility, they will come in as our guest and we will showcase all the things people in Kibera can teach the world,” he said.“It is meant to be a learning journey – what is working, what is not working. We can learn from each other when the community get a voice.“People on the frontline must be included. They have to have a place at the table.“They have been left out of the decisions made about them. Why? Because it’s all been about top to bottom. Now it has to be about bottom to top, because inequality is growing too much. We need to fight this.“I’m so excited. This is for me a big step. We will be a bridge between real people and policymakers.”WPF will be one of the first events in next year’s plans to accelerate progress towards meeting the sustainable development goals, which are being widely criticised at the UNGA this week as being off course and unlikely to be met by the 2030 target.Odede, who is also the co-founder of Shofco, an organisation working in urban slums, said: “It is sometimes forgotten that any programme to improve lives can only be successful it if works with the grain of iniduals – and the bundles of talent, hope and fear that make up their unique experiences. We will bring leaders to a place where they can feel both the unforgiving reality of poverty alongside the hope that an institution like Shofco can create.“The World Poverty Forum will spark new ideas through worlds colliding, bringing together leading politicians, CEOs, NGOs, entrepreneurs and thinkers, with those who are making things happen on the frontline, in the thick of the community – rather than in a western five-star hotel.“We want to reverse the usual power dynamics of development conferences and release the energies that genuine collaboration can bring.”A two-day programme will focus on practical solutions to the issues of health, education, conflict and climate crisis that keep people entrenched in poverty. Delegates will visit projects in Kibera as well as attending “Hacking Poverty” seminars that look for simple solutions to everyday hardships. It will also celebrate pioneers in the global fight against poverty – from iniduals and tech startups to NGOs and corporations – with the launch of the first Kibera Awards.The event will hire local photographers, video crews, caterers and musicians and hold the daytime events in the Shofco school inside Kibera. The contribution of local people’s talents is intended as a reminder to delegates that there are rich pools of skill, flair and inventiveness in the world’s poorest communities.More than 1.3 billion people across the globe are described as “multidimensionally poor” – defined by ways in which people experience deprivation beyond their income, such as health, education and the standard of living.“There is an urgent need for a fresh approach to lifting up the world’s poorest as recent progress has been slow, patchy and unstable,” said Odede. 2020, he said, was “make or break year”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a8d6027b1a3ee1335c8febac8751c4722a5ec40/0_45_1731_1039/master/1731.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=209c6913855b5d592b99b6f7d55f2989","title":"tell us about the moment you realised your cat loved you","story":"If you have lived with a cat we’d like to hear your stories about when you discovered they returned your affectionCats, it turns out, love humans more than we might think.

It sounds simple, but when you want to impress, the temptation to overcomplicate food can leave you feeling overwhelmed and overworked. So how do you make food to remember, without breaking your back in the kitchen? The answer is to take inspiration from the French – not their haute cuisine, but their countryside cooking, which is just as tasty and a fraction of the effort. The secret is simply to use the best quality ingredients, which should be left to do the culinary talking for you. When the basics are really good, there’s not much more you need to do other than throwing them together.Chicken is a great example. If you buy a standard supermarket chicken, you have to cover it in herbs and spices or even marinate it overnight to get a decent flavour out of it. Get yourself a poulet de bresse, and it’s a whole different story. These birds have been bred in the same French province for centuries, they have loads of space to run around, and they’re encouraged to eat a varied diet. Because of all that, you can put it straight in the oven on a low heat for an hour, then take it out, cover it in salt, and put it back in on high for 15 minutes, and you’ve got a meal for four that tastes out of this world.If you’ve got really nice bull’s heart tomatoes, cucumber and some olive oil, it’s pretty easy to just mix it up into a great salad to go with it crap vegetables make crap salads, and then you need to make it more complicated to make it taste better, which is a false economy. French culinary sensibilities make solo dining low effort too. I remember sitting out one night in Portugal with a tin of Ortiz tuna and crusty bread, and I just spent the whole evening on my balcony eating that with some drinks. It was perfect – no mayonnaise necessary.Speaking of drinks, when it comes to cocktails the same rules apply. If you’ve got good quality Grey Goose Vodka, you don’t need to mask the taste with syrupy mixers. Rather, you should let the inherent quality of Grey Goose Vodka do the talking, using it as the perfect base for botanical and classic citrus flavours such as elderflower, lemon juice or lime juice, as they complement the vodka without overpowering it – both Le Grand Fizz and Paris to Pampelonne are cocktails that add something new to the vodka without distracting from its taste. Grey Goose cocktails are wonderfully versatile too. If you’re pairing with something sweet, an Espresso Martini with high-quality espresso will balance things out nicely.Going straight to suppliers gives your food a story as well, which makes for great dinner party conversation. Customers love it when we wax lyrical about where our produce comes from in my restaurants, and so will your dinner party guests. Around six years ago, I was Instagramming some fishermen in their boat, and they were telling me what fish they’d caught that morning, and the next day it was in my restaurant. People love to hear these sorts of anecdotes because they help them feel connected to the food, which is why “I got it from the supermarket” never quite cuts it when you’re entertaining at home. While you will probably have picked your vodka from the supermarket, with a brand like Grey Goose there’s still a story to tell. Grey Goose is made with only two ingredients: single-origin Picardie winter wheat and water from its natural limestone well – a true reflection of Grey Goose’s French sensibilities.Check out some more cocktail recipes at greygoose"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd32eb2b3b16569e035616d0ea89a510963c9809/0_284_5747_3448/master/5747.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04a19e00ba1d62bf60344cdeab06b57f","title":"send us your questions for john humphrys","story":"The Today presenter has asked his final question.

The group’s chairman, Simon Bax, a former top executive at Pixar who sits on the board of Channel 4, will take the role of executive chairman.The company, which was co-founded in 1845 by mustard magnates the Colman family, has also decided to close its printing operation at Thorpe, outside of Norwich, which employs about 96 staff.The closure of the site, which prints Archant’s four daily newspapers and virtually all of its 50 weekly ones, brings an end to the company printing titles locally. It is understood the printing of its newspapers is to be outsourced to News UK, the publisher of the Sun and the Times.The combination of cost savings and commercial revenue from the seven-year deal makes the outsourcing move worth millions annually to Archant. The majority of Archant’s printing staff will transfer to News UK, which will print the titles at its operation at Broxbourne, however this is located more than 100 miles away from Norwich.Since joining in 2014, Henry, a former senior ITV executive, has battled to replace the inexorable decline in sales and ad revenue from print with income from digital sources as well as events and exhibitions.The strain local newspaper proprietors are facing can be seen in the sales decline of Archant’s flagship title, the 149-year old Eastern Daily Press. Sales in the UK’s biggest-selling morning regional newspaper have decreased by two-thirds since 2000, when its circulation stood at more than 75,000. Circulation has more than halved in the last decade to 25,600.Last week, Archant announced a landmark three-year, multimillion pound deal with Google called Project Neon. This will focus on local digital news run by the publisher’s chief content officer, Matt Kelly.The owners of Archant, which also publishes about 60 specialist and local magazine titles including London Bride and Pilot, have tentatively explored a potential sale of the business. Last year, talks were held with Newsquest, the UK’s second-biggest regional newspaper group, but they fizzled out.The business is also a potential takeover target, or partner, for David Montgomery’s new publicly listed National World venture. The former Mirror group chief has assembled a team of executives – including Vijay Vaghela, a former finance chief at Reach, formerly known as Trinity Mirror – to “buy and build” a regional newspaper group. Montgomery is also eyeing a bid for JPI Media, which owns titles including the Scotsman, Yorkshire Post and the i, which is up for sale.However, any potential buyer will have to deal with Archant’s pension deficit, which stands at about £30m. Archant sold its loss-making local TV station, Mustard TV, to That’s TV in 2017."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4bc1a85fd86ba55c4499f4cacc3d829e24db615c/0_1143_3550_2130/master/3550.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=74981bdb26b64d4ea5043b679ea2637b","title":"coop bank card payment claim consumer credit act","story":"I paid, but my son’s name is on the log book so it won’t meet my claim under Consumer Credit ActIn April 2017 I bought a 50cc AJS Modena scooter for my 16-year-old son.

The queue stretches across the front of several chain stores with people from all over the country – and even Italy – waiting to be let in.The 100 Club might be better known for its punk rock history, but the 6Ts Rhythm and Soul Society nights are celebrating their 40th anniversary, thus making it the longest-running club night in London and the longest-running northern soul night in the world. Despite recent club closures and changing music tastes, 6Ts has held firm.The room is full by around 11.30pm with barely any space to dance most people are over the age of 45, with an equal split of men and women. With the DJ gauging that the crowd are anticipating northern soul’s biggest anthems, that’s what we get: Sandi Sheldon’s You’re Gonna Make Me Love You, Soul Incorporated’s My Proposal and Luther Ingram’s If It’s All the Same to You Babe. The dancefloor is quickly coated in sweat from the dancers’ faces. There’s a lot of swift, nifty footwork, including some trademark northern soul spins and shuffles, which are greatly aided by the talcum powder laid down to add traction.By the bar is a small record stall with originals fetching anywhere between £20 and £900. The crate-digging culture on the northern soul scene is often likened to train-spotting, complete with sage discussion of matrix numbers etched into the record itself. The most expensive northern soul record to date is Frank Wilson’s Do I Love You (Indeed I Do), which was sold at auction for £25,000 in 2009 – there are only two known copies in existence.Northern soul in the 70s was counter-cultural, and many looked to 6Ts for new discoveries of long-lost records that had been found by record collectors on regular visits to American warehouses and record company vaults. Some were often demos from singers who made one song, and then went back to their regular jobs as bus drivers or cleaners.“Before 6Ts we had northern soul nights in London but only 30 or 40 people would turn up, as opposed to thousands up north,” Ady explains. “We were all on a big learning curve, but we already knew a lot of people, and being a record dealer I had a good reputation with other DJs and collectors.”As a result, soulies from all over the country would flock to London just to hear rare records on a Friday night. To this day, Croasdell puts its success down to “mainly luck” and playing “exclusive new-old discoveries that put us at the cutting-edge of northern soul”.After a hop from Covent Garden to West Hampstead, he moved to the 100 Club in 1981. To commemorate each passing anniversary, they release a 7in single, only available to those who buy a ticket – some fetch up to hundreds of pounds on eBay. This year’s release was Ready or Not, Here Comes Love by Carolyn Crawford with I Stand Blue by Mickey Stevenson as the B-side. At around 2am, when it’s Croasdell’s turn to man the decks onstage, he airs it: “You all have this single, and it’s fucking great!”At 3am, fellow 6Ts promoter, curator and DJ Matt Bolton, as well as resident DJ Butch, make a framed presentation to Croasdell for his Outstanding Contribution to Soul Music, with touching tributes from other DJs on the soul scene. There’s a poignant, touching tribute for “a few of those that can’t be with us tonight”, referring to co-founder Randy Cozens, who died of cancer in 2003, with an airing of Bettye Swann’s Kiss My Love Goodbye.When the all-nighter comes to a close at 6am on Sunday morning, the traditional final three songs of every 6Ts night play out: Carla Thomas’s I’ll Never Stop Loving You, Four Tops’ Baby I Need Your Loving, and Walter Jackson’s That’s What Mama Say. Walking outside after eight hours of dancing, there’s a feeling that – middle-aged or not – 6Ts punters still have a lot of energy left in those legs.“An atypical Stax sound, found in an annotated tape box in the company’s library. It is probably a Detroit production from the late 60s, when Al Bell got Stax artists to cut with Don Davis for a slicker sound. Played at the club at 5.55am – as the penultimate record of the all-nighters – it’s a goose-pimples moment for a tired and emotional crowd.”“Discovered in a Harlesden, London, studio, while listening to a wrongly marked tape box from indie Detroit producer and guitarist Dave Hamilton’s vaults. Little Ann had a massive track, What Should I Do, in Wigan Casino’s final years this tough, heartbroken, yet angry song, which Ann wrote with Dave, cemented her place as a lost soul heroine.”“An unmarked 8in metal acetate record was discovered in a Hanway Street record shop about 200 yards away from the 100 Club in London’s West End. It sounded incredible and turned out to be the great Ben E King on the third track – that missed the 45 cut – from his session with Leiber \u0026amp Stoller for Atlantic. As the only known copy in the world, this dramatic recording quickly became a 6Ts anthem that drew rare soul fans to the club like moths to a flame.”“Darrow Fletcher was a 14-year-old hit Chicago soul singer with The Pain Gets a Little Deeper in 1965. Ten years later he was in LA where he had matured into a talented, expressive vocalist and recorded this track for Ray Charles. The projected LP didn’t make the presses but Kent Records acquired the masters and the song is now considered a modern soul classic.”“The first of the unissued tape discoveries to really take off and become massive on the northern and scooter scenes across the world. Its dynamic production by NYC veteran Stan Kahan on Brill Building writer Ted Daryll’s opus, was perfect for the teenage Melba Moore on her first recording. It would have rammed Wigan Casino’s dancefloor in any era.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d306efb7b0f61c9173e3319d0f9ff2824f63263/0_26_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f3971d792d0c3771267bee91859f5c1","title":"une mark radcliffe electronica god im not just some radio bloke having a dabble","story":"The DJ has made an album inspired by untranslatable words, recorded with a bloke he met in the pub called Paul Langley. So what does ‘boketto’ mean?Mark Radcliffe and Paul Langley are sipping tea in central Manchester. The former is the much-loved radio star the latter is something of a mystery. “Good, the less said the better,” Langley says from behind his spectacles and pot of Earl Grey. However, I do know he once made an EP in an outfit called Rack-It! “That was with Martyn Walsh from Inspiral Carpets,” he laughs. “He said, ‘You wanna do a track called Sex on Acid – that’ll annoy people.’ And it did.”Radcliffe and Langley are, they tell me, “soon to be legendary”. This will be in the guise of UNE, the name they have given themselves. The pair have made Lost, an album of lovely, plaintive electronica over which Radcliffe sings. They met five years ago in the Builder’s Arms in Knutsford, Cheshire. Radcliffe, new to the area, asked locals which pub was dog-friendly. This led to dog-walk encounters with Langley, and the pair were soon bantering over pints, about music and Manchester City.One day Langley mentioned the fact he made electronic music, and Radcliffe groaned. “I didn’t think it would be any good,” he says, “because he’s such a clown. But his hidden shallows turned out to be hidden depths. When I heard it, I thought, ‘This is surprisingly good.’”Radcliffe was reading Lost in Translation, Ella Frances Sanders’ illustrated compendium of untranslatable words from around the world. He wondered if it was possible to write a song called Boketto, which means “to gaze vacantly into the distance without thinking” in Japanese. “So I’d give Paul the idea and the picture from the book. He’d write music and I’d go away and write words.” The pair were surprised at how effectively this created what Radcliffe calls “electronic pop songs, but very warm and dreamlike”.Radcliffe hopes UNE aren’t seen as “some radio bloke having a dabble”. He was, after all, in bands before becoming a DJ. “I’ve never really seen a ide between the two. Sometimes it helps and sometimes it doesn’t because radio people think, ‘We can’t play that – it’s Mark.’ I just hope we get the same chance as everyone else.”Over the years, his DJing has coexisted with playing in the not-yet-legendary pirate folkies Galleon Blast, spoof combo the Shirehorses, and Dr Feelgood-inspired Mark Radcliffe and the Big Figures. Early on, he even played drums in Skrewdriver, before singer Ian Donaldson became known as a white supremacist. “There were never any obvious signs of that while I was in them,” says the avowedly anti-racist DJ. “He did wear jackboots, though. God, I’m making this worse, aren’t I?”Meanwhile, UNE’s press release calls Langley a “Haçienda DJ-booth fixture”. Langley laughs. “My brother was actually the DJ. But I carried his record box around the world.”Radcliffe’s radio career began in 1979 when, at the age of 21, Manchester’s Piccadilly Radio asked him to present Transmissions, a show about the music exploding in the city, triggered by Joy Division and Factory Records. “I thought, ‘How hard can that be?’ I tried to be Manchester’s John Peel, telling people what we were playing in a manic depressive voice.”In 1997, he found himself (alongside ex-Fall guitarist Marc “Lard” Riley) briefly hosting Radio 1’s flagship breakfast show. “It was the biggest show in Europe – until we took it over,” he chuckles. Their anarchic, edgy, Mancunian humour didn’t always travel. “I’ve never forgotten the focus-group woman in Guildford who said, ‘I don’t pay my licence fee to hear scummy northerners.’”But his radio persona – self-effacing, ordinary bloke lost in music – works because it’s real. Langley roars at the tale Radcliffe tells of the time he and Lard were in David Bowie’s dressing room with the star asking where “Heroes” should go on the setlist. “I’m thinking, ‘Is this really happening?’” Radcliffe hoots. “Don’t ask us, Dave!” In August last year, Radcliffe was diagnosed with cancer. As Langley ferried his mate around during treatment, the pair became even closer. Radcliffe is now cancer-free and doesn’t want to spend his life worrying that it will come back. After well-received performances at Bluedot and Kendal Calling festivals, there will be more gigs, although the pair have yet to master the demands of being electronic gods.“One night,” says Radcliffe, “instead of singing, ‘The distant clatter of a thunderstorm’, I sang, ‘The distant clatter of a leprechaun.’ You can see the trouble we’ve got.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9adf199ee34a97f4a616ae286addfb3d52c5417b/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e13cb6eefbc27ad6930201103a1296c","title":"how to your way into an ivy league school","story":"Journalist Evgenia Peretz discusses how US college tutor Rick Singer persuaded so many parents to take part in one of the biggest university scandals the Department of Justice has ever prosecuted.

This was later confirmed by a Labour spokesman. “This crisis can only be settled with a general election. That election needs to take place as soon as this government’s threat of a disastrous no deal is taken off the table,” Corbyn said.Corbyn set out his plan to win an election then negotiate a Brexit deal within three months, and hold a second referendum within six months without saying which way Labour would campaign.This appeared to squash the idea that Corbyn, as a temporary prime minister, could push for a second referendum and get Brexit sorted before a general election to focus on domestic issues – which is promoted by some MPs, including a few of his allies. A Labour spokesman later reiterated that the policy is election first, referendum second.Corbyn showed how he would fight an election as the anti-establishment candidate, rubbishing Johnson’s claims of being the voice of the people against parliament. “In a shameless bid to turn reality on its head, Boris Johnson’s born-to-rule Tories are now claiming to be the voice of the people,” he said. “A political party that exists to protect the establishment is pretending to be anti-establishment. Johnson and his wealthy friends are not only on the side of the establishment they are the establishment.”Corbyn announced a major new policy of a state-owned generic drug manufacturer to supply cheaper medicines to the NHS. This would stop big pharmaceutical companies charging the NHS over the odds for medicines. “We will redesign the system to serve public health – not private wealth – using compulsory licensing to secure generic versions of patented medicines,” he said. “We’ll tell the drugs companies that if they want public research funding then they’ll have to make their drugs affordable for all. And we will create a new publicly owned generic drugs manufacturer to supply cheaper medicines to our NHS, saving our health service money and saving lives.”Corbyn ran through a series of big, bold policies announced by his shadow ministers at the conference including: “Crossrail for the north” nationalising the rail, postal and water industries plus the National Grid free prescriptions free personal care for the elderly and a net-zero emissions target for 2030. The policies go even further than Labour’s 2017 general election manifesto and may come with a large price tag. But Labour is calculating that people will be won over by ideas to make their lives easier if the tax burden falls on the very wealthiest and businesses. The party says its manifesto will be fully costed so the books are balanced."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf7e1726bcfd08185d42621e70ef9fd2bee47a03/0_219_6579_3947/master/6579.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a4081064e41e80ba357f305dd2a12e37","title":"30 year child health study parenting alspac jean golding","story":"At a bright green table scattered with toys and juice cups sit Charlotte and her six-year-old daughter Amelia, while two-year-old Isabella races a yellow plastic shopping trolley across the floor. Being here is much more fun than school, announces Amelia, as she shows off the animal plaster that covers her (apparently painless) blood test to a smiling Professor Jean Golding.The emeritus professor of paediatrics and perinatal epidemiology at the University of Bristol is founder of the hugely influential Avon Longitudinal Study of Pregnancy and Childhood (Alspac), better known as Children of the 90s (CO90s). She has just turned 80 and has just published her latest paper on child health.Charlotte, who doesn’t want her surname used, belongs to the original cohort of children, her mother recruited in pregnancy, while Amelia and Isabella are the third generation – the so-called Children of the Children of the 90s (COCO90s). Their arrival has made this study unique for the length, breadth and depth of its data on medical, social, genetic, environmental, and inter-generational factors affecting our health and wellbeing. Now involving 27,600 people, a biobank of 1.2m samples (including DNA, urine and placenta), and countless questions and answers, it has led to more than 2,000 research papers and had a significant impact on policy.The UK and US governments’ 1990s Back to Sleep campaigns (advising that babies sleep more safely on their backs) were informed by Alspac work, as was the US government shift to advise women to eat fish in pregnancy. And data from CO90s babies revealed that using peanut oil on infants’ skin – then common in baby creams – increased the risk of allergic sensitisation.Golding’s idea for Alspac was considered “crazy … impossible”, she admits, when she first proposed following every pregnancy in the Bristol area with a due date between April 1991 and December 1992, and then studying the parents and children as they grew. The big funders, including the Medical Research Council (MRC), refused to commit to “this monster”, says Golding, waiting almost a decade before getting involved in what Bristol University had started. “And scientists said it would never work,” she adds. “They said we should concentrate on one topic.”The whole point was to collect as much information as possible – including data they didn’t yet have a use for – maximising the ability to make unexpected connections. She wanted it to be open access too, and Alspac now has more than 800 registered users in dozens of countries. In the last six years, 1,000 COCO90s have been added to the cohort, and a further 2,500 are expected in the next five years as the CO90s tip into their 30s.The reasons aren’t yet clear, but Alspac is working on it. In the meantime, the finding has led to calls for better mental health screening in pregnancy and greater availability of treatment. As a child, Golding spent months at a time in hospital and contracted polio at the age of 13, which left her permanently disabled. Being ill so much meant she “spent a lot of time watching,” she says. “So I really am an observer.”Clearly clever at school, she only realised many years later that her teachers were fighting over which of them would get the kudos of sending her to read their subject at a top university. Her interests were zoology, psychology and chemistry, but the maths teacher convinced her that she would be unable to do lab and field work - “I had a calliper and on uneven ground I would fall down” - so she went to Oxford to read maths.“I attended the first statistics lecture and thought ‘this is rubbish’. They kept saying ‘approximate’. I don’t like approximate. I like to know exactly.” She switched to another branch of maths. She uses stats now of course? “Yes,” she agrees, “but with care!”She stood down as scientific director of Alspac aged 65, but her research is going strong. This month she published a paper showing that the children of mothers who take paracetamol in pregnancy (around half of mothers-to-be in Europe and America) are more likely to have behavioural difficulties, including hyperactivity in their early years. Though these particular difficulties resolve by age eight, Golding says other associations may come to light and advises, “pregnant women should reduce their intake of drugs, including over-the-counter drugs, whenever possible”.Her research results often bring surprises, she says. In her current work on “fascinating” transgenerational effects, she recently found that if the grandmother smoked in pregnancy (yes, the grandmother), the grandchild was likely to have a higher than expected birthweight but a slightly raised risk of autism and obesity. Traumatic events cascade down the generations, sometimes in unexpected ways. “Shock in one generation can be linked to a higher rates of obesity later on,” she says. “And one study involving grandparents who had been in one of the great famines of the second world war found that their sons have better mental health than others.” Golding is now studying families with refugees, war deaths and similar challenges in their background and is “open to any results”.Her other main focus is locus of control. This identifies people as either “internals”, who feel they have some control over their fate, and “externals”, who think life happens to them and there isn’t much point in trying to change it. “The main psychologist in the field pushed for us to include questions on this from the start,” says Golding, “and it turns out to have a big effect on the way people live and parent.Clearly, Golding isn’t retiring any time soon. “I think I have enough to keep me going until I’m 100,” she says. Meanwhile, younger colleagues are developing new techniques for direct collection of data – including via smart devices and miniature head cameras – and examining social media, both for its use in data gathering and the effect it has on us.Alspac’s role, Timpson believes, is to “make observations, explain them to government, push for specific policies and see practical change”. It’s a powerful model that has already proved its worth.Charlotte is gathering her daughters ready to go home. She has always been proud to be one of the Children of the 90s, she says, and she hopes Amelia and Isabella will be too. With luck, she adds, she’ll see their children joining as the COCOCO90s, bringing still more insight and improvement to our health and wellbeing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77091c190b5ef097bd802eb9d593bbb4490d0c7c/1_0_2999_1799/master/2999.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d738c48526abb397c9f0e06dce21b70b","title":"talking horses enable continues smooth buildup prix arc de triomphe racing tips","story":"Enable continued the smooth buildup to her attempt to become the first horse to win the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe three times, when she made what could well be her final visit to a British racecourse on Wednesday morning.John Gosden’s mare exercised under her regular jockey Frankie Dettori on Newmarket’s Rowley Mile course, covering a mile with the useful handicapper Crossed Baton and finishing just in front of her galloping companion.“I’m very pleased with her work,” Gosden said afterwards. “I wanted her to just stay with her lead horse and she’s had a good, healthy blow. It went to plan, and that doesn’t always happen with work mornings.“She’s going to have to be in top form to win the Arc. I don’t think she’s going to go winning it off what she did last year. You always have to be in top order to win a race like that.”Teddy Grimthorpe, racing manager to Enable’s owner, Prince Khalid Abdullah, was also in attendance and confirmed that all has gone well in the build-up to her final race.  “Her preparation has been straightforward, we’ve had no issues and she’s been in good form,” Grimthorpe said. “It was a good, solid piece of work and just what everyone seemed to want to see. Frankie was happy with her.” Enable is generally top-priced at 8-11 to win her third Arc next Sunday, with Aidan O’Brien’s Japan next in the betting at 13-2. The International Stakes winner is just ahead of Sotsass, who took the French Derby in June, on 7-1. Ghaiyyath is a 12-1 shot and it is 16-1 bar.Ed Arkell, the clerk of the course at Goodwood, described the track as “slightly soggy” this morning in a going update on Twitter, proving himself a master of understatement as he did so. There are a still a few prices worth taking, though, including the 7-2 about Nette Rousse (4.10) in the fillies’ handicap. Ralph Beckett’s filly has winning form on good-to-soft going and notched her second victory in her last three starts when upped to 12 furlongs for the first time at Leicester last month. She has looked a little quirky in the closing stages at times but there is little wrong with the bulk of her form and another step up in trip could see further progress.Air Pilot (3.40), a 10-year-old, is at least six years older than all five of his remaining rivals in the Listed Foundation Stakes but he remains relatively lightly-raced for a horse of his vintage and also has plenty of form with cut in the ground, including a Group Two victory on heavy going in April last year. He is worth an interest at around 5-1, along with Tukhoom (2.30) in the claiming handicap, while Lydiate Lady (2.20) and Round The Island (3.25) should both go well on the card at Redcar.

Even Crown Prince Akishino came. The game was fit for a king, too, the first upset of this World Cup.Uruguay, a team with just 22 professional players, beat Fiji 30-27. It was Uruguay’s first World Cup win in 16 years, since they beat Georgia in 2003. Given that the only other match they’ve ever won in the World Cup was against Spain in 1999, it must rate as the greatest game they’ve ever played.Fiji, on the other hand, were abysmal – tired, sloppy, and complacent. Five days after they started with a defeat to Australia in Sapporo, their World Cup is as good as over. In 1987, Fiji made it to the quarter-finals even though they’d lost two group games. France did it again in 2011. No one else ever has.The Fiji coach, John McKee, mentioned how little time the team had to get ready for this game, but said he didn’t want to use it as an excuse. “It was certainly one of the things we talked about before the match,” McKee said, “we knew we were coming off the short turnaround and that Uruguay were going to be very focused on this first match. We tried to take the same mindset from Australia into this game.”McKee had made 12 changes so this was, in the large part, a fresh team. The truth is that, as McKee said himself, “we made too many errors during the game and Uruguay capitalised on them, especially in the first half, and then we were chasing the game. which put us under a lot of pressure.”Their coach saw this ambush coming, but that didn’t stop the Fiji team blundering into it. The Pacific islanders beat Uruguay 68-7 just last year, and are nine places above them in the world rankings. Uruguay’s coach, Esteban Meneses, explained that his team have spent the last four years working their socks off at their new high performance centre in Montevideo, preparing for this match and their next one, against Georgia.Fiji, Meneses explained, “are two very different teams, one when they have the ball, another when they don’t.” Uruguay’s strategy was to “keep possession and play with our own rhythm.” Fiji were completely foxed, and Uruguay led by 24-12 at half-time.Uruguay scored three tries in that time, and came within an inch of a fourth. This was after Fiji had taken the lead once, with one try off the back of a scrum penalty and an attacking line-out, and then again, with another. In between, Uruguay scored their first when Leone Nakawara spilled a wild offload, and nimble scrum-half Santiago Arata pounced. He wriggled, slipped, and squirmed through three tackles on his way to the try-line.That made it 12-7, but given the try was a breakaway, against the run of play, there was nothing in it that suggested what was going to happen next. Juan Manuel Cat charged down a clearance by Fiji’s full-back Alivereti Veitokani, and their No 8, Manuel Diana, scored off the line-out that followed.Then, while Semi Radradra and Veitokani were tussling about which of them was going to catch a high ball, Uruguay’s full back Gaston Mieres swept through and claimed it instead. The South Americans worked the ball across to the left, where Rodrigo Silva put Cat through to score with a spectacular offload.Radrada almost gifted the underdogs a fourth with another loose pass to Veitokani, which Andres Vilaseca hacked downfield. The two of them raced each other to the ball as it bobbled over the line, but the replays showed Vilaseca had just knocked on as he ed for it.At the beginning of the second half, Fiji were even worse. Tevita Ratuva blew a three-on-one overlap and Josh Matevesi missed a couple of goal kicks from schoolboy range, one of them a conversion after Api Ratuniyarawa bullied his way over for Fiji’s third. They finally began to improve when McKee started bringing on his replacements.Uruguay never did get that fourth try, but it didn’t matter. Felipe Berchesi kicked two penalties, and that put them eight points up, even though Nikola Matawalu scored a fourth for Fiji. So, even when Matawala got a fifth in the very last minute, it wasn’t enough to win it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/568a551c8a35b41b31bd12079fd484a55a75d2f6/0_191_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=41e0a79368d507e6289c6edaeae7d2dd","title":"cycling road world championships 2019 mens time trial live","story":"Ramunas Navardauskas of Lithuania will be the first rider down the start ramp at 13.18 BST.Here is how the podium looked last year.

Despite a cataclysm that has robbed them of their stock and their customers, owners Noni (Rakie Ayola) and John Daniel (Rhys Ifans), along with their assistant Ifan William (Sion Daniel Young), remain steadfast. Into their lives of dignified defiance enters Jason Hughes’s Captain.Ed Thomas’s play, presented by National Theatre Wales and the Royal Court, is set after an undefined societal, environmental and deeply personal catastrophe. When there is no meat left to butcher or consume, sustenance is derived from the enunciation of words. The characters luxuriate in and savour language. Although no longer able to speak “the old language” – lost, like the chapel, to rampant urban capitalism – words become maps and pieces of jigsaws, the only things that tether these sad figures to their present. Co-directed by the playwright alongside Vicky Featherstone, this is Thomas’s first stage play for 15 years. In many ways, it is a continuation of his earlier theatrical works, which were a mixture of lyrical realism and absurdity, located in often beleaguered Welsh landscapes.It is finely acted. Ifans and Ayola suggest a life lived together with heartbreaking ease, both saturated to their bones with grief. Ayola’s performance is beautiful, possessing a grounded stillness that holds together the entire world. She and Young find surprising emotional nuance in brief, throwaway lines. As the Captain, Hughes provides an eloquent counterpoint to the family’s emotional inertia. In Cai Dyfan’s handsome design, the shop opens into a claustrophobic expanse, and Elliot Griggs’s lighting – golds and flashes and silhouettes – sets mood as well as rhythm.But while persuasively staged, the script meanders like the Captain lost on a snowy hillside. Exchanges feel tautological. Though labouring through language might be critical when language itself is the last mode of survival, it nevertheless inhibits the drama. The resolution, when it arrives, feels sudden. One feels the play aims at a Beckettian nowhere while also being somewhere very specific that its old language is a metaphor for all old languages, when it is clearly a specific old language. It’s an ambitious mixture, for sure, but at the end its ambitions are unreconciled."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cab42c751fed857c20b25ffd14ee4b0f8d8045f8/96_156_4396_2638/master/4396.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e07550cfc6b34ac9b8fb0ce8cf613f8a","title":"woods forests activities autumn colours wildlife walks","story":"Foraging, wildlife, art, cycling and walks feature in this pick of autumnal activities, set to a glorious backdrop this year as leaf colours promise to be particularly richWestonbirt Arboretum near Tetbury is one of the best places in the UK to view a huge variety of autumn colours.

The streaming service already screens Fleabag in more than 200 countries and territories including the US.“I’m insanely excited to be continuing my relationship with Amazon. Working with the team on Fleabag was the creative partnership dreams are made of. It really feels like home. I can’t wait to get going,” Waller-Bridge said as the announcement was made on Tuesday.While she emphasised the creative benefits, the news echoed growing warnings from senior UK television industry figures that homegrown British on-screen talent is increasingly being bought up by international rivals which “increasingly want to decide what we read, watch and listen to”.Alex Mahon, the chief executive of Channel 4, told the Royal Television Society conference on Thursday there was a “growing concentration of power in the hands just a few tech behemoths”.She added that such firms were motivated by their own commercial interests, which might lead them to promote their own content first, “whether it’s Amazon boosting its own products on marketplace, Google prioritising its own podcasts or Netflix serving us its own productions”.That was followed by a warning from the former BBC director general, Mark Thompson, who will say the UK is facing “a total loss of culture sovereignty”.Thompson will tell an audience at the Steve Hewlett memorial lecture in London on Tuesday night: “No one wants to see the UK turn into a cultural ‘Airstrip One’, but it’s a clear and present danger. With newspapers struggling and broadcasters outgunned, I fear only effective and salient government media policy stands between Britain and a total loss of cultural sovereignty.”Fleabag and those associated with it won six awards at the Emmys, including honours for writing, directing and acting, as well as casting and editing. The programme was also named the overall outstanding comedy series.The programme features Waller-Bridge as a young woman living in London who provides the audience with outrageous and intimate details of her life.

By 2040, the airport is expected to expand to eight runways and accommodate 100 million passengers a year.Officials have been showing off the sleek new airport for the past year, hosting tours of the space, which is to include customer-service robots to deliver flight information and facial recognition-enabled check-in.Critics have questioned the need for a second airport in the capital, especially one that is almost twice the distance from the city centre as the existing airport.Officials say Daxing will alleviate traffic pressure on the city’s existing international travel hub, Beijing Capital in the north-east, which had more than 100 million travellers last year, second in the world only to Hartsfield-Jackson airport in Atlanta, Georgia, in terms of passenger traffic.China is expected to surpass the US to become the world’s largest market for airport travel by 2022. But the aviation sector has a poor reputation for flight disruptions, the result of frequents delays caused by overcapacity and delays caused by the military, which controls most of the airspace. Officials hope the new airport will lessen those delays.Domestic and foreign airlines, including China Southern Airlines, China Eastern Airlines, Air China as well as British Airways and Finnair, have said they will move all or part of their operations to the new airport."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4029731.1569389581!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"higgins urges us to reverse decision on paris climate accord","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPresident Michael D Higgins delivers his address at  New York University on Tuesday. Photograph: Maxwell’s President Michael D Higgins has urged the United States to revisit its decision to leave the Paris climate change agreement, as he argued that climate change is the most pressing issue facing the global community.In a speech delivered at New York University on Tuesday evening, Mr Higgins highlighted the threat posed by climate change.“Failure to take radical, urgent action in relation to climate change that will effectively subject future generations to an existence of threat in an ever more bleak and volatile planet, and in human terms one that is likely to lead to the forced displacement of millions of people including those at the front line in small island developing countries,” Mr Higgins said.He addressed the decision by the Trump administration to exit the Paris accord, expressing his “profound disappointment” at the move.“I do urge the United States Government to revisit and reconsider this decision to exit the Paris agreement, a decision which could take effect from November next year,” he said.“Unless we collectively take action to prevent catastrophic climate change, together with a real commitment and transfer of resources towards assisting communities to prepare for, and adapt to, changing climates, these population flows, driven by climate shifts, will take place in a context of old revived and emerging new conflicts becoming available to be exploited by extremists,” he said.Keynote addressMr Higgins was speaking ahead of a keynote address to the UN General Assembly on Wednesday. Earlier, the President said that he believed Ireland had a “good case to make” for securing a seat on the UN Security Council in 2021 and 2022.Noting that much of the decision-making is made by the five big members of the security council, he noted that small countries have historically been able to effect change on the security council. Noting that about 100 of the UN member states have populations the same or less than Ireland he said: “They are actually the ones who speak on issues like proliferation, cluster bombs, disarmament and climate change.”Mr Higgins defended his own practices in relation to climate change, as well as those practiced in Áras an Uachtaráin, noting that he planned to travel by ship to Athens and Cyprus in October, while he regularly travels to Belfast by train.In his speech at New York University on Tuesday evening, he also said that Ireland “believes profoundly” in the United Nations, highlighting how Ireland, like the United Nations itself, emerged from conditions of conflict. Ireland’s “long and painful” escape from a colonial past means that it can empathise with so many countries in the UN he said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4029264.1569367150!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"students on thunberg at the end of the day it is our planet","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tStudents at Dublin’s O’Connell Secondary School, from left, McKenzie O’Connor, Bepo Jacan, Tighe O’Driscoll and Arseniy Kuznecovs. Photograph: Tom HonanSixteen-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg might be just one inidual but for students attending Dublin’s O’Connell Secondary School, she is not alone. Her message on climate change broadcast from New York City last week, when she led the Global Climate Strike, and her comments delivered to the assembled leaders at the United Nations on Monday resonated deeply with students. “She is inspirational when you think of what she can do at such an age,” said Arseniy Kuznelovs (16). “I’ve seen a few talks of hers and she mentioned how much one kid can do. I think that is an accurate statement – can you imagine what all of us could do if we teamed up?” Fifth-year student Bepo Jacan, who is also 16, said: “I remember when she said the Earth was on fire. I really liked that point. When we think of the Amazon rain forest and everything that has happened there over the last few months, we need to do something or the Earth is going to die. Everything is going the wrong way currently. But she is really making a difference especially when it comes to the younger generation.”Teenagers see life through a different lens and students at the 191-year-old school on North Richmond Street agreed Thunberg’s age should not cloud opinions.Not like adults“It is different when you get an opinion from another age group who see things differently and not like adults,” says Arseniy. “They shouldn’t really be devaluing anything she says – they should be taking it into account like any other person.”The youngest of the students The  spoke to, 13-year-old McKenzie O’Connor, agreed, and while he thought the younger generation should be listened to more “they think young people are irresponsible”, he said. Tighe O’Driscoll (14), a second-year student, has helped plan an aquaponic garden for the school and, for him, no change is too small.“Of course there are changes people can make,” he said. “For instance, we bring in our own reusable water bottles which stops us from buying plastic water bottles. It’s the small things. It’s not going to save the planet – but it is us doing our part.”A year ago Thunberg was sitting outside a school in Sweden and just 12 months later she was at the head of a social movement that has held marches in 150 countries across the world. “I think what she has done is a great thing,” said Tighe. “From just one girl on her own to attracting millions of views and millions of people around the world trying to support her. “And, at the end of the day, it is our planet and we should be the ones that should save it.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"IPCC predicts increased deadly heatwaves and losses of sea iceBritain\u0026rsquos leader faces uncertain future and narrowing options after a brutal court rulingIMO warns patients could face \u0026ldquochaotic winter amid dispute over two-tier payBoris Johnson and Leo Varadkar hold \u0026lsquoconstructive and productive\u0026rsquo meetingPresident says climate change is the most pressing issue facing the global communityBernard Gloster says key objective of his tenure will be winning public\u0026rsquos confidenceEPA found levels of harmful particles could be twice as high in areas without restrictionEPA report says fossil fuel vehicles and fires contribute to 1,800 deaths a yearDublin students voice their support for teenage Swedish activist on climate actionStand-alone fund may require legislation, finance spokesman tells front benchGovernment may access contingency fund to back at-risk sectors in event of no-deal BrexitHealth authority warns \u0026lsquono absolute guarantees\u0026rsquo on critical medicines such as insulinPeter Tyndall to criticise use of hotels as accommodation for asylum applicantsIreland\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquohospital-obsessed\u0026rsquo health system should be \u0026lsquoflipped on head\u0026rsquo, academic arguesTips for graduates looking to make structured start to their careersMy Career Path: Reamonn Mac Reamoinn was a Fulbright Irish Awardee to Johns Hopkins University where he completed a Masters in Civil Engineering.Women in the workforce: It is often left up to iniduals to challenge company culture themselvesAG has postponed decision on new inquest appeal several times, campaigners sayMinister of State Mary Mitchell O\u0026rsquoConnor says statistics on student drug use anecdotal"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons september 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraph matt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178.Brexit latest news: John Bercow reopens Parliament as Boris Johnson prepares to give statement to MPsBoris Johnson could be forced to ask for Brexit delay next week under opposition plansRoyal Tour 2019: A guide to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u0026#39s South Africa itineraryWhat happens next for Brexit and Boris Johnson after the Supreme Court ruling on prorogation?Comment: Boris\u0026#39s stubborn refusal to give up on Brexit is making him a hero of the people\tAustralian defence chief warns climate change could \u0026#39stretch army capability\u0026#39 in private speechWhat next for Parliament?

The period granted is unusually short for a private hire licence. TfL could have granted a new term of up to five years.The transport body\u0026nbsppreviously removed Uber’s right to operate in the city in September 2017 due to alleged failings in its approach to reporting serious criminal offences and driver background checks.The decision prompted legal action, which led to a judge granting the Silicon Valley company a probationary 15-month licence in 2018 after it made several changes to its business model in London.London is one of the most important markets for the firm in Europe.A TfL spokesman said: “Uber London Limited has been granted a two-month private hire operator licence to allow for scrutiny of additional information that we are requesting ahead of consideration of any potential further licensing application.”Jamie Heywood, Uber’s regional general manager for Northern \u0026amp Eastern Europe, said the decision demonstrated TfL’s recognition of the company’s “improved culture and governance”.\u0026nbsp“We will continue to work closely with TfL and provide any additional requested information,” he said.“Over the past two years, we’ve launched a range of new safety features in the app, introduced better protections for drivers and our Clean Air Plan is helping to tackle air pollution.”Uber launches helicopter service between Manhattan and JFK airportHowever, unions claimed that TfL was still failing to properly regulate Uber.James Farrar, chair of the United Private Hire Drivers branch of the\u0026nbspIndependent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB)\u0026nbspsaid: “Once again, TfL’s failure to regulate effectively and Uber’s unwillingness to play by the rules has led to the jobs of 40,000 Uber drivers being thrown into uncertainty. Sadiq Khan must use this two-month license review period to insist Uber respect UK employment law as a condition of license.”The London Taxi Drivers’ Association described Uber as a “threat to public safety”.LTDA general secretary Steve McNamara said: “Over the last 15 months Uber was supposed to change its operations for the better, but the firm has continued to shirk its responsibilities.

The hosts were on the end of a thumping, as Australia won the first test by 251 runsWilf Gillett Coles, who is due to study physics at the university in October, was left without housing. He told Inside Out on BBC West: “Most people haven’t lived anywhere on their own and halls can be quite a nice transition period but we don’t have that.“We’ve just been thrown out into the wind.”Grace Whittaker, another student who had no accommodation, was told that there was\u0026nbsphousing in Langford, in North Somerset, and in\u0026nbspNewport – which is more than 30 miles away and in a different country.She said: “If you know how big the courses are, you know how many spaces you have for students and you know how many halls you have for students – so why give out so many offers and why let people through clearing if we are not going to have accommodation?”A record number of students across the country took up places on degrees through clearing this year.Competition between universities to recruit students, who pay £9,250 a year, has grown as there are fewer 18-year-olds in the population and yet student numbers at institutions\u0026nbspremain uncapped.\u0026nbspUniversities across the UK\u0026nbsphave been expanding in recent years – and the number of students at Bristol has risen by 15 per cent in three years, from 21,555 in 2014-15 to 24,850 in 2017-18.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Especially in first year it felt as if everyone was pushing into each other to sit there,” he said. “They are trying to stretch each course as much as possible.”Mr Braakman added that he thought the university was accepting too many people – similar to airlines overbooking flights.He said: “If I knew about the housing situation in Bristol, if it was transparent that there was not much accommodation in general, then I wouldn’t choose Bristol.”Mr Bemrose told The Independent:\u0026nbsp“There are still a number of postgraduate and Erasmus students who are struggling to find accommodation in the private market.”“I still think there is work that needs to be done to ensure all students are getting the help they need,” he added. “We need to prevent a similar situation happening in the future.”Eva Crossan Jory, vice president for welfare at the National Union of Students (NUS), said: “The fact that flying to and from university is a cheaper and simpler option than renting is a damning example of the housing crisis students are facing.“Universities are simply not doing enough to ensure all their students have access to affordable, safe and decent accommodation from the start.”Sarah Purdy, who is responsible for student wellbeing at the University of Bristol, said she was “really sorry” to hear students were anxious about a lack of accommodation.But she said the process was similar each year and it will be “same in every university” in the UK.Ms Purdy added: “I think this year there were larger numbers of students involved in the process in part because we had fewer students who decided to defer or withdraw from the guaranteed offer.”But she insisted that the university had not “let students in, over and above the numbers” it had planned to admit.A University of Bristol spokesperson said: “Colleagues in our accommodation team have been working incredibly hard over the past few weeks to inidually support those students who were not part of the 6,000 students we have already placed in university-owned or university-managed accommodation.“As each day has passed we have managed to bring down the number still looking for suitable accommodation and before our students started to arrive this weekend we were able to offer every student accommodation in Bristol or at our Langford campus.”They added: “We believe our website and the information we supply to students gaining a place at Bristol is clear about the accommodation we can offer and the processes we follow. We are sorry if Sohail or any other student feels it is not clear.“We always look to see where our processes can be improved and\u0026nbsp we will review our communications as part of this.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

This is how our interactions in VR and AR can one day look. It can change the way we connect.”Mr Bosworth goes on to explain exactly how this technology works, stating: “You have neurons in your spinal cord that send electrical signals to your hand muscles telling them to move in specific ways such as to click a mouse or press a button.“The wristband will decode those signals and translate them into a digital signal your device can understand, empowering you with control over your digital life.”Following Facebook\u0027s announcement of the acquisition, CTRL-Labs shared a message across its social media platforms that it is thrilled  to join Facebook Reality Labs, however not everyone was happy about the news.Recent scandals involving how Facebook handles and uses people\u0027s personal data raised some questions about the ethics of such technology being used by the company.Great for them, disappointing for the rest of us, wrote tech analyst Azeem Azhar. Facebook needs to inveigle itself into our lives less, not more.CTRL-Labs’ wristband is not the only brain-computer interface that Facebook will be working on, having already unveiled a headset capable of transferring a person’s thoughts directly onto a computer screen.A paper describing the mind-reading technology was published in\u0026nbspNature Communications\u0026nbspearlier this year, revealing how the headset can decode brain activity to instantly transcribe what a person is saying into digital text.“We’re standing on the edge of the next great wave of human-oriented computing,” Facebook said at the time.\u0026nbsp“One in which the combined technologies of AR and VR converge and revolutionise how we interact with the world around us – as well as the ways in which we workm play, and connect.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It also raises questions about how to enforce differing jurisdictions when it comes to the borderless internet.The case stems from the EU court’s 2014 ruling that people have the right to control what appears when their name is searched online. That decision forced Google to delete links to outdated or embarrassing personal information that popped up in searches within the 28-nation bloc.One year later, the French privacy watchdog wanted Google to remove results on all its search engines on request, and not just those appearing on European country sites like google.fr.Now, the EU court said that such application to territories outside the EU was not legal. It said it was “not apparent” from the EU legal text “that it would have intended to impose on an operator, such as Google, a de-referencing obligation which also concerns the national versions of its search engine that do not correspond to the member states.”Those who wanted to see such an extension argue that on the internet it is easy to switch from the national versions of the website to ones outside the EU – by switching from google.fr to google for example – to find the information that must be removed within the EU.Since 2014, Google has received more than 845,000 requests to remove more than 3 million web addresses from its results. Around 45 per cent of “right to be forgotten” requests have been successful.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But each app must ensure they actually turn it on, or they will just look as they always do.Instagram has not yet done that. It means that users scrolling through their otherwise dark phone can open Instagram and be suddenly hit by a blazing light white design, which can be especially painful when scrolling at night.Twitter is full of users requesting that Instagram finally add the feature, comparing opening Instagram to having the curtains pulled open after sitting in the dark.Now Instagram appears to be finally testing it out, giving some people access to a dark mode that will automatically switch on if a phone has the setting turned on in their phone\u0027s options.The dark mode appears to leave the rest of the design largely similar. The colours of the app remain unchanged, and photographs look no different Instagram\u0027s dark mode simply swaps the bright white that is usually behind posts and stories and swaps it for a much darker colour.To get the update, users need to be on the latest version of iOS and Android as wel as the latest version of Instagram, as well as having the dark mode option chosen in the system\u0027s settings. But not everyone in that position appears to be able to get access to it, with the test rolling out gradually.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In colour are active regions of the atmosphere of the Sun e.g. solar flares and coronal mass ejectionsThe new comet is destined to be less mysterious. Its journey means that it will be nearby for much longer, giving astronomers a chance to observe it more fully and hopefully understand more of its story.Scientists perplexed by mysterious alien space rock2IBorisov\u0026nbspwas first seen at the end of August by\u0026nbspGennady\u0026nbspBorisov, from Crimea. He noticed that it appeared to be a comet, based on the haze that surrounded it, and he turned out to be right\u0026nbsp– since comets tend to be named after the person who first spotted them, it was given his name.That distinctive tail is helping astronomers understand more about how the comet is making its way through the universe. Its current orbit suggests that it will be flying around the solar system for months, coming close to the Sun on 7 December and then flying out of the solar system.During that time, astronomers are scanning the visitor to learn as much as they can about it. That could help illuminate its origin and its destination, more about what it is made of, and how it could have been sent all the way to us – questions that could not be fully answered about Oumuamua, since it was spotted so late and was already heading out of the solar system before researchers could turn their attention to it fully.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The period granted is unusually short for a private hire licence. TfL could have granted a new term of up to five years.The transport body\u0026nbsppreviously removed Uber’s right to operate in the city in September 2017 due to alleged failings in its approach to reporting serious criminal offences and driver background checks.The decision prompted legal action, which led to a judge granting the Silicon Valley company a probationary 15-month licence in 2018 after it made several changes to its business model in London.London is one of the most important markets for the firm in Europe.A TfL spokesman said: “Uber London Limited has been granted a two-month private hire operator licence to allow for scrutiny of additional information that we are requesting ahead of consideration of any potential further licensing application.”Jamie Heywood, Uber’s regional general manager for Northern \u0026amp Eastern Europe, said the decision demonstrated TfL’s recognition of the company’s “improved culture and governance”.\u0026nbsp“We will continue to work closely with TfL and provide any additional requested information,” he said.“Over the past two years, we’ve launched a range of new safety features in the app, introduced better protections for drivers and our Clean Air Plan is helping to tackle air pollution.”Uber launches helicopter service between Manhattan and JFK airportHowever, unions claimed that TfL was still failing to properly regulate Uber.James Farrar, chair of the United Private Hire Drivers branch of the\u0026nbspIndependent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB)\u0026nbspsaid: “Once again, TfL’s failure to regulate effectively and Uber’s unwillingness to play by the rules has led to the jobs of 40,000 Uber drivers being thrown into uncertainty. Sadiq Khan must use this two-month license review period to insist Uber respect UK employment law as a condition of license.”The London Taxi Drivers’ Association described Uber as a “threat to public safety”.LTDA general secretary Steve McNamara said: “Over the last 15 months Uber was supposed to change its operations for the better, but the firm has continued to shirk its responsibilities. The granting of the shortest operator’s licence ever shows the Mayor doesn’t trust Uber, and neither should Londoners.“It’s time the Mayor pulled the plug on Uber’s immoral operation for good.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If it were about science it would be led by scientists, not politicians and a mentally ill Swedish child who is being exploited by her parents and by the international left.”When challenged by left-wing pundit Chris Hahn, Mr Knowles reiterated that she “has many mental illnesses”.His comments came after the teenager gave a severe and impassioned speech to the United Nations climate change summit, telling world leaders and officials from about 60 countries “I shouldn’t be up here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean. Yet, you all come to us young people for hope? How dare you.

Umar’s wife was among six Pakistani women and a Bangladeshi national arrested, and a huge cache of weapons was recovered.Tribal leaders, politicians and officials in Helmand, however, disputed this account and accused the US and Afghan forces of killing around 40 civilians, most of them returning from a wedding party on Sunday night, many of them women and children.Hamid Karzai, the former Afghan president, has been among public figures who has condemned the deaths and called for an investigation into what happened.Created with Sketch.Afghanistan war: lives of children devastated by the endless conflict Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Andrew QuiltySave the Children220 Nooria*, 15 in the home her family has lived in for the past two years in Mazar-i SharifShe was forced to flee her home with her family after their town was attacked by armed groups.

They say that Umar had been tracked to the compound in the town of Musa Qala after extensive surveillance and was about to carry out terrorist acts when the military mission was authorised.AQIS, which was set up by Zawahiri in 2014, is known to have operated in Pakistan and Bangladesh as well as Afghanistan. It is not known to have a strong presence in India, but has received support from some Kashmiri separatist groups, including Anasurut-Tawhid Wai Jihad Kashmir.Four years ago, US forces raided an AQIS training facility in Kandahar, where they are believed to have established bases before branching out to Helmand, the former centre of British operations in Afghanistan. The town of Musa Qala, where the raid took place, had particular resonance, having changed hands several times under a British strategy of engagement with the Talibs,\u0026nbspone which the Americans were highly critical.airstrike in Lashkar Gah\u0026nbsp(AFPGetty)US and Afghan forces faced fierce resistance, according to American officials, from a combined group of determined al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters when they surrounded a compound in Musa Qala late on Sunday night, with a firefight lasting more than six hours.US warplanes were then called in to break the stalemate and carried out what American officials described as “precision strikes”, followed by the troops moving in.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Because of the heavy fighting, we did conduct targeted precision strikes against barricaded terrorists firing on Afghan and US forces.”US officials say that they are attempting to establish whether women, apart from the ones they had captured, may have been hiding in the compound when the shooting and air strikes were taking place.Mohammed Zaman Hamdard, an official with the Helmand police force, said that the al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters had fled into people’s homes during the raid and started shooting from there, drawing fire back in response. As a result “three women are among the dead, and three children are wounded”, he stated.Karim Atal, a member of Helmand’s Provincial Council, said it had not been possible to obtain reliable information because mobile phones were not working in the area. US-led forces jam signals as a matter of routine during operations. “Some say 14 civilians were killed, others says 60, many are saying 40,” he said.Abdul Majid Akhunzada, a fellow council member, claimed that at least 12 people from a wedding party were wounded in the air strike, but he was unaware of their identities. Omar Zowak, a spokesman for the Helmand Governorate, claimed that three cars had been hit from the air, but the numbers of wounded were unclear.Read the first part of the Conflict Without End series here:\u0026nbspAfghanistan election marred by bloodshed and corruption and the second part here:\u0026nbspAfghanistan families torn apart by deadly carnage: ‘My grandson will have to see more dead bodies when he grows up’Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The tribunal found evidence they were “being used as a bank of organs” and subjected to regular medical testing.China has repeatedly denied the use of unethical organ transplant practices, and said that it stopped using the organs from executed prisoners in 2015. In a statement earlier this year, it accused the London-based China Tribunal of perpetuating “rumours”.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A protester fires at riot police during university students\u0027 protest outside the Indonesian Parliament in JakartaRussia\u0027s Soyuz-FG booster rocket with the Soyuz MS-15 space ship that will carry new crew to the International Space Station (ISS) is transported from its hangar to the launch pad at the Russian leased Baikonur cosmodrome, Kazakhstan.

Sir Geoffrey called on the International Transplant Society and national medical associations dealing with transplant surgery to “face up to what is revealed in the China Tribunal judgment and act”.\u0026nbspSome countries, including Italy, Spain, Israel and Taiwan, already have restrictions in place for those seeking to travel to China for organ transplant surgery.And the International Coalition to End Transplant Abuse in China (Etac), which initiated the China Tribunal, said it expects a private members bill to stop unethical organ tourism will be tabled in the UK parliament in October.Etac is hoping its findings will prompt the Human Rights Council to open up a UN Commission of Inquiry into forced organ harvesting in China, said Susie Hughes, the organisation’s executive director.In his speech, Mr Sabi said\u0026nbspthat the targeting of minority groups for organ harvesting amounted to a “possible charge of genocide”, and compared it to other examples of mass religious or racial persecution in recent history.“Victim for victim and death for death, the gassing of the Jews by the Nazis, the massacre by the Khmer Rouge or the butchery to death of the Rwanda Tutsis may not be worse than cutting out the hearts and other organs from living, blameless, harmless, peaceable people,” he told the Human Rights Council. “It is the legal obligation of UN Member States to address this criminal conduct.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

My copies of the files will never be released unless something untoward happens to me.”When asked by the Mail Online about what information he has on the Prince, Dougan said: Do I have dirt on Prince Andrew  I have lots of things.But Im not a Kremlin agent and I did not share any materials with the Russian Government. I dont intend to blackmail anyone with my information. Its against my principles.Prince Andrew has said that he never took part in, witnessed or suspected any suspicious or unlawful behaviour during his friendship with Epstein.A previous Buckingham Palace statement said: The Duke of York has been appalled by the recent reports of Jeffrey Epsteins alleged crimes.His Royal Highness deplores the exploitation of any human being and the suggestion he would condone, participate in or encourage any such behaviour is abhorrent.Mr Dougan said he had about  hours of video from inside Epstein’s properties - including scans of documents seized by the cops.He says he has only watched only snatches of the video, which showed the interior of rooms from several angles.Dougan claims the data was given to him in files by a Florida detective working on a case against Epstein over the procurement of minors.However, he says his files are encrypted and the secret codes to open them are held by friends all over the world.The Epstein files will stay secure and unreadable to everyone, he said. I do not have a physical copy in my immediate possession, because of security reasons.The files are safe and the people who hold them have no idea what is on them.The Times has reported that MI is worried about how much Dougan knows of the original police investigation into the paedo’s activities .It is particularly concerned what information the ex-cop might have already shared with spooks in Russia.An unnamed source told the paper: “His knowledge of the Epstein case would have been of great interest to Russian intelligence.”One of the girls trafficked by Epstein was Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who claimed she was flown to London and had sex with Andrew when she was . Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

To give credit to the EU negotiators, they have played hardball all along and used every trick to avoid concessions.Imagine how they would negotiatethey knew that our Government would be committed to telling the public to reject that deal afterwards!Unfortunately, this policy may become a reality. All too many activist delegates to Labour Conference are out of touch with the history and the values of the party, and do not respect traditional voters’ opposition to EU federalism and neoliberalism.This is leading to anger and disillusionment in leave voting areas, which a majority of Labour MPs represent. Many decent, patriotic Labour voters feel alienated by the suggestion they were at best foolish to vote to Leave and should know better next time.Labour should take warning. Labour voters in seats we must win to take seize power may never dream of voting Conservative. BUT they now have a credible option.The Brexit Party has a clear promise to follow through on the referendum vote.

Bob couldn’t stand seeing it becoming so tacky.”Addressing the claims, a friend close to Terri at the time told Sunshine Daily coast that she is a good mother, a good community person and has the zoos best interest at heart.Steves daughter Bindi became a celebrity in her own right in the years after Steves death.By , the -year-old had her own show - Bindi The Jungle Girl- a bizarre fitness DVD complete with dancers and her own range of action dolls.As the Discovery Channel looked for the next big thing, there were reportedly hopes she could ‘do a High School Musical’, with the group’s chief executive proclaiming: “We think Bindi will be a big, big star”.Her rapid rise led to a wave of concern from critics and politicians, but Terri brushed it aside.“Bindi is lucky in that opportunities come in thick and fast – and they are turned down thick and fast,” she told The Times.“You don’t see Bindi endorsing some fast-food restaurant or a new trendy anything, because she’s a kid.”Terri herself also faced a backlash as she hit the publicity trail.A year after his death, she published the memoir, Steve And Me: My Le With The Crocodile Hunter, while hiring an American psychic to contact her husband at the zoo raised eyebrows.She was also forced to deny a romance with John Stainton, Steve’s best pal and colleague, who witnessed his death.Good luck with that, she told New Idea, saying Steve was a hard act to follow.An ambitious £million plan to expand the zoo hit the skids during the financial crisis, but last year a new water park opened and this April a £million partnership was announced that will allow visitors to camp over in glamping-style accommodation.While Bindi’s fame has never quite eclipsed her father’s, in  she won Dancing with the Stars and this July she announced her engagement to boyfriend Chandler Powell.With no mention of her grandfather, she said her brother Robert, , will walk her down the aisle.In an interview last year, she revealed her hurt over her treatment by Bob Senior and said she hasn’t received a single gt from him in years.“I remember, when I was still quite young, receiving a parcel in the mail from him, she told Daily Mail Australia.“I opened it with great joy and anticipation, only to discover he had opened and ed the Christmas presents I had sent him.“Heartbroken, I began to understand what it meant to have someone close to me hurt me in my time of need.”Bob is now believed to be living as a recluse” in a secluded -acre property called Camp Chilli, with signs ordering people to stay clear.Terri, meanwhile, laughed off talk last year that she was dating Russell Crowe, who has been a great supporter of their wildle reserve, and claimed that Steve remains the only love of her le.She said: “I haven’t dated anyone in the ten years since we lost Steve just because I feel a connection still with Steve, she told Access Hollywood.“You know when you take those vows, and say ‘we’ll be together as long as we both shall live,’ I really don’t think I would’ve marriedI hadn’t met Steve.And he’s very special to me and continues to be.As the battle for the crocodile hunters legacy continues, one hopes his family can find a way through their troubles.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

While a large percentage of the younger generation are genuinely concerned about the planet — and rightly so — how many of them are actually going to do their bit beyond the enviable opportunity to skip school on a sunny day and virtue signal with a hand-made banner Deliciously tempting though it may be to blame their parents, the simple truth is that up to  years ago, no one had even heard of climate change.Far from worrying about the planet heating up, I distinctly remember our geography teacher telling us that a mini ice age was coming.In the meantime, I walked or cycled to school every day, wore jumpers indoors in winter because we didn’t have central heating and baked in the stling heat of the summer of ’ in classrooms without the luxury of air-con.There were no ready meals, we ate simple food cooked by mothers who had grown up with rationing, the vast supermarkets of today didn’t exist and we didn’t have a freezer.The only “takeaway” in easy reach was a fish and chip shop and the first time we ever ate out was when I scraped a couple of O-level passes and my mum took me to the local Berni Inn to celebrate.Our milk came in glass bottles, we ate locally grown, seasonal fruit and vegetablesand I didn’t set eyes on an avocado or any other exotic foodstuff until well into adulthood.At school, I was taught to mend things, not throw them away, would wear something several times before my mother would even think about washing it, and only received new clothesat Christmas or on birthdays.We had one TV, didn’t even get a landline until I was and I didn’t go abroad until I was  — by boat, not plane.No one went on “a gap yah” and my mum would have killed meI left our tent at Glastonbury, because we used it for holidays in Wales.I could go on, but the younger generation’s collective eye-roll of boredom might cause a damaging tremor.Suffice to say,today’s kids are happy to strip their lives back to reflect the childhood we had, it would be a great step towards helping the planet. But it’s not going to happen.So, instead of the lame, “old people have ruined everything for young people”, mantra, all generations should be working together to not only do their bit at homebut to continue putting pressure on those who govern us and have the power to effect realistic, not idealistic, change for a planet that currently accommodates seven and a half billion people.Then the admirable young Greta can go back to school and get on with having a normal le.THE Duchess of Sussex has learned the hard way that making inclusive speeches and appearing accessible has its pitfalls.In other words, someone might ask you to dance.

agenda","story":"First the BBC soap posted its lowest ever ratings, .million viewers for an episode back in June, and now respected BBC commentator Mark Lawson has pointed out the show, along with Coronation Street and Emmerdale, has become outlandish and ­unsustainable on account of the ludicrous number of rape victims and murderers.And that’s before you even start trying to calculate the number of Walford characters who’ve been abducted.Personally, though, I don’t ­remember a time when EastEnders was anything other than the most deranged show on television.I would’ve thought more obvious signs it had lost the plot would be Ben Mitchell’s six ­dferent heads, Phil Mitchell’s ­people smuggling operation with Barry Grant off Brookside and the surprisingly high number of ­characters who revealed they were gay in time for the opening of the show’s new LGBT bar.Which has to be the happiest ­EastEnders coincidence since The Queen Vic organised a “European night,” not long after the Brexit vote.It’s good to have your prejudices ­questioned, though, so I watched with added care last week to seeI’d been missing a trick, as the Square came to terms with the bloody aftermath of the pub siege.Hunter’s still dead, thankfully, but Keanu’s made a remarkable recovery from being shot at point blank range and Bex is up for something called a “Pride of Walford award.” The real focus of the drama, however, was Bobby Beale, who’s freshly released from prison and so traumatised he’s prone to taking drugs and wandering off into train tunnels.As would youyou’d killed your sister and undergone four head transplants.The cure for all this ­torment is classic EastEnders and actually a bit easier to believe than the idea Ian Beale’s new lodger is Rainie, the ­prostitute he had sex with the night daughter Lucy was killed.Bobby’s embraced Islam.He says: “It helps me see the good in people.”The show says it is “to counter negative representations of Islam.”No word on why these representations might be negative, of course, just as EastEnders never had any dramatic response or even a mention of ­Islamist terror attacks in London or three East End schoolgirls running away to join IS.Bobby’s story exists in a soap vacuum.It’s a no-context approach that treats the viewers as dangerous idiots, of course, but wouldn’t grate quite so much­EastEnders had a blanket approach to all religions.It doesn’t, though. Only a ­couple of weeks ago some Christian “End is nigh” nutter was roaming the market and the show had no qualms about introducing Rev Lucas Johnson, who was driven to kill by his Christianity.This slanted agenda defines EastEnders as much as all its murders, rapes and abductions.The only thing that’s changed here, since the dawn of time , is the amount of ­scrutiny and competition it gets, which, given that ratings have recovered, means the misery will probably continue indefinitely.Still, on the positive side, Adam Woodyatt’s tenderloin of Iberico pork, with parsnip three ways, has seen him through to the next round of Celebrity MasterChef.#PrideOfWalford.Sent in by the brilliant Reenie E.Picture research: Marta Ovod.STRICTLY Come Dancing came out of the traps like Johnny Vegas on the opening leg of a x metres relay on Saturday.Two weeks they’ve been rehearsing and viewers still aren’t trusted enough to vote.Instead, the contestants laid out their nervous credentials over  testing minutes.“Eighteen years in the Premiership and I’ve never been as nervous as . . . ”We know, we know.There was an awful lot of “great energy” flannel from the judges as well, including Craig Revel Horwood, who needs to ignore any “be more positive” instructions.This ’s already compromised enough by the fact Motsi Mabuse’s sister Oti has – by accident rather than design – ended up with Kelvin Fletcher, who’s one of the favourites.Mercully, there are two dancers no amount of “great energy” can save.

Ms Arcuri’s mum Christine, , and stepdad John Jendrzejewski, , are said to have told pals: “[Mr Johnson] sponsored her. He didn’t screw her.” Speaking from their home in Louisville, in the US state of Kentucky, they said there was no affair or wrongdoing, adding: “She texted us to let us know it’s just not true. But we knew that already.”    Mr Johnson has been given two weeks to explain the decision to award public funds to close friend Ms Arcuri while he was mayor of London. Greater London Authority oversight committee chairman Len Duvall has imposed the deadline on the PM to provide details and a timeline of his “personal, social and professional” contact with the American during his time as mayor.

Her company Innotech got £, in sponsorship from the mayor’s promotional agency during this period. And it is alleged Ms Arcuri received special treatment to attend three foreign trade missions with the then mayor in the space of a year.  The PM has refused to directly comment on the story or the nature of his relationship with Ms Arcuri. But speaking about his time as mayor, he said: “Everything was done with complete propriety.” Technology entrepreneur Ms Arcuri said in a statement: “Any grants received by my companies and any trade mission I joined were purely in respect of my role as a legitimate businesswoman.” The Mirror has uncovered two more Government grants to Innotech. In November , UK Trade and Investment made two payments totalling £, to Innotech for “corporate event management and marketing”.

The defiant Duchy of Lancaster said the Government would not apologise and insisted they had not done anything wrong.He said it was up to opposition MPs to vote for a general electionthey thought the government had done anything wrong.Askedthe government would apologise to the House of Commons, he said: “I think itaposs only right for the government and all of us to reflect on this judgement. I don’t think the government should apologise for having a strong domestic agenda, I donapost think we should apologise also for seeking to advance our exit from the European Union, I donapost think we should apologise also for attempting to honour the democratic will of the British people.  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the Prime Minister should apologise both to the Queen for the advice he gave her but more importantly, apologise to the British people for what he’s done in trying to shut down our democracy at a very crucial time when people are very, very worried about what will happen on  October. The damning judgement of the UKaposs highest court was that proroguing parliament was unlawful, void and of no effect. The  justices took the unanimous decision that the five-week suspension before the crunch October  Brexit deadline had no justication. Today the former justice secretary, said the Government respected the decision made by the Supreme Court - but highlighted how senior judges had disagreed with their unanimous verdict. In a combative exchange on BBC Radio aposs Today programme, the Cabinet minister said: We respect the judgment of the Supreme Court and will comply with that judgment. It is absolutely right that the Supreme Court should take a view on a matter of this kind. It was done in the proper way. But, in defence of the Governmentaposs decision to prorogue Parliament, he added that senior figures both in England and Scotland took the view that this was legal.  Askedthe government did anything wrong, Mr Gove said I donapost believe so He told the BBC: I think itaposs important to stress that while the Supreme Court was clear, there is a respectable legal opinion that disagrees with that view. Itaposs perfectly possible in a democracy to say you respect a judgment and will comply with the judgment, but you also note that there are a range of views about the appropriateness of a particular course of action. Iaposm not criticising the Supreme Court - I would not criticise the Supreme Court, even though I disagree with that position - Iaposm simply pointing out that both in England and in Scotland, very senior judges took the view that this was lawful.  Last night the Attorney General Geoffrey Cox was facing questions after unredacted court papers revealed he had assured Cabinet the decision to prorogue would not be overturned. They state: The Attorney General said his advice is that this was lawful and within the constitution.Any accusations of unlawfulness or constitutional outrage were motivated by political considerations. Former Tory MP Amber Rudd, who quit the party earlier this month over the PMaposs Brexit strategy, said ministers requested to see such papers but they were not handed over.She said: Despite assurances from the PM, the Cabinet was not shown the legal advice. Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer said he plans to use a rare Commons procedure to force publication of the legal advice. A spokesman for Mr Cox said: The Government acted in good faith and in the belief its approach was lawful and constitutional.

Mum-of-three Danielle Quinnin discovered the £, trip she booked for her family with Thomas Cook last year had been cancelled on Monday after the company went into liquidation. The -year-old immediately started frantically searching for Disney World holiday deals and found a similar but less-inclusive two-week trip for £,. with Virgin Holidays. But two hours later, when Danielle revisited the site with her husband Dean Quinnin, , to make the booking, the couple say they were disgusted to see the price had shot up to £,..

The Duke of Sussex, who has previously spoken of his mental health struggles, told hold how he feels so “overwhelmed” by global issues that he can’t rise in time. Harry, , made the comments during the second day of the his visit to South Africa with we Meghan and baby son Archie. The couple visited the Auwal Mosque in the Bo-Kaap district, the first and oldest mosque in the country, where the Duke spoke to students from the local community.    Among them was Peter Oki, , an Anglican Christian, originally from Lagos, Nigeria, who moved to Cape Town five years ago and attended a Jewish school. Peter, who now studies politics and sociology at the University of Cape Town, said he asked Harry and Meghan what they wanted their “legacy” to be.  “Harry said that he often woke up and felt overwhelmed by too many problems in the world,” said Peter. “That sometimes it’s hard to get out of bed in the mornings because of all the issues. “But he wanted to use their  to enable grass-roots change and to try and create a better society.”    The couple also heard from Banzi Bottoman, , a Christian who attends Gardens Commercial High School. He told them: “Just because someone looks dferent to how I do, that doesn’t make me inferior to anyone . We need to build bridges between people of dferent heritages.” Meghan, who wore a floor- olive dress and cream headscarf, told him: “That was just so meaningful, it gave me chills.” Harry, thumping his chest, said:“You can feel that you’re speaking from here.” Earlier, the couple had been welcomed to the mosque by Imam Sheikh Ismail Londt, the Muslim community leader Mohamed Groenwald and Father Weeder, the Dean of Cape Town. They also met Father Michael Lapsley, an Anglican who was born in New Zealand but moved to South Africa to campaign against segregation during the apartheid era whose hands were blown off in  by a letter bomb.  In April , three months after ANC leader Nelson Mandela’s release from prison, he was sent a letter bomb by the Civil Cooperation Bureau, a covert outfit of the apartheid security forces. It was hidden inside two religious magazines that he was expecting in the mail. The explosion resulted in the loss of both hands and the sight in his left eye, together with seriously burns which kept him in hospital for several months. He said: “Shaking hands is obviously not natural for me so I went to hug the Duchess and her response was “thank you”.  “I received a warm hug from both Harry and Meghan, I could tell immediately they are warm people who mean well. I was only invited the day before the event so I was very honoured to meet them. “Harry immediately motioned to my hands and said ‘letter bomb ’ It was instinctive on his part and it was a good conversation starter. “In terms of Harry and Meghan’s visit, I believe their tone, the way they are speaking has been quite beautul. There’s a naturalness, a warmth, a genuineness that is communicating from them and they have been very well received.” During their visit to the mosque, the couple viewed the first known manuscript of the Qu’ran in South Africa, which was drafted by Imam Tuan Gurufrom memory while he was imprisoned on Robben Island.  Earlier in the day the couple joined schoolchildren at the stunning Monwabisi beach near an infamous crime ridden township where an alleged murderer was shot dead by pilive just hours before the royals’ arrival. There Meghan and Harry meditated with youngsters from the Waves For Change collective which teaches mental health skills and surfing lessons. During a a ‘power hand’ bonding exercise, where the couple were asked to declare their personal strengths, Harry cheekily ducked the task and invited his we to share instead. Meghan looked bashful as she tried to think of something and was told she might consider dancing her strong point, but she laughed and said no.

David Dosoudil, , travelled back home from Orlando, Florida, on Sunday night knowing full well it was likely to be his last voyage for the travel giant. He said he had no ideatheyaposd even be allowed to take off while the troubled airline teetered on the brink of collapse. But David, who has flown Thomas Cook jets for nearly  years, put his emotions aside and even assured his crew and passengers during the flight. He said over the radio: Easy guys, there are still some of us flying around here. But as they landed in Glasgow in the early hours of Monday morning, he knew the writing was on the wall and engineer then walked in and said ‘Itaposs over mate’.    David, of East Grinstead, West Sussex, said: It was then, locked in my room, with the responsibility lted off my shoulders, I started crying like a f***ing baby. Iaposm no captain anymore. The wings and stripes have no meaning. For the first time in my le,  years old, Iaposm officially unemployed. The saying goes, that a burden shared is a burden halved. I think thereaposs a great truth in that. So here is my story of the last day of Thomas Cook, rd of September , in command of one of the last three airborne fights into UK. The best company Iaposve ever known and quite possibly ever had a pleasure to be part of. Recalling his preparations for his last Thomas Cook flight, he said: “It was unusually quiet layover in Orlando, in our beloved Florida hotel. The usual warm cookies on arrival, everything ready for us, warm welcome from the ever so friendly staff.    “Most of us did a bit of shopping and then met for dinner in Cricketaposs, laughed, moaned and worried together as we always do and then went to bed.” Proud David said the last flight was made especially hard because he claimed the company had left them in the dark. “It wasnapost the best sleep of my le,” he added. “How will I look after the crew and passengers tomorrow, without zero information and support from the company  “What would everyone think, how will they sleep, how will they feel tomorrow  Will everything be normal, will we be even allowed to leave ” As he met with his crew he said they tried to treat it as any other flight. David added: “We have met downstairs at : local, five hours behind UK time. The inbound flight is early, theyaposre no planned delays. “Eight hours flight time disappointing and a little bit of a turbulence around Newfoundland. So I promise weaposll deliver : and itaposs gonna be mostly smooth flight.    “Weaposre supposed to leave two hours later and that was a strangely reassuring thought. “Itaposs Sunday, by midnight UK time we should be far away above US eastern seaboard. Nothing ever happens before midnight, surely.” He added: “When we got through the airport to our airplane, all the cleaning was done and most of the fuel was already on, passengers ready, with still more than an hour to departure. I mean, are we really in Orlando  “Both Shawn and Dean, our great engineers, were there. Perhaps a bit unusual, but in retrospect, Iaposm glad they were. Weaposve done everything as usual and been ready well ahead of time. “Everything was so painfully normal and ordinary. So we shook hands with the handling agents and engineers and parted ways with words of positive encouragement and the usual see you in few weeks.” He continued: “But you kind of know and see it at peopleaposs faces. The uncertainty and worries, checking their phones and looking for news.    “So many questions and no answers. Captains, they surely have answers for everything. And I thoughtthereaposs ever a moment to stand up in front of everybody and reassure in person, this is probably it.” He then had to make an emotional speech to his passengers and crew. “So I stood there, in front of  people and  of my crew, struggling with the intercom headset and trying to put into words what was on my mind,” he added. “I tried to smile and joke and reassure everyone weaposre still a company, we love our job and above all weaposre professionals to a core and for us all, itaposs just another day in the office and business as usual. “I knew theyaposre great team, even though I met most of them for the first time in my le. “Theyaposre Thomas Cook crew after all. I donapost really remember what I said in my eastern European accent andit made any sense to mostly Scottish audience. “All I remember were the peopleaposs faces, mixes of smiles and sadness and misty eyes all around, nodding heads and the clapping at the end of it.

The etiquette training company have just teamed up with Facebook to create a guide to digital messaging - and theyaposve got some thoughts on what you should and shouldnapost be saying in the group chat.   The guide, which was created using research conducted by Facebook Messenger, advises people not to send one-word messages or a single emoji to their pals, as it looks curt and might make you appear too busy or uninterested to talk to the other person. And you should also avoid sending multiple messagesall at once and send your thoughts over in just one message instead. The guide states: On a group chat, sending several messages at a time looks domineering and can be confusing for other members playing catch-up on the coversation. Andsomeone leaves their phone unattended for a few minutes, only toto  new messages, itaposs hard to resist checking what all the excitement is about.    Other big mistakes you might be making include gossiping and ghosting. Unsurprisingly, Debrettaposs encourage people not to broadcast other peopleaposs private information on a group chat as this might make the inidual youaposre talking about feel exposed and embarrassed. They also donapost recommend ghosting anyone and in turn suggest ending a conversation with a brief, polite explanation, oritaposs someone youaposve been dating, they say you should gather up the courage and give them a call or talk to them in person. As well as all this, the guide advises that messages should be replied to promptly where possible oryou cannot do so at that time, make sure read notications are turned off so that the other person doesnapost know it has been seen. And when it comes to chasing up a reply, you should wait at least a day unless the message is urgent. Bugging someone for a response after only a few hours is inconsiderate and puts the other person on the defense, they add.

Passionate activist Vera Blishch was reportedly hit by the bearaposs paws when she was instructing a new employee at the Ussuriysk Municipal Zoo in east Russia. She was rushed to hospital on Wednesday morning with an open fracture and a scalping injury. Doctors later said they had to amputate her lower leg as a result of the attack. Vera is known for a campaign to save animals hit by severe flooding in the far east of Russia in .   She demonstrated how she kissed a bear during an interview the same year as she explained about getting up close and personal with the animal, according to the Siberian Times .She said: It is very dangerous to do this. A bear is the most dangerous predator on earth. Bears are trained almost nowhere except for Russia.    Even by just kissing the bear now I might lose my head within a split second. To work with a bear, you must have a special feeling. We say itaposs a feeling sent by God. You must feel a bear. Alexander Fedyaikin, chief doctor of Ussuriyak emergency ambulance told the news outlet: The attack happened : in the morning.

There was such a blur of goals that, at the final whistle, the referee remarked to a Harp official that ‘keeping count of the  goals was no mean feat’.“A Harp committee man said: ‘I make it  goals scored’. Waving a small notebook, he continued: ‘I counted the goals’.“The match official accepted the Harp tally and agreed to send that score to the SFA in Glasgow – Harp  Aberdeen Rovers .“A joyous Harp team and committee set out to celebrate this momentous victory at the Dundee Arms, located at the beginning of the High Street.“It was brilliant fare laid on by the tavern – tripe and tatties washed down with a fine Ballingal’s ale. Could le be any better ”As often the case when lads are together having a rare old time of it, a bit of fun wouldn’t be amiss, as Rob revealed: “It was Ex-Gayfield defender Tom O’Kane who suggested a telegram be sent to that lot in Arbroath who had given him stick when he announced his move to Harp.“A telegram was composed amidst the celebration, and it informed Arbroath FC that Harp had demolished their Aberdeen opponents by a record score of -.“This would make them sit up in Arbroath and take notice of Dundee Harp.“An hour or so later, a telegram from Arbroath arrived at the Dundee Arms addressed to the Harp committee.“When the content was read – Arbroath  Bon Accord  – there were roars of laughter from the Harp lads.“Everyone agreed, those Red Lichties have a great sense of humour.“O’Kane looked at his pocket watch and decided it was best to get movinghe was to make the last train.“With a great send-off ringing in his ears, Tom made a brisk walk to the West station and caught the last train home to the Angus town.”On the Arbroath station , the first person Tom recognised was local policeman PC Clark.Rob continued: “The player said jubilantly: ‘Constable, what about that score today, must be a record don’t you think ’“PC Clark replied: ‘It may very well be, Tom. If they hadn’t disallowed so many goals, it surely would be a record. Mind you, - is one almighty score’.“A disconcerted O’Kane feared the worst. Arbroath had really scored  goals.“Tom slept little and, at first light, he was up and out the door. The Sunday train to Dundee would be too late for Tom, he walked and jogged all the way from Arbroath to Dundee, and sought out Harp officials to confirm the Arbroath score.“Do we have time to change yesterday’s score to the ref’s tally of Harp  Aberdeen Rovers  “Tom and the committee lads then went off to the referee’s house.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/5d88933ceb4769.54724060-e1569239377405.jpg ","title":"moment of madness cost dundee against morton says gaffer mcpake","story":"Dundee manager James McPake was today lamenting a “moment of madness” which cost them in Saturday’s - defeat at Morton.Peter Grant’s headed goal on the stroke of half-time won the points in the end at Cappielow.And boss James was left frustrated after Cammy Kerr gave away the free-kick which led to the goal and failed to pick up Ton centre-half Grant in the box.“I thought, for the first  minutes of the game, we defended exceptionally well,” he said.“We knew, especially with John Sutton playing, what was going to happen and, credit to them, they did it very well.“I thought my defenders stood up and I have been very critical of them at times, particularly in a game which we lost heavily.“They stood up well and handled everything that was coming into the box but then a moment of madness a minute before half-time costs us the game.“You give away a silly free-kick when the guy is  yards from your goal on the touchline facing his own goal.

Gallagher recovered in time to face Livingston.Boss McInnes is keen to open talks with Atlanta United about the possibility of extending Jon Gallagher’s loan deal.The -year-old’s loan at Pittodrie from the United States side expires in January but McInnes is keen to extend that for the rest of the season.Aberdeen will hold talks with Atlanta technical director Carlos Bocanegra about the possibility of extending the agreement.Former Rangers and USA international defender Bocanegra oversees all football operations including player loans and transfers.Gallagher has started  games for Aberdeen this season and started all six ties in the Europa League.On extending the loan, McInnes said: “There is a possibility.“However, there still has not been any real discussion. If there is an option to keep Jon for the full season, like we discussed at the outset, that’s something we would be keen to do.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2016/02/P-f2eeb1f4-4890-48e9-8a2d-5050596afb1b-100x56.jpg class=attachment-small size-small wp-post-image ","title":"we have won one cup and know the importance of cups to this club says derek mcinneswe have won one cup and know the importance of cups to this club","story":"Manager Derek McInnes is a realist and accepts the two domestic cups are Aberdeen’s greatest opportunity for success.In the Premiership, McInnes has run Celtic close in previous seasons. But ultimately the superior spending power and squad of the Hoops have triumphed.Now there is the multi-million spending of Rangers, managed by England and Liverpool legend Steven Gerrard, to add to the mix.McInnes and the Reds will attempt to overturn the odds in the league. But ultimately cash and squad depth, particularly relevant with the Reds in the midst of an injury crisis, will always tip the balance towards the Old Firm.Which is why cup competition is so vital to McInnes who ended a -year silverware drought by leading the Dons to League Cup glory in .Aberdeen will tonight face Hearts in the League Cup quarter-final and McInnes warned it is all or nothing tonight in the bid to emulate  – they are either in or out and must maximise the opportunity at Tynecastle to secure a semi-final slot.He said: “The focus from my teams over the years has always been to see the bigger picture about trying to win a trophy.“To do that you need to win tough games.“Every time we have been to Hampden for a final we have had to overcome tough challenges.“There is no doubt Hearts away is a tough game but the intention is to make it even tougher for Hearts and get into the semi.”Since lting the League Cup McInnes has led the Dons to three further finals, but all were lost to Brendan Rodgers’ Celtic.Last season Aberdeen knocked Rangers out of both cup competitions but lost to Celtic - in the League Cup final. He said: “I have never thought the cups were down to Rangers and Celtic.“If Celtic and Rangers are doing their job right by recruiting well and have good managers, as they clearly have, then it becomes more dficult for teams like ourselves to challenge through the league.“With the money they have it is dficult for any team to compete with these teams in the league.“They can compete for a period of time but theyhave the longevity and strength in squad which make it dficult for other clubs.“Cup competitions offer us the best chance of success.“We have won one cup and been close a number of times and know the importance of cups to this club.”Aberdeen suffered disappointment last season when narrowly losing to Celtic in the League Cup final at Hampden.That second trophy for now remains elusive.McInnes said: “That is done now. It is all about trying to use all the disappointments and experiences you get to keep going back to Hampden.“This is a new squad we have put together so a lot of the boys have not experienced playing in semi-finals and finals.“It is vital that they see the importance of that.”Aberdeen will be backed by a ,-strong travelling Red Army in the bid to be in the pot for the draw which will be broadcast live on BT Sport tomorrow night following coverage of Livingston’s quarter-final with Rangers.Semi-finals are scheduled for the weekend of November  .Aberdeen have six players out injured for tonight.McInnes said: “By the time the semis come round we will hopefully be in a better state with injuries.“In the meantime we have to make sure we put our best foot forward and put in a performance that gets us there.”Hearts will be buoyed by a - Edinburgh derby triumph that delivered a first league win of the season and alleviated some of the pressure on Craig Levein.There had been demonstrations outside Tynecastle following the - defeat to Motherwell which sank the Edinburgh club to the bottom of the Premiership.McInnes is concerned too many clubs in Scotland are edging towards pulling the trigger on manager’s reigns too early.He said: “Craig has been battered from pillar to post over the last few weeks.“As a manager, to see another manager come under real scrutiny so early in the season is really disappointing.“We are in real danger of going down the same road as what happens in England. Last year managers lost their jobs in August.“It used to be October or November before people even began to question a manager.“They are now losing jobs in August and it all becomes very unhelpful and unrealistic.”Beating Hibs ended a winless league streak dating back to March for Hearts.McInnes said: “Hearts will be feeling good about themselves. If you win a big game, particularly a derby, it can be more than just three points.“To be honestHearts had won, lost or drawn the derby I would expect a tough game.“Craig Levein is the type of manager who knows the importance of cups as well.“He is a good competitor and his teams are always competitive.“We have to make sure that competitive side of our game is there so we can be good enough to win regardless of how Hearts are feeling.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.45574492-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.45574492-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.45574492-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.45574492-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"networking group set up to help north east businesses","story":"A networking group has been launched to support businesses across northern Aberdeenshire.Network North East has been set up to unite local businesses through networking, information sharing and identying ways of supporting each other’s business activity and growth.Founding member Neil McLeod of Property Partners said that the Turrf area alone has more than  businesses operating in the surrounding area.He said: “At the moment there aren’t many networking opportunities unless you want to travel to Aberdeen or where, so Network North East was set up to address that need.”The organisation’s free launch event will be held at the Baden Powell Centre in Turrf from pm to pm tomorrow.Registration can be completed via the Network North East Launch Facebook page or by e-mailing contact@networknortheast"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column august 16 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsLet#s face it.

Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream. That is roughly the equivalent of only being able to have a small cup of tea and one can of soft drink per day. In addition, they may have to limit the potassium and phosphate in their diet which means missing out on enjoying foods like chocolate, bananas and tomatoes.We want to make the kidney diet about all the things patients can eat and bring enjoyment back into food # which is why we have launched the Kidney Kitchen.We hope that the Kidney Kitchen will mean everyone living with kidney disease in Scotland can enjoy healthy and delicious food with their family and friends.If you are, oryou know a kidney patient, check out www.kidneykitchen.orgEwen Maclean, advocacy officer Scotland, Kidney Care UKSir,The death of a pet cat can come as a shock, and many owners can find it dficult to come to terms with their loss.The death of a pet is not always seen as a signicant loss, leading some people to hide their feelings which can cause them to feel very alone.On Grief Awareness Day, August , Cats Protection is highlighting its free and confidential Paws to Listen support service, so people facing the loss of a cat do not have to feel alone.The service is available on   .

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

It keeps its money as close to home as possible so that, amid historically drastic cuts, the amount spent locally has gone up as featured inon January ,  which notes #where other authorities privatise, Preston grows its own businesses#.Preston ensures that its resources prioritise local providers and businesses wherever possible. Argyll and Bute Council#s Procurement Strategy   falls some way short of this. Its stated aims commendably include:There is no particular emphasis, however, on using its resources to grow Argyll and Bute businesses, to reduce carbon emissions and food transport miles or to foster healthy eating strategies that would benefit our local farmers through #joining up the dots# of local supply and demand.The climate emergency demands a bolder and more innovative respond, and demands it now.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,I wish to comment on Mr Henderson#s  open letter to Brendan O#Hara in the September  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.The expression #crash out# of Europe is used by Conservative members of parliament, the BBC and the press. While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee. The aim is to transfer all serious patients to one of these centres following pre-hospital emergency care within  minutes.The value of a helicopter air ambulance is therefore obvious.Working alongside the Scottish Ambulance Service#s air fleet, SCAA relies entirely on public donations to keep this vital resource flying.Please consider supporting SCAA in it#s le-saving work during a week when the country focuses on the crucial work of air ambulances everywhere.For further information please visit www.scaa.org.ukDavid Craig, chief executive, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance , Perth AirportSir,I get a magazine called #Clean Slate#.In it this month is an article where a -year-old girl, Greta Thunberg, along with  other youth activists, have issued this invitation to adults around the world: #Starting on Friday September  we are going to kick-start a week of climate action, with a world-wide strike for the climate.

have already been expressed by the UK Department for Transport over the benefits of the reintroduction of tracks all the way to Carlisle.Momentum has been growing since funding was announced for a feasibility study earlier this year into taking the Borders Railway through Hawick, Newcastleton and across the English border.But the papers released by the Scottish government in response to a Freedom of Information request reveal that they cant give the go-ahead.And that support from south of the border is not universal.Among the released files and emails is a previously confidential Transport Position Paper from September, .It states: \" It should be noted that Scottish Ministers do not have the powers to construct a cross-border railway line as they only have the powers to construct a railway which starts, ends and remains in Scotland.\"Accordingly, the power to construct a railway line from Tweedbank to Carlisle in its entirety would rest with the UK Government.\"The signing of the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal partnership, which is made up of five local authority areas either side of the border, was seen as a major boost for the extension going ahead.The newly released papers show the partnership wrote in June  to Hamza Yousaf, then Scottish Transport Minister, regarding the Borders Railway extension.According to that letter: \"The Settle-Carlisle line shows the benefits of having alternative routes to support the resilience of the rail network.\"The line was threatened with closure in the s but following a successful campaign to keep it open the line was reprieved in .\"Since then the line has played a key role for re-routed main line passenger services when the West Coast or East Coast Main Lines have been closed and for freight services between Scotland Cumbria and the rest of England.\"The Borders Railway between Carlisle and Edinburgh could be equally successful in providing this vital role as an alternative route to the West and East Coast Main Lines for freight and passenger traffic and through this help maximise the growth of the Scottish and UK economy.\"But the enthusiasm and optimism wasnt shared by the UK Department for Transport.Feedback provided by the Department in July  stated: \"We are not convinced an extended Borders Railway would help with capacity issues on the West Coast Main Line.\"Assuming any such extension would have similar characteristics to the existing line i.e. slow and un-electried, it would not be attractive for re-routing any of the existing services using the West Coast Main Line.\"Diesel hauled trains not in a hurry already go via Dumfries so having another ersionary alternative route would not add

This occurs when cats come in contact with chemicals such as fuels, lubricants and some solvents.Usually, self-grooming causes the cat to ingest the toxin, or in some cases they inhale it which can cause a severe pneumonia.The toxin can cause problems throughout the body and on the skin too.When Jonny had examined Tikka, he immediately sent her to our Tranent surgery for blood tests and intravenous fluids as she was dehydrated.Fortunately, Tikkarsquos blood tests were normal so she did not have kidney damage.She tolerated her fluid therapy well and was soon looking much happier however several areas of her skin had become red and she was losing hair especially on her front legs.Tikka did not want to eat or drink. She was given analgesics, antibiotics and soothing cream was applied to her skin.Our nursing staff ensured she was as comfortable as possible and as she was not eating by herself, they fed her via a feeding tube several times a day.Her skin became red and thickened and some areas sloughed off.She had to have cream applied frequently to the damaged skin, just asshe had suffered burns.Tikka was finally well enough to go home where Mrs Taylor continued to treat her skin. Tikka started eating well again and is improving daily. Her fur is regrowing and soon she will have her beautul coat again.Now Mrs Taylor was very vigilant and realised she had to do something to help Tikka immediately.If you suspect your cat may have had contact with petroleum-based substances, please contact your vet as soon as possible.Often the first sign you may have is your pet smells of petrol or diesel.There may be vomiting or diarrhoea. They may actually be dizzy or confused or showing other neurological problems such as staggering and trembling. There may be respiratory signs such as coughing or wheezingthey have inhaled the chemical.Do not try to make your pet vomit as this can exacerbate the toxicity.The first thing you should do is try to remove the chemical from the fur.In many cases, it is best to bring your pet straight to your vets as soon as possible. The nursing staff at veterinary practices are well trained in dealing with intoxication emergencies.With petroleum products there are three main areas where the body can be affected: l The internal organs especially the kidneys, so your vet will want to blood sample your pet to check for any damage to the kidneys or other organsl The respiratory system can be affected especiallythe toxin is inhaled. This often happensthe patient vomits then inhales some resulting in a very severe pneumonia. Your vet may wish to take x-rays to check for this.l The animalrsquos skin can also be affected. The petroleum products sit on the fur then soaks through to the skin where they are held in contact by the fur. This causes them to act as a caustic substance, damaging the skin and hair follicles. Often the first sign before the skin damage is seen is hair loss due to the follicle damage.The treatment for these causes is supportive at all times. There are no specic antidotes. Intravenous fluids are administered, this helps overcome dehydration and helps eliminate toxins from the body.Analgesics are given to help keep pain from damaged skin and internal organs to a minimum.Antibiotics are given, as damaged skin is very prone to secondary infection and they are always givenpneumonia is present. Skin treatment has to be intense to keep infection to a minimum and encourage damaged skin to recover.Thankfully Tikka has made an excellent recovery, thanks to Mrs Taylorrsquos quick thinking and the intense nursing care given by the nursing team at Dunedin Vets."},{"url":null,"title":"tim-39-s-tales-magic-real-39-s-around-us","story":"Of course, in stories magic is very real a frog or beast can transform into a prince, dragons and witches can fly, animals can talk, wishes can be granted by faeries and spells cast by wizards.

Itrsquos just that we have stopped noticing the magic that is real.In our world, a frog may not turn into a prince with a kiss, but a caterpillar turns into a butterfly, a tadpole into a frog.And such magic is all around us.

Animals do talk, any dog lover will tell us that.Have you ever seen a hare and made eye contact and felt the connection or watched a squirrel hide nuts, and then come up to you asking for more Walk in a wood, or by a riverbank, or just sit in your garden or a park and the magic is all around you. We watched wood pigeons nest in a small elder tree outside our front window over the summer. Two eggs hatched and we watched as they were fed and finally flew the nest. It was, truly, magic.The magic all around us is still vast, and we could all make our own list the sound of birdsong, watching a butterfly flutter, a spiderrsquos web decorated with dew, the glimpse of a deer in a wood, the mist wrapped mountains, a red sparkling cloud during sunset, a wee beastie under a rock as it scampers for cover, the whisper of an ancient tree and the sweet smell of a wood.But I believe that sadly too many of us donrsquot notice real magic anymore.And when we donrsquot notice something we donrsquot feel connected to it, so we donrsquot care about it. And when we donrsquot care about it we donrsquot protect or value it.And when we donrsquot value it, we canrsquot feel the wonder and sense of awe it creates. And so we trash it, ignore and neglect it, exploit it. And we forget we are part of this magic that we are sons and daughters of nature too. And so we disconnect ourselves from what can truly make us feel happy, and instead drug ourselves with the articial magic of our own technology which makes us feel all powerful.But the truth is we are not.Ultimately we rely on the natural environment for our physical and emotional well-being, as much as the creatures we are making extinct.We need nature, it doesnrsquot need us, and eventually it is in control. Asto make this point huge waves hit the rocks of Prestonpans in a storm not so long ago, drenching the nearby houses in a display of naturersquos power.

He was in Scotland mainly to play golf and try whisky, he told me. I was trying to convince him Scotland had many other things to offer and we got onto the issue of Scotlandrsquos landscape. He seemed interested in how our land was used, and he told me that back home he owned a ranch, which included a medium-sized forest of native trees.I remember saying ldquowow, thatrsquos so special, but he shook his head, saying: ldquoSpecial  No, not really, a stupid law means the forest is worthless.I was a bit confused, so I asked him what he meant. ldquoTherersquos a preservation order on it, which means that part of my land is unproductive, he said.I realised at this point that although we were having the same conversation about land, we were having dferent understandings of it.He shook his head sadly and said: ldquoItrsquos just a waste of good timber.That kind of ended our conversation. I didnrsquot try to persuade him to think dferently, I felt that I wasnrsquot in a position to do that since he was a paying customer and my tip could have been at stake.That conversation was nearly  years ago. And yet his comment ldquoitrsquos just a waste of good timber has stuck with me ever since. The reason for this was the mindset it revealed. I found it depressing that he could not see the value of something so precious because it would make him no financial profit.As my kids get geared up for the school climate strike this week, I realise now this mindset is one which has to be challenged. When I look back, I am ashamed of myself that I did not have the courage to speak out to the man, simply because I needed his tip.There are many parts of the climate crisis, but one truth within the debate is trees are our le. I have seen one calculation that each human breathes in the oxygen produced by around eight trees. So count the number in your family and those you love and multiply by eight. That is the number of trees needed to help your family and loved ones breathe. For sure, trees arenrsquot the only source of the oxygen we breathe, but they are a signicant part of it, and they hold tons of carbon. Surely that alone is lsquoprofitrsquo enough.But while the riches of woodland go way beyond that of timber profit, I understand that environmental destruction is linked to poverty as well as greed. We need to challenge both. But we will never do thiswe are made to be too afraid to speak out, either because we fear those who wield financial power over us, or the ridicule of others who as yet donrsquot get it.In a storytelling session last week for a P class in an East Lothian primary school, I told the tale of the king who wanted to touch the moon. He always gets his way because people are afraid of him, so the forest in his kingdom is cut down to make a tower of wooden boxes to the moon. But he is impatient and foolish, and falls from the tower, and the boxes all get smashed. The forest has been destroyed for the kingrsquos failed vanity project, while his people remain poor and still afraid of him.One of the girls in the class put her hand up then said: ldquoBut we need trees to live. Later she told me: ldquoThey should get rid of the kinghe doesnrsquot change his bad ways.Many of our young people get it. Itrsquos their future. We can all make our own small personal contribution, but to save our childrenrsquos future, courage is needed to speak out, for adults too.Never again will I remain silent, for either reward or fear of ridicule. There is too much at stake, not just for me but for my children and this dear planet which is home for us all, but dying in our care."},{"url":null,"title":"haddington-parking-plans-discussion-held-private","story":"East Lothian Council is working on designs that would see the parking provision changed in the town, including the possibility of a -plus-space long-stay car park on the townrsquos Whittingehame Drive.However, town centre traders are concerned about the possibility of spaces being lost on High Street and Market Street, with it also being mooted that the long-stay car park at Tesco, which is used by many people working in the town centre, could become short-stay only.The issue was briefly mentioned at the townrsquos community council meeting last Tuesday evening.Usually, these meetings are open to the public and the press however, it was agreed to cut short next monthrsquos meeting to allow community councillors to discuss the controversial plans in private.Jan Wilson, the grouprsquos long-standing chairwoman, said: ldquoIrsquom not sure how much can be made public at the moment.ldquoI know community council meetings should be public but there are times when I have to say no because the proposals are not set in stone yet.

called lsquoCommunity Links Projectsrsquo but the team in North Berwick wanted to do something on a dferent model.Community Connections uses members of the community to introduce others to groups and

ldquosocial prescribing rather than provide medication.Members of the public can also refer someone.Carol said: ldquoPeople who refer someone at risk of isolation to me may have medical problems that they need attended to, but social prescribing means that they are also trying to recommend other things that will benefit their wellbeing.ldquoIt might be to do with meeting other people, exercise or

And the French experience suggests the cost of living for almost everything bar housingwould rise sharply, which rather brings into question the priority of cutting hours while not raising wages.Anyway, where would those public sector workers and the money to pay them come from  Or will public services just be  per cent understaffed, or open shorter hours  In the private sector, are factories, warehouses, call centres, shops and restaurants expected to employ more people  Are the self-employed and small businesses to be prevented from working The dficulty of answering these questions is one reason for asking why itrsquos any of the governmentrsquos business to dictate how much people work, or to dictate precise terms and conditions ndash beyond those designed to prevent exploitation or ensure workplace safety ndash to businesses.Flexibility for those who want to choose their own hours and balance work and leisure is something the market already provides without government dictat ndash not least in the form of that great bogey of the Left, the zero-hours contract. And contrary to Mr McDonnellrsquos rhetoric, both job satisfaction and feeling they have the right work le balance is higher among zero-hours workers than employees as a whole.But Mr McDonnell would like to impose costs and government restrictions on private business, to create additional costs and restricted public services for the taxpayer, to prevent iniduals from making their own choices, and to let trades unions dictate terms and conditions of employment.We had something of the sort in the early s, in the days of wage councils, the closed shop, widespread nationalisation, currency crises, state-mandated industrial policy, private sector pay caps and government held to ransom by hugely inflationary wage demands and constant industrial action, which was why we were known as ldquothe sick man of Europe.

Some of them are as lovely as Sissinghurst or Inverewe, and quite obviously require as much hard work.

There would even be spores carrying ash dieback in the village hall where we sat, he told us, making a few of us shuffle our boots.

After  months, wersquove barely reached base camp, yet we canrsquot give up now. The gardens hereabouts are a constant reminder of how much there is to learn. Some of them are as lovely as Sissinghurst or Inverewe, and quite obviously require as much hard work. As a result, when neighbours meet, conversation is more likely to turn to brassicas and box blight than Brexit and the Backstop. Also high on the agenda are butterflies and bees, the absence or superabundance of rain, heat surges, the proleration of wasps, and the effect of all the above on the quality of their compost. If you chance to look up at the sky, someone will guess, to within a degree of accuracy, what the next dayrsquos temperature will be.This must be because, like gardeners everywhere, they are acutely attuned to the weather. Other than farmers, I doubt there is any single group more intensely aware of our climate, and the ways in which it is fast changing. For some of them, the young Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg is like Joan of Arc, fearlessly confronting the forces of destruction, and inspiring all of us to be more vocal, angry and proactive. If you have a garden, you cannot be unaware that when she says ldquochange is coming, whether you like it or not, itrsquos not a prediction for the far future. Change is already here. Indeed, serious gardeners are already taking steps, tree by tree, shrub by shrub, to mitigate or adapt to its impact.This became particularly evident last weekend at a Gardenerrsquos Question Time, run by Borders Organic Gardeners, in St Boswellrsquos village hall. The room was packed with people so experienced they cast Monty Don into the shade. A  of three experts, including this paperrsquos gardening columnist Dave Allan, held their nerve for almost two hours to answer a barrage of questions that ranged from how to deal with snails and slugs , and the best apple trees for a cold spot .Opinion ied on what tree to plant to replace a dying ash, but in answering, the alpine expert Ron McBeath said that all our ash trees will probably be gone within ten years. There would even be spores carrying ash dieback in the village hall where we sat, he told us, making a few of us shuffle our boots.

That cost more than pound,.Mr Livingstone told the Scottish Police Authority in Falkirk yesterday: ldquoThis has been demanding at an operational level but a strategic level as well.ldquoIs it sustainable  No, it is not. The capability of the single service comes in to bear. One of the officers injured was based in Dunfermline. We are drawing officers from right across the country away from their key role to respond to this.ldquoIn terms of sustainability, it is a signicant challenge. In terms of officer safety, there is a growing trend of attacks. There has been a signicant increase in the west of Scotland in particular. They are up by more than a fth.ldquoThe recent manestation of these marches, walks and protests seems to me to be part of a growing trend where our officers are coming under attack and it is utterly unacceptable. It is not part of the job.Referring to the last weekend in August and the first in September, Deputy Chief Constable Will Kerr said: ldquoThose are officers who are not involved in investigating ndash as we want them to be ndash domestic abuse incidents across the city and tackling drug and traffic offences, and dealing with normal police business.Speaking of the first weekend in September, he said: ldquoSo there are a whole range of opportunity costs which are attendant and added on top of that pound, pure cost of the operation itself.ldquoThat being said, the chief has made it clear that to protect the city of Glasgow and its citizens we will deploy as many police officers as we need to do to make sure the city is both safe and feels safe.ldquoWe have set up an investigation team led by a detective inspector ndashover  detectives are involved in that ndash who are robustly investigating all the offences involved.ldquoWe have made  arrests so far. There will be more arrests over the coming weeks and months.ldquoWe will not accept that sort of behaviour. We certainly wonrsquot accept assaults on our police officers.ldquoOne of those arrests has been for the throwing of the pyrotechnic and one of our officers being injuredby that.Police have also been hurt at football matches, including at Rangers Europa League home game against Feyenoord of the Netherlands. Mr Kerr listed problems: ldquoWe had six officers injured before and during that match.Throwing coins at officers. hitting them in the head and legs. Spitting on officers faces, kicking at their legs, throwing stones, one of which hit an officers in the face, punching officers to the face.ldquoThat is just wholly unacceptable. It cannot be right in  that we have officers deployed to protect their communities subject to that level of violence both at parades and associated protests or at football matches.Mr Kerr urged a sense of perspective. Citing his  years in Belfast policing, he stressed that only a tiny minority were involved in trouble. But he added: ldquoWe do need to have a clear, hard look at ourselves as to whether that is acceptable. We should not be putting officers in that position in the first place."},{"url":null,"title":"papers-digital-journalism-contributing-bottom-line-herald-ever","story":"But that was the position I found myself in on day one when I started as Digital Editor at The Herald in November . Naturally, the filming crew didnrsquot miss a beat, capturing the everyday frustration and the ongoing issues faced by all departments amid a digital transformation.While the transition to a more digital focus for the paper has had its own challenges, as alluded to in the documentary, there have also been a number of positives as part of our digital transformation.There is a perception that the growth of online journalism has resulted in newspapers ldquochasing clicks and impacted the quality of the product, but the reality is that we know exactly what people read and what they want to engage with.:The Papers: Economic reality of trying to compete in new media landscape is under harsh spotlightEvery click on our site is monitored, we can tell what subscribers read, how long they engage for and what stories pick up traction on social media.The simple fact is that we need a ing site that generates income to pay for the high-quality journalism that we strive to produce. Media reflects society and in this digital age, with news consumed quickly, on mobile and through social media, we have tried to change our digital offering to reflect this.Online we continue to publish the same content The Herald is known and loved for, with all print copy going on the website, but we couple it with more analysis on hot topics, breaking stories and pieces that we know our readers want to read.It is this strategy that has seen a signicant growth in The Herald with our unique visitors almost doubling in a year, and . million more articles read online between September  and August .Year on year, The Herald is up byaround  per cent in online readership.

As part of our overall focus on digital, we have appointed a Head of Audience who oversees all social media, as well as bringing in a number of multimedia reporters both on news and sport.Training has been rolled out to all of our reporters and rather than creating separate digital teams across dferent titles, we have merged to become one digital desk that drives forward both heraldscotland and eveningtimes, providing consistency and more dedicated staff to the Scottish Newsquest sites than ever before.While improving traffic is key, we have never hidden that The Herald sits behind a paywall and more focus has been emphasised on premium content and building on our growing number of subscribers.We have continued to operate behind our subscription model and have seen a signicant uplt in the number of people subscribing to read The Herald since our new premium model was launched.With more readers supporting our journalism we have also added to the site navigation subsection, improved our video player on site, and carried out an in-depth analysis on our newsletters with changes expected soon.Regardless of the changes we make, no newspaper is without criticism, however, we strive to respond to our readers, and it is that transparency and engagement that we have tried to use to build our brand and trust online.While readers may not necessarily agree with an opinion piece or certain story, we have constantly looked to be open with our readers and to give them a deserved insight. And that was also a motivating factor in the decision to open The Heraldoffice to the BBC cameras in the first place.The filming allowed our readers to see behind the looking glass and an insight into le for staff at The Herald and the everyday problems we faced, but what it also showed was the dedication and passion that staff have for the product both in print and online."},{"url":null,"title":"sainsburys-closing-100-stores-major-business-overhaul","story":"The grocer said it expects to close up to  supermarkets,  convenience stores and  Argos branches.

Disposing this total of  tonnes of material properly would be the equivalent of removing , cars off UK roads every year.When sent to landfill, food waste releases methane, a dangerous greenhouse gas many times more potent than carbon dioxide in the short term.By successfully capturing food waste it can be converted into sustainable energy, instead of being sent to landfill or incineration. The resulting material can also be used as a fertiliser for soil to help grow more food, more sustainably. Iain Gulland, chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland, said: “It wasn’t just fantasy when the Doc and Marty were discovering how they could power the DeLorean to time travel – they hit upon an idea that over  years later could make a signicant dference in how we combat the climate emergency.“Time is running out as we look to tackle the climate emergency. “The good news is that inedible food waste has huge potential as its energy can be used to make sustainable fuel and we can harness this by simply using our food recycling caddy. “You could provide enough power to watch the entire Back to the Future trilogy from the food held in nearly two and a half food recycling caddies.”Around  per cent of the , tonnes of food waste produced by households in Scotland every year is unavoidable. For items like tea bags, coffee grounds or banana skins, recycling food waste is a vital piece of the puzzle in tackling the climate emergency.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.falkirkherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"The public is being asked to look out for squirrels  both red and grey  for the Great Scottish Squirrel Survey. \"  \"  Join in the Great Scottish Squirrel Survey this weekviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.falkirkherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Claire Gullan s to Banchory for her ceilidh workshop\"  Claire to teach “How to Ceilidh” viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"DEES | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"DEES | Article Teaser\"According to the Scottish Government’s  Scottish Household survey, only  per cent of Scottish households say they recycle their food waste, despite around  per cent having access to a food recycling caddy."},{"url":null,"title":"four fifths of our carbon footprint is down to our consumption habit","story":"Businesses that don#t act now to meet growing public pressure to tackle the global climate emergency risk being left behind.That’s the warning from Zero Waste Scotland which says organisations must do more and examine how they produce, consume and dispose of everyday items just to stay in the race – and urges them to embrace the circular economy.Zero Waste Scotland stresses firms achieving a more sustainable way of working would deliver huge results in cutting Scotland’s carbon footprint. This is because four fths of Scotland’s carbon footprint is generated through the heat and energy required to grow, make, process, transport and provide materials that are often tossed aside at the end of their le.Only by considering how to make products with less reliance on raw materials, and by remaking items at the end of their original le into goods that can be used time and again, will businesses be able to signicantly reduce global emissions.Iain Gulland, chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland, who launched the organisation’s corporate plan before an auduence of business leaders last week, said: “We must radically change the way we think about and consume our goods and materials, and we must do that now.” “Too many businesses assume that reducing the cost to the planet means increasing costs for them. “But as we have and will continue to make clear, the opportunities are plentul, with massive savings to be made. “The current way of working cannot continue in the years ahead and successfully adopting a circular economy approach is the only long-term option.”Everything has value and in a circular economy nothing should be wasted. In simple terms, it can be explained as ‘make, use, remake’ as opposed to ‘make, use, dispose’. The ultimate goal is to maintain and improve our quality of le, while simultaneously reducing our material consumption and, by extension, our impact on the planet.Mr Gulland added: “Many Scottish firms are already leading the way, with our help, changing how they design and trade goods to keep materials in use for as long as possible to maximise their value. “Successful circular economy enterprises range from refurbishing computers and upcycling furniture to producing sustainable animal feed using waste generated by our world-famous whisky industry.”data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.buchanobserver webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Felicitasis just one of the many children supported by Marys Meals.\"   is just one of the many children supported by Marys Meals.\"  Throw a Porridge Party for Mary’s MealsviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.buchanobserver webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"A body recovered near Boddam is believed to be that of Ruairidh Sandison\"  A body recovered from the coast near Boddam is thought to be that of missing man Ruairidh Sandison. viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BUCH | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BUCH | Article Teaser\"Zero Waste Scotland estimates that the circular economy would save Scottish businesses collectively at least £ billion every year through benefits including the creation of longer-lasting relationships with customers, as firms switch from a model centred on simply selling products to providing products as services. Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said: “We should not underestimate our achievements to date in tackling climate change – we have already almost halved emissions since . “We cannot, however, be complacent. More action is needed to respond to the global climate emergency and show Scotland as the responsible, progressive, and ambitious country that it is.” "},{"url":null,"title":"join in the great scottish squirrel survey this week","story":"People are being encouraged to look out for squirrels # and record their sightings # in support of the Saving Scotland#s Red Squirrels project.The Great Scottish Squirrel Survey takes place this week until Sunday, September .During this week – which coincides with National Red Squirrel Week – the public is being encouraged to spend some time exploring the outdoors while keeping a lookout for both red and grey squirrels. They are then being asked to report where and when they saw them on the Saving Scotland’s Red Squirrels websitescottishsquirrels.org.uk.Saving Scotland’s Red Squirrels is a partnership project led by the Scottish Wildle Trust that is working to protect red squirrels where they are most under threat from the spread of non-native grey squirrels. Squirrel sightings received from the public help the project understand how red and grey squirrel populations are changing over time and decide where to focus conservation efforts.Prject manager Dr Mel Tonkin said: “We monitor squirrel populations throughout the year, and in  we received an incredible  squirrel sightings from members of the public.“This year, thanks to support from National Lottery players, we’re trying something a bit dferent.“By going out and looking for squirrels during the Great Scottish Squirrel Survey people can help us create a more detailed snapshot of the current situation on the ground.”Autumn is an ideal time of year for squirrel-watching. With leaves falling they can be easier to spot as they move through the treetops, foraging for the autumn harvest of seeds, nuts and berries. They will also be spending more time on the ground, building up stores of food in preparation for the colder months ahead.Mel added: “During the survey week you could visit a well-known squirrel stomping ground to help us keep our records up-to-date. data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Jon Marshall, Zero Waste Scotlands recycling sector manager, and chief executive Iain Gulland want recycled food waste to be used to power vehicles, just like the DeLorean car in the movie Back to the Future. \"  \"  Food waste really can power cars like in the s’ Back to the Future movies viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"“Or,you’re feeling adventurous, you could visit a woodland where few sightings have been recorded before. “The more information we receive from the public, the better our understanding of Scotland’s squirrel populations will be.” Gordon Buchanan, wildle filmmaker and Scottish Wildle Trust ambassador, said: “The red squirrel is an iconic Scottish species. “Thanks to conservation efforts their populations are beginning to stabilise, but their future is still under threat. “Taking part in the Great Scottish Squirrel Survey is a really simple way you can help.”The results of the Great Scottish Squirrel Survey will be published later this year.

He said: #We want to thank our residents for doing a great job in increasing the amount of metals they recycle at the kerbside.#However, we want to take that even further now by focusing on foil. I was amazed to learn that an average household can expect to use  foil trays and  metres of foil wrap each year.#The good news is that recycling a tonne of aluminium saves nine tonnes of C emissions and four tonnes of bauxite, the raw material from which aluminium is made. And aluminium can be recycled indefinitely.“So it’s clear that each household converted to foil recycling really does make a dference environmentally. The council also gets a goodfor metals recycling, which helps offset the costs of all our waste disposal activities in Orkney.“But we know from speaking to the public that some people are unaware they can recycle foil in Orkney, or aren’t aware of the benefits. That’s why, with Alupro’s help again, we’ll be highlighting foil recycling during Recycling Week and beyond.”As part of awareness-raising, the council will be installing banners provided by Alupro at recycling centres and other public places around Orkney.OIC’s waste team are also featuring facts and figures about foil recycling on the EcoActive Facebook page, and carrying out visits to schools over Recycling Week.In Orkney, householders can put aluminium foil and foil trays in the metal recycling banks at one of the council’s Household Waste Recycling Centres , or into their recycling bin. The advice is to just rinse off food residue and put in your recycling binalongside other metals you can recycle such as food and drink cans and tins, and metal lids and tops from jars and bottles.For smaller pieces of foilit#s best to make a larger ball of foilby scrunching pieces together # it will prevent smaller pieces falling through machinery during the recycling process.For more information about waste and recycling visit the council#s website or email recycling@orkney.gov.uk .copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Successful generators still sell the electricity they produce on the wholesale market but receive a #top-up# payment over the course of the -year contract.Changes made to rules which had forbidden all onshore wind projects from competing in the electricity market in  meant projects in the Western Isles, Shetland and Orkney were able to compete.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “The UK is leading the way in the fight against climate change, and it’s great news that millions more homes will be powered by clean energy at record low prices.“Seizing the opportunities of clean energy not only helps to protect our planet, but will also back businesses and boost jobs across the UK.”Though they may have won favour with the government, Hoolan#s two Orkney projects have previously been met with protest from the public and rejection by councillors. More than  protestors took to School Place, last September, when the projects appeared before the OIC planning committee. Though there were no statutory objections to either project, there were  letters of objection and  of support for the Costa project. The Hesta Project, meanwhile, received a total of  objections and nine letters of support.Though councillors elected to reject the wind farms, this decision was later overturned by the Scottish Government. This sparked criticism from former planning chairman, Councillor Owen Tierney, who accused the government of #lacking faith# in the local planning system.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I look forward to the project progressing.”Led by ZeroAvia, developers of hydrogen fuel cell powertrain solutions, HyFlyer will demonstrate a phased approach from battery power to hydrogen power, integrating the new technology aboard a Piper M-class six-seater aircraft which will perform test flights out of Cranfield and Orkney.Project partners Intelligent Energy will optimise its high power fuel cell technology for application in aviation while EMEC Hydrogen, producers of green hydrogen from renewable energy, will supply the hydrogen required for flight tests and develop a mobile refuelling  compatible with the plane.The HyFlyer project will see conventional piston engines in propeller aircraft replaced by electric motors, hydrogen fuel cells and gas storage.If all goes well, ZeroAvia, based in Calornia, are aiming to supply the technology to commercial manufacturers by .Following this demonstration, the next goal then is to power an aircraft, carrying up to  passengers, to travel  miles.According to the Air Transport Action Group, aviation is responsible for  per cent of CO emissions from all transport sources and is one of the fastest growing sources of global emissions.Val Mtakhov, founder and CEO of ZeroAvia, said: “The substantial backing provided by the UK Government underlines the potential that hydrogen holds as a fuel source for commercial aviation and provides signicant validation of ZeroAvia’s approach to zero emission flight.“Our project goal of  NM is equivalent to the distance from London to Edinburgh and will prove that zero emission aviation, powered by hydrogen, can play a key role within the UK and other countries’ transport strategies — enabling net zero targets to be met and improving productivity and regional prosperity.”Richard Ainsworth, Hydrogen Project Specialist at EMEC Hydrogen, said: “HyFlyer is another key step in Orkney’s aim to decarbonise leline transport services for islanded communities.#Hydrogen has the potential to help meet our emission commitments where electrons and batteries can’t.#This project sees us one step closer to meeting our fuel and energy needs from abundant local renewable energy resources using green hydrogen.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

So when they retire the feeling of sadness is akin to a death in the family.John Humphrys of the Today programme was the irascible uncle, the kind who at dinner would be very likely to start an argument while grace was being said – but first thing in the morning his rigour and tenacity as he, metaphorically at least, pinned an evasive politician under the wheels of the radio van until the poor sap answered the question would set me up for the challenges of the day.: Jackie Bird reveals she has quit Reporting ScotlandFor unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website hereBut we in Scotland are soon to suffer a loss far more grave. When we bid farewell to this bitter and isive year Jackie Bird won’t be around to point the way towards a hopefully better . Stop all the clocks. Stop them around .pm on  December. Cancel Hogmanay!Bird has fronted BBC Scotland’s Auld Year’s Night shindig since back in the auld century. If Humphrys was the grumpy uncle then she was the whoop-it-up aunt in the sparkly dress, capable of embarrassing you in your teens with slobbery festive-season kisses, but who you’d eventually come to appreciate was a good laugh and crucial to every party.Well, the party’s over. Hogmanay Live is to be revamped – it will probably get a name-change – and won’t be hosted by Bird. Unlike Humphrys who has gone willingly and was granted a long goodbye last week and one final opportunity to rough up David Cameron, Bird had rather hoped to stay involved, despite having quit newsreading duties earlier this year. But she was only offered a ten-minute slot leading up to the bells in Edinburgh – “You’ll have had your black bun” as they sometimes say in the capital – and has declined. Now I can’t get out of my head the sad image of Bird trudging the streets on a broken heel, her carryout bag about to burst, as she peers up at tenements looking for a light in a window, flickering to the beat of Prince’s , the year she first presented Hogmanay Live. Oh, and she’s got Phil Cunningham and Aly Bain propping each other up behind her as it doesn’t look like the trusty duo will be part of the new-look show either.Maybe Bird hasn’t been your glass of warm prosecco these past  years. If that’s the case, then it’s typical of the complex relationship Scots have with Hogmanay. It’s summed up for me by memories of my mother looking out the Crabbie’s Green Ginger Wine in anticipation of first-footers on that specially Scottish night of nights – and at the same time my father bolting the door.Everything about Hogmanay is complex, including the black bun. It looks luxurious but after you’ve gorged on it you feel like you’ve swallowed a depth-charge. The idea of a gigantic party sounds great but before too long you’ll be stuck in a corner having zoned out of a conversation with a woman about schools – this is an Edinburgh party – but becoming more and more morose as you reflect on the year ending and the diddly-squat you’ve achieved during it.For a long time Scots liked being viewed as unofficial world champs at Hogmanay, partly because our dear friends in England seemed to struggle with the concept. But when that status became official and Edinburgh started hosting the biggest open-air rave-up on the planet some of us thought: “This isn’t us. This rampant exhibitionism, frolicking in the Firth of Forth and all that, isn’t Scottish. Let’s get back to drinking an estuary’s worth of beer in the privacy of our own parlours then sleeping off the hangover while everything’s shut for two whole days.”Putting Hogmanay on TV is certainly complex. As any film director will tell you, party scenes are tricky to pull off. The nightclub looks half-empty because not enough extras have been hired and when the party is in a house, actors can prove themselves surprisingly bad at dancing, though I suppose the glass heron figurines can be inhibiting. When the programme is live, the date is  December and the entertainment are pished, though, then you’re asking for trouble. There was one notorious show, Live into ’, where comedian Chic Murray “died” and actor John Grieve “corpsed” and a drunken reveller groped singer Maggie Moone mid-song. Actually there were quite a few notorious shows, presenting a portrait of Caledonia that we thought the rest of Britain and, by extension the world, wanted to see. BBC Scotland producer Iain MacFadyen was the master of these hoary heather ’n’ haggis-stuffed heuch-athons, earning him the nickname of the Ayatollah Hogmanay.To minimise risk Grampian used to drape country houses in tinsel and pre-record their New Year celebrations in August. But, you know, I reckon Bird could have coped with one of those Hogmanays from hell. I can see her smiling sweetly while Tennent’s Lager Lovelies cavort with men dressed as Lee’s macaroon bars and a flying caber knocks out the foremost authority on William McGonagall just as Simple Minds roar into a medley of their hits.Unfortunately I’m not going to see this. I’m not going to see Bird again on Auld Year’s Night and that’s a great pity. In a dignied farewell, she says she knows what’s in the re-styled show but won’t comment on it, simply wishing Beeb Scotland well with their new endeavour. Should the rest of us be worried  Perhaps. Much as I would like to be more like my mum, I fear I’m turning into my dad. Thus, not only will the door be bolted, I might have to switch off the TV as well.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"leader comment there is no travel insurance for the thomas cook employees","story":"Within hours of the Thomas Cook collapse, accusations were surfacing about rival holiday firms cashing in by hiking their prices. Meanwhile, the UK’s largest peacetime repatriation swung into action as the Civil Aviation Authority worked out how to bring , stranded tourists back home. Families turned up at airports not knowingthey were going to get to go on holidays, other stories surfaced about honeymoons and weddings thrown into chaos. It is, however you look at it, an appalling situation, and our sympathies are with everyone affected. Amid all the rolling coverage yesterday, however, one element appeared all but overlooked. The fact that , people, , of whom are in the UK have not lost their holidays with Thomas Cook’s failure but their livelihoods. While the £ million Operation Matterhorn is bringing tourists home, another looming challenge for the governments in both London and Edinburgh will be the thousands now out of work. The arguments over whether the UK Government was right to refuse a bail-out to the stricken travel giant will continue. There are questions around what it knew when and whether it could have stepped in sooner to prevent catastrophe. There is further anger over the lack of scrutiny of its actions caused by the proroguing of parliament. But none of that changes the simple fact that a -year-old business, a mainstay of the British high street for so long, has disappeared forever. Once the immediate challenge of repatriation is complete, efforts have to turn to supporting the Thomas Cook employees into alternative employment as quickly as possible. It is reassuring to see the Scottish Government has already made an offer of support through its Partnership Action for Continuing Employmentinitiative, and the support available on a UK-wide scale should be far greater.The thousands of holidaymakers caught up in the chaos can retain some comfort that their holidays were protected by law and they will be refunded, albeit they may face a long wait. Others waiting to fly home, can be reassured that the Government will arrange alternative flights for them.The thousands out of work as a result of Thomas Cook’s demise have no such reassurance today. ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"richard madden jack lowden kelly macdonald and jenna coleman to compete for bafta scotland honours","story":"TV mystery The Cry, which Doctor Who favourite Coleman starred in and was partly filmed in Glasgow, leads the race for honours with Wild Rose, the hit Glasgow-set movie about a country singer, played by Irish actress Wild Rose, pursuing her dreams of going to Nashville.The awards ceremony, which will be hosted by broadcaster Edith Bowman in Glasgow on  November, will be screened by the new BBC Scotland channel, its first TV coverage for more than a decade.Organisers also revealed that they had seen an almost of almost  per cent in entries in the space of  months, which they partly credited to the boost to the industry brought by the arrival of the new channel earlier this year.This years shortlists also see a noticeable increase in the number of women recognised, with three female writers - Nicole Taylor for Wild Rose, Jacquelin Perske for The Cry and Kirstie Swain for Pure - in competition and two films made by women - Only You and Freedom Fields - in contention for the best feature honour.Madden, who is shortlisted for the gripping BBC One drama Bodyguard, will be up against former Eastenders star Alex Ferns, for his role in Emmy award-winning series Chernobyl and Ncuti Gatwa, the Scottish star of hit Netflix drama Sex Education, for the best TV actor prize.Kelly Macdonald, who is honoured for her role as a grieving mother in The Victim, will compete for the best TV actress honour against Jenna Coleman and Morven Christie, star of ITV crime drama The Bay.Jessie Buckley will be up against Harry Potter star Henderson, who is nominated for her performance as Oliver Hardys we opposite John C Reilly in Stan and Ollie, and Florence Pugh, for her role in Outlaw King, Netflixs Robert the Bruce epic, in the best film actress category.In the best film actor category, Jack Lowden, one of the stars of Mary Queen of Scots, is up against rising star Lorn Macdonald, who is nominated for his performance in s rave culture drama Beats, and Peter Mullan, for his role in The Vanishing, a psychological thriller set in and around a remote Hebridean lighthouse, which was shot on location in south-west Scotland.Jon S Baird, the Aberdeenshire-born filmmaker, is in the running for the best film director honour, along with Brian Welsh, for Beats, and Johnny Kenton for Endeavour.Bowman said: \"There has been a real focus over the last couple of years about the role of women within the film and TV industries.\"I think people have addressed that and we are now beginning to see the fruits of those changes.

But this week the #Peatbogs# will be back on home turf to showcase their energetic brand of traditional-inspired electronica as part of this year#s Skye Live Festival.The rare Skye gig will mark the start of another autumn tour for the six-piece group, for whom constant re-invention has proved key to longevity spanning almost three decades.The sound that#ll boom out in the tent high above Portree Harbour this Saturday will be far removed from the group#s roots as a folk band playing in local pubs. But the Peatbogs, like more recent successors such as Niteworks, are a reminder that a grounding in traditional music is no barrier to a letime of instrumental experimentation.Le for the Peatbog Faeries began with a gig in Edinbane Lodge in the spring of . Peter Morrison and bass player Innes Hutton from Braes # the two constants in the line-up # were joined by Davie Tait, Ali Pentland and Alan Edmunds.Pubs and village hall dances became their early staple, but gradually more adventurous elements crept into their set and the audiences lapped it up.Morrison recalled: #We#d bring in a blues or a reggae sound, and we found it was these things that started to go down best with audiences.#We moved to more of a world music sound around about , but we never expected much to come of it. We were just out to play at pubs and parties and have a bit of fun#.Their first tape # the #Great Ceilidh Swindle# # sold well locally and paid for a demo in Edinburgh, which in turn caught the ear of Greentrax Records, the specialist label in Scottish traditional music.With bands like Shooglenty and Martyn Bennett also arriving on the scene it proved a perfect time to be breaking new ground and the Peatbog Faeries# debut album #Mellowsity# would stay in Greentrax#s top ten for the next decade-and-a-half.Morrison remembers: #Because of our size and sound, bands like us and Shooglenty cost a lot more to record than other folk bands at the time. So there was a worry at the start.#But as soon as we signed to Greentrax, we quite quickly got an agent and we got sought-after slots at Glastonbury, Nomad and Celtic Connections.#We didn#t really notice what was happening, in a way # it felt like one day we were playing in the pub, the next day playing in front of thousands.#There weren#t that many precedents for bands like ours. Most folk bands just played in pubs. There were some accordion bands that were full-time or groups like #Silly Wizard#, but for us coming out of Skye we never thought it would turn into a full-time occupation.#We just went with the flow and luckily for us it proved a lot more popular than we thought it would be.#The band#s line-up has changed several times, and in turn, each addition helped explore new sounds # the most dramatic sht coming when Rick Taylor and Nigel Hitchcock arrived on Skye in the s to add a three-piece brass section.Taylor # who passed away earlier this year # was a revered musician who had toured with Elton John, while in recent years the Peatbog#s fiddler Peter Tickell left the group to take to the road with Sting.The current scaled-back line-up has seen Morrison and Hutton joined by Edinburgh-based Tom Salter on guitar keyboard player Graeme Stafford from Ardnamurchan drummer Stu Haikney and Shetlander Ross Couper on fiddle.For Peter Morrison, the global tours, the record deals and the Glastonbury stage all owe their origins to the chance he got to learn the chanter in the long-since closed Vatten Bridge primary school.He explains: #Every year Norman MacLeod # the teacher#s husband # and John Laing used to pipe us all in to the Christmas Party, so that was where I first heard the pipes.#Every pupil got the chance of learning the chanter at school, and I think nine of us started playing. It was either that or an hour of maths.#I think I was the only one who carried on into secondary school, but I got the bug. I didn#t like the competing part, but I enjoyed listening to the pipes and learning to play them.#My pal Donnie MacAskill from Roag also played the accordion, so I learned to play drums along with him and from about the age of  I was always in bands.#Morrison#s early piping tutor was Cameron MacFadyen, and he received additional help from Nicol Campbell # another well-known local piper and character from Dunvegan, whose memory has been honoured across the globe.Morrison added: #When he passed away Nicol left me his kilt, which has since been worn on stages in Japan, Africa and America.#A joiner to trade, who also worked for aperiod as a hotelier in Dunvegan, Peter Morrison has seen attitudes to traditional music change over the years, and with it opportunities flourish.He still lives in Roag with we Johan and grown-up kids Jenny and Calum, and it#s no surprise to hear him promote the virtues of free access to music tuition in local schools.He continues to be #amazed# at some of the local talent learning traditional instruments, some of whom he can be heard playing alongside at regular music sessions laid on in the Edinbane Inn and the Old Inn in Carbost.#It#s changed a lot since when I was a youngster whenyou wanted to learn music the only real opportunity was the pipes,# he recalled.#Things like the fis movement have been really helpful in creating opportunities. There now seems to be a constant stream of really good young musicians coming out of Skye.#When I started you would never have thought of making a career out of it, but now with some of these youngsters, it seems to be the only thing they think about. #A lot of these kids are now at a standard that in previous years only a handful of people in Scotland were achieving.#In Skye you have the likes of Daimh, Niteworks, Bridghe Campbell # the list goes on and on. #At these regular sessions there are some great young local players going along like Anna Scott, Dugald McKiggan, Archie and Isobel Maclean and Malin Lewis.#Morrison continued: #Recently over in LorientI saw a great act. It was a Sikh beatboxer, accompanied by step-dancer Sophie Stevenson along with Catherine Tinney from Portree singing puirt-a-beul.#This was another Skye person on the international stage, singing to an incredible standard, but she was someone I#d never heard sing before. #In the past, going somewhere like Lorient,there was a person from Skye on stage you would know exactly who it was # they would be an established name. Now you can go somewhere like that and get a surprise.#It shows the strength in depth there is now.#Some of that west-coast musical talent will be showcased at Skye Live this weekend among a ied line-up that will also include some of the country#s top nightclub DJs.Morrison urged the local community to rally behind the festival weekend, which this year starts with a Thursday-night concert to the Waterboys.He added: #We played at the very first Skye Live five years ago and are looking forward to getting on stage at the Lump in Portree again.#It#s an iconic setting, but organisers have kept the festival to a level that is comfortable for the place.#A capacity of , people is about a fth of the population of Skye and is manageable. When you start to go into the tens of thousands it brings pressures, and it#s a risk to go too big without the infrastructure to support it.#Whenever anyone organises a festival there will always be people who might want to pick holes in it or knock it in some way.#But people need to remember that these guys are putting on a  for so many types of music.#It#s something people of all ages can go to and hear some of the best music in Scotland in Portree. I would hope local people can support it in any way they can.#The Skye Live festival runs from Thursday th until Saturday th September.

The volunteers cover quite a large area, including Broughshane, Kells, Ballymena and the surrounding rural local areas.The group has  volunteers, however by August it had responded to  purple and red incidents in support of the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service.This translates into  inidual responses. The group prefers to send more than one responder to each patient in case their needs are beyond the capacity of a single person. Cardiac arrest is a case in point and while only three of patients have been in this specic condition, many more have been suffering from chest pain.Responders grow in experience and expertise, with the group aiming to have an experienced person at each incident to support them. The four committee members have ided this task between them.The more active members are learning fast, particularly through their exposure to NIAS crews and rapid response paramedics, who have been patient and helpful with them.The group held their second monthly members meeting and training event at the end of August and used this to reflect on their experiences, share what they had learned and build vital patient care competence.More members are needed and they are asking people to get in touchthey want to volunteer.

Find out when the exams are and get the advice that the schools give out, but don’t waste your energy following rumours about what the grade is. It’s better to spend your time helping your child.It’s always worth practising. Whatever schools say, it’s worth it. Children can improve their performance by  -% by careful practice.Start earlyyou can, but don’t worryyou haven’t. Ideally it is best to start preparation for the Transfer Test exam at least one year ahead. However, don’t panicyou don’t have that much time even a few weeks can make a dference.Make a simple action plan. However long you’ve got, have a clear, simple strategy. There are two key principles: . Start from your child’s present level of knowledge. . Help your child to learn from their mistakes.Motivation, motivation, motivation! You have to take your child with you on this journey. A simple rewards system can be highly effective.Don’t just practice. There’s a tendency to think that just practising one test after anther will do the trick. It’s far more important to learn from mistakes. Going through the test afterwards with your child and filling in the the gaps in learning is crucial.Stay calm, manage stress, build confidence. Don’t talk about the Transfer test all the time. Use breaks, treats and bite-sized learning sessions to keep things fresh. Be realistic about your child’s potential. Pass or fail, it’s important to try to make this process a positive one.Manage the exam day. Make sure that you have everything ready for the day, that your child tries to get a good night’s sleep, eats breakfast and gets there in good time.How and when to use our testsIt’s best to use them as real exam practice. These tests are mock exams. They are set out in a style as close as possible to the real thing – though the format will y from year to year. It is best to use them as authentic exam experience rather than for general practice. Follow the instructions and advice in the sections before starting the test.What a score means and how to boost itIt is unfortunately impossible to say that a certain score can guarantee a pass in the actual exams. However, we suggest that a score of % would be a standard to aim at. It is important not to present this to your child as a concrete benchmark though, as the best motivator for them is to see the scores going up. Here are some tried and tested tips for improvement.Go over any incorrect answers. Always go over incorrect answers so that your child can see what went wrong. To help with this process, some of our harder Maths questions are explained.Use an action planner inside. This will provide a plan for what to do next when a test has been marked.Improve basic exam technique. Work on improving speed, working efficiently – coming back to trickier questions later – and pacing within the time limit.Improve general English skills. Ensure the foundations are strong enough. Use a range of checklists to help reinforce your child’s English skills.Target what is not fully understood. The secret is not to keep blindly practising but to target the areas of English Maths that your child is weakest in. This is where crucial marks can be picked up.Once your child has completed the papers you can download the corresponding answer sheets here:Answer sheets: Monday rd SeptemberAnswer sheets: Tuesday th SeptemberAnswer sheets: Wednesday th SeptemberAnswer sheets: Thursday th SeptemberAnswer sheets: Friday th SeptemberAnswer sheets: Saturday th SeptemberIf you would like to access the answer sheets for the transfer test practice papers from April May , you can access them here.Answer sheets: Monday th AprilAnswer sheets: Tuesday th AprilAnswer sheets: Wednesday st MayAnswer sheets: Thursday nd MayAnswer sheets: Friday rd MayAnswer sheets: Saturday th May"},{"url":null,"title":"28k for woman sacked by northern ireland firm for","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I was very worried that the stress could cause complications or even a miscarriage.\"We were in a very bad situation for a time and it is a great relief to me to have this all finished.\"Ms Gruzdaites case was supported by the Equality Commission. She added: \"I am very grateful to the Equality Commission for helping me.\"No woman should lose her job because she is pregnant and it is important that women challenge such treatment.\"Ms Gruzdaite and her husband Andrius Jasinevicius started work at McGrane Nurseries Ltd, a wholesale suppliers of plants, in January , and were given a blank contract to sign with no start or end dates.She believed she was coming to Northern Ireland for a permanent job but at no point was she told it was to be a seasonal job.When she announced her pregnancy and showed the appointment letter for her first antenatal appointment to one of her managers on September , , he forgot to tell the other manager about it.Ms Gruzdaite was called to a meeting on September  with both managers to explain why she had not been at work.She also told a manager on October  about a later scan appointment on October , and she was called in to a meeting about her absence on October .The tribunal found that she was unjustiably questioned about her absence on September  and October  when she had told her manager that she was off for antenatal appointments.The employer accepted that they failed to pay Ms Gruzdaite for her time off attending the antenatal appointments.The tribunal found that a manager was less friendly to Ms Gruzdaite after she announced her pregnancy.On October , while she and her husband were at that antenatal appointment, their employers held a meeting at which a group of seasonal workers were given one weeks notice of termination.The couple were subsequently called in to meet with their employers on October  and were informed of their dismissal.Other seasonal workers were kept on by the employer and carried out the duties previously performed by Laura.On that day, her manager said to her: \"You will need more days off for your pregnancy doctors appointment... you already skipped work on Wednesday when you had your ultrasound scan.\"At tribunal, Ms Gruzdaite said: \"On that day I got very upset because both of our contracts had been terminated.\"We were waiting for our child to come into this world but both of us were unemployed and had no additional income.\"When I ed to my place of work following this conversation, I felt nauseous, my hands were shaking, and I felt a dull pain and a stretching sensation in my stomach.\"The tribunal concluded the decision to terminate Ms Gruzdaites contract was tainted by discrimination in that it was connected to her pregnancy.Her dismissal was both unfair and an act of unlawful discrimination, it ruled.Dr Michael Wardlow, the chief commissioner of the Equality Commission, said around a quarter of all the complaints of discrimination made to its advice line each year are to do with sex discrimination.Of those, consistently the largest number, around % of the total, are about pregnancy and maternity discrimination.Mr Wardlow said: \"It is dispiriting that we are at tribunal once again supporting another case of pregnancy discrimination.\"Im afraid this is still all too common and, in spite of the legislation being in place for more than  years, some employers still seem to be unaware of the law and the consequences of breaching it.\"Laura Gruzdaite was  weeks pregnant at the time she and her husband were dismissed.\"They had arrived in Northern Ireland ready and willing to work and have started to make their le here.\"Lauras husband has since found other work and she is caring for their baby.\"A spokesperson for McGrane Nurseries said: \"We acknowledge the findings of the Equality Commission.\"We have engaged the services of a professional HR company who are assisting us in implementing a series of policies and practices to ensure we meet the highest standards in relation to the issues highlighted in the judgment of this case.\"This situation should never have occurred. We apologise to Laura for the upset caused to both her and her family and hope that this ruling will allow them to move forward.\""},{"url":null,"title":"all northern ireland paper 5 and 10 banknotes to be withdrawn from circulation","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Tragically, Dessie was killed in a car crash in .“Dessie was the best of us. Him and Brendan were the two runners. Dessie was a great runner at school and then at Sparta where he was captain. He was a very popular fella.“As well as being a great runner he was a great captain. He looked after his charges very well.“Brendan and his we both ran for Northern Ireland and were both very good athletes. Dessie ran shorter distances whereas Brendan ran anything from km right through to the marathon.”Harry was somewhat of a late starter when it came to running, his brothers talked him into it at a time he was overweight in the early s. About a year later he competed in his first marathon in Dublin.He was one of the founding members of Foyle Valley Athletics Club in . At the time they were told it wouldn’t survive six months, but  years later it now has approximately  members.It is an “all ability club” with dferent groups meeting weekly at Templemore Sports Complex and in the Waterside. “Anybody who wants to run will get the opportunity butyou don’t want to compete you can join to keep fit. We like people to compete but don’t put anyone under pressure to do so.”“I, to be perfectly frank, wasn’t brought in for my athletic expertise, I’m not saying I was useless but would’ve been average, but that fits into the ethos of the club.”Personal bestDespite his modesty, Harry has run impressive times over the years, recording a sub--hour marathon in Belfast. That is no mean feat, it requires dedicated training, and, on the day you have to run an average of around : per mile across the . mile course.Harry recalled his brother Dessie spurring him on as he neared the finish line that day, sadly, it would be the last time he saw him alive.“It was the st of May  and Dessie was killed ten days later on the th. I hadn’t enough long runs coming into it and at the latter stages I was absolutely out of it, really struggling.“Dessie was there at the  mile mark and, in Belfast I don’t know anybody, but I heard this voice shouting ‘Harry, get your head up out of your chest! You’ve come through  mile in : you can break  hours but you’re going to have to work for it’.“It just gave me enough encouragement to keep going. He came round to see me at the finish line. “He had just moved to Belfast and wanted me to see his new house but I had come with a crowd of boys on a train and said I’d be up in a couple of weeks to spend the weekend, to do a bit of running and play some snooker.“But he was killed ten days later.”Marty Gallaghergoogletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshTwenty years later, Marty Gallagher, a young prodigy of Harry’s, was killed in similarly tragic circumstances.Next month fty members of Foyle Valley will take part in this year’s Dublin marathon in memory of Marty who died after being hit by a car on the Racecourse Road while ing home on Halloween night.Martin was -years-old and it will be his th anniversary this year.Reflecting, Harry said: “Marty Gallagher was a lovely young fella, very modest, unassuming, and comes from such a nice family.“He was a member of the club and would’ve been one of my prodigies when he first came into running, I would’ve nurtured him, but then he got to the stage where he was too quick for me and I couldn’t stay with him. I’d have needed a bike to keep up with him.”Harry has been fortunate to avoid serious injury over the years aside from breaking his ankle in . Doctors warned that without an operation he would have chronic arthritis and would never run again.“You learn to live with the fact that on the long runs you’re going to be in pain. I was lucky to get away with running the Derry marathon this year.”After a more recent x-ray, a doctor warned thathe continued at his present rate he would need a new ankle.“I wear an ankle support and patella support, but you’re not going to let stuff like that stop you,” he added.CamaraderieSpecial club memories include a time when members competed in the All Ireland Marathon Championship in Mallow Co. Cork, in . They won the senior marathon and veteran’s championships.As winners they had the honour of hosting the competition in Derry the following year. It was a very successful event which stands out as one of the clubs highlights.Harry finished second in the veterans team and his brother Brendan competed well in the senior team.Looking back at other fond memories, Harry cited the Walled City Marathon in , which was the first marathon to be held in Derry for many years.“I thoroughly enjoyed it, along with the London marathon, I’ve done four of them, and the Great North Run, which I’ve done twice.“But the club itself, the camaraderie is just unbelievable. It’s a social outlet more than anything . In terms of the people, not just at Foyle Valley but running in general, there are very few people I’ve met through running that I could say I didn’t like, they’re all good hearted, good natured people, and help you in any way they can. They’re gracious in defeat and generous in victory.“Foyle Valley has a great family atmosphere,someone is training for a marathon they will always train with you and help you through. That’s part of the ethos of the club.”Fitness has become an essential component of many people’s lives as experts regularly expound on the benefits to both physical and mental health.Therefore, the emergence of new clubs, and the introduction of couch to k runs, has been “one of the best” things to happen in the city in Harry’s view. “The people behind these clubs love their running and are so friendly. They got people out who never would’ve necessarily been interested in running, and now they’re doing half marathons and marathons - that’s fabulous.”"},{"url":null,"title":"department weighing medical school options","story":"The Department of Health is assessing the cost-effectiveness of locating a Medical School in Derry and said any final decision will require ministerial sign off.The Medical School forms part of Derry’s City Deal proposals and as such the local council is engaging with the UK government to see “ this project would be eligible for UKG funding under the City Deals programme or the Integrated Education Fund.”The Ulster University has been for some time considering the development of a Graduate Entry Medical Schoolto be located in Derry and this project proposal features heavily in the Derry City  Strabane District Council’s economic regeneration plans for the region.With the support of the Local Council the University partners have been engaging with a number of NI Departments in an effort to progress this proposal.A spokesperson for UU confirmed that as part of its latest business case it aims to have its first academic year of enrolments for the GEMS in  .The Northern Ireland Department of Healthis acutely aware of the pressures on the medical workforce across Health and Social Careand its key role in leading the transformation of services set out in Delivering Together.Accordingly, DoH commissioned a Medical School Places Review, led by Professor Keith Gardiner, to determine the optimum number of medical school places that Northern Ireland requires per year. His report, published on  January , raises challenging, long-term, strategic and cross-cutting questions with major financial implications.Amongst other issues, it recommends expanding medical training places by at least  per year, potentially costing up to an additional £m per year when fully implemented. This report is a key consideration of UU in putting forward its proposal for a medical school in Derry.While DoH has been assisting UU in the development of its Outline Business Casefor a Graduate Entry Medical School at Magee Campus, this is separate from any decision on medical student expansion in Northern Ireland. Feedback was provided on  July  to the fourth iteration of the OBC.Any commissioning of additional medical places for Northern Ireland must address comprehensively the full range of available options, with a particular focus on the assessment of value for money and affordability for health and social care, the report says.“For example, rather than simply expanding medical student numbers, it will be important to explore lower-cost measures likely to increase the supply of medics over the short-term and which enhance and maximise the signicant investment currently being made in undergraduate medical education.“DoH is developing a business case to consider these matters. Given the cross-cutting nature and potential for signicant associated costs with the Medical School business case, the DoH Permanent Secretary has advised that any decision on this or other long-term options, must be considered by Northern Ireland Executive Ministers.”It added: “The provision of HE places in NI or the establishment of a medical school in Derry is a devolved matter, however, the Derry  Strabane City District Council is presently engaging with UKG to considerthis project would be eligible for UKG funding under the City Deals programme or the Integrated Education Fund.“The medical school is one part of a wider package of proposals currently under consideration with other draft proposals included that could complement existing specialties at the Magee Campus.“The development of the Council’s final bids for a City Deal from the Inclusive Future Fund is still ongoing and as of August , there has been no official final bid submitted for either funding stream to UKG, including no formal bid to provide funding to a Derry medical school.”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshPhoto: projected image of what Magee will look likeexpanded with Graduate Entry Medical School by the riverfront."},{"url":null,"title":"derry public invited quiz karaoke holywell trust support honesty cafe","story":"The Derry public have been invited to a quiz and karaoke night in support of the Holywell Trusts Honesty Cafe this Friday night, September .The cafe, which is the first initiative of its kind in Derry,  allows people to pay what they can.  It has been warmly welcomed by locals for its inclusive ethos and has been running successfully for three months.It is based in the Holywell building on Bishop Street but people can also enjoy their lunch in the Garden of Reflection.There is no till but instead three honesty boxes so people can pay whatever they decide its worth or contribute what they can afford.  If they have no cash they can donate online on our website.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshWith many people in poverty who have to make use of food banks it is a positive scheme which relies on public generosity and kind-heartedness - something Derry people are known to possess in abundance.Customers are able pay it forward so that someone in greater need can eat for less or for freeneeds be.Antoin OHara who frequents the cafe has organised the fundraising event and would urge people to come along and donate what they can.The event begins at pm and people can bring their own refreshments."},{"url":null,"title":"door now wide open independent nw university derry university group","story":"A spokesperson for the Derry University Group has responded to the report on higher education published by Julian Smith.We welcome the clarity provided by this report and intend to respond in full in due course.At the outset, we wish to thank Lord Andrew Adonis, the Shadow Employment Minister Mike Amesbury MP and the Shadow Schools Minister Mike Kane MP for championing this issue at Westminster, and also the authors of this report.The Shadow Education Minister Angela Rayner has also raised the prospect of Derry availing of Transformation Fundingand we thank her for that proposal.On initial reading, this report provides a roadmap as to how the North West can develop its own autonomous university.

It read: “YOU ARE NOW ENTERING EXTINCTION ”, and encouraged people to join the environmental movement.By Saturday that message had been defaced by someone who scrawled \"globalist agenda\" underneath.The catalyst for the environmental movement is fteen-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg. Last year she protested for more than a month prior to Swedens parliamentary elections by sitting alone on the steps of the parliament building in Stockholm.Following the elections she spent Fridays there demanding the government undertake a radical response to climate change.She has since inspired a mass movement supported by people, young and old, around the world.On Saturday Derry people continued to champion her cause by carrying placards reading, The Sea is Rising and so are We and We Need to Change the Politics not the Climate.Linda O Sullivan of Friends of the Earth told an audience gathered in the Guildhall that we are facing an \"existential crisis\" and people \"need to be held accountable\".And Paddy Nash, musician and environmentalist, sang a song inspired by the Save Our Sperrins campaign against gold mining.

Starring alongside Chris in the film were André Hollandand Natalie Martinez .Scottish-born Chrismoved to Magherafelt in , where he worked as a personal trainer. He said that his acting career really began when the opportunity arose to work as an extra on Game of Thrones.As well as appearing as a member of the Nights Watch in three seasons of the show, hes also featured in Superman drama Krypton and filmed sword-fighting scenes for the film Viking Destiny, which is available on Netflix.He first heard about the Jurassic World role when a friend tagged him on Facebook in a post from Louise Kiely Casting, which gave away very few details about the role.“They were looking for a biker with a flawless American accent. I just thought Id go for it and see what happens,” he said.Chris said that when it came to the day of the audition in Dublin he was “sweating bullets” and almost didnt go through with it.“Just as I was walking up to the door, I sort of freaked out. I went past it and I said to myself I cant do this just because of the nerves, because I wanted it so badly,” he said.“Then I was thinking to myself, youve come this far, you need to do this. I genuinely thought I didnt stand a chance as I knew Id be up against actors with more experience.”“I went and got myself two pints of Guinness, settled my nerves and went back. I was happy when I came out and thought Id done well but I thought it would just be good experience and that I wasnt going to get it.”A few weeks later the casting agent emailed Chris to let him know that the role was his, but he still didnt know exactly what he had been cast in.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“I thought it was probably some low-budget thing, but I was happy to get the experience and a few lines. To me, that would be a start at least.”Chris found a few clues about the production by looking up Jurassic World  director Colin Trevorrow on IMDB, but it was only at a costume fitting that he fully realised how big an opportunity he had been given.“They werent even allowed to say it but it was so secret,” he said.“One of the girls said to me that all they tell could me was that it rhymes with schminosaurs and I just knew. I was just blown away because Ive always loved Jurassic Park.”The eight-minute film was filmed in January in Co Wicklow, which means that Chris is happy to finally be able to talk about the role hes had to keep under wraps for months.“The weirdest thing is just seeing my name in the credits. Thats one of the most surreal things,” he said.Chris said that he hopes to find an agent in the near future to help him land more roles. He believes that a talent for accents hes developed from a young age can help him secure some great parts.“Accents have always been something that comes naturally to me. Even when I was only about four or five years old, I would talk to myself in the mirror and try out lots of dferent accents.”This skill came in handy when Chris played redneck biker Greg with an American accent so accurate that the production crew assumed it was his regular speaking voice.“Most of the crew on the set thought I was an American actor,” Chris said.“It wasnt until Id done my first scene and I asked someone what time it was, that they realised I wasnt an American. They couldnt believe it when I said Id just came down from Magherafelt.”"},{"url":null,"title":"mayor renews call back supporting people programme frontline workers","story":"The Mayor of Derry and Strabane has stressed the need for employers to “review their practices” and value the workers who are supporting some of the most vulnerable people in society.Supporting People Programme workers provide housing related support services, help people affected by domestic violence, those with addictions, families with child protection concerns, people in need of benefit advice and more.Earlier this year the local council unanimously backed a motion which recognised the work of frontline workers and called for an independent review into the programme, including terms and conditions of its workers.In a statement to the Derry News this week, Mayor, Michaela Boyle of Sinn Féin, reiterated the need to back workers: \"As Mayor I would like to voice my support for those involved in the Supporting People Programme, and stress the need to protect and respect the rights of frontline workers.\"This is an issue that affects so many people in the Derry and Strabane area who are dealing daily with the challenges of providing a valuable support service helping some of the most vulnerable people in our society.\"This matter needs to be urgently addressed and I would encourage those employers involved to review their practices and fully acknowledge the value of the staff delivering these much needed specialist services.\"Niall McCarroll, UNISON community branch chairperson said the Supporting People Campaign presented \"damning evidence\" to Derry City and Strabane District Councils Health and Community Committee.It detailed the outworkings of outsourced public contracts and the growing crisis within the Department for Communities and NIHE funded Supporting People Programme - \"a crisis which is impeding service delivery for vulnerable people and denying frontline workers the right to social justice.\"With specic reference to supported living workplaces, he said, the reality of outsourcing within the community sector is that some employers, unchallenged, choose not to value their frontline workers whilst garnishing a select few, who they deem worthy.\"The transfer of public services has many beneficiaries, however working class people are not included but rather excluded from benefiting from an honest days work.\"UNISON Community Branch activists are working hard and are committed to building a community wide culture of solidarity with regards the Supporting People Campaign and now with the direct involvement and support of the Mayor this solidarity focused campaign has become more dynamic and influential.\"The UNISON led Save the Foyle Haven Campaign began with the workers getting organised, the wider community mobilising in support and finally DCSDC joined the campaign through the office of the Mayor and collectively the workers driven movement protected jobs and a much valued and needed service.\"He continued: \"These are the fundamentals of any trade union movement campaigning formula, a blueprint for equality, integrity and the downfall of self serving governance.\"On behalf of our branch membership a UNISON delegation will now meet with the Mayor to deliver a list of human rights based questions, for both employers and all relevant statutory bodies to provide answers.\"The employers and statutory agencies will now be called in front of the DCSDC Health and Community Committee to engage in the UNISON led Supporting People Campaign as we focus on protecting the Supporting People programme and safeguarding frontline workers against corporate greed and those not fit for purpose employers who operate within this sector.\"The right of everyone to the enjoyment of just and favourable conditions of work is recognised in the United Nations International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, its time this same right was honoured and upheld within the Supporting People programme.\"UNISON would like to thank the DCSDC Health and Community Committee for the genuine support offered following the UNISON presentation to council and we look forward to working closely with them in the future.\"googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot

googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshFirstly, we asked does UU have any update or response regarding the medical school and concerns raised by David Sterling around the need for ongoing funding which UU is not prepared to invest   A spokesperson for Ulster University commented: \"Following cross-party political and health and social care support in  for Ulster University’s Graduate Entry Medical School, the University has continued to proactively develop the project, working closely with the Department and other relevant partners. Our responses to any remaining clarications within the Graduate Entry Medical School business case were submitted to the Department of Health at the start of July, following prompt and close engagement with the Department and other relevant partners. Our proposed first academic year of projected enrolments outlined within the updated business case is  .“As the Department of Health has previously confirmed that any decision on funding can only be made by Ministers, the University is not actively recruiting medical students as yet for  entry until that decision on funding can be reached.· If funding was confirmed, all other elements of the proposal for our medical undergraduate degree programme have been firmly on track including continued progress with the GMC, clinical placement opportunities and the development of a curriculum to meet the needs of healthcare locally.“We value the continued support of all those who share our vision for medical education and we continue to work with the General Medical Council, St George’s University of London and local clinicians and partners building on our existing leadership in medical and healthcare provision to take forward graduate entry medical education for Northern Ireland.\"What does UU say in response to local councillors representatives who have claimed that UU has neglected the Magee campus for decades and should not be given money as part of the City Deal but should instead invest its own money in Derry   A spokesperson for Ulster University commented: \"Ulster University continues to invest in the Magee campus, most recently with the state-of-the-art £m teaching block which signals our ambition for higher education in the city, already enhancing campus le and paving the way for enhanced future capacity at Magee.    This and other investment priorities for students have resulted in a very strong performance for the Magee campus across all elements of the  National Student Survey, reflecting the very positive reaction from our students to these recent investments in University le at Magee.  With all four faculties of the University represented on the Magee campus – across health sciences, arts and humanities, business and computing and engineering, we are pushing boundaries and breaking new ground in emerging sectors as a progressive university, shortlisted for the prestigious Times Higher Education University of the Year Award, .“Our contribution to the City Deal opportunity is a signicant step forward in our collective opportunity to realise the full ambitions of this vibrant university city.  Our City Deals proposal will see us apply our expertise to help maximize the city’s potential in this unparalleled opportunity to boost economic growth and prosperity.  In our continued collaboration with industry partners, we look forward to driving innovation in personalised medicine, cognitive analytics, robotics and automation, leading to both new research posts and learning opportunities for additional students.  The proposed riverfront innovation hub will build upon the expertise of our first data analytics Institute, opened in  and headquartered at Magee campus, and which cemented our reputation as a global leader in this field. Also integral to the City Deal remains our commitment to establishing a Graduate Entry Medical School in a bid to address the challenges of a healthcare system at breaking point.   City Deal recognises the crucial role our University can play as an economic engine in the North West and is a major boost to the collective ambitions of the city and region.  We look forward to the development of our projects in partnership with industry, civic and educational partners.\"How much money will be needed in total to fund the projects put forward as part of the City Deal A spokesperson for Ulster University commented: \"The funding contributions by project across City Deal and the Inclusive Futures Funds are indicative at this stage, based on the allocations provided by Council, and subject to adjustment as we go forward.  Our contribution of % University funding to the Magee projects within City Deal reflects our belief in the impact they will make, and our commitment to playing our part in the collective ambitions of City Deal.“City Deal enables us to build further on our academic strengths that are signicant for the region’s growth, and to make sure that this expertise across world class research and progressive student learning works hard for the benefit of all in the city region. The City Deal bid has education, innovation, job creation and skills development at its core and each of these priorities are also central to our work across both teaching and research.  We are therefore a natural fit and a committed partner in this ambitious bid.  A continued collaborative approach is essential as we prepare to take forward the projects through planning and design and development of the business cases.”"},{"url":null,"title":"montgomery couple aiming high

Shea Croskery raced through moments later and drove for goal, but saw his effort go wide and Dundrumrsquos relief was palpable.Instead of going eight points behind, Dundrum did well to re-group and points from Aidan Fegan and a second Venney free cut the deficit back to three points.Oran Flanagan sent over the next three points in the second quarter of the game with Glavin doing the same for Dundrum. Garland and Croskery also raised the white flag with their strikes to leave the lsquoFin with a half-time lead of - to -.Fegan got the first point of the second half for Dundrum with three minutes gone and a third free kick of the game was landed by Venney by the end of the third quarter.While the lsquoFin had not yet scored, it wasnrsquot for the want of trying as a few opportunities were missed and Dundrum lsquokeeper Eamon King pulled off a superb double save, the first from Croskery and the follow up from Chris Doran.Oran Flanagan was having a good game and he sent over his fourth point of the match and a superb effort from Shane McCann restored the lsquoFinrsquos four point half-time advantage with ten minutes remaining.Dundrum continued to threaten, but other than two more excellent points from their standout player Kyle Glavin, the lsquoFin defence held strong and kept the dangerous duo of Venney and Fegan scoreless the remainder of the game.Dundrum half forward Fegan was sent to the line after getting a second yellow in the final throes of the game.

The upgrading of the pitch is certainly sustainable financially, given the amount of usage it would get.ldquoWe have lost  teams to other leagues in the past few years and they have all cited poor facilities as their main reason for moving to play in the the Lisburn or South Belfast Leagues, he added.Mr Torney said it was essential that proper facilities were put in place to enable the league to avoid weekly postponements of games.ldquoWe are left every year with a fixture congestion because of postponements and in order to arrest the haemorrhaging of clubs from the league we must address this issue immediately.The league are being supported by South Down MP Chris Hazzard, who has called on Newry, Mourne and Down Council to ldquofinally deliver fit for purpose pitches for the local community in Downpatrick.He continued: ldquoThe current provision of sports pitches at Dunleath Park is nothing short of a disgrace.ldquoDunleath Park is used extensively by the Downpatrick Youth Football League with hundreds of young footballers playing each weekend, but yet againthis week, parts of the pitches have been closed to the public as raw sewage has come to the surface.ldquoIt is an absolute shame that in the shadow of our fantastic new leisure centre here in Downpatrick our local young people are expected to make do with substandard pitches that not only flood for most of the winter months, but are regularly polluted with raw sewage.Mr Hazzard believes that Downpatrick deserves much better treatment.ldquoAs the county town, Downpatrick deserves to have the very best in local sports provision, and that simply isnrsquot the case at the moment.ldquoIt is deeply disappointing that so many of our young footballers are left to travel to Lisburn and Belfast each weekend to play football. That must not be allowed to continue.Mr Hazzard added: ldquoWhilst there is no getting away from the fact that Dunleath Park is in a flood plain area, I would have sympathy with local sports clubs that feel that this is too easily put up as a hurdle to any investment, and that the council should actively consider a range of solutions in order to deliver suitable facilities.ldquoI want to thank those local sports clubs and Downpatrick Youth League representatives who continue to work tirelessly in order to provide local sporting opportunities for our young people and I will now be making representation to senior council management in order to make all their voices heard..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th September 2019 Castlewellan.jpg","title":"Castlewellan forest cycle in the park family event in aid of Knockevin Special School  ","story":"ALL roads lead to Castlewellan Forest Park this Sunday for a special event to raise money for Knockevin Special School in Downpatrick and celebrate the benefits of cycling for everyone.The lsquocycle in the parkrsquo event is being organised by the schoolrsquos Parent Staff Association to raise funds to help purchase new bikes for pupils to help them experience nature and the great outdoors.Sundayrsquos all ability event mdash which runs from am until pm ndash is being billed as a celebration of cycling and will have something for families and special needs adventurers, hard core mountain bikers, club riders, children and young people.The event is being hosted by the Kilmegan Velo Cycling Club with its chairman, Sean Warnock, inviting all cyclists to make their way to the forest park for the event.He said: ldquoThe aim is to get families and friends to experience cycling in a safe setting but full of adventure and we have events for all abilities.ldquoThere will be family trail quests, agility skills for kids, a full time-trial on the red trails, special needs bikes and a Sunday club fuel stop.

Title deeds, usually the easiest of documents to trace, have become impossible to track down.Three people are laying claim to the pier alone and a legal row is pending about whether a contract was broken over the sale of pier some time ago.Against this backcloth, Down council official have been trying to bring the harbour into public ownership since the publication of the Governmentrsquos cash-help promise in July . Before then they had already spent four years attempting to trace owners.This week councillors decided to end their six-year search and apply for vesting mdash a statutory power which enables a Government department to buy land compulsorily, despite the wishes of the owner.But they were warned by council administrative officer, Mr Owen OrsquoConnor, that it would be a dficult vesting order and he could not guarantee that the whole of the inner bay of Killough would be acquired before December.The last-ditch attempt to beat the deadline was sparked off by Downpatrick councillor, Mr John Ritchie, who has been trying to push the council into buying the harbour since . On Monday he was clearly angry that time was running out.POLITICS mdash A suggestion that South Down MP, Enoch Powell, should accompany a Down council deputation to Stormont was kicked out by SDLP councillors this week.The suggestion was surprisingly made by industry minister, Mr Giles Shaw, who has agreed to meet a council deputation to discuss industrial affairs in Down district.In a letter to councillors, Mr Shaw suggested that Mr Powell should be advised of the meeting and,convenient, should accompany the council delegation.SDLP councillor, Mr Eddie McGrady, described the ministerrsquos decision as ldquoodd and said he had never come across anything like it before in his  years in government affairs.He thought the minister was ldquousurping the councilrsquos decision to form its own deputation and he believed the motive behind the suggestion was not altogether altruistic.He told councillors: ldquoWhat is happening is that a new precedent is being proposed to us. A corporate body has almost been directed to include a political representative on its deputation.

Lea explained to Phil and Holly how she had been spurred on by Gareth’s kindness to carry on the good gesture: “I know it wasn’t absolutely the same circumstances, but I just thought I wanted to do a good gesture for somebody  so I paid off the same amount that he’d paid off our cake onto someone ’s. It carries on the story as well.”Gareth and his we Kirsty, who live between Loughbrickland and Rathfriland on the outskirts of Banbridge, were then introduced.Lea Ni Bhriain on This MorningTheir daughter Hannah Stella Bronte was born prematurely on September ,  weighing just two pounds, five and half ounces.

Our little boy Caleb, who is four, came up with the idea of letting a helium balloon go so that it would make its way up to heaven. That was something we had planned.“I’d said to Kirsty I wanted to do something dferent, maybe a little random act of kindness to share a little joy.

So, do I belong to the IRA  I did not, never have, am not, and have no intention.”.ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button However, based on his own words in a BBC Spotlight film to be broadcast tonight, those denials were lies.Ryan, who is almost , was the critical link between Libya and the IRA as Colonel Muammar Gaddafi happily supplied guns and explosives to republicans so that they could attack their common enemy, the British.Speaking in the third instalment of Spotlight’s seven-part series on the Troubles, Ryan is explicit about his own role in illegal activities.Spotlight did not state whether Ryan still lives in Ireland nor did it explain why he has now decided to self-incriminate himself as has done.During the interview with the BBC, Ryan praised the Libyan dictator who was killed in an uprising in . He said: “He was a fine fella. One of the best I ever met. We got on very well.”Ryan had been a Catholic missionary in east Africa but was back in Ireland working as a parish priest when the Troubles began at the end of the s.He said that he financially contributed “as much help as I could – some of it out of the mission boxes – to the situation up north” and then was “approached by some of the IRA leaders down here [to ask]perchance I could work for them permanently. They asked me to travel the world and try to get help for them.”Ryan eventually fell out with the church and left the Pallottine order in .That year he was instrumental in securing a five-tonne shipment of weaponry from Tripoli but it was intercepted before arriving in Ireland. He said that the original plan had been for a -tonne shipment but that at the last minute the load had been slashed by the Libyan authorities for reasons which were never explained to him.No Deal Brexit: As many , people in Republic of Ireland with U.K. driving licence could be driving illegally Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"It was Ryan who realised that a gadget used in continental Europe to remind drivers toto their cars before their parking tickets ran out could be used as timers in bombs.Hundreds of the Memopark timers were bought by the former priest on the continent and sent to the UK or Ireland for IRA use.The fragments of a Memopark timer was recovered from the rubble of the Brighton Hotel bombing which almost killed Margaret Thatcher in  and did kill five others, as well as injuring more than , some very seriously.In a declassied government document, Margaret Thatcher was shown to have described Ryan as “a very dangerous man” who had “an expert knowledge of bombing” and had been the key conduit between the IRA and Libya for over a decade.When Mrs Thatcher’s accusations were put to him and he was askedhe was involved in any of those incidents, he said: “I would say most of them one way or another, I had a hand in most of them. Yes, she was right.”Askedshe was right to link him to bombs such as Hyde Park and Brighton, he said: “Absolutely – %. Oh yes.”When askedhe had any regrets, he said: “Oh, I have, yes. Big regrets. Of what nature  I regret that I wasn’t even more effective. Oh yes absolutely. I’d like to have been even more effective than I actually was. But we didn’t do too badly, no.”l Spotlight on The Troubles: A Secret History will be broadcast tonight on BBC One Northern Ireland and also simultaneously on BBC Four at pm.try catch  TrendingN.I.

Greenfield who seconded the motion said this legislation is ‘a step too far’. “As demonstrated in recent times thousands of people share the view that Westminster should retract this drastic legislation at the earliest opportunity, given its serious ramications and the manner in which it has been brought..”SDLP Cllr Joe Nelson said it was an emotional debate as there are very strong views on both sides of the issue. “The SDLP remains a pro-le party but has in recent times allowed members to have a conscience vote. This is a move I did not support as I feel we have to be absolutely clear about our position. Speaking in support of the motion, after Sinn Fein had tried to get the debate stopped on a point of order, I gave my personal views as a practicing Catholic on the sanctity of le, We must consider that at around  weeks the child has a heartbeat and that modern D scans show that at   weeks the features have formed. “We agree that there is more support required for women who are suffering crisis pregnancies and more should be done. All members of the SDLP on ABC council voted in favour of the motion giving the clear signal that the SDLP group in ABC Council is very clearly Pro-Le.”Alliance Cllr Eoin Tennyson said the issue was ‘not black and white’. “Abortion is a conscience issue for Alliance. Personally, I would like to see decriminalisation, with access to free, safe and legal termination within strict gestational limits. I believe the best place for it to be considered is in the Assembly. However, the irony of the DUP’s motion is that they are one of the main stumbling blocks to that happening.”Sinn Fein declined to comment.Muckamore Abbey scandal: Gavin Robinson welcomes ‘personal

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We want to turn them into respectful iniduals with good values and an understanding of issues across the whole spectrum le has to offer.The school encourages pupils to voice their ideas, and shape their own education to a degree. They are asked what additions and activities they would like around the school, push for pupil engagement with a range of le experiences, and emphasis the development of their social skills to help them interact with others in dferent settings.The idea works well in practice. The students are friendly, confident, and respectful to the teachers. They smile, wave and say hello to the teachers in the corridors.ldquoThis is my eleventh year here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoI feel privileged to work in Fairfield. Itrsquos a school with a wonderful ethos and atmosphere, and skilled staff who know the children well, ensuring theyrsquore getting the best possible.ldquoThe children really exude enjoyment and enthusiasm for their learning.One classroom was filled with children learning their times-tables by singing and dancing, grins from ear to ear. In the schoolrsquos on-site nursery, youngsters concentrate on their basic arithmetic, rolling modelling clay into a single sunflower, or a pair of bananas.The nursery is the most recent addition to the school, having been opened in January of last year. Itrsquos the sort of place you can hear long before you see, as smiling toddlers enjoyed their break time.The nurseryrsquos addition to the school site would allow for an improved transition for pupils from nursery to reception.ldquoChildren benefit from being challenged with their learning at an earlier stage, explained Ms Lewis. ldquoWe want to make them feel safe and comfortable at the school, and make it as easy as possible to move up to reception.ldquoWe also give our older pupils a chance to experience both Stanwell and St Cyres secondaries around here to give them a smooth move into secondary education.Therersquos plenty on offer at the school, as well.Opportunities for extracurricular activities is vast, with local community groups using the hall throughout the week, for gym, dance fitness, karate, football and music tech.The introduction of a lsquoMid-week Muddle-Uprsquo allows pupils to work across age groups on half-termly projects, which use staff expertise in particular areas for a project that they collectively work on such as working on the environment in their own conservation area, or lsquoPizza Mathsrsquo combining elements of maths and fractions with cookery.Pupil groups cover School Council, Sports Council, Creative Committee, Sgwad Cymraeg, Eco-Committee, Team Captains, Digital Leaders, while other groups focus on global issues and the impact of their actions internationally.Jake Kidby, Ahmed Maher and Georgia Tomalin-Reeves are on the school council.Though each had a dferent focus for their enjoyment of the school site, they all agreed they were very happy at Fairfield.Jake said: ldquoI absolutely love my football and therersquos loads of chances to play that here. The new gym trail outside is great too.Ahmed said: ldquoI prefer maths and challenges. We thought school council would be a fun responsibility to look after the school, help people and share ideas.Georgia said: ldquo As part of school council we decided to build a lsquorelaxation stationrsquo for anyone who feels down. They can bring paper and pens and books. Itrsquos just a wooden den. But wersquore putting in shelves, posters. And therersquos lot of free space to run around front and back.The school has been lauded for its environmental efforts, securing a Bronze Welsh Charter Award last term, and earning a Platinum Flag for their approach to ecological and sustainability issues.Pupils Isaac Eley and Sophie Wilford were at the schoolrsquos conservation area.They explained to me that the area was first started around  years ago, but they had begun pushing for more lessons to be held outdoors.They hope to add tables, chairs and more outdoor classroom equipment, so they can take lessons in the open air.ldquoThe staff go above and beyond here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoWith increased pressure on funding for schools staff, governors and parents have to really put  per cent effort in.ldquoThe PTA has raised an incredible amount for us over the years and have done wonders for our IT departments.ldquoParents have helped out in raising money for the new gym trail.ldquoOne father built our relaxation station shed by himself, and the stage on the playground for singing and dancing was also built with parentrsquos help.ldquoThey ensure we can continue and we can be excellent for all the childrenrsquos learning.ldquoAttainment is high and all pupils make good progress specic to them, and this achievement is something of which we are extremely proud.Therersquos an underlying feeling of positivity in Fairfield, off the beaten path but quietly proud and it seems thoroughly well-earned. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yet, too many people across the UK ndash and here in Wales ndash are going hungry.It is shameful that in the sixth richest country on the planet people are struggling to put food on the table.A recent report by the South Wales Food Alliance has shown that  per cent of  to -year-olds ran out of food in the past year and , children in Wales are living in households for whom a healthy diet is increasingly unaffordable.In addition, the Trussell Trust has reported record numbers of people accessing its services. Last year, it provided over , emergency food parcels to people in crisis in Wales, , of them to children. A No Deal Brexit will be catastrophic for the countryrsquos most vulnerable households and would be an act of economic self-harm impacting many generations to come. This is why I am supporting the campaign for Food Justice.There can be no doubt that the causes of rising hunger are rooted in a decade of austerity, tax and welfare changes, and an economy that no longer provides a fair dayrsquos pay for a fair days work for too many.The food crisis that the UK is living through is likely to be signicantly worsenedwe leave the EU without a deal. The recently published government documents on Operation Yellow Hammer predict shortages of some fresh foods and an increase in the price of food by up to  per cent, as a likely scenario.The papers make for grim reading for the many hard pressed families who are already struggling to put food on the table.In Wales we are committed to eradicating food poverty but we need UK-wide action.The Co-operative campaign is calling on the UK Government to commit to zero-hunger by  and incorporate it into UK law.While many of the solutions to food poverty are the responsibility of the UK Government there is local action that we can take that can make a real dference.The campaign is encouraging councils across Wales to commit to playing their part by designating a lead member for food poverty, to draw up a food action plan, and to take inspiration from emerging community responses to food poverty.The good news is that there is a huge amount of work already going on in our communities by councils, churches, charities and food banks.For more information or to get involved in the campaign please visit www.party.coop campaign food-justice article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We have a long waiting list.ldquoWe have to make sure these are properties we have finance for and they are up to our standards as well. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This rushed legislation was nailed on to a wider piece of legislation at Westminster and was passed despite the opposition of my DUP MP colleagues and with no form of public consultation whatsoever.“Our motion called for a meaningful letter to be sent on behalf of our Borough to reflect the very genuine and signicant concerns that exist around this issue.” Cllr. Greenfield who seconded the motion said this legislation is ‘a step too far’. “As demonstrated in recent times thousands of people share the view that Westminster should retract this drastic legislation at the earliest opportunity, given its serious ramications and the manner in which it has been brought..”SDLP Cllr Joe Nelson said it was an emotional debate as there are very strong views on both sides of the issue. “The SDLP remains a pro-le party but has in recent times allowed members to have a conscience vote. This is a move I did not support as I feel we have to be absolutely clear about our position. Speaking in support of the motion, after Sinn Fein had tried to get the debate stopped on a point of order, I gave my personal views as a practicing Catholic on the sanctity of le, We must consider that at around  weeks the child has a heartbeat and that modern D scans show that at   weeks the features have formed. “We agree that there is more support required for women who are suffering crisis pregnancies and more should be done. All members of the SDLP on ABC council voted in favour of the motion giving the clear signal that the SDLP group in ABC Council is very clearly Pro-Le.”Alliance Cllr Eoin Tennyson said the issue was ‘not black and white’. “Abortion is a conscience issue for Alliance. Personally, I would like to see decriminalisation, with access to free, safe and legal termination within strict gestational limits. I believe the best place for it to be considered is in the Assembly. However, the irony of the DUP’s motion is that they are one of the main stumbling blocks to that happening.”Sinn Fein declined to comment. and Liam Shannon pictured outside Belfast court with some of their legal team.

A signicant number of our employees at Hays have been with us for , ,  and even  years, and we pride ourselves on growing our own talent and promoting from within. Although there are times when employees leave due to circumstances employers can’t control, organisations can create the right conditions to retain their staff for as long as possible. We believe there are three key areas. A sense of purpose Across ages, cultures and sectors, professionals need to get up in the morning knowing that they can make a dference. No matter how big or small, recognising a clear and meaningful purpose in your role is a huge driver for staff. Communication is key for employers. By prioritising employee progression, offering regular feedback and communicating the wider objectives of the business, employers can ensure their staff come to work each day with a strong purpose. Variety each day While not every task can be exciting, and some parts of a job will inevitably be more stimulating than others,the mundane becomes the usual, employees will think about moving on. Injecting iety into each week and staying interested at work partly falls on employees themselves, who can proactively seize opportunities. But a good employer should also push their staff and encourage them to work outside of their comfort zones. This ensures professionals can keep growing and developing within an organisation rather than move where. A strong network The people we work with have a huge bearing on our happiness levels at work. You simply can’t stay in a role long-termyou don’t enjoy working with those around you, so the importance and impact of these relationships are not to be underrated. Employers can help their staff develop a network of inspiring and admirable colleagues from their first day by making sure they receive proper introductions and support contacts. Workers who have these strong bonds feel a greater sense of belonging which keeps them wanting to work in their organisation. With these three points in mind, it’s important to consider how someone’s organisation and role makes them feel, rather than just how impactful their salary or bonus might be. After all, this is what can’t easily be replicated across organisations and can keep an employee with an organisation throughout their career.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/catherine_1.jpg","title":"word from the wise kathryn collie","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by Ulster Business How did you start out in your business  I followed the fairly well trodden path of completing my legal practice course at the University of Law in Guildford, having graduated with a degree in law from university in England. Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/da1.jpg","title":"clarity telecom building telecoms from the ground up","story":"Posted on Monday September  by Ulster Business Clarity Telecom helps businesses of all shapes and sizes develop their communications needs from the ground up, and is now rolling out its fast-growing cloud software across the UK and Ireland. Founder and managing director David Whelan speaks to Ulster Business about a business which boasts the right tools for the job David Whelan’s vision and mantra for what is now one of the leading telecoms businesses is clear – telecommunications services are only as good as the foundations on which they are built, with engineering front and centre. He’s the entrepreneur behind Clarity Telecom – a successful Belfast-based full-service telecommunications solutions company with almost  years under its belt, helping develop top-end connectivity – including lines, calls, mobile, broadband and cloud software – for businesses across Ireland and the UK. And for David, telecoms is all about engineering at the core of finding the best comprehensive solution to its customers, having the right tools for the job, and having world class people. For Clarity Telecom, it’s about developing a bespoke system for companies, focusing on engineering from day one. Since its inception in , Clarity Telecom has grown to have a greater engineering capability than any other independent telecommunications company in Northern Ireland, and is now rolling out its leading byphone VoIPsystem throughout the UK and Ireland. David also says through Clarity Telecom and its burgeoning byphone technology, the company could double revenues in the next three years as well as growing its workforce. “The phone network stops at a plug in the wall and from that point on, you have to provide the infrastructure and management,” David says. “What we do is focus on the engineering. It’s all about how well it works and adapts to your business. “By focusing on that we are looking at the way things are being built, and we can then get insights on how we can change and improve things.” Led by engineering, the Clarity team is driving change within the telecoms industry ensuring client infrastructure is fit for purpose and for the future. That starts with assessing a business’s needs, making sure the network is suitable, reviewing the workforce needs and bandwidth requirements. From there, Clarity Telecom can develop a bespoke solution – from cabling, to switching, cloud services, routing and phone systems. Clarity Telecom now has a team of  staff – a third of whom work directly within the engineering side of the business. But that number could grow further still, as the company expands its business across Northern Ireland, and develops its byphone technology. The company developed its subsidiary, Voxbit, in  – specically to design engineering solutions. And through that has come one of its most successful products, byphone. A simple to use VoIP , byphone is a drag and drop system that allows users to configure their own phone set up suited to the exact needs of the organisation and enables a range of analysis tools that can help business owners drive up efficiencies. “In  as VoIP started coming along, I realised that was a signicant opportunity,” David says. “Where the communications industry is going is into the cloud. It’s going from traditional storage within buildings, into something in the cloud. The traditional telephone systems are evolving. “We started making a series of innovations surrounding cloud technology. We realised you can make it simpler – we were asking ourselves, can you make it work without a manual, for example. “If you can, in the same way as Apple’s iPhone made things easier for users, people will start using the services. It’s about making everyone’s le easier. “The end user wants to be able to use the system easily, from managing their telephone number, to having access to voicemail. It’s about the ‘power of simple’. “We now have around  resellers for the byphone system in the UK, and we are looking at trebling or quadrupling those sales,” he said. One of Clarity Telecom’s customers is Mid  East Antrim Borough Council. The firm was tasked with bringing together the complex communication needs of the new ‘super council’ following the amalgamation in . “With bringing three councils together, one of the main problems was having a single phone number that people could call. If you have numerous sites, spread across three council areas, that would involve a lot of rip and replace,” David says. “But we gave them one telephone number and then managed the routing to all those bits of equipment across the council areas.” Hotel giant Andras House – which operates seven hotels and , rooms in Belfast including the Crowne Plaza at Shaw’s Bridge and the new Hampton Hilton – is also another major customer. “Businesses trust us to be able to provide the engineering solutions in order for them to run their companies,” David says. So, why should a business consider Clarity Telecom for its crucial and comprehensive connectivity needs  David says Clarity is all about improving how companies interact with their customers – making it easier, and thus, improving revenue and sales. “As you manage your telephone connections you become better at dealing with your customers – you become more efficient at dealing with them, and they will have a better experience. It’s about improving customer contact. “As a business you are able to do a lot more, such as listening to call recordings, access to statistics and using data which will help manage that contact, as well as saving on costs and making your business more efficient. “What solution depends on your business. That is where we come along. We never put a system in without doing a full engineering visit.” Some of the connectivity includes the ability to connect landline with mobile phones, call forwarding and being able to access voicemails as digital recordings, by phone or computer. “When companies deal with us, they can come along and say ‘this is what we are trying to do’, and we are able to work the engineering and infrastructure, before then providing the services,” David says. “It’s also about fighting against the view that it’s all about price. Yes, you have to be competitive, but you need the right infrastructure. For example,a shop loses connectivity for two days, then they lose two days of sales, simply because they don’t have the back-up for the credit card payment system. “It’s about getting businesses to think about the infrastructure and all of the issues. It’s not just about how cheap you can make a call. It’s about how customers can engage with your business – and we are at the heart of making that happen.” For further information, contact Clarity Telecom on    or visit www.clarityteleView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/glyn_121.jpg","title":"ni business leaders to outline major job creation plan at downing street and westminster","story":"Posted on Tuesday  September  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland industry leaders will outline their plans to create tens of thousands of new jobs to Downing Street, hundreds of MPs and company leaders today as part of a major business delegation visiting London. Trade NI – the new alliance between Hospitality Ulster, Manufacturing NI and Retail NI – is unveiling a -year plan called ‘Vision ’ at a Westminster reception on Wednesday afternoon, as the UK’s political system enters its most volatile period in a generation.

Business leaders are also due to attend a later event at Downing Street, and a lunch at the Irish Embassy. Trade NI’s “transformative economic plan” will set out key policy priorities that have the potential to create , jobs and to make Northern Ireland a high growth economy. In a joint statement, Trade NIs Colin Neill , Stephen Kellyand Glyn Roberts , said: “Northern Ireland is facing a huge challenge as it struggles politically and economically with a growth forecast of around % or below. This is simply not good enough and we can’t sit idly by and let events overtake us. We must break the cycle of limited economic growth.” “Our three organisations represent most of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland. Therefore, a louder voice needs to be heard on their behalf so that they don’t suffer in the wake of the local political issues. We want a reboot of the economic policy of Northern Ireland, in order to benefit our economy and safeguard our growing business community.” “We need to be bold and ambitious about creating % or even % growth over the next few years, but that requires decision makers to be pressed into action and a series of policy and legislative decisions to be taken and driven through. Our local economy and businesses have taken a back seat and we simply cannot afford that situation any longer.” “Our Vision  document sets out a bold new ten-year plan for creating , new jobs and creating a high growth economy. We want to make Northern Ireland the best place in the UK and Ireland to shop, socialise, locate and start a business “The Vision  plan sets out to create a better ing business environment and attract further inward investment that will lead to a revitalised economy taking on the challenge in turbulent times.” “We want to make Northern Ireland an eco-system of innovation.Trade NI is keen to work with all business organisations, chambers of commerce, trade unions and voluntary sector representation to create a new progressive partnership for change in Northern Ireland.” And Kevin Kingston, chief executive of Danske Bank, sponsor of Trade NI’s Westminster reception, said: Danske Bank is proud to be one of the main sponsors of Trade NI’s Westminster reception. Trade NI is seizing the initiative and ensuring that the voice of the local business community is being heard loud and clear at a time of upheaval and uncertainty.” “The vibrancy of the Northern Ireland private sector is imperative to the strength of our economy and we need to ensure that local businesses are protected and well positioned to be able to compete globally in the post-Brexit environment.” Emma Gilthorpe, executive director, Heathrow Expansion, said: “Heathrow is delighted to support the launch of Trade NI, echoing Heathrow’s commitment to connect Northern Ireland to global growth and to share the benefits of an expanded Heathrow with the businesses and communities of Northern Ireland.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/con1.jpg","title":"us cyber security firm creating  jobs in belfast","story":"Posted on Tuesday  September  by John Mulgrew Alastair Hamilton and Alan Naumann A US cyber-security firm is creating  jobs with a new base in Belfast.
