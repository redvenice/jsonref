Wilder was due to attend a press conference on Friday to preview Sunday’s league fixture at Leicester but the club postponed that until the late afternoon before cancelling it “due to circumstances beyond our control” just before 5pm. An announcement about Wilder’s future is expected to follow.It is understood that Paul Heckingbottom, the club’s under-23s manager, will take charge of the side against Leicester. However, no decision has been reached about a potential long-term replacement for Wilder.The Blades are marooned at the foot of the Premier League table with just 14 points from 28 matches and would have to stage the most extraordinary revival in top-flight history in their 10 remaining matches to escape relegation to the Championship.Although Friday’s events were unplanned, they did not come as a shock. Relations between Wilder and the club’s board have been strained recently even though the owner, Abdullah bin Musa’ad bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, declared publicly last month that Wilder would be retained as manager even if the club did not win another match this season because he would be the best person to lead the club to promotion again. That statement disguised tensions that had emerged between the pair, especially over transfer strategy. The manager suggested last week that he did not know whether he would still be in the post by next season.United’s struggles this season are in stark contrast to the success Wilder inspired for most of his reign. He was hired in May 2016 after guiding Northampton Town to the League One title and won the league again in his first season in charge of United, the club he has supported since childhood and for whom he made over 100 appearances during two stints as a player. It took him just two seasons to lead United out of the Championship and then, last season, his team took the Premier League by storm, defying predictions of instant relegation by soaring up the table with an energetic and tactically innovative style. After flirting with European qualification, they finished in ninth place.The club spent around £50m in an effort to build on that achievement, including a record fee for Rhian Brewster, but most of the recruits have failed to excel and that fact, combined with injuries to key players, contributed to a dreadful start to the campaign from which United have never recovered. Wilder expected to be given funds in January to repair his squad and mount a fight for Premier League survival, but they did not materialise."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f00f9ac03dbf64a2390baa6cbe4edcd7e95cfe43/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=4ac679692904de6e3b64e3f577dce736","title":"quick sweet and life affirming the perfect virtual birthday party","story":"I am using the lessons I’ve learned from a year of remote socialising to organise a celebration I actually wantIt’s my birthday next week and I am virtual-party planning: a culmination of so many life lessons that squeezing them all into this column may be tight.

For years I’d have my birthday celebration at venues close to where friends lived to save them the commute (and guarantee attendance).

A tiny germ of controversy or rebellion can spread across parliament, through Whitehall and into the prime minister’s office within hours. The windowless offices are cramped, MPs sit elbow to elbow in a Commons chamber that can only squeeze just over 400 MPs into its seats, two-thirds of the number in parliament.It is also a place of macho presenteeism, where the Greggs in Westminster tube station often serves as a nightly dinner spot for some of the most senior office-holders in the land.This was the situation when Covid-19 arrived in the UK.  has spoken to a number of people who were there at the time. They revealed that the virus spread far more widely than has been reported, and spoke about the sense of panic across Whitehall as Covid threatened to paralyse government.Horrified staff and ministers, dealing with the worst crisis in decades, had to reckon with how the country could be run when everyone in charge was getting ill.Famously, Boris Johnson, Matt Hancock and Dominic Cummings contracted the virus. So did England’s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, and the then cabinet secretary, Mark Sedwill. Ministers and their staff had it. Almost all the staff in Downing Street, too.It spread to special advisers across Whitehall and to parliamentary lobby journalists. Although the Palace of Westminster escaped any mass outbreaks among staff, several MPs caught Covid. Many in the office of the Labour leader, including Seumas Milne, had it. Jeremy Corbyn may have had it, although he was never tested and so has never been sure.But the situation was at its worst at the heart of Downing Street. For a number of days aides looked almost entirely to the then director of communications, Lee Cain, for direction.“No 10 was a plague pit,” one adviser recalls. “No one outside the postcode quite knows how bad it got in there.”Another said: “Lee was running the country, genuinely, for quite some time.”According to many of those present, almost the entire staff team in Downing Street caught Covid-19 at some point during those weeks, with James Slack, the prime minister’s spokesperson, a notable exception.“You’d got to a meeting expecting to see someone important and they were gone – and you knew why,” another adviser said. “It started off more surreal than scary, but it became very scary once the PM was so ill.”There are fewer workplaces less suited to social distancing than Westminster. High security means much business is conducted in person. MPs vote in packed and sweaty corridors. Staffers share desks. Most windows can only be heaved open a crack with brute force.Downing Street is far from opulent when compared with the palaces of most heads of state. Staff use small entrances and corridors with flaking paint and decorated only with laminated health and safety notices. In the weeks leading up to lockdown, staff acknowledge there was no social distancing to speak of, only jokes about how to most respectfully sing God Save the Queen while hand-washing.Staffers working in political and civil service roles during that time, who spoke on condition of anonymity as some are still in post, admit the pandemic took time to appear on the radar of a government preoccupied with a great election victory, Brexit and, closer to home, a purge of special advisers under Cummings’ iron fist.There were concerns, but there was also a lightheartedness. One aide held a birthday party for fellow Tories and served Corona beer. Johnson was sufficiently unconcerned to miss five Cobra meetings in January and February. It seems clear the UK was deeply unprepared for the pandemic – from out-of-date PPE to delayed preparedness training – while contingency planning was erted to a no-deal Brexit.Lindsay Hoyle, the newly elected Speaker of the House of Commons, said the whole of government did not see until quite late the extent to which Covid-19 would radically alter everyone’s lives.One of the few people still working in a high-profile job in Westminster who had experience of tackling a pandemic was the shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth.“I was actually in Downing Street for swine flu 10 years ago,” the Labour MP said. “I remember when I first heard of the virus in Wuhan I thought: I wonder if that’s going to be like swine flu. But I obviously didn’t appreciate at that point it would be off the scale.”Ashworth asked for his first briefing with Whitty in January 2020. By February he was doing “nothing else” but studying the trajectory of the virus, he said. But it was when the health minister Nadine Dorries was confirmed to have Covid on 10 March that the magnitude of the crisis fully dawned on some of those in government. “The moment we realised this is probably more widespread in the country than we thought is when Nadine Dorries tested positive,” one health official said.At the time, people were only meant to get tested if they had been to one of the affected areas. “So the original assumption was, she hasn’t been to Italy or China so she hasn’t got Covid, even if she’s got some symptoms. And then she tested positive and I remember thinking: hang on, is this thing spreading much more widely than the people realise?”On 11 March, the day after Dorries tested positive, Liverpool played Atlético Madrid in front of a crowd of tens of thousands at Anfield. It was also the day of Rishi Sunak’s first budget. Many of those at the heart of the story who caught the virus admit they were slow to realise how fast it was spreading. One special adviser recalled starting to experience symptoms in the middle of a meeting with a national newspaper’s political editor.“Everyone was getting ill, it was quite striking how obvious it was,” one senior Labour official said.“It felt like a cold,” said another senior party official. “And you wouldn’t normally go home because you had a slight cough. But then I was eating something and it tasted like metal. And the inside of my nose felt weird. And that’s when I realised.”One political journalist who started feeling ill described being gripped by horror later in the afternoon when they remembered that the MP they had met earlier for coffee had breezily announced she was off to a meeting with her entire parliamentary party – and wondered how many they might have unwittingly infected.“It was so different because it directly affected everyone, I got so many calls from journalists or MPs asking for personal advice, what happens if I’ve had dinner here or I’ve met this person, or if I’ve been to see my 80-year-old mother,” one health official said.On 16 March, Johnson convened a meeting with Corbyn, Ashworth and staffers including Cummings and Milne, as well as Whitty, in Downing Street. It was intended to shore up Labour support for the coronavirus bill, introduced three days later. “Everyone was crowded around one desk,” one observer said. “It was insane if you think about it.”The Labour group argued forcefully for more economic intervention, given the spontaneous lockdown many people in the country were already beginning to observe. Two sources in the room said Johnson agreed with Corbyn and Ashworth that some form of full national lockdown would be inevitable. The meeting was cordial Milne and Johnson even shared a joke about their time as journalists.The meeting’s significance might have been passed over had it not been for what followed. Milne told friends he came down with a temperature that night – and was subsequently featured on the front page of the Mail on Sunday as the man who might have given the virus to the prime minister. Sources close to Corbyn said the then Labour leader also had some cold-like symptoms. Ashworth, who was also in the room, did not catch it.No one can say for sure who spread Covid to whom, because the virus was already rampant in Westminster.That evening Johnson advised people to avoid all unnecessary contact and travel and to stay away from pubs and theatresOn Wednesday 18 March, PMQs was quieter than usual but MPs still dribbled into the chamber. Sunak and Hancock, the health secretary, sat close to Johnson on the frontbench. Corbyn, despite being over 70, attended in person, with his spokesperson saying the government advice on shielding was still not clear.On the Friday evening, Johnson said pubs and restaurants should close and Sunak announced a furlough scheme. On Monday 23 March, in a ministerial broadcast from Downing Street, Johnson ordered the entire nation to stay at home.The first indication that officials outside Downing Street had that something was wrong with Johnson was a quiet inquiry by a No 10 special adviser to speak with Whitty on Wednesday. The chief medical officer advised the prime minister to get a test, which came back positive.Hancock began experiencing symptoms on 26 March, and rang his staff to say he had a temperature and was getting tested, prompting panic in the department about how to handle the media frenzy they anticipated should they have to announce the health secretary was ill with coronavirus. But within hours the prime minister tested positive, and that was the story.Johnson’s office realised in horror that one key person he might have infected was Hoyle, who has type 1 diabetes.“I got a phone call immediately. They were very worried about me, because the footage on the television was Boris six inches away speaking to me. And Hancock had also done the same in the same week,” Hoyle said. “I was very lucky, I didn’t get infected, but nobody could have got closer to either of them. I don’t believe it was caught in the house. Far from it. My worry was about them bringing it into the house.”Many of those staffers who fell ill like dominoes over the coming days tried to keep working. Hancock was isolating when he got a positive test but carried on issuing directions from home. “If anything he was almost more manic,” one official said.Another senior party insider said they and many others just worked through the virus, taking short naps in between calls. “Even though I was ill, I’d worked every day from home for a week and I just used to get very tired in the afternoon and go to bed for two hours. And then I kept on working.”“So much was happening by video and you could not always tell if people were at home because they were ill,” one aide said, describing it as “like playing wink murder” to spot who was trying to struggle through, or who was missing.Whitty was forced into self-isolation by Johnson’s diagnosis, as were many other staffers. Cummings, Johnson’s all-seeing chief of staff, departed London for Durham with his young family, his wife already sick and knowing he was likely to develop the illness.In the week after Johnson was diagnosed, it was not taken too seriously by staff, or the prime minister himself. He worked in isolation in Downing Street and would thump himself on the chest and say “strong as a bull!” and aides would laugh.But it was quietly becoming evident it was taking him a long time to shake off the virus.After making his daily joke, he would cough. Then cough for longer. Johnson was working in a small office connected by a stairwell to his No 11 flat next to another used by his private secretary and senior aides, who would toss paperwork and media scripts through the open door. Johnson chaired cabinet on 28 March by video link, “coughing and spluttering his way through conference calls”, according to sources, which leaked into newspapers. Public questions were starting to be asked about the prime minister’s condition.On Friday 3 April it was clear that Johnson’s symptoms were lingering and aides took a video in which an unkempt and clearly struggling prime minister said he “still has one of the symptoms, a minor symptom, I still have a temperature”.The video was recorded on Johnson’s phone and took multiple different takes to record because he was coughing so much. Aides had to keep politely finding different ways to say: “I’m not sure we’ve quite nailed that there, boss.”Even then, Johnson was joking about trying to look well on camera and “uplift the nation”. Many felt at the time – and more now do in hindsight – that more should have been done that week to persuade him to rest.Advisers were getting worried. Discreet preparations were being made that week for Johnson’s admission to St Thomas’ hospital, should it be necessary.  got wind of this but it was denied by officials.By Sunday, it was necessary. Johnson phoned his senior staff before he left for hospital confirming Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, should take charge in his absence. Cummings was also out of the picture, ill in Durham.“It wasn’t actually scary – personally scary – until the PM almost died,” one senior official said. “From that moment you go from it being just a manic effort to get everything done to the consequences of it all hitting you so hard.”There was still a persistent attempt, outwardly, to pretend Johnson remained in charge. At the daily press briefing on Monday 6 April, Raab kept repeating that the prime minister was in “good spirits”. In fact, neither was true.That night Johnson was moved to ICU. He had told the nation he hoped to turn the tide in 12 weeks and that restrictions would be reviewed in three weeks. In that third week, he was in intensive care.The symbolism was not lost on many working closely with him. Johnson’s private secretary, Martin Reynolds, phoned Downing Street and said there was a “5050” chance the prime minister would be put on a ventilator. If this had happened, his chances of survival would have plummeted. Sedwill was in charge of drawing up a plan for succession if Johnson died – approved by the prime minister himself.No 10 at that point was like “a ghost ship”, as one aide put it. Cummings was in Durham, Cain was on his last day of self-isolation.“Lee came in like a bullet the next day,” one colleague recalls. “There was a meeting he turned up to with Raab, Sedwill and other civil servants and he was like: ‘Hello, I’m back, I’m in charge of the politics now.’”The political staff in No 10, particularly those with a background in Conservative internecine politics, were also starting to think about the nightmare scenario of the death of the prime minister. “You knew the party would have forced some awful leadership election, it would have been carnage,” one said. “It was about confronting the utter horror of that – in a pandemic – and feeling pretty overwhelmed with emotion, too.”Representing one of the flaws of the British political system, Downing Street resembles the court of a medieval king. What matters is the prime minister, and who matters are those who have the ear of the prime minister. Advisers fall in and out of favour and only a few are known to be directly speaking for the prime minister – those who can therefore be taken seriously. When the prime minister is suddenly absent, the system no longer works.“There’s a gap, like physically, in the building, and there was a bit of a gap politically,” one former adviser said.“The two main characters – Johnson and Cummings – were absent,” one No 10 insider said.“When the court doesn’t have a king, it’s just a massive vacuum,” another former staffer said. “The only reason senior people had authority is because they spoke with his voice. So when you remove him, it becomes very, very difficult to keep that authority.”“Boris in particular, his presence is really felt, he takes up space,” another ex-staffer said. “And the other person who had that presence was Dom. And he was gone as well.”“That week was hell,” another official said. “There were all these meetings where it was never completely clear who was driving things or in charge. Who was actually going to be there if you had a meeting?”Those who recovered were desperate to get back into work. “I remember saying I have to be there, I’m going mad at home,” a Whitehall source said. At the time, civil servants were ordered to work from home but many in No 10 wanted to be in the building. Cain told them they could come in if they wanted and he would take the flak.“Lee did end up running the country for about two weeks, I’d say,” one adviser said. “There was no one else any sort of senior level who had any sort of authority on behalf of the PM to be doing stuff or making decisions.”Ministers’ aides were buddied up and told to get to grips with a different department so they could shadow each other if another fell sick.Cain had been at the prime minister’s side for years, through his time at Vote Leave, to the Foreign Office, to his time on the backbenches and through his leadership campaign. Even more than Cummings, Cain was seen by people in Whitehall as speaking with his boss’s voice. “It was a bit like a very long marriage,” one close friend said.Raab, the “designated survivor”, as he was nicknamed, took charge of the day-to-day business as part of a quad of ministers with Sunak, Hancock and Michael Gove. Hancock was often the target in those meetings as the government struggled with PPE shortages, deep concerns over ventilator capacity and what many felt were wildly optimistic promises by the health secretary on testing.Raab felt his role was to be a stabilising force, one aide said. “He was a good manager, he didn’t push his own agenda. It was just a holding position. But he didn’t step up in the way Rishi stepped up. You’d hardly say it was a moment for Dom Raab.”Others described Raab’s understated attitude to the role as a strength. “He had a lot of big jostling egos to manage in the cabinet and he managed it,” an aide said.A senior Downing Street source said it was like “chalk and cheese” working with Raab versus working with Johnson. The prime minister would hand out jobs from his red box, happy to delegate – “a bit more loosey-goosey” as one insider put it. Raab was extremely strict with protocol and insisted everything went through Cain.In the prime minister’s absence, battle lines were also starting to be drawn between those who believed opening the economy was imperative and those who believed a long lockdown was necessary.Cummings spent much of his isolation reading about the Spanish flu pandemic and told advisers after he returned that he had been convinced of the need for tougher measures and slower reopenings. There was some political calculation at play as well: Cain and the Tory adviser Isaac Levido believed the party would be annihilated at the next election if there was a catastrophic death toll, whereas voters would be more forgiving of economic turmoil.Among those in favour of “running in hot”, which one characterised as “trying to allow desperate business owners to salvage their livelihoods”, were Sunak and the prime minister’s chief of staff, Edward Lister, who was shielding at home for much of the period. Newspapers were constantly briefed about the rows between “doves and hawks”.Gove was someone who “jumped from one camp to the other”, one adviser said, though in latter months he has been a more predictable voice of caution, alongside Hancock. In those early weeks, it was drily observed in Whitehall that Gove always seemed to be characterised as a hawk, whatever his position.No 10 and Whitehall were beset by leaks during that period, on the very biggest issues. “It’s fucking Zoom,” a special adviser said. “You’d log on to a sensitive meeting and you think it’s going to be five key people and then you’re like, hang on, why are there 80 people here and who the hell are they? We may as well broadcast this thing live to the world.”The daily 9.15am call between Raab, Sunak, Gove and Hancock would constantly leak. “Rish just got to the point where he wouldn’t even say anything in the meeting,” one insider said.With Johnson temporarily out of the picture, political aides suggested there were some attempts by ministers or civil servants to quietly discard unpopular issues. An adviser recalls a suggestion that a legal signoff connected with HS2 was needed – and that it be delayed until the prime minister’s return. “One of the first things the PM said when he got back was: ‘I can’t believe they tried to delay HS2 while I was in the ICU.’”“People really pushed their luck during that time – cabinet ministers, civil servants,” a senior aide said. “People delivered statements for approval by No 10 just 10 minutes before they were supposed to deliver them at the press conference and we had to be like: hang the fuck on!”All the actions of staff during that period are likely to be the subject of a public inquiry – perhaps the most important undertaking in living memory. Many believe the mistakes that were made were not a direct result of the way the virus ripped through the heart of Westminster and hobbled the operations of the government, but predictable consequences of a decade of deliberate policy.“I wasn’t in government. So I don’t know the extent that people being off ill hindered the decision-making on a day-to-day basis,” Ashworth said. “But the reason our response has been so disappointing and why we’ve been so exposed is because of decisions made over many years. The absolute scandal about the way in which we allowed the virus to rip through social care, not giving their staff sick pay, which meant that staff had to go to work.“We’ve built an economy which is characterised by zero-hours contracts, temporary work. These are all a reflection of the type of economy that the Tories have built over the last 10 years.”Johnson returned to Downing Street on 12 April to a team that felt “overwhelmed with relief”, according to one staffer. He went to recuperate with his pregnant fiancee, Carrie Symonds, who was also recovering from the virus.But any reprieve would be very short-lived. The day he returned was the same day Cummings set out for his drive to Barnard Castle."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c09077b7c73bfde37904b06882a8aa35f4b98b8d/0_56_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=394c74c590d5fe2dfefe85e50dd341f4","title":"suspicion stalked sky but british public swallowed marginal gains story whole richard freeman cycling","story":"Dave Brailsford’s team promised to win clean but the Richard Freeman verdict raises questions about their methodsFew of those in European cycling’s professional milieu, long schooled in batting away doping suspicions, will be shocked by the findings of the Richard Freeman medical tribunal. Cycling, after all, has a long history of “dodgy doctors”, the most renowned of all being Michele Ferrari, Lance Armstrong’s infamous performance guru.In a sport long shadowed by scandal, the wondrous achievements of Team Sky under the management of Dave Brailsford were always viewed sceptically. But this is also a story of subterfuge, failed vetting procedures and manipulation of facts, even before a government select committee.In Britain, a nation and media largely naive to the inner workings of the professional peloton and dazzled by the slew of successes in both track and road racing, swallowed the story of marginal gains and magical pillows, whole. Now the scepticism that was always bubbling under the surface in Europe towards the explosion of British success appears even more well-founded.The Freeman verdict, that the former Team Sky and British Cycling doctor was guilty of ordering testosterone “knowing or believing” it was to be given to a rider to improve their athletic performance, is damning and has led to UK Anti-Doping bringing further charges of doping infractions against him.Brailsford has not yet responded to the ’s requests for comment. Throughout their sponsorship, however, Team Sky always stuck to the line used at their team launch: “We follow the rules and we ride clean.”After the Freeman verdict was announced, Ineos Grenadiers, the current incarnation of that team, issued a statement saying: “It is very clear from their report that Richard Freeman fell short of the ethical standards required of him as a doctor and acted dishonestly. However, the Team does not believe that any athlete ever used or sought to use Testogel or any other performance enhancing substance.”However, hard as they try, this is a story that Brailsford and his staff, past and present, at British Cycling and Team Sky and now Ineos Grenadiers, can no longer evade.Brian Cookson, the president of British Cycling between 1996 and 2013, was more forthcoming than Brailsford. “I was proud and privileged to have overseen a period of unprecedented success in the sport, leading to a massive increase in its popularity and profile,” Cookson said. “That this should now be open to question is a matter of extreme concern to me and all of those who work or have worked behind the scenes in our sport, in governance, management, administration and coaching.”Prior to the arrival of Brailsford and Team Sky, doping had long dominated the European cycling headlines. A decade or more of debilitating revelations, from the Festina affair, Operation Puerto, the Floyd Landis scandal, and in late 2012, the downfall of Lance Armstrong, had crippled the peloton’s credibility.In 2010 Team Sky came to the rescue, proclaiming their integrity, their vetting skills and their credibility, vowing to win the Tour de France “clean”. It was a message that was a breath of fresh air for fans, weary of years of doubt and disappointment. In Britain, the sales pitch of Sky as cycling’s saviours was embraced almost unquestioningly.Yet within a sport that is still haunted by its past, there were always whispers of just how close to rule-breaking the team would go. In Europe, suspicion stalked the team after they reversed the poor performances of their early outings into the all-conquering Grand Tour successes of Wiggins, Froome and Thomas.There were furores over their admitted use of the potent painkiller tramadol, now banned by cycling’s governing body, and obfuscation and confusion over the use of therapeutic use exemptions (TUEs) by both Bradley Wiggins and Chris Froome.Froome, who benefited from a TUE in April 2014, when he won the Tour of Romandie, told the BBC a year later that he had declined a TUE in the latter stages of the 2015 Tour de France because “it did not sit well morally with me”.A further problem for Brailsford and his management structures is that Freeman is not the first “dodgy doctor”. Wiggins’s career-making golden summer of 2012, which included multiple stage race wins, Tour de France success and Olympic glory, was achieved when Geert Leinders, now banned for life for doping offences, was retained as a medical consultant.Brailsford maintained that Leinders was always a distant presence, but subsequently admitted to an error of judgment in hiring a man whose name became a byword for doping in the Netherlands, where he worked for the disgraced Rabobank team. But then Sky’s zero tolerance policy, based on recruiting from a pool of professionals in which it was impossible to guarantee propriety, had been unworkable from the outset.The team’s much-vaunted vetting procedures failed abjectly, when they were forced to shed staff – such as Bobby Julich and Steven de Jongh, supposedly scrupulously vetted by Brailsford and Steve Peters – who had subsequently admitted an involvement in doping earlier in their careers.Yet Brailsford, whether scrutinised by the media, catcalled by roadside fans, or grilled by a digital, culture, media and sport committee in Westminster, has ploughed on regardless. The big wins kept on coming, even as the doctors came and went. Recently he has talked of having “more fun” with cycling, although that seems less likely given the latest turn of events.Brailsford was talked about, but never seen, during the Freeman hearings. Now many will ask where is the man the French media once knowingly titled “Monsieur Zero Tolerance” in all this? As he has been so often during the difficult moments, the architect of the British cycling success story, from its beginnings through to the present day, remains the Invisible Man.And what will Jim Ratcliffe’s view be of the Freeman verdict? Two years ago, when the Ineos takeover of Team Sky’s personnel and infrastructure was unveiled, the billionaire entrepreneur sat alongside Brailsford and made his ethical position clear.“We did our due diligence,” he said. “I have absolutely no interest in cheating or drugs. The day that any of that enters our world, we’ll be exiting that world.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29120adb7419d6036b1a3903c91cf54f500f2736/0_7_6016_3609/master/6016.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=1e05f9364e1d94739c148c0e58080439","title":"can you kick it the definitive womens football quiz","story":"Women’s football has seen its audience rise to a whopping 1.12 billion viewers – but are you one of them?

Playing with her local club from a young age, she knew a big move was inevitable if she wanted to play at the highest level.In fact, it was the young women in the national team, the Football Ferns, who inspired Moore the most.“I think because New Zealand is so remote from everywhere else, I idolised a lot of the girls from our national framework. They’re actually still there now, and I remember when I had my first tour with the Football Ferns and I’d had those players on my wall – then I was going to training with them for the first time.“Players like Abby Erceg, Ria Percival, Amber Hearn, Ali Riley – all those girls were influential because I saw them, and I was like: ‘I want to do that, I want to be in the Football Ferns environment, I want to follow in their footsteps.’”The first leg of her journey was to Germany, where she played first for FC Köln in the women’s Bundesliga during the 2017-18 season. A couple of seasons at Duisburg followed, including a bad injury just ahead of the 2019 Women’s World Cup, before she signed with Liverpool, at the beginning of this season, where she is fitting right in.“Coming from New Zealand, we’re very carefree – we’re just living the life and quite chilled. So I think coming to Liverpool, it’s quite similar to home – you could say there’s a lot of banter between the girls, we get along quite well.”That said, it’s not always easy living so far from home.“I’m quite family-oriented, so that’s a really important thing for me. I regularly keep in contact with my mum and sisters, my grandma – I schedule in weekly video calls, because it’s so important to me. And being so far away, it’s important for me to keep those connections close, to be able to lean on when I need to.”When disaster struck and Moore tore her achilles while training in France ahead of the 2019 Women’s World Cup, she was lucky, she says, that her family was already travelling to Europe on the same day, and so they were present when she woke from surgery.Though Moore realises injury is “part of the game”, a tough time followed as she underwent rehabilitation in Christchurch, New Zealand, afterwards. However, it was in these difficult moments that she realised who the most important figures in her journey were. Her family, and in particular, her mum, who she describes as her “rock”, and says she is on the phone to straight away regardless of the 13-hour time difference, whenever she has a problem.She also hailed her physiotherapist, Tamsin, as a key figure in her recovery.“I couldn’t have done it without her, and I do think you notice in those sorts of times how important the people around you are – how much you can, and need to rely on them to get through it.”But Moore isn’t used to being confined to one place for too long. She loves travel and long journeys – in which she makes sure she always has some good music and a book with her when she’s on the road. But she is getting settled in Liverpool now and, as a big coffee drinker, can’t wait for normality to resume so she can explore some of the city’s cafes.Another thing Moore misses is playing in full stadiums. “The people make the atmosphere, and the people make the game, so to be able to play in a packed stadium again will be pretty cool,” she says.“It’s always nice to be able to play in front of people and hear them cheering behind you, but we know that it’s not possible right now and since coming here I have felt a lot of love.”In terms of where she wants to be next, there is only one destination, she says: “Anfield.”Expedia believes that travel, like football, is better experienced together.

The goalkeeper talks to Jen Offord about her journey to Liverpool and who’s been with her en routeAt just 22, goalkeeper Rylee Foster has already travelled much of the globe, having visited every continent except Africa. She’s played for Canada under-20s, and spent four years at West Virginia University, but Liverpool has always been her dream destination. With strong family ties to the city, it feels fitting to her that this is where she has started her professional career.“I don’t think I had a choice when I was born,” she says, “I supported Liverpool for as long as I can remember.”Foster’s paternal grandparents were born and raised in the Wavertree area of Liverpool and travelled to Canada after the second world war. Though her father was born in Canada, Foster says the connection to Liverpool never left.“It was something that was in a sense drilled into me as a young kid, watching the matches every weekend with my dad or my mum, and my sisters on the couch,” she says.Her grandparents were also key figures in her early footballing aspirations.“My grandparents used to come to my matches and there were always words of wisdom: ‘Just keep your elbows up and don’t let anyone take you down. If someone comes close just give them a little knock – whatever you’ve got to do to keep strong.’”After her beloved grandmother passed away in 2013, Foster had the words of the famous Liverpool anthem You’ll Never Walk Alone tattooed on one of her biceps in memoriam. It was, she says, a reminder that her grandmother would always be with her.“But it also rooted me into my culture. I just wanted to have that reminder to keep going forward and keep representing my family, but also the Liverpool crest with as much pride as I could.“To be the first one to be able to return back to Liverpool and to have roots here to start something new and carry on the Foster name in the city is an honour.”Foster’s family is clearly as integral to her football journey as much as the physical one she has taken to be here, acting as her cheerleaders and support network.She started playing football around the age of five, when her father took her and her sisters to the local park. These are, she says, some of her fondest memories. But as well as starting her on her journey, her family gave so much and put everything else aside to make sure she was able to fulfil her potential.Not living close to a competitive training ground, her entire family would follow her for the hour-and-a-half journey to practice and back.“My dad would leave early to come and pick me up, my mum would take my sisters and they would miss time with their friends and do their homework in the car.”Given how close they are, and how meaningful her career move is to the entire family, it’s not ideal, says Foster, that they can’t be with her at the moment. Her sisters were able to visit during the year she has been in Liverpool, and her mother also came with her when she first signed with the club. Next, she really hopes her dad will be able to visit.“It’s been a dream for me to make that happen,” she says. “Just be at a match together, for him to see the Kop and be in that experience, that environment, would mean the world to me.”Although Foster hasn’t had much time with the club under Covid-free circumstances, having joined in January 2020, she’s already had a taste of the incredible fanbase Liverpool are known for.“The football culture here is amazing. We talk about the fans, but it’s not even that it’s a thing that they love, it’s like a religion, which is how I’ve felt all my life – so to be immersed in a culture like that is so fun and so cool.”“When I walk on to the pitch and hear You’ll Never Walk Alone, it kind of hits home a little bit more. It actually brings a tear to my eye every time I hear it.”Since she’s been in Liverpool, she’s been impressed by the food culture and lists Bold Street as one of her must-visit places. She’s also enjoyed travelling by foot to take in the historic buildings, particularly around the docks, as well as getting to know her fellow scousers.“If I’m wearing the kit in town it’s an automatic conversation. Other cities I’ve been in, they don’t really care to have that conversation, they kind of look at you and walk by, but people here want to get to know you and know where you’re from. I think it’s so cool to be able to make those connections.”Finally, of course, there’s Anfield itself, which is, in her opinion, “breathtaking”.Though it may have been chaotic at times, Foster is proud to have travelled so much, and is grateful for the opportunities football has given her.“When you’re going there for football you get a different feel for these countries, you don’t get the resort style stuff you get to see the inner cities and what the people are like – you can talk to the people and relate to them. I’m pretty lucky to be able to learn while being able to experience some of the greatest places in the world.”But that doesn’t mean she’s not keen to enjoy some leisurely travel too. She’s looking forward to seeing the Blue Lagoon in Iceland and surfing in Hawaii when things get back to normal. “I don’t think I’d be very good at surfing,” she ponders, “but I’ll try it.”Expedia believes that travel, like football, is better experienced together.

Now, at only 19, she’s one of Liverpool FC Women’s brightest stars. Here, she talks about the people who have been with her all the wayFor homegrown talent Missy Bo Kearns, playing at Anfield is the dream. Though the 19-year-old’s career may have grown – like many others – from humble beginnings, she is well connected in the local football community, and counts Liverpool royalty Jamie Carragher as one of her confidants.“I think growing up Steven Gerrard was my idol and I always looked up to him,” she says. “But now, I speak to Jamie Carragher quite regularly – he’s my dad’s friend – and he gives me the best advice I’ve probably had in football. He’s always there if I need to ask him anything, and I know he’s been there himself.”If that wasn’t enough, Kearns also credits Lioness, Atlético Madrid forward and ex-Everton player Toni Duggan as having been instrumental in her career. Duggan was a huge source of inspiration to the young footballer, having attended the same youth club in Liverpool.Kearns started playing football at the age of four with her cousins in the garden, and joined a local team with her cousin. She trialled and signed for Liverpool at the age of eight, and worked her way through each of the age groups at the club before breaking through into the first team last year. Though, it could have been different for the midfielder.Female role models are important in this game, with the age-old adage: if you can’t see it, you can’t be it – and Kearns hopes to return the favour one day.“Knowing what Toni has done for me, if I can do that for other young girls, that’s amazing – it’s got me where I am today. So if I can help, I’d love to.”Another important female figure in her football journey is her grandmother, who she says she has successfully converted to the beautiful game.“Believe it or not, she never used to watch football,” Kearns says. “But now she’s starting to get into it more. She used to watch when it was just me, but now she’ll watch actual games on the TV.”Kearns’s grandma also fulfilled the role of backroom staff as well as fanbase, and would pick her up from school, get her ready and take her to training. Several times a week, whatever the weather, she was always ready to help.“If she’d not done that while my parents were at work, I wouldn’t be where I am today. I’m grateful for what she’s done for me.”Like many of her fellow Liverpudlians, Kearns is an avid football fan, as well as a player, and is part of what she thinks of as “one big family”.“I was watching football in the house before I even played it. I was going to Anfield, so I’ve been brought up into football and I think being a Liverpool fan, it makes you want to follow football more because of the passion and how big a club it is. It’s just unbelievable when you’re in the stadiums feeling it, home and away, how much it actually means to the fans watching the team.”In her free time, as well as hanging out with friends in the city, and particularly the Royal Albert Dock, Kearns is a regular in the stands at Anfield, and appreciates the role of fans both as a player and supporter.“I think for us, as the women’s team, when the fans are there you feel like you’ve got more players on the pitch. You feel privileged that they’ve come out to watch you and support you.”Kearns has big aspirations for her career, hoping to get Liverpool back into the Women’s Super League, and hopefully winning some trophies.When she’s on the road now, to the slightly less exotic locations of Charlton in south-east London, and Maiden Castle in Durham, you’ll most likely find her with best friend Jade Bailey on the team bus, and she takes her PlayStation 5 with her everywhere to “relax”, she says. She hopes there might be some longer journeys in the future, though.“There’s loads of places I’d like to play,” she says, quickly clarifying, “as an away team, though.”Anfield is the dream, she says, but she thinks Barcelona’s famous Nou Camp would be a “good experience”. And she’d like to experience the atmosphere at Ajax’s Johan Cruyff Arena.“I just think Ajax fans are brilliant,” she says of the Dutch Ereisie club.She’d also love to play at German Bundesliga club Borussia Dortmund’s Westfalenstadion for the atmosphere and another familiar reason.“They sing You’ll Never Walk Alone, too,” she says, referencing Liverpool’s famous anthem. “I’d probably get goosebumps.”Expedia believes that travel, like football, is better experienced together.

Since then, over 200,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,000 people have died.Globally, over 100 million people have been diagnosed and over 2.5\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Scientists have been racing to develop a vaccine that would bring an end to the pandemic, and there are now 64 different vaccines in clinical development, with another 173 in preclinical development, according to the World Health Organisation.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspis also in talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva. 157,072 had received their second dose.Some 170,570 of these vaccines had gone to people in long term residential care facilities, while 273,215 had gone to frontline healthcare workers and 108,932 had gone to people over the age of 70. Some\u0026nbsp295 people in Cohort 4 - those\u0026nbspaged between 16 and 69 at very high risk of severe Covid-19 disease - received a dose.\u0026nbspGlobally, over 300 million doses of a Covid-19 vaccine have been administered.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 5.4 million doses by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc. While talks continue on how to increase production, the company has now committed to a total of 40 million doses for the EU in the first quarter of 2021.While the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab, resulting in a significant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.How many will Ireland get? 190,000 doses in February and a further 95,000 in early March - supply after this is not confirmed.Storage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and expects to have its first results by April 2021. On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?In December the HSE published the provisional order in which people in Ireland will be vaccinated against Covid-19. After over-65s in care homes and frontline health workers, people aged 70 and older and other healthcare workers are next in line to receive the vaccine.\u0026nbspPeople aged 16-69 with very high risk conditions will then be\u0026nbspthe fourth cohort to be vaccinated.The next categories are: people aged 65-69 years an ill-defined group referred to as “key workers” and people aged 18-64 with certain medical conditions. Next up will be: those living or working in crowded conditions people working in education those aged 55-64 workers in other occupations important to the functioning of society people aged between 18 and 54 and, finally, pregnant women and those under 18.The vaccination of people aged over 85 began on Monday, February 15th. Those in the 70-84 age bracket should begin to receive their first dose by March 8th, alongside people aged 16-69 with very high risk conditions.The HSE has said everyone over the age of 70 should have received their second dose by mid-May.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4508729.1615564075!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"is ireland facing another covid 19 wave or is a blip being used to put the frighteners on","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t‘We are sailing very close to the wind,’ said Nphet’s modelling expert Prof Philip Nolan on Thursday. ‘A gust of wind in the wrong direction and we’re in real trouble.’ Photograph: Colin KeeganCollins.The change shows up as a small uptick on the graph of daily case numbers, but after two months of mostly steady decline it was sufficient to cast an air of gloom over Thursday’s National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) briefing.“We are sailing very close to the wind,” said Nphet’s modelling expert Prof Philip Nolan. “A gust of wind in the wrong direction and we’re in real trouble.”Was the increase in cases this week really evidence of the beginning of another wave of Covid-19? Or was it a blip seized upon in order to put the frighteners on people and shore up declining compliance with public health advice?Time will tell. The wider issue is why Ireland is stuck at about 500 cases every day, months into a third lockdown and despite the rollout of vaccines. Progress on case number has been slowing for weeks now, and the reproduction number, the number of infections linked to each confirmed case, is hovering just below 1.Have all our sacrifices been in vain? Are we not doing things right? Will it mean further delay in easing restrictions or even the imposition of new ones? These are inevitable questions for an increasingly frustrated public.Nphet explains our current impasse by pointing to the more transmissible, and now dominant, B117 strain first identified in the UK. Without B117, Ireland would be down to about 20 cases a day, according to some experts.MinglingInstead of that, any increase in mingling in the population is “rewarded” with more new cases, many more than would have been the case last year when the variant was not present. It may also give rise to more serious illness than was the case with other variants. Other countries have seen cases rise as B117 makes inroads.Nphet has focused on mobility, as measured by Google tracking of our household and workplace movements, as an extra factor behind the increase in cases. There is also data on where people use their phone, or withdraw money from ATMs, but none of this information tells anything about whether people are observing social distancing or isolation rules, for example.It takes infected people to pass on this disease. The Nphet view tells us little about where the new cases are arising. Though 900 people are now working in contact tracing, only sparse information emerges about outbreak patterns. A few weeks ago, it took the media to highlight large student clusters in Galway and Limerick this week, the only specific references by Nphet was to outbreaks in workplaces and among Travellers.The public health doctors employed to track disease tell a different story of a lack of resources of having to rely on pen and paper and basic Excel spreadsheets of outdated computer systems that don’t talk to each other.“There are almost no supports put into investigating the chains of transmission” of the disease, public health doctor Dr Ina Kelly told RTÉ’s PrimeTime this week. Another says: “We’re no better equipped than a year ago”.A month ago, Nphet said one-quarter of cases were not being followed up to establish the source of infection. The situation seems not to have improved since.Blunt instrumentCould this be the reason for relying on the blunt instrument of lockdown for so long? Currently, 10 counties appear to have effectively suppressed the virus, with average daily case numbers in single figures, yet they are treated the same as other parts of the country with big outbreaks.Meanwhile, vaccination is changing the calculus of lockdown, rapidly and massively. Cases have fallen off a cliff in healthcare settings and in nursing homes after staff, patients and residents were inoculated. Deaths are declining, too, as the most vulnerable groups are protected.Israel’s experience shows you can still have active transmission even when most of the population is immunised. But the capacity for harm is greatly reduced, so the rationale for severe restrictions is greatly weakened.Ireland hasn’t reached that point yet, of course, though the way our vaccination programme has been targeted at specific vulnerable groups means they should soon be able to enjoy a wider “vaccine bonus” than is currently proposed.The rest of us can only wait, watch the stop-and-go nature of the vaccine rollout and wonder when we will be able to buy children’s shoes again.

This is important as twin deliveries are associated with higher death rates among babies and children and more complications for mothers and children during pregnancy, and during and after delivery.”Substantial increasesWith Prof Gilles Pison of the French Museum of Natural History and Prof Jeroen Smits of Radboud University in the Netherlands, they collected information on twinning rates for the period 2010-2015 from 165 countries, covering 99 per cent of the world’s population. For 112 countries, they obtained information on twinning rates for 1980-1985.They found substantial increases in twinning rates in many European countries, North America and Asia. For 74 per cent out of 112 countries for which data was available for both periods, the increase was more than 10 per cent. There was a 32 per cent increase in Asia and a 71 per cent increase in North America.Prof Monden said: “In both periods Africa had the highest twinning rates and there was no significant increase over time. However, Europe, North America and the Oceanic countries are catching up rapidly. About 80 per cent of all twin deliveries in the world now take place in Asia and Africa.”The twinning rate in Africa is so high because of high numbers of “dizygotic twins” – born from two separate eggs. This is most likely to be due to genetic differences between the African population and others.“The absolute number of twin deliveries has increased everywhere except in South America. In North America and Africa, the numbers have increased by more than 80 per cent, and in Africa this increase is almost entirely caused by population growth,” Prof Monden said.Because infant mortality among twins has been going down, many more of the twins born in the second period of the study will grow up as twins compared with those born in the early 1980s.“However, more attention needs to be paid to the fate of twins in low- and middle-income countries,” Prof Smits noted. “In sub-Saharan Africa in particular, many twins will lose their co-twin in their first year of life, some 200,000-300,000 each year ... While twinning rates in many rich western countries are now getting close to those in sub-Saharan Africa, there is a huge difference in the survival chances.”"},{"url":null,"title":"q a is the astrazeneca covid 19 vaccine safe for older people","story":"The AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine developed with scientists at Oxford University continues to be in the news for all the wrong reasons. From being in prime position in the race to create a vaccine, the company has become embroiled in a bitter dispute over supply. And recent reports over possible side effects associated with its use have compounded matters. In between, there was protracted debate about its effectiveness in older people. A particular problem arose in the way its developers conducted initial clinical trials because they did not include older people. It culminated in the European Medicines Agency, the EU regulator, approving its use – yet some countries then declined to deploy it for older cohorts.Based on a lack of evidence, Ireland’s National Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) in early February advised that the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines should be given to over-70s “where practicable”, but that vaccination should not be delayed. The Department of Health subsequently adopted a less-nuanced position, saying only those vaccines should be administered to over-70s. Niac has now updated its advice, while the Health Service Executive is making “significant changes” to address problems with vaccine delivery to GPs countrywide.So what changed between last month and now? There are now reports in three scientific publications on “real-world effectiveness” on how the vaccine performs in older people, according to Niac chairwoman Karina Butler. Positive data from Scotland, in particular, has provided more flexibility, she said. This research confirmed equal efficacy in over-70s and therefore gave more flexibility for the vaccine’s use in all age groups.What does the AstraZeneca vaccine bring to the table?It harnesses a virus to act as a Trojan horse that sneaks some of the genetic blueprint for Covid-19 into the body. The “viral vector” used is a modified common cold virus to provoke an immune response.Clinical trials found with two doses it was 62 per cent effective. But when people were given a half dose followed by a full dose at least a month later its efficacy rose to 90 per cent. Some questioned these results, including the UK medicines regulator, which recommended two full doses be administered in approving its use. It concluded it was up to 80 per cent effective when the second dose was delayed by three months. Delaying the second dose in the UK allowed the NHS to prioritise delivery of the first dose to as many people as possible.The benefits of this vaccine are considerable. It is much easier to administer and can be stored at normal refrigerator temperatures for at least six months.What of blood clot concerns being raised in some countries?Instead of full steam ahead while trying to address supply chain blockages, another issue in the form of a potential health scare has arisen. Over the past week, a growing number of countries have suspended their rollouts of the jab because of reported cases of blood clots supposedly linked to vaccination.The European Medicines Agency has confirmed 30 cases of “thromboembolic events” had been reported among five million people who had received the jab in Europe so far. But, significantly, it has not called for it to be withdrawn from use in other words, benefits outweigh risks.There have been more than 11 million doses of the vaccine administered in the UK and no reports of excess deaths or blood clots among those receiving the vaccine, compared with the expected rate in the population.There is no established link between the vaccine and blood clots, though each case requires careful investigation.Should older people feel safe if they are offered the vaccine?The overwhelming scientific opinion is that it is safe for all age groups. Indeed, all three vaccines in circulation currently are 100 per cent effective in reducing severe Covid-19 infection and deaths. They will soon be joined by the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine, while the Novavax jab looks set to be the next to be approved.A UK study published in early March found the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines are effective in significantly reducing Sars-CoV-2 infection in older adults and in providing long-term protection. The bottom line is the public should have confidence current vaccines are safe and highly effective.Who decides who gets what vaccine?The HSE – backed by National Public Health Emergency Team, Niac and the vaccination taskforce – are involved in a huge logistical effort to get the Irish population vaccinated as quickly as possible. At EU and Government level, intensive efforts are being made to improve supply chains. This does not provide the luxury of pick and choose when offered a vaccine given proven effectiveness and risk profile of currently approved jabs.When asked about patients refusing the AstraZeneca vaccine, Prof Butler said such refusals were based on a lack of understanding and confirmed there would not be a choice. She encouraged patients to take what they were offered, as all were very effective. How much easier will vaccination rollout be with the AstraZeneca vaccine available for older people?The obvious versatility and flexibility of the vaccine will significantly assist Ireland’s vaccination programme. It is especially suited for deployment in care settings and GP surgeries. But it will require a careful recasting of vaccination schedules backed by guarantees on supply, to reduce risk of heightened concerns or lack of confidence among the public.“We are now spoiled for choice with vaccines . . . It is down to logistics and when they will be delivered,” said Prof Butler.The longer time between doses of AstraZeneca is also an advantage as it gave the opportunity for more people to be vaccinated, as the first dose provides significant immunity."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4508819.1615567333!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"covid 19 british army medics to join north s vaccination drive","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Boris Johnson (right) is shown the latest technology by Ahmed Elkaskis, a PHD student at Wellcome-Wolfson Institute For Experimental Medicine, Queen’s University Belfast on Friday.

The British government announced on Friday that 100 army medical personnel would be be sent to the North from the end of the month to support the accelerated rollout. It follows a request by the North’s Department of Health, which was approved by the UK defence secretary. It would be the second time medically-trained British military personnel have travelled to assist the North’s pandemic response. Earlier this year, 110 army medics were deployed to assist nursing staff in hospitals. Northern secretary Brandon Lewis said he was “pleased medically-trained personnel from our Armed Forces will support health and social care teams in the delivery of this unprecedented programme across Northern Ireland”. UK prime minister Boris Johnson toured a mass vaccination centre in the converted Lakeland Forum Leisure Centre in Enniskillen, Co Fermanagh on Friday with the North’s First Minister Arlene Foster and Minister for Health Robin Swann. According to the most recent data from the Department of Health, as of Friday 664,029 doses of vaccine have been administered in Northern Ireland, which includes 614,629 first doses. A total of 6,677 jabs were given in the last 24 hours. Positive testsOne more death with Covid-19 was reported by the Department on Friday, bringing the total number of fatalities to 2,097. A further 208 people tested positive for the virus. Separate data published on Friday by the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (Nisra) put the number of coronavirus-related deaths up to March 5th at 2,845, compared to 2,069 recorded by the department in the same period. Nisra recorded 22 fatalities in the week to March 5th. In care homes, where residents and staff were among the first cohort to receive the vaccine, no deaths were recorded that week. The Nisra figures, which are released weekly, provide a broader picture of the impact of Covid-19 as they are based on death certificates on which coronavirus has been recorded as a factor by a medical professional, regardless of whether the death took place or whether the patient had tested positive for the virus. The data released daily by the department is focused primarily on hospital deaths and includes only people who have tested positive for the virus.

Photograph: politan Police AFP via GettyBritish police forces have been warned not to allow vigils planned by thousands of women in dozens of towns and cities to honour the memory of Sarah Everard this weekend amid frustration about “endemic” levels of violence against women and girls.Police said on Friday that human remains found in a wood in Kent on Thursday was the body of Ms Everard (33), whose disappearance last week sparked anger and fears among women about their safety.Wayne Couzens (48), a serving member of the politan Police, is in custody after he was arrested on suspicion of her kidnapping and murder. has learned that the National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC) told forces across England and Wales on Friday that they could not waive lockdown guidance banning gatherings, after it was discussed with the policing minister, Kit Malthouse. The document says that he is “supportive”.But one force has decided that it will allow vigils as long as they are socially distanced and people wear masks, the  has learned, reasoning that the outdoor events would pose little risk of spreading infection.Vigils were planned on Clapham Common, south London, and at least two dozen other towns and cities in the wake of the alleged murder of Ms Everard, whose body was identified more than a week after she vanished from south London.In Scotland, police similarly asked people to stay away from planned vigils in Glasgow and Edinburgh, and to come together online instead.The arrest of the police officer has been described by the commissioner, Cressida Dick, as having sent “shockwaves and anger through the public and through the Met”.Responding to an outpouring of public anger and fear, the government on Friday reopened its consultation into violence against women and girls to allow the thousands of stories of abuse and violence experienced by women to feed into government policy.Nimko Ali, a government adviser and violence against women campaigner, said women had experienced the disappearance and death of Ms Everard as a “collective grief”. “It is like our wounds have been reopened, but when a wound opens up that is a good moment to use antibiotics. This is a moment to use our platforms and our privileges and make sure we bring about change.”Organisers of the vigil in Clapham, near where Ms Everard was last seen, have been locked in a legal battle with the Met police since Thursday, when the force – after initially apparently seeking to work with organisers – said the gathering would be unlawful under current lockdown restrictions.They told the organisers, Reclaim These Streets, that they could face tens of thousands of pounds in fixed penalty notices and criminal prosecution under the Serious Crime Act 2007, which criminalises encouraging or assisting an offence, if they pressed ahead, Reclaim These Streets said. Following an emergency hearing on Friday evening, a judge told police and the vigil’s organisers to enter into further discussions.At the hearing, Mr Justice Holgate refused an application by the organisers of the vigil for the high court to make “an interim declaration” that any ban on outdoor gatherings under coronavirus regulations was “subject to the right to protest”.The judge also refused to make a declaration that an alleged policy by the politan police of “prohibiting all protests, irrespective of the specific circumstances” was unlawful.Mr Justice Holgate said the organisers were told by police that “the vigil would be illegal and that their ‘hands were tied’ by Covid-19 regulations”. The judge added that the four claimants “were told that, as organisers, they would be liable to be issued with £10,000 fixed penalty notices”, and could also be arrested.The NPCC document is a rare attempt to forge a common approach among the 43 forces across England and Wales. It says “we understand the strength of feeling” but stresses that Covid regulations do not allow large gatherings. It says vigils will have to be conducted “in accordance with the law”. Currently two people are allowed to meet for exercise in England.In a sign of rising tensions, Labour’s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, added her voice to those calling for vigils to be allowed to go ahead, saying: “Women’s voices must not be silenced.”Campaigners and women across the UK have called for a societal shift and a policy overhaul to tackle violence which sees one women killed at the hands of a man every three days, according to the Femicide Census. – AgenciesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4509013.1615578025!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"andrew cuomo blames cancel culture as he rejects calls to resign","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNew York governor Andrew Cuomo: “I did not do what has been alleged.

Nursing home data“Unfortunately, the governor is not only facing the accusation that he engaged in a pattern of sexual harassment and assault,” the statement said. “There is also the extensive report from the attorney general that found the Cuomo administration hid data on Covid-19 nursing home deaths from both the public and the state legislature.”Mr Cuomo has been accused of suppressing the true number of nursing home deaths from Covid. In addition, six women have accused the 63 year old of sexually inappropriate behaviour, and in some cases, assault. Impeachment investigationThe move against Mr Cuomo from New York representatives in Congress comes as 55 members of the New York state legislature also called on him to go. The state assembly – the lower house of the New York legislature – has officially opened an impeachment investigation into the governor. Mr Cuomo was widely praised for his response to the pandemic last year. However, the three-term governor is now facing the biggest crisis of his political career.

Photograph: Andrew HarnikAP PhotoAs Joe Biden marked his 50th day as president, he delivered his first primetime TV address on Thursday.Speaking from the White House, in front of a red-carpeted hall lined with flags, the president opened with the words that so many presidents have spoken: “My fellow Americans . . . Tonight I’d like to talk to you... ” he said in a sombre tone.But this time, the address was not about a foreign war, or an economic crisis. Instead it was about the Covid-19 pandemic, as Biden marked a year since it shut down America. \u0026nbsp“While it was different for everyone, we all lost something. A collective suffering. A collective sacrifice. A year filled with the loss of life – and the loss of living for all of us.”At one point he took from his pocket a note with the latest number of lives lost to the pandemic. It’s something he does every day, he says, to remind himself of the true cost of the pandemic.On Thursday, the number had reached 527,726 – “They were husbands, wives, sons and daughters, grandparents, friends, neighbours – young and old. They leave behind loved ones unable to truly grieve or to heal, even to have a funeral.”But the president also brought a message of hope. All adults aged over 18 will be eligible for a vaccine by May 1st, he said, pledging to launch a new system to help those who need vaccines to find them. By Independence Day on July 4th, small groups will be able to get together, he predicted.Beaten expectationsOne year on from the onset of the crisis in the US, America is beginning to turn a corner. Like Britain, its vaccine strategy has beaten expectations even though it suffered one of the highest case levels and death tolls in the world.About 19 per cent of the US population has now received at least one dose of the vaccine, while 10 per cent has been fully vaccinated.The US is now administering about 2.2 million doses a day, with Biden ordering an extra 100 million doses from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson this week. Each state is administering the rollout of the free vaccines, with mass vaccination centres open around the country. But demand is still outstripping supply as eligible adults desperately search for available slots through their local provider.Nonetheless, the acceleration of the vaccine rollout is a huge win for Biden politically. He campaigned on a promise to deal with the Covid crisis. Some Republicans have accused him, not without reason, of taking full credit for a programme that was already in train when he took office.Donald trumpA piqued Donald Trump issued a statement this week reminding America of his Operation Warp Speed initiative. “I hope everyone remembers when they’re getting the Covid-19 (often referred to as the China Virus) Vaccine, that if I wasn’t president, you wouldn’t be getting that beautiful ‘shot’,” he said.Questions are now being asked about America’s willingness to share some of its surplus vaccines with Europe. In particular, millions of AstraZeneca doses are sitting in factories in Ohio and Maryland.The US, like Britain, was quick off the mark on procurement and investment, signing a public-private partnership agreement with AstraZeneca last May, which included a $1.2 billion investment in development and manufacturing. But the company has run into difficulty with the FDA (Food and Drug Administration), which has demanded more US-based clinical trial data before it can approve it.Powering aheadWith America powering ahead with distribution of the three approved vaccines – Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson \u0026amp Johnson – there is now the possibility that the AstraZeneca jabs won’t be needed if approved. Headlines from Europe questioning its efficacy may also make the vaccine less palatable to Americans.This week, for the first time, Biden said he will share vaccines with the rest of the world if there is a surplus but insisted he would make sure “Americans are taken care of first”. There have been reports that an initial approach by the EU for the vaccines has been rebuffed. One complicating factor is that AstraZeneca may seek liability protection for doses sent overseas.The issue may be raised at next Wednesday’s meeting between Biden and the Taoiseach. But Europe may find that it is not necessarily at the top of the queue. America’s neighbour, Canada, is also experiencing vaccine shortages, as well as Brazil. Deciding who is most deserving of the US’s extra vaccines may well be the next big issue in the vaccine nationalism debate.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"world view how andrew cuomo went from covid hero to pariah","story":"Suzanne Lynch on the fall from grace of New York State governor Andrew Cuomo, whose early handling of the pandemic won him praise but is now subject to increasing scrutiny, and whose declining fortunes have been worsened by accusations of sexual harassment.The \u0027 unrivalled foreign affairs coverage, now brought to you in weekly podcast form.

When he isn’t prophesying eco-doom he can be found urging on the downfall of capitalism – which would, of course, bring about a not much better variety of doom. Yet even a radical Leftist like Monbiot can sometimes be onto something. This week’s stopped clock award goes to him because on Thursday he took to social media to show that he had been thinking about the EU a bit. As ever he was confused. But within the confusion lay something important.Monbiot started by saying that we must try to separate out the questions of whether Britain should be in the EU and whether the EU itself is a good thing. Rather bravely (given his tribe), he stated that he had come to the conclusion that the EU is not a good thing, indeed it is a bad thing. Rather illogically, perhaps because he wishes to retain his position as the Cassandra of the hard-Left, he never the less still managed to maintain that Britain should remain within it.Other than pausing to laugh for a moment, I do not want to get stuck on the inconsistencies of the eco-Left, but the first part of this breakthrough still struck me as significant. For Monbiot said that the realisation that the EU is not a good thing had come to him “gradually” and I wonder whether this isn’t something that a large number of people are feeling at the moment. Recent polls suggest so.The areas that Monbiot listed as contributing to his awakening included the EU’s environmental, agricultural and biofuels policies among others. These all happen to be among his personal hang-ups, but the conclusion he came to could have applied to the hang-ups any of us might have. He concluded: “The problem seems to be that governments can hide behind the European Council and European Commission.” And indeed, that is one of the arguments that Eurosceptics have made for decades. It may be that Monbiot is especially irate about the ability of governments to hide behind the European Commission to push through environmental policies they would be unable to defend at home. But the same critique has for years been applied from every other political direction in different policy areas.For example, over the course of decades people mainly on the Right have pointed out that governments hid behind the European infrastructure to avoid having sensible migration policies. They said that their hands were tied – that nothing could be done – because of decisions that had been made at the Brussels level.Similar critiques came on trade policy, tariffs and a whole range of other issues. The point is that few if any of these things could be addressed so long as a national government could claim – rightly or otherwise – that it was Brussels who had the power. The realisation that Brussels had a democratic deficit and that this in turn made national governments as well as the supranational government in Brussels unaccountable should never been a concern solely of the political Left or the political Right. It should have been seen all along as a pan-political problem.Mr Monbiot’s concerns are his usual ones, around the ability of corporate lobbyists and other to quietly push through policies at the EU level that they could not get away with at home. But everybody else could perfectly happily apply the same critique to whatever their particular bugbear is.For instance, if you are especially concerned about the Chinese Communist Party’s ability to get away with genocides, pandemics and much more, you might be concerned at the EU’s ability to be silent on Chinese atrocities while acting beseechingly towards it at a trade level. If you are concerned about Russia policy you may be dismayed at the EU saying one thing about Vladimir Putin while nodding through the Nord Stream 2 pipeline on the other. Closer to home, you might worry about the security of Northern Ireland, but you have to face an EU which simultaneously professes to worry about the issue and violates the sovereignty of the province without democratic recourse or accountability.These things and much more rankle with people depending on their own particular interests. But they are all related in the central issue of a dreadful lack of democratic accountability. A deficit which can be seen at any moment, on any issue.Over recent months, European publics have been treated to the sight of the EU’s vaccine development and procurement policies. It has been a test which the EU has failed appallingly. Franco-German protectionism delayed both the development and purchases of vaccines. Sheer incompetence at the Commission level exacerbated these and many other issues. And now we see an EU where the best-performing members in vaccine rollouts are those – notably Hungary – who have broken away from the EU scheme.People in Brussels should be held to account, but as ever they will not be. Ursula von der Leyen may preside over another tragic farce, but still there will be no alteration in the personnel and no accountability. Because that is how the EU rolls, and it is how it always will roll.Europhiles will say that all that is needed is reform at the EU level. But the people who say this cannot have spent any time studying the EU’s form. If the EU were capable of learning lessons it would learn them. But it hasn’t. It never does.What lessons has it learnt from Brexit – from losing one of the largest contributors to its budget? Nothing. Guy Verhofstadt and the rest of them have spent five years threatening Britain and insulting British voters. But not once have they bothered to wonder what it was that the British public saw that they did not like. Or whether the British public might have been onto something.For their part, the British public have noticed this and much more. One poll this week showed that only 39 per cent of the British public now have any interest in rejoining the EU. That is a decline of 8 per cent in the past few months alone. Perhaps the public can see what Monbiot and others are quietly conceding. Which is that, whatever the EU’s fate, it was never the great moral cause célèbre it was made out to be.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"fertility clinics giving women false sense security egg freezing","story":"Fertility clinics are giving women a “false sense of security” that egg freezing will guarantee them a baby in future, experts claim.Researchers have criticised clinic websites which make “misleading” claims about the likelihood of egg freezing leading to a successful pregnancy.Dr Zeynep Gurtin, a women’s health specialist at University College London, analysed the websites of the UK’s 15 biggest clinics, which carry out nearly nine out of 10 of all egg freezing cycles.She said women were not always receiving “honest, accurate and transparent information” and may be being “exploited or provided with false hope”.Speaking at a virtual event hosted by fertility ethics charity the Progress Educational Trust, she added: “One of the biggest risks of doing egg freezing is a false sense of security in the potential of those eggs to turn into actual babies.Data from fertility clinic regulator the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) shows, on average, the success rate of IVF using frozen eggs is about 15 per cent, compared to 23 per cent when using “fresh” eggs.But separate studies have suggested as few as 3.3 per cent of eggs frozen by women aged between 36 and 39 – the most common age for egg freezing in the UK – lead to a live birth. One UK clinic made the “really misleading” claim the success rate could be as high as 60 to 80 per cent, Dr Gurtin said.Egg freezing was often presented online as “a solution to a modern woman’s life circumstances” and as “a means to avoid the reproductive risks of ageing”, she said, with marketing messages using phrases like: “Start a family later without worrying about the biological clock”.“In many of these websites there was a discussion how as women become older, risks of miscarriage increase, risks of infertility increase – but interestingly there was very little or no discussion of any potential risks associated with the elective egg freezing process and little explicit discussion of things like success rates,” Dr Gurtin said. “We felt these presentations led to a biased view of egg freezing in which there were unrealistic anxieties about not freezing your eggs and unrealistic expectations being set up about the process and the potential success rates.”Rachel Cutting, director of compliance and information at the HFEA, said the regulator was clear that clinics must ensure their websites provide “information that is clear, accurate, comprehensive and as evidence-based as possible”.Demand for egg freezing rose by 240 per cent between 2013 and 2018 and there has been increased interest in egg freezing for “social reasons” in the last two years.HFEA data shows the majority of women freezing their eggs for non-medical reasons are in their mid to late 30s, educated, professional and single. Overall, only around a third of women who freeze their eggs later return to use them.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"israel launching strikes ships carrying iranian oil","story":"Israel has attacked a series of ships en route to Syria carrying Iranian oil, according to US media reports, in what appears to be a new front in the regional conflict. On Thursday, the Wall Street Journal said that since 2019, Israel has been targeting ships carrying Iranian oil and other cargo. At least a dozen ships were bombed, the newspaper added, citing US and regional officials.Although the strikes, some of which took place in the Red Sea, damaged the vessels and forced two to return to their ports, none were reportedly destroyed.In one incident, the newspaper said, Israeli operatives put limpet mines on an Iranian vessel carrying oil while it was anchored near Lebanon. While Israel has carried out hundreds of airstrikes on Iranian forces in Syria, it has not publicly confirmed whether it also conducts operations against the regime at sea. Israeli officials typically decline to comment on reports about its military activity abroad.It is not the first maritime dispute involving Israel and Iran in recent weeks. In February, a major oil spill from a suspected Iran-owned tanker coated the Israeli and Lebanese coast with more than a thousand tonnes of gloopy, black tar. Israel’s environment protection minister Gila Gamliel accused Iran of being responsible for the spill in what she described as “environmental terrorism,” though this account is disputed by Israeli intelligence officials.There is no suggestion of a link between the oil spill on the Israeli coastline and the Wall Street Journal’s reports of Israeli strikes on vessels carrying Iranian oil.In February, Israel also blamed Iran for attacking one of its ships, the Helios Ray, in the Gulf of Oman.“Iran is the greatest enemy of Israel. I am determined to halt it. We are hitting it in the entire region,” said Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, at the time. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"mothers day flowers may not arrive florists run delivery slots","story":"Mother’s around the country could be sitting at home this Sunday waiting for flowers which will never arrive as offspring who have left it late may have found they are out of luck.For a huge boom in orders at florists has left them overwhelmed with some finding themselves short of delivery slots. One even tweeted on Friday to say it had run out of fresh flowers.A spokesman for the British Florist Association (BFA) and some companies said lockdown had driven demand for delivery with families separated and unable to see each other. Bloom and Wild, which specialises in flowers that can be posted through the letterbox, said its Mother’s Day sales had doubled compared to last year, while online card company Moonpig said this year has been its busiest ever Mothering Sunday.The spokesman for the BFA said: “Florists are mostly small retail businesses on the high street or in a studio, and their capacity to fulfil thousands of orders isn’t possible. “Once they have reached a few hundred deliveries for Saturday and Sunday, they can’t afford any more drivers and they want to get the flowers there first thing in the morning, not at 5pm.”She added that families being separated over lockdown had boosted demand. “Florists have had a pretty tough time like everybody, but they have been extremely adaptable to social distancing and click and collect,” she said.Interflora, one of the country’s best-known florists, had run out of delivery slots in some areas of the country on Friday. A spokesman said that while the company did have availability it can differ depending on location. “We have over 900 local independent florists across the UK and Ireland who all have inidual capacity limits based on demand for their local area,” she said. “The availability shown on our website moves in line with their capacity, and this can change from day to day leading up to a big event like Mother’s Day.”She added: “Demand is high, of course, due to lockdown and we’ve also seen orders come in much earlier than in previous years.”Aron Gelbard, chief executive of Bloom and Wild, said: “We’ve seen an increasing trend throughout the pandemic of people sending flowers as a way to send some love in the post whilst we\u0027re all apart, and we are really fortunate to be able to still make that happen for our customers. “And this is definitely part of a broader trend that goes beyond Mother\u0027s Day - so far this year, as many people have sent flowers with us as the whole of 2019.”Meanwhile, online card companies said they had also seen a surge in customers adding gifts or flowers to their orders because they are separated by lockdown.Moonpig said sales of beauty gifts are up by 198 per cent year on year, with gifts for the home soaring by a massive 582 per cent.A spokesman said: “This year’s Mother’s Day will be the biggest we’ve ever seen, as people are physically separated from their loved ones during the lockdown. “Tulips are proving extremely popular this year, and we expect to deliver almost two million stems to mothers across the country. If you lined up all of those tulips stem to stem, you would get all the way to the Netherlands and back.”Andy Pearce, chief executive of Thortful, another card company, said it is selling flowers for the first time this year.He added: “We have had our best ever Mother\u0027s day, enabling us to donate 5p on every card and £5 on every bouquet to NHS Charities Together and we\u0027ve raised £117,000 so far.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"park shop visits rise 50pc covid anxiety eases official figures","story":"The number of people leaving home to visit parks and shops has increased by 50 per cent as Covid-19 anxiety eases, government figures show.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) published its weekly research on social impacts of Covid-19 on Friday between Mar 3 and Mar 7.Researchers found that the number of people leaving home to socialise has gradually increased as happiness levels rise.Since mid-January (Jan 13 to Jan 17), there has been a “gradual increase”  in the number of adults who left their home in the last seven days. The ONS said that there were certain reasons for this, for example, to visit local parks or green space.This comes as all four personal wellbeing measures continued to improve slightly compared with last week.There has been a gradual improvement in the level of happiness (6.8 out of 10 this week) since a lowest level recorded on this survey at the end of January the level of anxiety (3.9 this week) also appears to have gradually improved since a high in early January.The Royal College of Psychiatrists has repeatedly warned that coronavirus has fuelled a looming mental health crisis, with two fifths of sufferers only getting help in an emergency. Dr Kate Lovett, the dean of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said last year: It simply isn\u0027t good enough that so many people are waiting for mental health treatment and ending up in crisis.Even before the pandemic hit, mental health services were not keeping up with demand. But the looming mental health crisis fuelled by the pandemic and the economic recession means waiting times could get a lot worse.As well as needing medical students and doctors to choose psychiatry, we need decisive Government action on workforce, infrastructure and funding.This week, of adults who reported leaving home: 21 per cent did so to visit a park or local green space (14 per cent in mid-January), 16 per cent did so for any medical need, including to get a Covid-19 vaccine (11 per cent in mid-January), and 14 per cent did so to collect takeaway food or drinks from a restaurant, bar or pub (nine per cent in mid-January).A further 10 per cent left home to shop for things other than basic necessities such as food and medicine (five per cent in mid-January), nine per cent did so to take children or young people to or from school, college or nursery (five per cent in mid-January), and eight per cent did so to meet up with people in a public space (five per cent in mid-January). Researchers also found that around nine in 10 (94 per cent) adults in Britain reported leaving home this week (93 per cent last week).

This week, Her Majesty was given a glimpse of the surface of Mars. The verdict? “Rock-strewn.”She also highlighted one of the most pressing questions when planning a trip into outer space – how on Earth would one get home?The Queen, 94, joined scientists and schoolchildren for a virtual conversation to mark British Science Week.She was briefed on the latest updates from the Nasa Mars Perseverance mission by Prof Caroline Smith, a member of the science team working on the mission.Prof Smith explained that the aim was to understand the geology of Mars and look for signs of ancient life, as well as test technology that could pave the way for human exploration.After being shown images taken by the rover on the planet’s surface, the Queen noted: “It’s very rock-strewn isn’t it?”She later added: “It’s fascinating to see the pictures of Mars – it’s unbelievable really to think one can actually see its surface.”The Queen, who took part in the discussion from Windsor Castle, was also told about a meteorite that landed on British soil last Sunday, the first to be found in the UK for 30 years. A family found a 300g fragment of the meteorite, which survived its fiery passage through the Earth’s atmosphere and landed on their driveway in the small Cotswold town of Winchcombe.Prof Smith, professor of earth sciences and principal curator of meteorites at the Natural History Museum, told the monarch it was a “heaven-sent opportunity” for research and described how the pieces were being curated by the museum.“I’m glad it didn’t hit anyone,” she said.The discussion was hosted by space scientist and broadcaster Dr Maggie Aderin-Pocock on Wednesday, just a few days after the Duke and Duchess of Sussex made a series of damaging claims about the Royal family in their Oprah Winfrey interview.It came as the Duke of Edinburgh, 99, continued his recovery from a heart procedure at the King Edward VII hospital in London, where he was first admitted on Feb 16.Dr Aderin-Pocock asked the Queen about her meeting with Russian cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin at Buckingham Palace in 1961, soon after his historic space mission. “What was he like?” she asked. “Russian,” came the royal reply, to much laughter. The Queen went on: “He didn’t speak English. But no no, he was fascinating.Dr Aderin-Pocock said it must have been terrifying to be the first human in space, not really knowing what was going to happen.The Queen quipped: Well, yes, and if you could come back again. That\u0027s very important.Her Majesty was presented with a set of Mars Perseverance rover face masks, sent from Nasa headquarters to Windsor Castle. Prof Smith asked that one of the masks be gifted to the Duke of Edinburgh, given his particular interest in space exploration.Dr Aderin-Pocock, said after the video call: When I mentioned Yuri Gagarin to her I couldn\u0027t believe her answer. It was not what I expected, she made us all laugh.She has a wonderful sense of humour and it makes you realise, given the fact that he died in 1968, how long she has been our monarch. She is living history, in fact.In July 1969, the Queen, along with figureheads from 72 other nations, sent a message to the moon. The message, carried on a tiny disc, was microfilmed and deposited on the moon in a metal container.It read: “On behalf of the British people, I salute the skills and courage which have brought man to the moon.

finds","story":"Browsing social media apps on smartphones makes you more likely to grind your teeth, sleep poorly and suffer from jaw pain, an Israeli study has found. The Tel Aviv University study of 600 Israelis compared the behaviour of regular smartphone users to those with so-called kosher phones, which are stripped of social media and other forbidden apps.Kosher phones are widely used by Israel’s ultra-orthodox community, allowing them to make phone calls and in some cases basic internet access without falling foul of strict religious practices. According to Tel Aviv University, 24 per cent of regular smartphone users experienced teeth grinding during the day, compared to just six per cent of kosher phone users. The study also reported that 29 per cent of regular smartphone users reported jaw pain, compared to 14 per cent of kosher phone users. Kosher phone users also appeared to get much better sleep than regular smartphone users, with only 20 per cent complaining that they keep waking up during the night.  “We believe these symptoms are related to FOMO, fear of missing out,”  Dr Pessia Friedman-Rubin, a scientist at Tel Aviv University’s dental school, told the Times of Israel. “People are constantly using their phones because they are worried they will miss something, and check WhatsApp, Facebook and other apps,” she added. “We didn’t just find differences between the groups, but also clear patterns showing that the more you use your smartphone the more likely you are to hurt from jaw pain, grind your teeth, and wake in the night,” Dr Friedman-Rubin said. She said she hoped that the study would make people more aware of the fact that technology can be damaging to a person’s physical health, as well as their mental health. “We are of course in favour of technological progress, but as with everything in life, the excessive use of smartphones can lead to negative symptoms,” she said. “It is important that the public is aware of the consequences it has on the body and mind.”The study is due to be published in the peer-reviewed journal Quintessence International.  All of the participants in the study were aged 18-35. It is by no means the first time that researchers have found that social media can be bad for your health. In 2019, a study of 6,000 children aged 12-15 found that those who heavily use social media were far more likely to suffer from depression, loneliness and increased aggression. In 2017, Facebook, one of the world’s largest social media networks, admitted that it can harm people’s mental health. The social media network said “passively consuming information” could leave people “feeling worse”in a blog post. However, not all the research says that extended smartphone and social media use is harmful. One study last year by Lancaster University measures the amount of time Android and iPhone users spent on their phones and examined their mental well-being. But “surprisingly,” the researchers said, the amount of time spent using smartphones was unrelated to a person’s mental health. “A person’s daily smartphone pickups or screen time did not predict anxiety, depression, or stress symptoms,” said Heather Shaw, the leader author of the study at Lancaster University’s Department of Psychology said:“Additionally, those who exceeded clinical ‘cut off points’ for both general anxiety and major depressive disorder did not use their phone more than those who scored below this threshold,” she added.   More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe

british woman fell yacht near us virgin islands","story":"A huge search and rescue operation has been mounted for a British woman who vanished without trace from a yacht moored off the US Virgin Islands.Sarm Heslop’s boyfriend raised the alarm after waking in the early hours of Monday to discover she was nowhere to be seen on his 47ft catamaran Siren Song.Police and ers searching for Ms Heslop, 41, from Southampton, have been scouring the coastline and waters around the island of St John, where the yacht was moored. The US Coast Guard said it was alerted to Ms Heslop’s disappearance at 11.46am on Monday, some hours after her American boyfriend realised she was nowhere to be found. Ms Heslop’s boyfriend, named locally as Captain Ryan Bane – the owner of the luxury charter yacht – told the Coast Guard\u0027s San Juan station that she had gone to sleep at around 10pm, and that “at 2am he woke up and realised that she was not on board” his catamaran.A close friend of Ms Heslop has described the situation as “desperate” and said that her friends had been left distraught by her disappearance.Laura Taylor told The  it would have been completely out of character for her to try and leave the yacht at night to get to shore or go swimming.“She\u0027s very level headed, you know, she\u0027s very smart. I just can\u0027t see why she would get out of bed to go for a swim between the hours of 10.30 and one o\u0027clock in the morning. I know she wouldn\u0027t,” said Ms Taylor.“She was a very strong swimmer, but she wouldn’t have chosen to go for a dip at night, and certainly not if her boyfriend was asleep.”Ms Taylor said the Leopard 4700 catamaran was moored about 200ft from shore and that the couple would have taken a smaller boat to get to it. However this, along with Ms Heslop’s belongings, including her cards, mobile phone and passport, remained on the catamaran.Ms Taylor, who comes from Doncaster but now lives in Malta, said her friend had met her boyfriend while “sailing with friends last year”. She said Ms Heslop had been visiting her and had left on Feb 11 to return to the Virgin Islands and had been “very excited” about the trip. Ms Taylor said that on Sunday evening the couple had gone to dinner at a restaurant close to Frank’s Bay before returning to thecatamaran by 10pm – thought to be the current coronavirus curfew on the islands.Ms Taylor added: “We are relying on locals that are ing around the bay. They’ve been amazing. People are going around printing posters and the Red Cross are getting involved, but I know that the police department can’t look for so long.”The Virgin Islands Police Department has urged members of the local community to help find the missing Briton, with local ers joining in the search.Ms Heslop, who grew up in Hertfordshire, is described as white, slim, with a southern English accent and a tattoo on her left shoulder. Toby Derima, Virgin Islands police spokesman, said: “Divers from various law enforcement agencies have searched hundreds of square feet of water.”Virgin Islands police said that volunteers have also scoured the area around Cruz Bay during daylight hours, but added: “Unfortunately, this effort proved unsuccessful.”Ms Heslop was chronicling her adventures around the Carribean on her Instagram page, with photographs of the sun-drenched locations she had visited. Her last post, of Mr Bane’s dog on a beach, was on March 1.A friend posted on Instagram under the name Flora the Sailing Chef: “The last time I saw Sarm Heslop was dropping her off at the airport in Grenada before she flew off to Malta. I was sad to see her go and even more sad for Ryan. “In my heart I prayed she would come back to him. Lo and behold a few months later she’s messaging me about ideas for cooking on boats! She was coming back to Ryan!! That was the best news ever when we heard it! .... and I know it made Ryan’s dreams come true. Now a few months later she is missing.”A Facebook page, MissingSarmHeslop, has been set up to help trace Sarm and anyone with information that could help the investigation is urged to contact the Virgin Islands Police Department.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"harry meghan prove royal story","story":"NewsopinionHarry and Meghan prove Royal story is childish fiction – but Brits dont want it to endThis is an infantilised nation obsessed with the Queen the same way Jacob Rees-Mogg is with his nanny.

YouTuber pranksters fed them a couple of snippets and off they went, dissing Meghan and defending the Palace, one saying “this was an actress giving one of her great performances, from start to finish”, despite not having seen that performance. But amid all the other outrage no one had time to be outraged. I wasn’t surprised, having worked alongside the late James Whitaker, who, whenever a royal story broke, would be inundated with media ­interview requests. They guessed he had nothing new to tell them, but didn’t care, so long as he said nothing in a posh voice. And he was so posh he drank vending machine coffee from a champagne flute. The Royal Family is a fiction, you see. For the majority of Britons it’s their favourite children’s book. A sort of Alice in Windsorland. And for those who hug its battered cover nostalgically to their bosom, it doesn’t have to be true, or real, just reassuring.As in all fiction this story throws up regular baddies – Wallis Simpson, James Hewitt, Paul Burrell and now Meghan Markle. But no royal is allowed to be seen as a baddy. Not eventhey ­associate with paedophiles. A mass grave could be found in Balmoral containing the corpses of babies murdered by a senior royal, who coughed to being an infant serial killer because he was bored with his ­pointless existence. And the majority of Brits would say “yes, but who’ll be head of statewe abolish them  Diane Abbott  No thanks”. The plot twists are a brilliant ­distraction from reality. Right now we’re hearing that post-Brexit trade with the EU is down by a third, low-paid workers who saw us through the pandemic face wage cuts, and the poorest schoolkids will fall a year behind in their education. But what’s that compared to wetting our knickers over a pair of spoiled rich kids pleading they’ve been left destitute in a Calornian mansion with only a multimillion pound inheritance and an in tray full of lucrative media deals to live on  Who cares about record use of foodbanks when they can listen to true patriots like Nigel Farage tell Americans there’s not a scintilla of racism at the top of the British state. That’s despite the current Prime Minister once writing that the Queen “has come to love the Commonwealth, partly because it supplies her with regular cheering crowds of flag-waving piccaninnies”.

Jonathan Cooper, owner of Coopers Chemists in Mr Sunak’s Richmond constituency, said: “Had community pharmacies not worked so hard to keep their doors open during this national crisis, things would have been far worse. “As a result we have incurred massive extra costs and the government needs to cover this as promised. “We want to give a message to Mr Sunak: our door is open – please let us keep it that way by reversing these devastating cuts.”  Anil Sharma, owner of Lords Pharmacy in Newmarket, in Mr Hancock’s constituency, said: “We opened our doors and put ourselves at risk to help people while most other services were shut. “We said no to no one.” He appealed to ministers to give pharmacies a fair deal, adding: “We are not asking to be rewarded more than anyone .”  Some % of independent chemists could be losing money by , according to a study by accountancy firm Ernst  Young in September. It also found that community pharmacists are underfunded by £ million a year.

Royston Smith, the MP for Southampton Itchen, registered a claim to pay for car parking during a food bank visit in November last year, according to official records. The same month local media reported he had visited Southampton’s Kingsland Community Centre food bank. He later said he had thoroughly enjoyed the visit, saying he had been able to watch first-hand how the excellent volunteers are looking after those less fortunate. Labour ’s Andrew Gwynne said: “Food banks are one of the ultimate symbols of a decade of Tory failure.“But it takes a special sort of callousness to visit one then charge taxpayers for your parking. And Dr Alan Whitehead, the Labour MP for neighbouring Southampton Test, said: Whilst itaposs up to MPs what they claim for within the rules, car travel and parking around the constituency isnapost something I currently claim for. And doing so isnapost usually at the forefront of my mind after getting to see the great work that local foodbanks and charities are doing to support residents. Food banks in Southampton reported “unprecedented” demand in the run up to Christmas, as the Covid- led to more hardship than ever. In the South East alone, the Trussell Trust handed out , food parcels between April and September. Kingsland Community Centre, the ‘pop up’ food bank visited by Mr Smith said they had helped  families across four sessions in October. And as many as  new people were queuing up every time they opened their doors. A month before his visit, Mr Smith opposed a bid to force the Government to extend free school meals to be extended until Easter. He said a vote on the issue was a “politically motivated stunt.” On top of his £, salary as an MP, Mr Smith is paid £, a year for  hours work a month of consultancy services for Barker-Mill Estates, a property firm in Southampton. He spent £,. on expenses during the - financial year, including £,. on office running costs in -, £,. on staff wages and £,. on other office expenditures. He spent £,. of his accommodation budget of £,, and a further £,. on travel and subsistence. Yet his total claims were slightly below the national average for MPs expenses of £,. A former Southampton councillor, Mr Smith was elected to the Itchen constituency in . Kim Rose, his Ukip rival in that election, claimed Mr Smith had handed him an envelope marked “confidential” ahead of the election, which contained data to help him target Labour voters. Mr Smith denied passing on private details of voters - and Mr Rose’s claim that he had handed him a “racist leaflet” to use in the campaign. But he admitted giving him information on wards and votes at previous elections that was accessible to any candidate. Police investigated the claims, but no charges were brought. Mr Rose secured more than , votes in the  election, , more than Ukip got in . Mr Smith won by , votes. In , he held on to the seat by just  votes, making his the narrowest Tory marginal in the country.But in  he increased his majority to , after the Brexit Party stood down plans to stand against him.During the campaign, Mr Smith said he was “content” to hear Nigel Farage’s former party weren’t standing against him."},{"url":null,"title":"banksy sneezing woman torn side","story":"NewsBanksy of sneezing woman torn off side of house with huge crane after home soldThe Aachoo mural was painted on the home on the famously steep Vale Street in Bristol in December - but now it appears to be being taken awaymirrorShareCommentsByConor GogartyDanya BazaraaSenior News Reporter:,  MAR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video scene-crane-operation-totterdown-banksy-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

Campaigners warned it is not only an eyesore and a danger to motorists and road cleaners but also a threat to species such as shrews, voles, wood mice – a vital food source for birds of prey. On Tuesday the Mirror’s environment editor took to the verges of the A on the outskirts of Brighton, on the border between East and West Sussex. Although it passes through some of England’s most scenic landscapes, it is one Britain’s filthiest roads. What is your view  Have your say in the comments section In the space of  minutes, she collected five bin bags full of cans, coffee cups, bottles, sweet and crisp wrappers and cigarette packets. Discarded shoes, polystyrene and plastic sheeting were also found. Residents set up a campaign group two years ago to get authorities to tackle the mess. Until now problems with enforcement have meant few offenders are punished. On motorways, campaigners say it is almost impossible to be fined unless a motorist drops litter in sight of police. Highways England and councils are responsible for cleaning up our main routes but some rubbish found by volunteers is more than  years old due to the dficulty of arranging litter picks.  Next month, Maidstone in Kent will use LitterCam CCTV, a new scheme to fine motorists throwing litter. Penalties will start at £ and rise to £unpaid after  days. The maximum on-the-spot fine in England is £.  LitterCam boss Andrew Kemp also aims to start trials in Wigan, Lancs, and Sheffield, Yorks. Allison Ogden-Newton, head of Keep Britain Tidy, wants littering drivers to get heftier fines and three penalty points. Supporting the trial in Maidstone, she said: “Roadside verges are a haven for wildle but every year millions of shrews, bank voles and wood mice are killed when trapped in drinks bottles.”  Crispin Truman, head of CPRE, the countryside charity, added: “We need a wholesale sht in how packaging is designed, used and recycled to help prevent littering in the first place.” Britain’s dirtiest roadsThe A The A The A The A The AFind out the number of fly-tipping incidents in your area You can seethe number of fly-tipping incidents has been rising in your area using our interactive, along with how that compares to the national picture, and the types of waste being dumped.

The campaign is aimed at rallying society to encourage girls to stay in sports because the benefits of their participation go far beyond the field or court. Figures show  per cent of teenage girls are feeling more anxious about their future than they did before the pandemic. And research of , girls aged - revealed sports participation can help change that, with  per cent of girls currently playing sport saying it has helped them feel more confident about their future development. The study, commissioned by Always, found the benefits for girls in sports go far beyond the cheers and the wins. What is your view  Have your say in the comments section Women polled who played sports during puberty say doing so helped them build skills such as learning how to work as a teamand developing self-esteemwhich have benefitted them in adult le. In addition to participating in regular exercise and having fun, sports helped them develop important le skills including learning how to win and lose , persevereand become a better communicator . Another quarter also believed sports helped their mental health. Rachel Riley, speaking on behalf of Always which has teamed up with Sported, the UKaposs largest community sporting network, said: I played so many dferent sports at school, from hurdles to football and the skills I learned helped me in so many ways.

The biggest impact sport had was on my confidence, especially as a teen - it taught me to be more vocal and encouraged me to take the lead and this is something that has stayed with me in my adult le. Iaposm really passionate about this partnership because I believe that playing sport has many unexpected benefits, including being able to build relationships with team members, improving communication skills and most of all, it really boosts confidence. And as someone who has reaped the rewards of staying in sports when I was younger, I really want to make sure that girls are encouraged to do the same because sport can help fuel girlsapos futures. However, despite all the value sports participation provides, nearly one in three girls will drop out of sports during puberty, because they either donapost think theyaposre good enoughor donapost feel encouraged to keep playing . The survey via OnePoll also found that half of women who dropped out of sports as teens wish they had continued to play.With sports looking a little dferent right now, even more support and encouragement is needed.In fact,  per cent of girls want more support to keep them involved in sports.Sported, the UKaposs largest network of community sports groups, reported that  per cent of community groups are not sure that their participants willin the future. Always will be donating to Sported to help hire youth centre spaces and equipment to ensure the organisation is equipped to support participants once lockdown eases.  To help show the nation that the value of sports extends beyond the field, a video has been created showing the unexpected ways sports can transform her future. The content showcases Rachel, the UKaposs youngest female pilot, Ellie Carter and COVID st responder, Ellie Pantlin, who all credit sports as a key enabler of their success.Successful social enterprise CEO Dr Anne-Marie Imafidon MBE also features as part of the campaign and credits her learnings from playing netball in her younger years as part of her success today.Anne-Marie said: What I most enjoy is seeing a direct impact as a result of my efforts."},{"url":null,"title":"couple save thousands renovating dated","story":"NewsCouple save thousands by renovating dated home - and makeover ups value by £kA couple who had little DIY experience have shared how they managed to save money by renovating their dated period property predominantly on their own - and their work has increased the homes valuemirrorShareCommentsByCourtney PochinAudience WriterRia Newman:,  MAR NewsAbbie and Mark working on their home \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

But one couple decided to give it a go anyway in the hopes theyaposd save some money, even though they had very little renovation experience between them. And not only did they manage to save thousands - they also added £, onto the value of their property. Abbie Mottershead, , and partner Mark Moloney, , from Staffordshire, purchased a s semi-detached home in June  for £,. They felt the place was extremely tired and needed a modern makeover, so for the past two years, theyaposve been transforming the three-bedroom house. The couple completed the majority of the work by themselves – including levelling the floors, fitting the kitchen, tiling and decorating – and only hired builders for the structural work and an electrician for a new fuse board.Doing it this way meant they were able to keep costs down and Abbie estimates they saved around £, by tiling the floor without any professional help and a further £, on on plumbing costs by plumbing the radiators and taps. They also saved money by doing all the decorating themselves, giving every wall and ceiling a fresh coat of paint. And when it comes to their new kitchen-diner, experts quoted them £, to £, to fit it all - another expense they decided to forgo. In total, the couple have spent £, doing up the property – with all but £, of the money going to the gruelling kitchen renovation, which involved knocking down several walls and five moths of work.  Before the kitchen was touched, they had the house valued at £, – but they now believe the kitchen will add another £, to the property. Speaking to Jam Press, Abbie who works as a childrenaposs nursing sister, said: We were attracted to the house because of its original features, high ceilings and big room sizes, but it was very dated and didn’t suit our needs with a narrow galley kitchen that was poorly designed and impractical. The whole house was very dirty and extremely tired. The goal for the house was to do it up for us to live in for a few years and be able to grow into. We wanted to do it to a high standard and take our time to allow us to save the money we needed for the renovation, doing one room at a time. The house now features three bedrooms, one bathroom, a large kitchen-diner and large living room-music room. The property has been freshly decorated in stylish neutral tones throughout with black finishes.  Abbie continued to say: The hardest part was the kitchen – we had to live in lockdown without it for nearly five months as we did everything we physically could ourselves. Once the builders left, we had to sand down, plaster, paint, level the floor, plumb the radiators and tile sq m worth of kitchen floor with the most dficult pattern I could have chosen. “It took weeks to floor between my shts but it saved us a lot of money. Every tile company we spoke to told us we were brave doing it ourselves as it’s one of the most complicated designs. Towards the end we were struggling as I work -and-a-half-hour shts, so every day off was spent doing DIY and eating nothing but microwave meals.

Centuries ago we elevated those humans who were good at war, and today their descendants still rule over us although we now handle the battles ourselves. Andthey want to stay on that blood-stained pedestal, they need to deserve it.  So when the Duke and Duchess of Sussex said a member of the Royal Family inquired after their sonaposs skin colour, during debates about whether to give him a title or security, we wonderedthese higher-than-thous were pretty low. When Buckingham Palace didnapost comment for  hours, we became restless. And when a stf-backed Prince William declared we are very much not a racist family yesterday, there was relief he had deigned to mention it, although, to be fair, he didnapost really sell it.Which family was he talking about  His closest living relatives, the Windsors in general, or everyone going back to William the Conqueror, whose DNA is probably, by this point, distributed equally around the British Isles. The trouble with Williamaposs claim is that, whichever family heaposs talking about, there is racism. Quite a lot of it, in fact. And itaposs not out-of-context, reasonable-for-the-time racism. Itaposs eye-poppingly-bad-even-then-racism. Here are just a few examples.  . The time someone senior in Williamaposs immediate family repeatedly asked what colour his nephewaposs skin would be while discussing his security needs, and which he has yet to deny.. The time Prince William allegedly went to a party dressed as a gorilla, but couldnapost be clearly identied behind the mask, so pictures of Harry at the same party dressed as a Nazi caused a scandal instead.. The time his uncle Andrew left then-Home Secretary Jacqui Smith slack-jawed at a dinner for the Saudi royals by making racist comments about Arabs that were unbelievable... it involved a comment about camels. . The time that same uncle referred to the n***** in the woodpile to one of David Cameronaposs advisers, who was of Sri Lankan descent.. The time his grannyaposs uncle said Adolf Hitler was not a bad chap and taught three princesses to throw a Nazi salute, in the same year the Reichstag burned down, Hitler had seized power, the Gestapo was created, Dachau was built, and thousands of Britons protested against rabid anti-Semitism and persecution of Jews.. The time that same grannyaposs uncle ignored government advice to visit Nazi Germany, dined with Goering, Goebbels and Hess, take tea with Hitler, and gave a speech saying that what he had seen is a miracle one can only begin to understand it when one realizes that behind it all is one man and one will. - . The time the Queen Mother told a diarist during a drunken lunch beware the Blackamoors, the time she told a journalist she “had some reservations about Jews,” and the time she told a lady-in-waiting that the Africans just don’t know how to govern themselves…what a pity we’re not still looking after them.. The time Princess Michael of Kent wore priceless jewellery depicting an African slave kept as a domestic pet to the wider familyaposs first meeting with Meghan Markle.. The time the same princess told black New Yorkers to go back to the colonies and named two black sheep on her farm Venus and Serena. . The time Queen Victoria became close friends with an Indian Muslim, and her son Edward VII sacked him within hours of her funeral, had him deported, then ordered every record of their relationship to be destroyed.. The time the Royal Family set up the Royal African Company, of which Edward Colston was merely a shareholder and employee, and shipped more African slaves across the Atlantic than anyone .. The time that wealthy slave-owner, banker and MP George Smith became enormously wealthy, his granddaughter married the Earl of Strathmore, and her granddaughter Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon married a prince, became Queen, and on her death left most of her £m estate and fine art to the Royal Family. . The time she also left about £m each to Princes William and Harry, who have, presumably, happily lived off the profits of slavery ever since.Some of these have roots deep in the mists of time. Others are bang-up-to-date. And itaposs worth pointing out that Britain ended the slave trade, too, and freed those brought to its shores by Americans who held on to the nasty habit for decades longer. In  Prince Charles condemned the atrocity of slavery. Prince William has spoken about the horrors of racism in football. Princess Michael of Kent, Prince Harry, even Prince Philip, have apologised for what have become known as gaffes.And at the end of last year, the Historic Royal Palaces announced a review of their buildingsapos and contentsapos links to slavery, which will probably see a lot of heavy annotation in souvenir handbooks rather than having to lose, er, pretty much every palace and private home.

It was when the mum-of-three was standing over her sonaposs body in a street in Harlesden, north west London. Oliver Tetlow, , died after he was shot with a machine gun in a drive-by shooting as he waited outside a shop for his friend on March , . It was a horric case of mistaken identity that claimed Pamelaaposs innocent son - her only son. Tuesday marked the fth anniversary of his death and no one has ever been convicted of his killing. Sadly over those five years Pamela has been diagnosed with stage  breast cancer. Despite surgery and chemotherapy it has spread and she is now battling stage  liver cancer. The -year-old told the Mirror: I know exactly when I developed my cancer - it was when I saw Oliver dead on the street. I stood there and I felt a pain in my breast. That was the cancer. I refuse to let this cancer kill me because I want to get justice for my son. It is now five years since he died and his killers are still walking the streets. Before Pamela was given the devastating news that she had breast cancer, four men had been acquitted in court of killing her son in .  She had been forced to move from her home in Harlesden for own protection and was living in a hotel at the time. I didnapost want to move but since my son had been murdered I was told I must, she said. My son was waiting outside a shop for a friend when he was killed. He usually goes inside the shop andhe had he would still be alive. I have lost my only son and I canapost let this cancer kill me because I need to be alive to see the people who murdered him locked up. Pamela, who has two daughters and two grandchildren, had developed a persistent cough but thought it was a stubborn cold until she saw an advert on TV.  The stress of losing my only son put my body into shock, she said. I had surgery to remove my lymph nodes and had two rounds of chemotherapy but they have had to stop it because I was so stressed about his killers still walking freely in the street. I am taking chemotherapy tablets instead, I also suffer from lupus and have had a stroke so everyday I have to swallow a cocktail of medication to keep me alive. I also have to have an injection in my stomach every four weeks. Doctors had initially told Pamela she was cancer free after they removed her lymph nodes in March  but she said she knew something wasnapost right.  She said: Within weeks I started getting pain in my back, was nauseous and couldnapost stop vomiting so I knew the cancer was still there. I was told it was liver cancer and it was stage four. Doctors removed two tumours from Pamelaaposs liver and she is currently awaiting tests to seethe surgery has been a success. Once I beat this cancer I will concentrate wholly on finding my sonaposs killers, she said. The turmoil of losing her son and fighting cancer has taken a toil on Pamelaaposs mental health which culminated in a failed suicide bid. She said: First one cancer and then another - it just became too much for me.I felt like the devil was trying to stop me from getting justice for my son. I tried counselling but I found it made things worse but I am stronger now and am ready for whatever obstacles are thrown my way. As part of her mission to get justice for her son, Pamela plans to do a series of podcasts about the murder in the hope that witnesses will come forward. She said: My son was completely innocent and killed because he was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Itaposs now five years and people may be more willing to speak up. After the men were acquitted I was abandoned by the police as I have not heard a thing from them since so it is up to me to make sure people donapost forget about Oliver. I am begging anyone out there who knows who killed my son to speak up. They might have children themselves and need to think how would they feelthey lost the child the way I lost Oliver. Oliver was my only son. I will beat this cancer so I can justice for my only son. I want to be there in court when I see his killers jailed for taking away my boy.

After one of the most tumultuous weeks of recent royal history, the Queen showed it was business as usual following the fallout from the Oprah Winfrey interview with her grandson Harry and his we Meghan.In a video call with scientists, teachers and schoolchildren to mark British Science Week, the monarch spoke of the importance of technology in keeping people together as well as protecting us from coronavirus.The Queen showed events of the last week - where her family was accused of racism and abandoning Meghan while she was pregnant -  had not knocked her off her stride by cracking a joke when reminiscing about the time she met Yuri Gagarin, the first human to travel out into space. Asked by top British scientist Dr Aderin-Pocock: “Yuri Gagarin, the first human to travel out into space was also born on th March, and I believe ma’am that you met him - What was he like ” What is your view  Have your say in the comments section Her Majesty drew huge laughs from her virtual crowd when she abruptly replied: “Russian!”. The Queen quickly added: “He didn’t speak English. But no no, he was fascinating. “And I suppose, being the first one, it was particularly fascinating.” Prince William on Thursday became the first royal to tackle head on allegations of racism within his family, after his brother claimed a senior royal had questioned how “dark” his further children with Meghan may be, told reporters during a school visit: “We’re very much not a racist family.” The Queen has said they will privately deal with the raft of accusations by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex about their unhappiness during their time in The Firm and is expected to call Harry personally in the coming weeks. In her discussion with teachers and schoolchildren to mark British Science Week, to celebrate the role played in UK society by science, technology, engineering and maths , has highlighted probably the most essential fact when planning a trip into outer space - the importance of ing home. Dr Maggie Aderin-Pocock, a scientist and co-presenter on the BBC’s The Sky At Night programme, said of Gagarin: “It must have been very terrying to be the first one, and not really knowing what was going to happen.”  The Queen quipped: “Well, yes - andyou could come back again. That’s very important.” The -year-old monarch added: “This past year has really driven home the importance of science and technology in all of our lives, from the search for the vaccine, the rollout to the public, to the technology that enables all of us in dferent locations across the UK to gather and speak. STEM is very much a part of our lives.”  During the showcase, Her Majesty was also shown the latest updates from NASA’s Mars Perseverance mission, commenting how Red Planet looked “very rock strewn”. Meanwhile, The Duke of Edinburgh is likely to spend his fourth weekend in hospital as he continues to recover after treatment for a pre-existing heart condition. Philip underwent surgery on March , just three months before his th birthday, and is being cared for at the King Edward VII’s Hospital in central London.

Along with many practical considerations, the emotional toll it takes can be overwhelming, creating a sense of grief that can be painful to confront. “Your parents are the people who knew you first, they know your history, they know all the stories about you,” says Claire Hewson. “They love you unconditionally. “When they’re gone, when that’s gone, and they’re not around, it’s a struggle.” Coping can depend on many things. The support you have from those around you, and the plans already laid in place. “I was lucky. My mother was a fantastic organiser,” says Claire, , a call centre manager from London. “She organised her funeral with the local Co-op Funeralcare – her coffin, the car she wanted, and even the flowers she wanted. “All I had to do was the music. Everything  was arranged and paid for. I will always be grateful to my mum for doing that. I wouldn’t have known what to choose.” Coping with loss The last couple of years have been ‘challenging and horrible’ for Claire, who lost her father, Bob, to cancer in May , and her mum, Eileen, who died suddenly in June , whilst in hospital being treated for an ongoing liver issue. “It just felt like the rug had been pulled from underneath me. No-one tells you about death or what it feels like to lose someone. There’s still a stigma when it comes to talking about it.” And yet, while she lost them both within a short period, her experience with each was quite dferent. “Dad was in a hospice so we were going in every day, and the nurses were amazing, telling us what to look out for,” says Claire. “Every day we went in, not knowing ‘will it be today’ ” Claire was still coming to terms with losing her father when her mum died.  “It was dferent dealing with each death. With dad, it’s like I knew he was gone, I saw his body. Mum’s death was sudden, so I never got to say goodbye, and that really does mess with your brain, there’s no finality. Planning ahead The fact that her mum had sorted out her funeral was a blessing. “When my mum’s sister died it was traumatic for everyone trying to arrange the funeral and sort the money out. Mum saw this unfolding and didn’t want that for me. “She said she didn’t want me to have to worry about anything with her funeral. She went to Co-op Funeralcare and had a chat and chose what she wanted. She said they were very pleasant, and it was easy to do. “I will always be grateful to mum for that because I wasn’t in my right mind and I’d urge anybody to do that. It makes that part so much easier for those left behind. All I had to do was phone them up and give them her details and that was it. It took the pressure off, and people don’t always have the money.” "},{"url":null,"title":"sarah everard familys tribute shining","story":"NewsSarah Everard familys tribute to shining example as daughter taken from usSarah was last seen in Clapham, south London before disappearing, and politan Police officer Wayne Couzens has been arrested on suspicion of her kidnapping and murdermirrorShareByJonathan ColesReporter:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror incoming video sarah-everard-map-key-locations-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

Human remains were found in woodlands near Ashford, Kent last night after the marketing executive, , disappeared eight days ago. While formal identication awaits, Sarahaposs family said tonight: Our beautul daughter Sarah was taken from us and we are appealing for any information that will help to solve this terrible crime. Sarah was bright and beautul - a wonderful daughter and sister. She was kind and thoughtful, caring and dependable. She always put others first and had the most amazing sense of humour.  She was strong and principled and a shining example to us all. We are very proud of her and she brought so much joy to our lives. We would like to thank our friends and family for all their support during this awful time and we would especially like to thank Sarah’s friends who are working tirelessly to help. We are so grateful to the police and would like to thank them for all they are doing. We are now pleading for additional help from the public. Please come forward and speak to the policeyou have any information. No piece of information is too insignicant. Thank you.  A police officer arrested on suspicion of the kidnap and murder of Sarah has been further detained in custody, the Met said this evening. PC Wayne Couzens, , of the force, is being quizzed over her disappearance. He remains in custody at a London police station after an application to extend his detention was granted at Wimbledon Magistrates’ Court, the Met said. A woman aged in her s, who was arrested at the same time on suspicion of assisting an offender, has been released on bail toto a police station on a date in mid-April. Sarah’s family have been informed of these developments, the Met added. The family statement comes this evening after it emerged Couzens was rushed to hospital with a head injury. Scotland Yard said the suspect was injured in custody and taken for treatment before being ed. A statement said: The suspect was taken to a hospital for treatment to a head injury sustained while in custody.  He has since been discharged and ed to custody. We are not prepared to discuss further. Couzens was arrested on Tuesday night on suspicion of kidnap, before being rearrested yesterday on suspicion of murder. He is also being detained over a separate allegation of indecent exposure. It is claimed that CCTV footage from a passing bus led to his arrest, with another report claiming a car linked to the suspect was allegedly spotted on a motoristaposs dashcam. The serving cop - a member of the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command - is thought to have been off-duty when Sarah disappeared. Cressida Dick, the Metaposs Commissioner, announced the discovery of the human remains last night.

The Independent Office for Police Conductis looking into whether Met Police officers responded appropriately to the report of indecent exposure. It was one of five matters referred to the IOPC, which is carrying out its own probe alongside the Met investigation into Ms Everardaposs disappearance and suspected murder. Serving PC Wayne Couzens, a Met Police officer who protected diplomats and VIPs, was arrested on suspicion of abducting and murdering the -year-old marketing executive. He was also arrested on a separate allegation of indecent exposure after he was allegedly reported over an incident in a south London fast food restaurant on February . Do you know the takeaway where the incident allegedly occurred  Email webnews@mirror.  The alleged incident is said to have occurred three days before Ms Everard went missing while walking from a friendaposs house in Clapham, south London, to her home in Brixton at about .pm on March . It is claimed married dad-of-two Couzens, , finished a six-hour relief sht at the US Embassy in Nine Elms, south London, at pm on the night Ms Everard vanished. She left her friendaposs home at about pm and was last seen on a doorbell camera at about .pm as she walked towards her house in Brixton. It is understood Couzens, part of the Westminster-based Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command, was arrested at his home in Deal, Kent, late on Tuesday after ing from work in London.  Murder detectives have been granted more time to quiz Couzens. A woman in her s, who was arrested at the same address in Kent on suspicion of assisting an offender, has been released on bail until mid-April. These are the five matters which have been referred to the police watchdog. Alleged murder of Ms Everard One of the matters relates to the alleged murder of marketing executive Ms Everard, given that the person in custody is a serving police officer. Couzens, a former car mechanic, was an armed member with an elite unit that protects diplomats and VIPs. Police suspect Ms Everard was abducted and murdered by a stranger, and have had Couzens in custody since late Tuesday night. Human remains were found on Wednesday as police searched an abandoned golf and paintball centre near Ashford, Kent, some  miles from where Ms Everard was last seen alive.

Indecent exposure allegation Couzens was accused of exposing himself to a woman at a south London takeaway on February , three days before Ms Everard disappeared. The complaint itself is being investigated because the person accused is a police officer. How police handled that allegation A third matter relates to how two of Couzensapos Met Police colleagues handled the report of the alleged incident. It is said the incident was reported by staff and was captured on CCTV. Despite the allegation of indecent exposure, Couzens continued working until his arrest six days after Ms Everard was alleged abducted.  Staff reported it to police on the night, but it is said no action was taken in connection over the alleged incident, the Sun reported. Had Couzens been arrested on suspicion of indecent exposure, his firearm licence would have been revoked and he would not have been allowed to continue working. Former Met Police detective chief inspector Mick Neville said: He would have been suspended from duty and would have been at home. It is claimed the complaint had not reached command level and his colleagues are unlikely to have been aware of the allegation, the Daily Mail reported. Original reports of disappearance The fourth matter involves the way the Met Police handled the original reports of the disappearance of Ms Everard. She spoke to her boyfriend, Josh Lowth, on the phone shortly before she went missing near Poynders Gardens in Clapham at about .pm on March . Lambeth Police appealed for information from the public at .am on March , tweeting: We are increasingly concerned for the #missing Sarah Everard, , form Brixton. She was last seen on rd March in the area of Clapham Common.  Suspectaposs head injury The IOPC is also investigating how Couzens was injured in a cell at a police station in Wandsworth, where he was being monitored by CCTV. He received immediate first aid when he was found unconscious with a head injury, and taken to hospital for treatment. Couzens has since been discharged and ed to a police station. There is no suggestion anyone  was involved in the incident. What have the watchdog and police said  The IOPC said: The Independent Office for Police Conducthas started an independent investigation into whether politan Police Serviceofficers responded appropriately to a report of indecent exposure. The IOPC’s investigation follows a conduct referral from the MPS in relation to two officers, receivednight, which is linked to four other referrals. They are all connected to the arrest of a serving MPS officer on suspicion of kidnap, murder and a separate allegation of indecent exposure. Our investigation will look at the actions of the MPS after police received a report on  Februarythat a man had exposed himself at a fast food restaurant in South London. we determined that two conduct referrals relating to kidnap murder and indecent exposure allegations against the arrested officer should remain under local investigation by the force. We are still assessing a mandatory referral in relation to the actions of police after they received a report that Sarah Everard was missing. A fth mandatory referral was received from the MPSin relation to police contact with the arrested officer who was treated in hospital after sustaining a head injury while in custody yesterday afternoon. That referral is also being assessed to determine what further action may be required from us. The Met Police said in a statement: Following the arrest of a police officer, the politan Police Servicemade two referrals, one mandatory and one voluntary, to the Independent Office for Police Conduct .

Using a blank tag just under the display of Pringles, they wrote:  quid - youaposre having a bleedinapos laugh ainapost yer! and simply carrying on with their day.

within touching distance of their goal.With the three A’s coming up next – Arbroath, Ayr and then Alloa – this is an opportunity to get on that all-important run they’ve been craving at Dens Park all season.Some A-plus performances are demanded from the fans and no wonder.The squad most certainly has the quality to rattle up three victories in the space of a week.And what a boost that would be for the season, not to mention manager James McPake.Fans haven’t been slow to criticise McPake but that comes with the territory of being Dundee manager in the Championship.Between now and the end of the season is where he can turn that criticism around.In the past week, I’ve been accused by a Dundee fan of needing a reality check in saying on our podcast Twa Teams One Street that I still think the Dark Blues can win promotion this season.I always appreciate people taking the time to write in, eventhey don’t agree with me.But it won’t change my opinion that McPake can get this team going.I always remember Harry Redknapp being asked ‘what makes a good manager ’ a few years back.His answer: ‘Good players’.That’s where my belief comes from in this Dundee team.That faith hasn’t been proved correct as yet, however.I’m not for a second suggesting everything so far under the current Dens boss has been good, every decision correct or that mistakes haven’t been made.Dundee are underachieving right at this moment.However, there is plenty of time left still this season.It feels strange being in March but Dundee aren’t long past the halfway stage of their league season.They have  matches remaining.From the start of the season, second place would be an acceptable finish.Yes, they should be much closer to Hearts than they are but catching Robbie Neilson’s side has proved a tall order.That’s left them with second place to fight for.And, fair to say, that fight hasn’t gone well so far.But, from a Dundee point of view, all that matters is the destination, not the route you take.Ten games to take control of second place and build up some form for the play-offs.That starts with Arbroath on Saturday followed by Ayr and Alloa – an opportunity the Dark Blues must grab.The top six may now be – just about – beyond them but Dundee United can take plenty of heart from their performance at the weekend.By my sums, they need something like a - win over Aberdeen and both St Mirren and St Johnstone to lose their matches to get into the top half.Unlikely.However, that shouldn’t worry United fans too much.Coming up last season, even being within three points of the top six with a game to go before the split would’ve been welcomed with open arms at the start of the campaign.Barring a monumental collapse and sudden revival of the bottom sides, relegation isn’t really a concern either these days.That means Micky Mellon can start planning properly for next season.And Sunday’s draw with Celtic should fill the manager and fans with confidence for what could come in the future.Celtic might not be anywhere near their best and missed chances left, right and centre but United earned their point.And could easily have won it at the end, had the final ball been better on their numerous breakaways.They showed they can mix it with the top sides.Now they have a wee breather before taking on the Dons.Could be a new manager bounce by then at Aberdeen – all eyes will be on the New Firm Derby at Tannadice.Congratulations have to go to Rangers and their boss Steven Gerrard for a fine season after they were crowned champions.They have been a class above the rest all season – though the same can’t be said for the supporters who crowded Ibrox and George Square over the weekend.I’m no fan of the Gers but I was pleased to see my old pal Glen Kamara earn his first winner’s medal.Immediately it was clear he was a class act when he arrived at Dundee and was destined for big things.It’s just a shame the paths of Kamara and the Dark Blues have been so dferent. vw, px\"

occasions to be celebrated with cards, gts, hugs and even kisses.One milestone, though, whose passing brings only melancholy and frustration is the marking of a year since fans were at a football game in this part of Scotland.The turnstiles have not clicked, the pies have stayed unmunched and the referees have had slightly less abuse than normal.Boy, have we missed it all.Around . pm on Tuesday, March , , I sauntered up to the main entrance at Dens Park from my usual parking space near Radio Tay.By coincidence, I had also worked at what would turn out to be Dundee United#s final fixture of the campaign # the - draw with Partick Thistle at Tannadice on the previous Saturday.By then, there was awareness that a new virus – recently named Covid- # had made its way from China to other parts of the world, including Scotland.The first case here had been confirmed on March , when a patient was diagnosed after ing home to Tayside from Italy.However, we were all still working at our desks in the office, rather than occupying the couches and armchairs that have become home to so many backsides since.Masks were still things that were worn by bankrobbers, Joe Wicks was a place where you bought kitchens and the Grassy Beach path down at the Stannergate had yet to be walked by half the population of the city.Indeed, le was normal enough for , spectators to gather – not distanced, socially or otherwise # to watch Dundee play Ayr United on a freezing cold night.My match report made no mention of the health tsunami that was about to engulf Scottish football.Of more interest to me as a local hack was a good - victory for the Dark Blues.It read: “Goals from Kane Hemmings and Olly Crankshaw sent Dundee leaping over opponents Ayr into third place in the Championship.“Hemmings raced clear of the visitors’ defence as the game at Dens Park ticked into its th minute, shooting low into the net.“Substitute Crankshaw made sure with a goal two minutes into injury-time after he was found by Graham Dorrans’ cutback.“James McPake’s men have now gone six games undefeated – three wins and three draws – and are now tucked in behind Inverness Caley Thistle, who are four points ahead in second spot in the table.”None of us really thought it would be the last time fans would be in the stadium.Lockdown followed, as did a crazy summer in Scottish football, with Dundee at the heart of it all with their infamous yes no vote.Supporters’ absence has undoubtedly highlighted the privileged position of a football writer.No journalist covering the national game will have taken for granted their seat # complete with name tag and or tick sticker – while thousands around them remain empty.Being brutally honest, there have been some positives to the lack of crowds.There is the parking – no need to arrive at Celtic Park or Ibrox hours before kick-off – but even that brings with it a pang of guilt as you drive through empty streets that should be full of hustle and bustle.Also, we lucky few have been treated to the wonders of the touchline banter. This has given us all an insight into how managers conduct their players during matches, although some of the industrial language has left you wishing your mask could cover your ears as well as your nose and mouth.Interviews have changed, not for the better. Pre-match stuff is one over Zoom, while post-match has seen some players who normally talk in hushed tones become completely inaudible behind their face coverings.The wall table police tape between media and football folk doesn’t help but we all know why the barrier is there and accept it.There has been worth to the action that has taken place on the pitch this season and every official at every club deserves immense credit for making it possible.It just hasn’t been the same without the atmosphere created by people.The great Jock Stein said: “Without fans who pay at the turnstile, football is nothing.”The legendary manager was, of course, right to highlight how the game needs those who love it most.It is a diminished spectacle without them.The remarkable thing is, when the history books cover Scottish football during the Covid era, fans will still take pride of place.Tales will be told of season tickets bought with no hope of attending matches, modest bank accounts and piggy-banks raided to keep their club alive, and all manner of community and charitable good deeds done.This is not a happy anniversary we mark this week but,you can, try to imagine that first sight of the green grass when the doors finally reopen.It will seem like Christmas, holiday time and your birthday all rolled into one. vw, px\"  Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE

former Torry Academy, following a series of delays resulting from the coronavirus lockdown and issues relating to asbestos.The school, which closed in , has been slated for demolition for a number of years, with plans in place to turn the site into a community and education hub.Work to remove asbestos from the site stalled last year as the pandemic hit, and when workers ed to the site following the easing of restrictions, they discovered the efforts would take longer than expected.However, Torry and Ferryhill councillor Audrey Nicoll has confirmed that the demolition began this week.She said: #We#re glad that the demolition has now got under way, because we#re keen for the new primary school and the hub to be built as soon as possible, given the impact Covid has had on education over the year.#The demolition work is planned to have been completed by the end of May, with construction on the replacement beginning the following month.It is then hoped that the hub will open in .Mrs Nicoll added: #We know it#s been dficult, but the main thing is that we push on and get the whole project completed.#We want our local children to have a first-class school environment to pick up

admitted Covid- placed a huge burden on healthcare staff – but also led to “unimaginable” achievements in science and medicine.Noha El Sakka is the only consultant in virology in the region and was thrust onto the front line of the battle to control the pandemic as a result.She was responsible for testing the first suspected cases to arrive in the north-east last March at a time when there were few facilities in the area – and little was known about the disease.In a matter of months, however, the virology doctor – who is also an adviser to chief medical officer Gregor Smith – and her team had created two hubs capable of processing thousands of tests every day.“One of the good things from my view is that although it was a challenging experience, myself and the rest of the team all feel as though it’s something we won’t regret being at the centre of,” she said.“It’s been a very valuable experience. We all felt the burden on us, but it’s something we value being part of.“On the diagnostics side in the laboratory, we have done things we could never have expected. The number of samples we were testing and the turnaround time had never been done before, because we had never been in that situation. It was an eye-opener to what we can do.“Covid testing wasn’t here at first so we had to build that up. We brought in equipment from across the world and built up our lab to a signicant capacity – more than we could ever have imagined. We also built up the regional hub, which can now test more than , tests a day.“The fact NHS Grampian is now running two hubs which can test thousands and thousands of samples a day is totally unimaginable, andanyone had said we would be able to do that at the start I wouldn’t have believed them.“The steps that were taken were huge, in both our NHS lab and the regional hub. Being able to run two major hubs was a massive achievement and a success we are very proud of. That will stay with us for a long time.”Little more than a year after the virus first emerged, there are now several vaccines for it – something the virology doctor admits she didn’t think would be possible when the first cases were reported.“It’s beyond anyone’s expectation that we have vaccines, but it tells you a lot about the pressure of the situation,” she said.“When resources are all put in one direction with a combined effort, it shows how the unimaginable can happen. To be honest, I did not expect there to be a vaccine by the end of the year. It has never happened so quickly in the past and it tells you what was required – national direction, funding and scientic resources combined led to this.“Of course, money and funding had been put in place while all other activities had been stepped down, so there were many factors which helped, but it shows how even in a challenging situation we can come up with a positive outcome at the end.”Because of the improvements made and the lessons learned, the virology doctor believes NHS Grampian – and society as a whole – will be better placed to deal with future major health events such as Covid.“We have learned a lot from this outbreak, particularly around things like how to ramp up our skills and knowledge, who the key people are who can mobilise resources,” she added.“There is no such thing as impossible. If something like this happens in the future, we are in a far better position to be able to handle it from our experiences in the early stages. We will be starting further ahead than we did with this pandemic.”Coronavirus in Scotland – track the spread in these charts and maps\" title\"#Coronavirus in Scotland – track the spread in these charts and maps# # Evening Express\" src\"https:www.eveningexpress fp news specials coronavirus-in-scotland-track-the-spread-in-these-charts-and-maps embed # secretcGKzZfyEq\" data-secret\"cGKzZfyEq\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Covid vaccine in Scotland: Track the rollout progress with these charts\" title\"#Covid vaccine in Scotland: Track the rollout progress with these charts# # Evening Express\" src\"https:www.eveningexpress fp news specials covid-vaccine-in-scotland-track-the-rollout-progress-with-these-charts embed # secretlrgONMDNn\" data-secret\"lrgONMDNn\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. vw, px\"  "},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/03/2.58567215-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/03/2.58567215-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/03/2.58567215-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/03/2.58567215-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"pupils at aberdeen school self isolating after a positive covid case detected","story":"Pupils in a class at an Aberdeen school have been told to self-isolate after a positive case of coronavirus was identied.

He hopes for two fully funded sites from bidding port authorities, with Aberdeen seen by some as a frontrunner.Freeports are given special status and can defer paying tax until products are moved on.It’s understood the UK Government wants to keep the “freeports” name to maintain an internationally recognised title. There is also no assurance that as many as two ports will be awarded the status.McKee previously dismissed the UK policy but changed tack with a tailored proposal for Scotland.He wrote to Treasury secretary Steve Barclay this month, asking for assurances “green ports” will have access to the same level of set-up cash as locations already announced in England.McKee wrote: “I welcome that we are agreed on the importance of establishing an approach in Scotland that is fit for purpose.“The Scottish green port model achieves that, with its focus on sustainable, inclusive growth, fair work, and a just transition to net zero emissions, which I know is also a key objective of the UK Government, alongside the core objectives of the UK Government freeport policy around regeneration, innovation and trade.”However, with a reply still yet to be sent, it emerged signicant hurdles are yet to be cleared.A UK Government source said: “We are very pleased the Scottish Government have reversed their initial opposition to the concept of freeports and we want to work with them.#We are currently assessing how their proposals fit with our UK-wide vision for freeports and discussions on that continue between the two governments.#Butwe are not able to reach agreement on the details, we#ve been very clear that the UK Government will press ahead with rolling out the freeports programme to Scotland.#There is a huge amount of interest across Scotland and a massive potential boost to the Scottish economy.#For that reason, we want to move quickly.

In contrast, roads in other parts of Scotland have detailed works planned and money set aside to pay for them. After  years of failed attempts at a solution and six months after a major landslide, Argyll deserves better than a vague election promise to #enhance# the road.The only new ferries mentioned are two -metre ferries. These are the same two ferries that were promised in the  infrastructure plan, but still lie in a yard, years late and well over budget. Neither of these ferries is for Argyll and Bute. All we get is vague promises of a #long term plan and investment programme#.This so-called plan is a shocking neglect of Argyll and Bute.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal wardSir,The start of  is proving to be an acutely challenging time for people with cancer, the NHS and for cancer care. Indeed, it’s clear that this is the most worrying time in recent history to get a cancer diagnosis.At Macmillan, people are calling our support line every day to tell us about the heightened anxiety, loneliness and distress that they are feeling.On our support line – open seven days a week on     – specially trained nurses, counsellors and financial support advisors are available to help anyone affected by, or worried about, cancer. They can provide comprehensive information and advice, as well as emotional support, to help people with cancer cope with the additional strain of the coronavirus pandemic.We know doctors and nurses are working in unspeakably dficult conditions and are having to make tough decisions every day. Healthcare professionals are doing everything they can to keep cancer care on track, but we also know that some treatment – operations, for example – are being cancelled or postponed because essential services such as ITU are full of seriously ill people with Covid-.What is absolutely vital is thatthere are changes to treatment plans, these must involve the person living with cancer and be communicated clearly.Although some changes may be needed for treatment plans, this is not the case everywhere or for all treatments or tests. Healthcare professionals are doing everything they can to make hospitals a safe environment so it’s really important that people with cancer who have been invited for tests or treatment do attend.GPs are openyou are worried about possible cancer symptoms, and screening and other vital tests have resumed in a Covid-safe way. The NHS is still here for you.As well as our support line, comprehensive cancer information and support is also available on www.macmillan.org.uk and our online community is there to provide invaluable emotional and peer support.Gordon McLean, strategic partnership manager in Scotland for Macmillan Cancer SupportSir,Inclusion Scotland, the leading Scottish disabled people’s organisation, believes that planning for the post Covid- Scotland must be about building towards a more inclusive future for disabled people, not back to an old #normal# that excluded a lot of us.As we launch our manesto for the  Scottish Parliament elections, disabled people have told us about the problems they face daily, both before and as a result of Covid-, and what needs to change.Before Covid-, disabled people were already some of the most marginalised and excluded in society.We were more likely to live in poverty, be unemployed or earn less than non-disabled people, and less likely to leave school with qualications, because of the barriers and exclusion we face in our day-to-day lives.The Covid- crisis and responses to it highlighted this, aggravating existing inequalities and generating new ones, and putting the human rights of disabled people at further risk.Going back to the way things were before is not the answer. We don’t want to go back. We want to go forward to a more inclusive future.The manesto # Rights and Renewal # sets out what disabled people told Inclusion Scotland are the most important issues they face and what needs to be done to make a post-pandemic Scotland a better place for disabled people. It has five key asks:I call on all political parties fighting the Scottish Parliament elections and their candidates to pledge their support for disabled people’s Five Asks.Dr Sally Witcher, Inclusion Scotland chief executive officerSir,Our dilapidated roads continue to be raised as an issue by many constituents.While I understand that our roads department is struggling due to local authority budgets being cut, much more still needs to be done.It has been said to me time and time again that we are fast approaching the point of noand when it comes to our roads and that neglecting day-to-day maintenance will end up costing us more in the long run.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures february 12 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It was especially pleasing to see non-shinty players join our Strava group and help to get us to Barcelona and back.#The Camanachd Association also raised more than £ for the Scottish Association for Mental Heath through the event."},{"url":null,"title":"staying active while home schooling","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It therefore has a special responsibility to do all it can to advance the peace process.So, while calling for an end to violence, it is simultaneously supplying the weapons necessary to prolong the conflict.The shameful neglect of this leadership role and continued licensing of arms to facilitate Saudi-led offensives is unsustainable. It is a stance that leaves the UK increasingly isolated on the global stage, with countries including Germany, Italy and the Netherlands already banning the export of arms to Saudi Arabia.The UK government now faces a choice: to join President Biden and live up to its obligations as UN penholder by ending the UK’s involvement in the Saudi campaign, or to continue to act as both peacekeeper and warmonger, undermining any moral leadership it might claim.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,The SNP has voted to conceal Alex Salmond#s evidence to the parliamentary inquiry.The Scottish Conservatives brought a vote to the Salmond inquiry demanding that Salmond’s evidence, much of which is already in the public domain, be published.This would allow Salmond to give crucial evidence in person about the SNP#s botched handling of this case. All the SNP MSPs on the committee, however, voted against its publication, meaning it will not be released.The Scottish public deserves to know the truth of what happened and why £, of public money had to be paid to Salmond.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward.Sir,The personal testimony of the men and boys in the final independent report into non-recent sexual abuse in Scottish football # who have shown incredible courage # demonstrates how needed this independent review has been.The abuse young players have suffered in football is inexcusable and heart-breaking. By bravely speaking up, they provided the catalyst for the review and the changes that will come from it are thanks to them.We welcome the ongoing work the Scottish Football Associationhas carried out in light of the report’s recommendations and encourage them to continue their progress.The SFA is showing it is willing to listen and implement changes that ensure no more children suffer the experiences described in the report.We are pleased to see children and young people’s involvement in the process, including the consultation with the Scottish Children’s Parliament. The voices of children and young people are crucial to developing improvements for their own wellbeing and safety and to change a culture where children can be frightened to speak up.Safeguarding in Sport, a partnership between Children st and sportscotland, has developed the Standards for Child Wellbeing and Protection in Sport, which state children have a right to express their views and have their voice taken into account. We are keen to support the SFA in its continued implementation of the recommendations to create a culture in football where we can be sure that every child is safe to enjoy the huge benefits of participating in sport.Any volunteer or official looking for advice or support about a child can contact safeguardinginsport@childrenst.org.uk or contact the Children st Parentline service on   or online at www.childrenst.org.uk parentline.Mary Glasgow, chief executive, Children st.Sir,Zero Waste Scotland’s Energy Efficiency Business Support Service provides free, independent advice to Small and Medium-Sized Enterprisesto introduce more energy efficient technology.Businesses can apply for an interest-free Scottish Government SME loan of £, to £,, with a maximum cashback grant of £, for those eligible.Many businesses in Argyll and Bute have decided to take action to reduce their energy use, adding profit directly to the bottom line while helping Scotland meet its target to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by .Since , the impartial advice given to companies in the region has identied almost £m of potential energy savings through heating, lighting and building upgrades.To find out more or to apply, visit www.energy.zerowastescotland.org.uk.

Options! There is only one possible and that should be obvious.When I first moved to Argyll, driving through Glen Croe was a beautul feeling that I had left the urban areas behind and come out into fresh country. No longer # it is a disaster zone and will remain so for a number of years, and possibly decades,a new  safe road is not built.With the elections in May for the Scottish Government, we should be calling on our  politicians to deliver a suitable road through Glen Croe and to do it soon, not  years  away with no firm plans to do it even then. Our politicians are in hiding and it is time they should deliver.The option should be for a new safe road well away from any landslide so that we, the inhabitants of Argyll, can get back to some normal le.Derrick Anstee, InveraraySir,The neglect of the A is a disgrace.It’s not just the long detour via Crianlarich when it rains heavily, it’s the potholes and ruts when we get a spell of cold weather.Three years ago we had a cold winter and the A became a dirt track. Emergency repairs had to be carried out. The Scottish Government said they’d solved the problem. Now we have another cold winter, and again emergency repairs are needed.Other trunk roads in Scotland don’t get closed when it rains or get all these ruts and potholes in a cold winter.We need serious money invested now to solve the A problems. Yet all we get from the Scottish Government is waffle about y public inquiries.We need money and action now to make the A as reliable as Scotland’s other trunk roads, not more cheap solutions.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal wardMr Reid is the LibDem candidate for May#s Scottish parliamentary electionSir,With reference to theto school, I do hope that the pupils in Lochgilphead Joint Campus are kept in at lunchtime instead of being allowed to roam the streets like herds of wildebeast, with absolutely no social distancing or the wearing of masks.There is a perfectly good ing canteen restaurant in the school and or packed lunches.There is no need, at this time, for them all to be out and crowding supermarkets, fast food shops, cafes and chippies.This needs to be addressed by the Argyll and Bute education department as soon as possible.Name and address suppliedSir,In a leaflet delivered to every home in the Argyll and Bute constituency, Conservative MSP Donald Cameron claims that the #UK Governmentannounced the Argyll and Bute Rural Growth Deal worth £ million# and goes on to say that he is working with local councillors #including Alastair Redman# to #see what further action is needed#.The Rural Growth Deal, however, is a joint project involving £ million from the Scottish Government and a matched sum from the UK Government as well as more than £ million from other sources.In addition the deal has its origins in discussions between the Argyll and Bute MSP Michael Russell, then Scottish Government Finance Secretary John Swinney and the former leader of Argyll and Bute Council, Dick Walsh, in February . The UK Government only became involved some years later.This would be a very serious attempt at disinformation were it not so ludicrously self-defeating. Mr Cameron is standing to be a member of the Scottish Parliament yet he is trying to airbrush out anything Scottish about the largest investment ever in Argyll and Bute and its future.I hope it is merely ignorance of what has happened here that has led him to so severely misrepresent the truth of the issue, becauseit is political spin then he needs to apologise and withdraw the leaflet.Being pictured next to Alastair Redman won#t help him either, given that Mr Redman is best known for his regular letters to local papers attacking the very Scottish Government that is putting an extra £ million into this area.The Scottish Tories need to decide who they are working for # Boris Johnson in London, or the people of Scotland.Until Mr Cameron sorts his loyalties out, then he can#t be regarded as any sort of contender for the privilege of representing the people of Argyll and Bute.Michael Russell MSPSir,The SNP has committed £, to prepare for a second referendum within the next year.Instead of being focused on Scotland’s vaccination programme and protecting people’s jobs, the SNP’s priority is holding another isive referendum as early as this year.Setting aside this vast sum of money to help preparations for a referendum shows the SNP’s commitment toScotland to the politics of ision all over again.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward"},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 20 the final tee","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The conversations, Kaya hopes, will feel like the discussion that would usually evolve over a cup of tea or an evening pint.Kaya, who begins her residency this month, will record the conversations which will be stitched together as a sound-based artwork called Milk + Two Sugars which will eventually be exhibited on the island for local audiences to engage with and listen to.Over the last few weeks, invitations have been extended to the local residentsin the communities of The Bush and Ballochgoy. To take part they need only call   armed with a ‘cuppa’ of their choosing.The phoneline will be open to two people per day between am-pm on Thursday March  and Friday th, Thursday March  and Friday th. An answer phone message will be available in between times for people to register their interest in taking part.Kaya, who graduated from Duncan of Jordanstone in  with BA Hons First Class in Art and Philosophy in , said: #I begin this residency with a strong nostalgic feeling of connection to Rothesay even though only knowing it through family anecdotes of holidays there. I hope this residency extends these memories into my own stories of the people and stories I come to meet.#With Milk + Two Sugars, I aim to extend these connections beyond a screen and focus on the house phone as my source of extension. I anticipate these oral histories will create an enticing sound landscape reverberated in public spaces for the very community that it captures. The work will also be available to call and hear via a phone number—extending off the island the essence of Bute, those who call it home.#The residency, now in its third iteration, creating an opportunity for emerging artists, whose practice is rooted in social engagement.The Contemporary Visual Art Programme is led by Sophie Crichton-Stuart and curated by Morven Gregor."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures february 26 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Not before time.I was supportive of the mitigation plan, using nets and catch pits, as the simplest and least expensive approach. It was certainly worth a try, but it is abundantly clear now # with reputedly £ million spent # that it is not working.The , tonnes or more poised to come down on the road may well be an underestimate, and recent closures of the OMR, despite the new bund, doesn’t say very much for the efficacy of the protection. So we need an alternative, and we need it soon, not  years away.Talk of #alternative traffic corridors# is just a distraction.There may well be a case for a bridge-and-tunnel approach. Such has been successful in Norway and # notably # both in Iceland and Faroe Islands, which have much smaller resource bases than Norway. But these would be long-term schemes, each requiring the completion of several major interlinked crossings, for the like of which Scotland’s roads authority has hitherto shown neither interest nor aptitude.The problem at the Rest is a local one which requires a local solution. It’s only a mile or so of road which is at issue there.The alternatives, realistically, boil down to three:Overhead protection might well be required over quite a long distance, as it’s not just the bit at the catch pits which is threatened. The slopes of the Cobbler have experienced slides too. Since the hillside ies it might not be possible to use standard prefabricated modules, and in any case installation work would close the A for some time.A tunnel through to Butterbridge could be driven quite quickly # particularlythe Norwegians did it # but the approach in upper Glen Croe would require protection just like the OMR. Sir William Lithgow’s proposal mentions this, but construction would also almost certainly close the OMR, leaving no ersion for that period.The construction of a new alignment up the south west side of the glen, however, either on or roughly parallel to the existing forestry road, would avoid interference with through traffic.Both the gradient and the transverse slope would be substantially similar to those of the existing A, though thewould be marginally greater, which is probably why the north east side was chosen when the #new# A was built.The core of the case for the third option, however, is that the south west side of the glen has experienced far less erosion, both historically and in recent years, than the north east one.Stand at the upper viewpoint, or better still a little way along the Lochgoilhead road, and look around. The slopes of Ben Luibhean on which the A runs show far more watercourses and gullies than any of the others in the vicinity.This indicates a lot more rainfall impacting that slope, probably by the prevailing weather being funnelled on to it through the pass at the top of Glen More. And that weather is becoming worse.There have been no major slips over the forestry road in recent years, despite a spate of them on the opposite slope. It may just be the trees. I don’t think so, but in any case the trees are there, while it would take some years for tree cover to established above the A.Going back a lot further in time, the pattern is the same. The burn in the floor of upper Glen Croe has been pushed, over the centuries, by slip debris coming down from the north east slope, and the depth of that debris can easily be seen in the gullies recently carved in it behind the new bund.There is also a fair number of impressively-sized boulders on the lower slopes on that side, which at some point rolled down the hillside. Some of these came from the Cobbler, and although most are below the road a few are not. There is nothing to say that more will not arrive.A further point is that while the lower slopes on each side of the upper glen are similar, those on the south west side ease off towards the top, while those on the NE slope do not.It is on these upper slopes that the small slips develop which can pick up more and more water and debris on their way down, hence the fan shape of the typical slip. There is, in other words, a lot less potential for the initiation of slips on the south west side.I think that this all points to the need for a serious look at the forestry road, and I fail to understand why the investigations a few years ago dismissed it as a viable alternative.It’s the existing A which isn’t viable. And why any of these solutions would take  years to complete also beats me. Local objections  There is only one house in upper Glen Croe, and in the rest of Argyll I have yet to meet anyone who doesn’t want a permanent solution.My suspicion is that the biggest dficulty is that Transport Scotland can’t yet find a way to explain how £ million could be spent to such little effect. I might, of course, be wrong in all this, but I wait to be convinced of it.Arthur Blue, ArdrishaigSir,Since the temporary repairs to the Rest are clearly getting nowhere and costing money into the bargain, I would like to suggest a radical solution to the problem, and that is to build a viaduct right down the centre of the valley, based on the design of the MillauFor those not familiar with this structure, it is well worth an internet search. I believe this is still the world#s tallest bridge and is a really beautul structure.Seen from a distance, the white deck and piers look quite unreal # moreBefore anyone asks where that sum of money is to be found, I would point out that Boris Johnson#s proposed tunnel to Northern Ireland may cost between £ billion and £ billion # nobody knows because it hasn#t been designed yet. Nevertheless, Alister Jack is extremely enthusiastic about the proposal, so clearly money is not a problem.Not only would this new viaduct solve the problem once and for all, I suspect that, like the Millau Viaduct, it would become a much-photographed tourist attraction.John McCall, LochgilpheadSir,In last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser, Councillor Alastair Redman criticises the SNP for setting aside £, of its own money to campaign for an independent Scotland.Not surprisingly, he fails to enlighten us as to the costs of  the Tory party#s #Union Unit# set up by the Prime Minister at the taxpayers# expense.David Hay, MinardSir,Due to the speed with which the NHS is carrying out its vaccination programme, there is hope that we can soon all get out again andto normal.We still, however, face huge challenges. The economy has suffered. The NHS faces a big backlog of cancelled operations. Our young people have a lot of schooling to catch up on. We don’t have much time left to stop our climate changing before it is too late.Here in Argyll the Scottish Government must rise to the challenge of building a permanent solution at the Rest and Be Thankful.These must be our priorities. We can’t afford to spend the next few years arguing over independence. That’s an unnecessary distraction.We need a needle-sharp focus on the recovery without the distraction of another isive referendum.Put recovery first.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal wardMr Reid is the Argyll and Bute LibDem candidate for May#s Scottish parliamentary election"},{"url":null,"title":"look out for nuthatches in argyll this spring","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Without this investment, said the authority, there would have been a signicant deterioration in condition.Councillor Robin Currie, leader of the council, said: #We accept that many of our roads are in a bad way and we have listened to our communities.#This was reflected in our budget decision and as a priority we are putting as much resource as is possible into addressing the situation.

The vaccination process carried out with great economy and efficiency # and entirely painlessly so that we really will have to stop calling it #the jag#.The real bonus was the warmth and good humour from everyone involved that made the whole process welcoming, so that you left with a smile on your face. Only after the event do you realise what a tremendous team effort it was from everyone involved and all of them deserve our thanks.I hope very much that the Mid Argyll area makes a near  per cent response to the vaccination invitation, because that is what this effort deserves and will demonstrate to those involved the very real, genuine appreciation we have for their work during the pandemic.Norman Rea, Kintallen, TayvallichSir,The rank hypocrisy of the Scottish Tories knows no bounds.While they are frothing at the mouth that the first minister should resign over allegedly misleading the Scottish Parliament, at the same time Prime Minister Johnson was proven to have deliberately misled the Westminster parliament.Standing up in the House of Commons, Mr Johnson stated that all Covid-related contracts were #on the record#.This was three days after the High Court ruled the government had acted unlawfully by failing to publish hundreds of such contracts, which somehow seemed to find their way to those with Tory party connections.Two weeks prior to this, the Health Minister Matt Hancock was found guilty of illegal activity by the High Court, refusing to resign or even apologise when the extent of illegal awarding of PPE contracts was revealed.Last year Tory Home Secretary Priti Patel was found guilty of breaching the ministerial code by being a bully and shouting and swearing at civil servant employees in the Home Office, recently reaching a £, settlement with the former Home Office Permanent Secretary.Compare and contrast that with north of the border, where the Tory party has demanded the resignation of the first minister even before the outcome of the enquiries into the handling of the Alex Salmond case by the Scottish Government has been published.Not a cheep from them demanding an apology, let alone a resignation, for the flagrant abuses by their Westminster colleagues.

In addition, I am a Walk It leader in Earlston.As a member of the community, contributor to and consumer of council services one of my priorities will be to challenge how and why vital decisions on the use of finance and resource, which affect us all, are made.I, and many people I have spoken to, are concerned about planning processes.Permission is granted for large residential and other developments, often in questionable locations, seemingly without consideration of or investment in, the vital infrastructure required to support them.As is now evident, existing services are already stretched to capacity or facing cutbacks, including the NHS, education, social work, water etc. yet more extensive building is planned in the ward.How, for example, was the land at Melrose Gait considered a suitable location for a large residential development next to the refuse centre, on polluted ground, with an inadequate road to serve it.What consideration was given to the additional demands on the wider range of public services needed to support this scheme and its hundreds of residents.The COVID pandemic has most likely changed the way we live long term, people are now working from home, many permanently.Investment is needed in reliable broadband and mobile phone coverage, particularly in rural areas where signals can be unreliable, to support this new way of working.Existing offices, shops and other buildings that may become empty as a result of the pandemic could be repurposed for residential use, with careful planning.As we move forward the COVID Pandemic has made the most effective use of limited resources even more essential in the short and long term.The Borders must emerge from the pandemic in the strongest possible shape to best support the community and businesses into the future.I have no affiliation to any political party. I have always voted for who I believe can make a dference and contribute to local services.I believe that with my experience in public services and a knowledge of the local community I can help provide a focus for the council on the issues and problems that are faced day to day by the people of the Borders.Jenny Linehan Jenny LinehanMy professional le as both a former procurator fiscal and local solicitor taught me two things: speak plainly and never try to second guess the lives of others.Convincing you of my credentials to be your Scottish Conservative councillor for Leaderdale and Melrose is, therefore, a straightforward proposition for me: I will practice honest politics I will do my best to find out what it is that you most care about and fight your corner.Having lived in the ward for  years, I know how strong and ied our local Bordersrsquo economy is.We are lucky in Leaderdale and Melrose to have some of the best high streets in Scotland but they are under threat.I know the value of small business to our economy whether itrsquos standing up for farmers in Blainslie or supporting hotels in Melrose, to helping new businesses set up in Tweedbank.I will work tirelessly to ensure they receive the support they need.As this goes to print, the Scottish Conservatives have successfully pushed the SNP into a U-turn on extending business rates relief.Thatrsquos the kind of action I want to see from our government, not the dither and delay that wersquove seen from the SNP that threatens livelihoods and stles local enterprise.The challenge isnrsquot just to our economy. COVID- has been tough on all of us.With a vaccine on the way there is light at the end of the tunnel. Our NHS staff at the BGH have been fantastic.I would like to thank them for all the work they are doing to keep Borderers safe and healthy.As the mother of three children, education is another priority for me. Our teachers in the Borders have done an excellent job in dficult circumstances but the reality is they are being let down by the SNP government in Edinburgh, who would rather focus on independence than the future wellbeing of the next generation of Scots.I believe that education should be our priority, not further constitutional ision.I will work with our fantastic Scottish Conservative team on the council to make sure Borders schools get their fair share.Michael Needham Michael NeedhamMichael joined the Scottish Green Party several years ago after reflecting on a future with the impact of climate change, war, nuclear and pollution as key national and global concerns.Locally, however, the immediate priority is helping the Leaderdale and Melrose community to a Green recovery following the impacts of COVID- and considering how the new normal should develop.Scottish Borders Green Party welcomes the climate emergency declaration and Michael would push the local council into changing the words of the announcement into actions.Having studied the local development plan, Michael aims to drive environmental change with new builds utilising low carbon heating systems such as heat pumps, regulation has delayed mandatory use of these systems until  but we should show the carbon zero ambitions in the Borders together with improved local authority provision of electric vehicle charging facilities.With a greater gap between income levels and rental   house prices and a lack of affordable housing within the Leaderdale and Melrose areas, itrsquos vital that any new developments at least complies with the minimum provisions agreed for low cost housing.Michael would also aim to protect and improve local bus and train services throughout the Borders and ensure that the operators continue to work towards restoring timetables following the restrictions.The Scottish Green Party was responsible for changes within the Scottish Government that will mean under s will soon get free bus travel throughout Scotland.Other key local issues are: saving the high street with a shop local campaign, unemployment, which has always been more challenging in the Borders, together with people typically earning lower wages.Michael is from Galashiels, has lived most of his le in the Borders and works in the contact centre industry he is currently working from home and is acting co-lead GMB union rep and has been involved in national campaigning to make firing people to re-hire on lesser terms and conditions illegal.Michael is a disability champion within the global organisation he works for and is involved in union policy change and disability discrimination.John Paton Day John Paton DayLeaderdale  Melrose is the jewel in the crown of the Scottish Borders.Then, I may be biased, having lived, worked and raised my family here for the last  years.I have dedicated myself to standing up for numerous grassroots and vital voluntary causes that are close to the hearts of so many in our community.From co-founding the lsquoBorders Small Schools Networkrsquo to chairing Earlston Community Council, I am proud to serve those who call Leaderdale  Melrose home.Itrsquos important that our representatives within Scottish Borders Council understand the needs of local people.It is for this reason that I highlight the following three issues, on which I am seeking your vote next month.The first issue is roads.After yet another cold and wet winter our local roads require urgent repair and improvement ndash and this is not just dealing with potholes: we need to ensure all those using those roads can do so in the safest manner possible.Next is rural housing. As a committee member of Scottish Borders Housing Association, I am ready and able to hold to account those in charge of building affordable housing.I will call for increased investment to speed up the delivery of warmer, safer homes for all.And finally, recycling.Itrsquos vital we are able to do our bit to protect the environment and leave our Borders beautul for the next generation to enjoy however, many of our smaller villages are currently without facilities that make everyday recycling accessible.Itrsquos for this reason I will be seeking greater provision of recycling points that are accessible to all our towns and villages.Last, but by no means least, many of you will be familiar with the hard work and dedication of our much-missed colleague, Councillor Kevin Drum.When Kevin passed away last March after a short illness his loss was felt by so many in our community.Retaining this seat for the SNP will enable me to pick up where Kevin left off continuing his legacy of putting others first and helping to build a better Borders for all.Scott Redpath Scott RedpathThe impact of COVID over the last year has shown us the importance of working together and proved beyond doubt that it is through collective action, rather than constitutional arguments, that we can best face up to the great challenges of our times.I am neither unionist nor nationalist but a socialist and Irsquom standing for Labour in this election because I believe that jobs, wages and public services are key to our recovery from the pandemic.Born and bred in the Borders Irsquove spent most of the last two decades as a shopworker, serving my community, getting to know the problems and challenges people face.Irsquom an experienced campaigner and an active member of the shopworkers union USDAW.I successfully campaigned for changes in the law to protect my colleagues from abuse and tackle the bad practices of employers who, sadly, too often sought to cut corners when it came to their safety and pay.As a councillor I would campaign for a rise in the minimum wage to pound and would push to ensure that the key workers who have stepped up so magnicently during COVID are recognised not just by rainbows and rounds of applause but by better working conditions and proper pay.I would bring an independence of mind to the council chamber, campaigning for action to tackle the attainment gap in our local schools, ensuring people have the quality public services they deserve, pushing for a publicly owned local bus system that better meets our needs properly connecting our towns and villages and ensure that funding provided to SBC to assist people during and after the pandemic gets to those who need it most quickly and without red tape holding them back.On March  vote Labour to help achieve these goals ndash together.Karen Wilks Karen WilksI am a volunteer support officer and session supervisor at Musselburgh Citizenrsquos Advice Bureau.Previously I have worked with Domestic Abuse Advocacy Service in the Scottish Borders, Edinburgh Domestic Abuse Court Service and Victim Support Scotland ndash providing advocacy, information, emotional and practical support to victims of crime within the community and within the Scottish Criminal Justice System.From living in and around Earlston for most of my le and being a parent of a young person in secondary school, I have the same concerns as every other parent has in relation to education, especially given this past year and the dficulties our young people have had to face due to the pandemic.Currently I manage the general advice service within Musselburgh Citizens Advice Bureau. I have witnessed, as have other bureaux, a vast increase in the need for support due to COVID-.People being placed on furlough, loss of employment, businesses closing, requirement to self-isolate, reduced incomes, increase in demand for foodbanks and energy support.I have the knowledge and understanding in relation to these issues and many more that are prevalent within our community.My current and previous roles have taught me how to question, challenge those in positions of power on behalf of people in crisis and in vulnerable situations.My focus has been to get their voice heard, get them the information required, aid them to empowerment all working towards as positive an outcome as possible.I can and will draw on those skills, experience and dogeared determination, enabling me to confidently support local business, community groups, the inidual, transport infrastructure, local economy and health in our recovery and continued growth from COVID-.ExtrainformationPolling stations for this by-election will be open as normal.The council says that arange of measures will be in place to ensure that those who wish to vote in person can do so as safely as possible, including adherence to social-distancing guidelines and the wearing of face coverings.Returning officer Rob Dickson said: ldquoIf anyone develops symptoms ahead of polling day, or is contacted by NHS Test and Protect and is required to self-isolate, then you can apply for an emergency proxy ballot up to pm on Thursday, March .Visit: www.scotborders.gov.uk elections"},{"url":null,"title":"borders-girl-chops-off-hair-little-princess-trust","story":"CUTTING off almost  inches of hair for charity has left a nine-year-old Borders girl with a very stylish bob cut.Over Christmas, Hannah Ramsay decided she wanted to donate her long locks to the Little Princess Trust ndash the charity that makes wigs for young people who have undergone cancer treatment or live with other conditions.On Sunday, February , at her home in Darnick, Hannah and mum Claire created an at-home hairdressers on their driveway.And the verdict on the finished product  ldquoI love it, I think itrsquos cool, said Hannah, although Claire modestly joked: ldquoI donrsquot think Irsquoll get a job as a hairdresser somehow.Although apprehensive at first, Claire said she thinks Hannahrsquos new hair ldquolooks great.:Borders town could get one-way road system as council asks for opinions on trialldquoI was worried that she [Hannah] might not be so sure about it once it was done, but [she] seemed quite happy with it and [she] coped well with the attention which was quite good, said Claire.As the haircut was outside, passersby were able to stop and ask a few questions about what was happening, which Hannah took in her stride, explaining why she wanted to help the Little Princess Trust.And this week Hannah has debuted her new lsquodorsquo to her classmates in the virtual classroom.ldquoMy teacher knows [about the haircut] and she keeps asking questions and stuff, said Hannah on Sunday.ldquoShersquos like, lsquoI canrsquot wait to see you and your hairrsquo.Before the big chop, Claire said her husband Craig had ldquomixed feelings about the haircut as ldquohersquos really enjoyed brushing her [Hannahrsquos] hair and has now become a master of the plait.:Its an absolute bog: Muddy Borders play park needs work, meeting hearsAs well as cutting her hair, Hannah has been fundraising for the Little Princess Trust to help cover the costs of making the wigs.As at Tuesday , Hannah had raised pound ndash her initial target was pound.ldquoHopefully when the hairdressers are back we can get a proper cut because wersquore looking a little bit wavy in the back, Claire said.ldquoIt is definitely an amateur haircut.ldquoBut, it still looks brilliant on her.To donate to Hannahrsquos fundraiser, visit justgiving fundraising hannah-ramsayA donation tub can also be found at Bean Nrsquo Gone outside the Greenyards, Melrose."},{"url":null,"title":"urgent-recalls-co-op-lidl-tesco-meat-cakes-dog-food","story":"Customers are being warned over the posible health risk from products they have bought froms major UK supermarkets including Asda, Sainsburys, Tesco and Co-op.Salmonella poisoning,food allergies and glass are just some of the reasons behind a number of urgent product recalls across the UK.Weve rounded up the latest products to be recalled.If you have bought any of the items mentioned below, you need to be aware of these possible health risks.Co-op Irresistible Carrot Cake and Irresistible Coffee and Walnut CakeCo-op is recalling Irresistible Carrot Cake and Irresistible Coffee and Walnut Cake because the products may contain pieces of glass.

re-entering a regional level system.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced last month that Scotland would head back into the levels system, similar to the restriction tiers that we had last year.Now, new data from Public Health Scotland has given us a clue as to which level each area could enter when the system is re-introduced.Our interactive map shows the rate of Covid cases in each local authority in Scotland, taking the weekly new positive cases per , people up to March .Currently, Orkney Islands is the only local authority that could be placed into Level  based on the case numbers. Areas such as Glasgow City, North Ayrshire, Stirling and West Lothian could move to Level , based on cases.Unlike the previous levels system, the Scottish Government is taking a harsher approach to deciding the levels.They are taking point from the World Health Organisation, and are rebasing the indicators that are used to guide decisions on the allocation of levels on the recommendations made by WHO.It is hoped these indicators will be set out fully in the middle of this month.The framework reads: \"Although there are some dferences, this aligns broadly with our levels approach and indicates that we should lower or tighten some of the thresholds associated with each of our five levels.\"If following the WHO recommendations, levels will be based on cases per , population and the percentage of positive tests as core indicators, meaning the data in the above table details what we could expect, based on the cases per k.The Scottish Government also say they will continue to look at forecasts of hospital admissions and ICU occupancy, as well as patterns of infection in older people andthe ability of the NHS to resume paused serviced.According to their Strategic Framework update, the plan is to progress through the proposed easings for Level , \"at a pace that the data indicate is safe\", and from there to allocate protection levels again in accordance with geographical epidemiological data.They will look to the criteria set out by the World Health Organisation, and use it to assess whether it is safe to proceed with each new set of easings.However, they will also be adding one extra condition that they say \"must be met\" in addition to the six WHO criteria for easing lockdown.

Finding a permanent solution might not seem pressing to some of us, while travel restrictions remain in place, but it is causing havoc for the businesses which depend on the route daily.Hopefully pressure from the affected business owners, many based in Kintyre, who are now making their voices heard, will result in a quicker solution.When thingsto normal, the people of Campbeltown are looking forward to welcoming visitors to the most improved place in Scotland, but visitors need to be able to get here."},{"url":null,"title":"letters february 26 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It really will make a dference to our environment and is something that can be done easily on our daily walks.I would also like to say a big thank you to Jimmy Robertson, the bin man who contacted me and donated his litter-picker, bags and gloves. It is very much appreciated. I wish Jimmy a really happy retirement, and would like to thank him for all he has done over the years.I went back to work at MAKI Pups, the new outdoor nursery based in Lochgilphead, last week but I intend to continue with my litter-picking at weekends when I can. I won#t stop now I#ve started.If anyone wishes to help in any way, please phone me on  .There was an interesting letter from Ron Wilson in the February  edition of the Courier which, as with any politician#s pronouncements, was laced with spin, hyperbole or half truths and consequently tells only half the story.Regarding vaccines, nobody, except the SNP, talks about Westminster#s charity. It is my understanding that Great Britain and Northern Ireland are part of the UK and independently opted not to use the EU system and purchased vaccines for itself.This elicited the usual howls of derision by SNP politicians along the lines of: #This idiotic refusal is all about Brexit and nothing to do with the pandemic and will cost lives,# and others of a similar vein.The inept EU vaccine-purchasing system has been and still is chaotic. France, at the time of writing, with a population of  million, has vaccinated . million. Pro rata, under the EU system, Scotland would probably have received , as opposed to the . million currently vaccinated.The electorate keep hearing: #As an independent member of the EU#. This is possibly an SNP aspiration but I think there are several hurdles to an independent Scotland joining the EU.What currency would be used, what proposals are there to meet the EU fiscal rules for membership in respect of the annual GDP deficit which is currently running at . per cent, well above the three per cent required The last figures available for government debt to GDP of  per cent is well above the  per cent required. Then there is the strong possibility of a Spanish veto or perhaps they are proposing throwing Clara Ponsatí to the wolves and saying: #We are sorry we backed the Catalans in order to curry favour with Madrid.#Regarding the EU solidarity stimulus plan, I would hope that it was considerably greater than the UK there are  member countries. I understand that it is € billion, spread over three years, and the grants and loans are subject to strict requirements. I notice that you do not mention £. billion to date allocated through the Barnett formula which is separate from the money. I do not know how much, currently paid to Kate Forbes MSP, cabinet secretary for finance#s department in the furlough scheme.Regarding the comments relating to Brexiteers and leaving the EU as #Johnson#s folly#, it has obviously escaped Mr Wilson#s notice that leaving the EU, liking the decision or not, was a democratic one by the UK electorate and, unlike the EU or the SNP, in our constitution we do not send the electorate back to vote again until such time that they #vote correctly#.Banking crash  May I remind Mr Wilson that it was the Royal Bank of Scotland and Bank of Scotland which were the main protagonists in the UK which had a serious impact on our economy. Mr Wilson#s rather emotive #gimcrack imperial fantasies# could well have applied to the antics of the two Scottish banks# boards of directors.I am not particularly an avid supporter of politicians per se but the current SNP government by any yardstick is a really appalling administration with a record of declining education, health care and financial mismanagement, just to mention three areas.Leaving aside the first two, what should cause concern is the eye-watering amounts of taxpayers# money wasted. The new Royal Hospital for Children and Young People in Edinburgh is at least £ million over budget and still not fully operative Ferguson Shipyard ferry project, currently £ million and no ferries, projected final cost an additional £ million and no firm delivery date other assorted projects like the BiFab yards, £ million, two of which have been bought by a UK company for £, Prestwick Airport, there is a bit of #smoke and mirrors# but somewhere around £ million is close.A bit closer to home, the Glen Croe problem up to the Rest and Be Thankful, which has been ongoing since  and is regularly subject to closure, has had at least £ million spent on it to date. It is of no surprise that Jim McColl said that #everything the SNP touch is a mess#. Added to that, we have the current internecine Salmond Sturgeon Murrell case ongoing currently swallowed up in excess of £, of taxpayers# money and rising.Mr Wilson is perfectly entitled to his point of view, as I am to mine, but as I said in my opening paragraph, and this applies to politicians of all political persuasions, please present the full narrative not some unsubstantiated wish list.The neglect of the A is a disgrace. It’s not just the long detour via Crianlarich when it rains heavily, it’s the potholes and ruts when we get a spell of cold weather.Three years ago, we had a cold winter and the A became a dirt track. Emergency repairs had to be carried out. The Scottish Government said it would solved the problem. Now we have another cold winter, and again emergency repairs are needed.Other trunk roads in Scotland don’t get closed when it rains or get all these ruts and potholes in a cold winter.We need serious money invested now to solve the A problems. Yet all we get from the Scottish Government is waffle about y public inquiries.  We need money and action now to make the A as reliable as Scotland’s other trunk roads, not more cheap solutions."},{"url":null,"title":"postponed new year competition played in brutal conditions","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

God may perhaps grant them repentance leading to the knowledge of the truth.#Timothy was to be a model of the Lord Jesus, the most loving man who ever lived and yet the one who disagrees with everyone. Disagrees  Really  Yes, Jesus# first word to the world in the gospel of Matthew is, #repent#, that is, #you are heading the wrong way, turn from sin to God.#Jesus isn’t addressing a particular section of society, or a particular behaviour, he is not directing his gaze at #everyone except me#. This is the most loving call in the world to everyone everywhere. And it#s good news because it comes from a saviour who paid for sin and who offers us the power to change.#I have come,# said Jesus, #that they may have le and have it in abundance.#His invitation  Come, find out how to live and how to love."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 20 the final tee","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The conversations, Kaya hopes, will feel like the discussion that would usually evolve over a cup of tea or an evening pint.Kaya, who begins her residency this month, will record the conversations which will be stitched together as a sound-based artwork called Milk + Two Sugars which will eventually be exhibited on the island for local audiences to engage with and listen to.Over the last few weeks, invitations have been extended to the local residentsin the communities of The Bush and Ballochgoy. To take part they need only call   armed with a ‘cuppa’ of their choosing.The phoneline will be open to two people per day between am-pm on Thursday March  and Friday th, Thursday March  and Friday th. An answer phone message will be available in between times for people to register their interest in taking part.Kaya, who graduated from Duncan of Jordanstone in  with BA Hons First Class in Art and Philosophy in , said: #I begin this residency with a strong nostalgic feeling of connection to Rothesay even though only knowing it through family anecdotes of holidays there. I hope this residency extends these memories into my own stories of the people and stories I come to meet.#With Milk + Two Sugars, I aim to extend these connections beyond a screen and focus on the house phone as my source of extension. I anticipate these oral histories will create an enticing sound landscape reverberated in public spaces for the very community that it captures. The work will also be available to call and hear via a phone number—extending off the island the essence of Bute, those who call it home.#The residency, now in its third iteration, creating an opportunity for emerging artists, whose practice is rooted in social engagement.The Contemporary Visual Art Programme is led by Sophie Crichton-Stuart and curated by Morven Gregor."},{"url":null,"title":"campbeltowns colin joins team scotland staff","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

If we want children and families to come to the area we need to keep the school open,# he said.Argyll and Bute Council met yesterdaywhen members were asked to agree to hold informal pre-consultation meetings with representatives from  communities that may be affected by the school estate review.The council was also asked to agree to review the school estate #on an ongoing basis# and reducing the future scale of any changes which would be considered at any one time.Now the proposal is for Rhunahaorine to go into Glenbarr and Clachan and Skipness to go to Tarbert. Saint Kieran#s also goes into Castlehill in Campbeltown this is a paper exercise as Saint Kieran#s no longer has pupils and is mothballed.TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGONew Post OfficeCampbeltown’s Meadows scheme is to get its own post office in the early summer.Post Office Counters plans to open a community post office in Ralston Road in late May or early June.Post Office Counters has already secured premises for the office which will be open for around  hours a week but the chairwoman of Campbeltown Community Council, Mrs Nancy Smith, said she would prefer a new post office in the town centre.Since the main post office moved from Longrow to the Co-op supermarket last summer, the town centre has not had a post office.Mrs Smith said: #I#m pleased that there is going to be another outlet for people, but unless people have got a car it#s only going to be suitable for people in the Meadows scheme.#She added: #The community council has always pushed for a post office in the centre of the town. Not only because it#s convenient, but also to help the commercial centre of the town.#FIFTY YEARS AGOLocal choir on radioCampbeltown Gaelic choir was taped at a concert in the Town Hall on Tuesday evening.The choir will be heard on BBC radio later this month.BBC men recorded a half-hour programme of all-Gaelic songs, which were introduced by Mr Hector McNeill.The choir was conducted by Mr Charles Bonar.

This is in contradiction to what is surely the council#s main aim when setting the budget # saving money where possible.Despite many of KRL#s staff having barriers to working, they do an exemplary job and are happy in their workplace # something which is evident from a visit to the recycling centre. The fact that some of them may lose the jobs they enjoy and do so well as a result of this decision is shocking and heart-breaking.Campbeltown has seen record levels of redundancies over the last couple of years, with more than  lay-offs at CS Wind and Campbeltown Creamery alone, never mind the many people who have since lost their jobs as a result of the pandemic. To potentially add to this level of unemployment for no apparent good reason is baffling.KRL not only provides an efficient and cost effective service but worthwhile jobs to people who may otherwise struggle to find employment and are no doubt very concerned about their futures right now.This decision should be reconsidered."},{"url":null,"title":"letters march 5 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I immediately hung up # wondering which of my frailties had been discovered # and phoned  which tells you the last number that called.I twice noted the number given by  and ventured to phone it. On dialling this number, the phone company advised me that there was #no such number#.Over a week, adopting identical procedures, five dferent #no such numbers# were found. The job of answering morning calls was then delegated to the message answering machine and only once did it receive a call which was terminated speedily by the caller without a message.Is there a flaw in our phone companies# systems with consequent loss of income  If this flaw could be eradicated, phone scammers might be less numerous and consequently afford a little more protection for the vulnerable.Going by theof John Newall#s reply to my letter on England#s disastrous Brexit, forced upon Scotland against our democratic wishes, I had expected better than the mishmash of worn out tropes and John Bull exceptionalism trotted out by Mr Newall.Mr Newall makes great play of the successful roll-out of the Covid vaccine in Scotland and the UK. He is absolutely right, it has been a fantastic achievement, but to then go on to use this success to denigrate the EU#s vaccine programme is crass and over simplistic.Our success is an illusion until both doses of vaccine are administered, crowing about vaccines when only . per cent of the UK population has had the vital second jag, compared, for example, to . per cent in Denmark, is both presumptuous and inappropriate.Mr Newall goes on to assert that Scotland has a deficit that will prevent Scotland re-entering the EU, without of course mentioning the elephant in the room, the UK#s ruinous £ trillion # and increasing # debt. Unionists need to get their own house in order before lecturing anyone .Of course, legally, Scotland has no #deficit# or #debt#. How can a country with virtually no borrowing ability have a debt  What Scotland does have is a notional #debt#, the price of Westminster failure within the UK, where spending outwith Scotland#s control is assigned to Scotland, such as Trident, HS and London’s Crossrail. Spending that Scots taxpayers cough up for.Indeed,Courier readers start counting now at the rate of one a second, they#ll reach the number of pounds spent on Boris Johnson’s failed Track and Trace system at about .am on April  in the year . Readers may well wonder where the money went and why this is being loaded on to Scotland#s ledger.Straight from the #Better Together# playbook, Mr Newall brings up the hoary old #Spanish veto# myth. The truth is that Spain has no issue with an independent Scotland in the EU so long as this is within the framework of the UK constitution # which it is.Unlike Catalonia#s predicament, Scotland is not a #region# of the UK, there is no constitutional prohibition on independence votes or indeed of Scotland abrogating the  Treaty of Union with England.This is why successive prime ministers, from Margaret Thatcher to David Cameron, have repeatedly recognised the right of the Scottish people to independence # and why Boris Johnson#s oafish #No# will run into the sand.Mr Newall and I will never agree but that is the essence of democracy, and the right to choose in a free country.Scotland can either remain, semi-detached and impotent, as part of an increasingly insular Little Englander Tory Britain, bringing in its wake further austerity and diminished le chances for our young people, or Scots can vote for independence, just like our neighbours.Yes, there will be dficult choices, yes, there will be mistakes, but they will be our decisions to get right as we work for the prosperous, open and internationalist country that is within our grasp.I am delighted that our council will be investing nearly £. million to help keep Argyll and Bute going and growing.After relentless campaigning from myself and others it#s great to see, at long last, some substantial investment in our crumbling infrastructure.Building on investments made in previous years, an additional £. million will be invested to drive forward improvements and repairs to Argyll and Bute#s network of roads in rural, remote, island and urban communities, bringing the overall roads reconstruction budget to £ million for  .We are also investing more in active travel, in line with the council#s agreed priorities. This includes a further £, in enhancing and improving footpaths. This investment complements the current allocation of £, in green transport and travel.This recent Covid pandemic has highlighted more than ever the need to tackle our urban-rural ide. Even now, many of my constituents are paying primum prices for snail#s pace broadband speeds.That#s why £, is being invested in a Tackling Digital Exclusion Top-Up Fund # to support people, businesses and communities to access improved digital connections for social and commercial opportunities supporting communities and in some cases iniduals that are missing out on national programmes due to logistics and economies of scale.While this budget is not perfect and there will be challenges ahead as we start to recover from the ongoing global pandemic this is a massive step in the correct direction.Now my constituents across the Kintyre and the Islands ward will quite rightly want to see action, not more talking.So that means more help for our small businesses, improving our digital connectivity and substantial improvements to our roads which in so many areas are sadly approaching the point of no .Six years ago, I had a sudden and le-changing stroke. I’m not alone in this: stroke strikes every five minutes in the UK, and around . million survivors are living with its devastating effects.Despite this, research into stroke is severely underfunded. Just one per cent of the total UK public and third sector health research spend goes towards stroke research.The Stroke Association has launched a unique opportunity for stroke survivors and those who care for stroke survivors to have our say on the future of stroke research. Partnered with the James Lind Alliance, the charity will find out what matters to us most so research can make the biggest dference to our lives.With such limited funds for stroke research, worsened by the Covid- pandemic, it#s vital that we come together and make our voices heard.If you#re a stroke survivor, or you care for or work with someone affected by stroke, join me and speak up for stroke.Visit www.stroke.org.uk jla by March ."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week march 5 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Mr Wilson is trying to muddy the waters there.Whilst Mr Wilson is correct that Scotland cannot have debt , Scotland does have deficit, and the reason we know this is because the SNP-run Scottish Government tells us so in the annual Government Revenue and Expenditure, Scotlandbut Mr Wilson contradicts himself by going on to say that Scotland has a #notional debt# . Scotland has no debt. Scotland cannot have debt. Mr Wilson needs to realise that debt and deficit are two dferent things.With regard to HS, yes, Scotland pays a two per cent share of the total cost but will receive approximately . per cent back in Barnett consequentials. THAT is a very good deal for Scotland. London#s Crossrail  Not a single penny for that will be paid for by Scotland.Mr Wilson goes on to say that there is no #prohibition on independence votes#. Another error from him. Section  of The Scotland Act , the act which allowed us to have a devolved assembly and to which the then Scottish Office signed up, lays down the exact process required. We need permission from HMGov.Oh, and the notion that Scotland can abrogate the Treaty Of Union is also wrong. Whilst Westminster is a parliament of equals, it cannot of itself dissolve the Treaty of Union of which it was not itself a progenitor. That is the prerogative of the suspended national parliaments of England and Scotland, which will require to be recalled from suspension #in abeyance ad interim# where they legitimately reside at the present time. Only the recalled national parliaments of Scotland and England may re-negotiate the  Treaty of Union.I would take this opportunity to remind Mr Wilson of two things: we had a referendum in  and voted to stay in the UK, and he should really learn to live with that and in no election ever, General or Scottish, has the SNP garnered more than  per cent of the vote.The decision by Argyll and Bute Council to stop funding Kintyre Recycling Limited is perverse to say the least.No thought seems to have been given to the level and cost of the future support for the employees who will be thrown on the scrap-heap. Will that go to the social work department and will they get the same level of support as they do now No thought seems to have been given to the effect on the mental health of the employees # what support will be available and what budget will it come from How can the expenditure of a quarter of a million pounds be justied when the council is struggling for money and how long will it take to save this amount compared with the partial funding for Kintyre Recycling Limited It is shameful that only two of our local councillors are against vulnerable people being thrown on the scrap-heap when all three should be supporting their constituents.I am pleased to support the new business group set up to campaign for a quick and permanent solution for the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A.It’s now seven months since the landslide closed the A last summer. That should have been a wake-up call for the SNP Government, but all we#ve had since then is a failed attempt to protect the Old Military Road from landslides and talk of taking  years to solve the problem.This is just not good enough. We need urgent action now.Last week#s Courier letters page didn#t offer much hope. The SNP only wrote about independence, not the real issues facing us, such as the Rest and Be Thankful.The SNP Government should be concentrating on fixing the Rest and Be Thankful and recovering from the Covid pandemic, not spending its time plotting about independence.This Mother#s Day, school feeding charity Mary#s Meals would like to pay tribute to incredible women around the world.From the mums in the UK whose food has nourished us throughout our childhoods, including those who volunteer and fundraise for Mary#s Meals, to the women who cook and serve our daily meals for children in some of the world#s poorest countries, we celebrate them all.Mary#s Meals feeds more than . million hungry children in  countries every school day.That#s why I am asking your readers to send a Mary#s Meals gt card to the special women in their lives this Mother#s Day.

That is a tough place to be in.The first occasion, He told them to go out again into deeper water , on the second occasion,it was to cast the net on the right side of the boat. In both accounts, these fishermen caught so many fish the nets were at breaking point.Oh, that it could always be as straightforward as that!Right now, fishermen and their families are facing such a dficult time and feeling that their voices are not being heard. These Bible stories remind us that their need and cry is heard by Jesus, the one who chose fishermen as His companions whilst on earth.We too must not forget them and this important industry in our west coast communities. I hope you will join me in praying for them, not only for their daily safety but also for provision and wisdom.In these stories, there is a lesson for us all to think about. What obstacle do you face this week that could be overcome by changing our actions or by thinking dferently  We resist change particularly when something has worked for us in the past, but sometimes we need a dferent approach.Sometimes, like the disciples, we too can find that calling on Jesus gets us through."},{"url":null,"title":"woman tipped foul smelling water over man","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

A December poll in GPonline revealed that a third of GPs were facing \"very high\" levels of work-related pressure, a situation likely to worsen as the UK endures its second wave of coronavirus.While the added pressure brought on by the pandemic has triggered an immediate crisis for many within the profession, the environment for most GPs has been extremely challenging for many years, with numerous legacy issues still needing to be addressed beyond this current public health crisis.A lack of sufficient numbers of newly qualied GP candidates sits at the heart of the problem. It takes years to address this issue, meaning the UK public faces a decline in care standards or having to recruit additional experienced doctors from abroad, a costly process which denies poorer nations of much-needed medical skills.Here in Scotland, GP recruitment has been further set back by the Scottish Governmentrsquos attempted integration ohealth and social care alongside the implementation of its new GP contract. Under the new agreement, GP practices will continue to operate as private businesses with the partnersrsquo remuneration dependent on their level of profitability.The new agreement offers further Government support, in principle, by removing some of the risk burden from GP practice partners in running a business. It also provides more funding and reinstates the principle that doctors are expert medical generalists who should only focus on those patients who actually need to be seen by them.Some health boards are attempting to implement these policies but this has not been consistent across Scotland and progress has been slow. While this may be understandable in the current climate, failure to creating a stable working environment for GPs will lead to increased shortages and could trigger wider public health issues. The Scottish Government must therefore ensure all health boards take a consistent approach in implementing the new contract.There are also UK-wide issues for the Westminster Government to address which are currently preventing older GPs from working. While the Chancellorrsquos March  Budget took some steps towards addressing doctorsrsquo pensions earnings, issues around letime allowance limits still remain which are penalising experienced GPs who want to continue working beyond their retirement age.Andy Drane, partner and GP practice adviser at law firm Davidson Chalmers StewartAlong with the challenges it has brought to the profession, Covid also presents a real opportunity to revitalise GP service delivery through new, imaginative policies which will benefit those in the profession along with the wider public. However, Scottish and UK governments must firstly focus on removing the increasing level of burden that many doctors are currently facing.Given the essential role of GPs in safeguarding public health, politicians and policy-makers must ensure this is a key health priority.Andy Drane is partner and GP practice adviser at law firm Davidson Chalmers Stewart"},{"url":null,"title":"film-jennifer-garner-gives-children-want-day","story":"If that sounds like a recipe for lawlessness, think again.

Her image is everything, a potent symbol of UK sovereignty abroad. Even the Scottish National Party buys into royal mystique and accords the monarch pride of place in its independence project. Not perhaps for much longer.This crisis is arguably worse than the Abdication in . Then, the monarchy was a robust and unchallengeable part of the British institutional landscape. Edward and his American orcee went into convenient exile and relative obscurity. Meghan isnt going quietly. She is a destroyer ndash a heat-seeking missile, and she was bang on target.Read more: Its time for the SNP to ditch its attachment to the Queen, that last remnant of empireShe accused the royal family of propagating hoods, failing in its duty of care, discriminating against her children, ignoring her suicidal tendencies and putting her familys le in danger by withdrawing protection. Her tale of victimhood has reverberated across the world and particularly in the Commonwealth of former British colonies. Nothing could be more damaging than the head of the Commonwealth being tainted with racism.Meghan has at her back an army of international celebrities led by Hillary Clinton, who accused the royals of ldquooutrageous cruelty astheyd held Meghan in a dungeon in the Tower. Brexit Britain was already being portrayed by the US media as a reactionary and xenophobic place. Now comes confirmation from within.It hardly matters that much of what the Duchess said was nonsense. She claimed that during her pregnancy she was not allowed to visit her friends and was only allowed out twice in four months. If thats true the royals were guilty of coercive control, a criminal offence. The isolation, she said, contributed to her mental health problems and resulted in ldquosuicidal thoughts for which she was given ldquono support.She said that she approached the human relations office and was told they couldnt help because she wasnt an employee. This is hardly surprising. The Sussexes had their own private office staffed by well-paid people whose job it was to look after her welfare. They could have bought the best psychiatric help on the planet. Her husband, Harry, even co-founded a charity for people with mental health issues, Heads Together. Did he ignore his own wes psychological deterioration Meghan complained that her son, Archie, had been blackballed by the Palace because of ldquoconcerns about his colour. She says she was told he would not automatically be a prince, which is true since the Queens great-grandchildren dont automatically take on the title. Archie could become a princeand when Charles, his grandfather, becomes king.But this was not about protocol, but race. She connected the unspecied ldquoconversations about his skin colour with the fact that Archie was being deprived of his royal title ndash at risk to his le. Its not clear which she thought was worse: the racism or the fact that she was told, again during her pregnancy, that her son would not have police protection.Was she suggesting here that her protection officers would have been withdrawn because Archie was not immediately to become a prince  That is plainly wrong. The royal protection squad would never have been taken from Prince Harry and his family while he remained an active royal. Security costs only became an issue when the couple said they wanted to leave, ldquostand back, from their royal roles and seek their fortunes in Canada and America. They couldnt have it both ways and continue to be funded by UK taxpayers after theyd departed for La La Land.Read more: Its time to abolish the monarchyIn one of many startling revelations Harry said: ldquoMy family literally cut me off financially.... His dad wouldnt answer his calls, either. Thats obviously an issue for the Prince of Wales, who holds the purse strings. But the Sussexes werent exactly left penniless. Harry had around pound million from investments left by his mother and Meghan had her own millions. They are getting poundm from Netflix and Spoty. Harry said that ldquogoing to the streamers was never part of the plan. Perhaps not, but since they intended to earn large sums of money to pay for their pound million Santa Barbara mansion, media work must have been in the back of their minds.There were predictable claims of racism in the British media. The press is disrespectful, sometimes cruelly so but, unlike social media, claims of actual racism against Meghan have never been substantiated. Yet the Duchess is now offering concrete proof that the royal family itself, the pinnacle of state privilege, is racist. Just how ldquodark would Archie be This was the cruellest cut of all, and one the Palace cannot allow to stand. The context of the remark, or remarks, was not made clear. It was Prince Harry who heard it and he was refusing to ldquoshare any more of the story. Yet hed already shared the greatest possible libel of his own family. There can be no charge more damaging to a institution today than that it harbours racists.Could it have been a misunderstanding  I was once accused of racism for saying that, when watching her legal drama Suits, it had never occurred to me that Meghan was black. It was only after she hooked up with Harry that I learned she was a Person of Colour. Butit was a similarly misconstrued remark, the Palace should make that clear. If it does not, the monarchy will be indelibly smeared.It is said, jokingly, that Meghans interview was a rehearsal for the next season of Neftlixs Crown.

He is surely right that ldquonothing less than a revolution in the way Whitehall acts and thinks is required, and is spot on when he points out that dferent parts of the UK require dferent policies, whether for education, labour markets, immigration or many other fields.His analysis, though, stops short at the civil service. Unfortunately this inflexibility pervades the whole body politic in Westminster, and a revolution is required in the political sphere too. For example, take immigration: Tory policy is to try to reduce it, and the Conservative Party plays on this repeatedly and everywhere in its messaging. How can they possibly reconcile this with a nuanced policy of encouraging it in Scotland and parts of England, while railing against it in others This is the way the UK political system works. If the civil service finds it hard to adapt its ldquodelivery to dferent parts of the UK, that is because it is the servant of UK politicians whose whole instinct is for bold, sweeping measures. Westminster politicians, seeing themselves reflected and magnied by a metropolitan media, are trapped in this mode. They want to be seen as ldquoworld-beating and ldquoglobal. This is the ambition that Whitehall has to indulge.Asking Boris Johnson to be otherwise is to plead forlornly against nature. Tasking him with making Scotland ldquofeel hellip part of a shared endeavour asks for the impossible. Itrsquos not just Mr Johnson, though. Any UK PM is ineluctably drawn towards grandiosity, because the Westminster London universe implicitly demands it. Careful attention to Scotland, Wales or English regions gets you nowhere in that world.The remedy, Lord Dunlop, is to leave it.Lyn Jones, Edinburgh.POLICE LACKED LEADERSHIPI AM moved to write this letter by a sense of incredulity at the events surrounding Rangers fans celebrations at winning the Scottish Premiership.First, it has to be acknowledged that the sporting achievement is certainly a signicant event for the club for which they have to be congratulated. However, as a retired former police officer I am appalled at the police handling of the ious incidents. In my view it highlights the inappropriate strategy of promoting officers with limited operational experience to positions of strategic control.When we see photographs of police officers having selfies taken with people forming part of an illegal mob, escorting the same mob to the main focal point of the city to celebrate illegally and indeed openly engage in ious aspects of illegal activity, then we simply have to speak out. Who is setting the standards Where was the leadership to make decisions on what was a slowly developing situation  They had the time it takes to slowly walk from Govan to the city centre to decide what to do, yet did nothing to stop the illegalities. This is a personal affront to me as a former member and an embarrassment to those taking good money to be entrusted with our protection. I believe I can say with confidence that in my day, the early s, this would never have happened, as the police would have simply refused to accept it and tackled the group head on with the confidence that we would have had the support of our experienced leaders rather than worry about any careerists who simply donrsquot know what to do.Unfortunately, there seems to me to be a cadre of senior officers who are more worried about their next promotion than in looking after our wellbeing.The demands of society havenrsquot changed in hundreds of years.

However, theWorld Health Organisation said there was no indication of a link.The first real world data collected through theKings College London Zoe tracking app and involving , UK participants,found that women, younger people and those who have already had Covid- were more likely to experience side-effectsfrom both vaccines.However, the research team saidthis did not mean people were more or less protected than someone who did not feel unwell.The data shows that both vaccines reduced the risk of infection to a similar extent seen in larger clinical trial - with a % reduction in mild disease.Some of the most unusual side-effects reported through the app were sore ears, tinnitus and \"smelling petrol all the time\". The rate of side-effects was less than expected from any of the clinical trials.: It was incredible news: Dozens of people in Glasgow learnthey were protected from Covid-Nurses involved in the care of adults with congenital heart disease said there had been reports of some patients suffering irregular heart beatsafter vaccinations.A  of experts drawn together to comment on the findings, said it was reassuring that those with underlying health conditions were no more likely to suffer side-effects than healthier iniduals.The app asks participants to record the date of vaccinations and any side-effects and found that in some cases symptoms were actually Covid- infections.Eli Barnes, a professor ofexperimental medicine at Oxford University, said: \"The side effects that you get are related to your innate immune response, which is your immune systems first line of defence to either an infection or to a vaccine.\"That is quite a separate thing from the kind of T-cells and antibodies that protect you from subsequent infection later on, which takes much longer to evolve.\": Coronavirus: Estimated  Scots living with cancer as experts warn many cases will be detected too lateProf Barnes said that while both vaccines were considered safe for patients with weakened immune systems, it is not yet known howeffective they are for patients in this group including those with cancer.New real-world data published yesterday found cancer patients are much less protected against Covid- than other people after one dose of the Pfizer vaccine.Three weeks after one dose, an antibody response was found in % of people with solid cancers, compared to % of people with no cancer.Dr Sheeba Irshad, oncologist and senior study author from Kings College London, said the findings were \"really worrying\" and cast doubt on whether cancer patients should face a -week wait for the second dose.Up to  patients are being recruited in three cities including Glasgow to investigate the efficacy of the vaccine in patients with compromised immunity.Prof Barnes said there were \"interesting\" reasons why more women were more likely to report vaccine side-effects.She said: \"The two genders have a dferent immune system to some extent. Women are generally better at coping with infectious diseases generally.\"They are more able to counter things like influenza, they respond better to vaccines, there is less childhood mortality in little girls than boys - actually it starts as young as that.\"Man flu is actually a real thing. When a man has got influenza, hes actually got a higher viral load - he is more sick.\"So all those people who have been rude to their partners about man flu - they should feel really bad about that because he really will be feeling more unwell.\"And all of that is probably reflected potentially in the side effects we are seeing here.\"Its interesting. On the counter side of that women get more auto-immune diseases because sometimes they have a more over-active immune system and men dont have that.\": Vaccine spat: Top EU official summoned to Foreign office over Brussels claimSome people who had experienced a more severe reaction had reported a reluctance to having a second dose.Dr Anna Goodman, an Infectious Diseases Consultant at Guys and St Thomas Hospital in London, advised people to take paracetamol on the morning of vaccination day.She said: \"One thing that is interesting is that people get more symptoms from their first Astra Zeneca dose and their second Pfizer dose.\"We arent sure why thats happening.\"Professor Phil Spector, Professor of Genetic Epidemiology at Kings College London, said there was also some evidence that certain drugs, including steroids,taken by patients with underlying health conditions were the same used to treat the virus, which may have offered some protection to those patients.He said the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agencywas carefully studying data on more reactions to vaccines and stressed that around % of people will not experience any side-effects.He added: \"So far, there is no evidence in any country- and American is looking at this quite closely - that the amounts of severe problems is more than you would expect.\""},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12393000.jpg?type=article-full","title":"linda-bauld-likely-catch-coronavirus-outdoors","story":"This week also saw headlines about some very dferent outdoor gatherings involving football supporters. These were not only illegal at the current time, but also criticised because of the infection risk to those gathering and to the police who had to intervene.So what are the risks of infection outside The first thing to make clear is that viruses donrsquot generally evolve to spread in houses or other buildings. Instead they survive by passing between hosts in nature, which in evolutionary terms has mostly meant outside. That includes respiratory viruses that are passed on when humans or animals breathe, sneeze, cough, call outor come into close contact. LINDA BAULD:Vaccines are giving us hope ndash and a cautious route out of this pandemicThe virus that causes Covid- can be passed on outdoors. But we know from flu and other respiratory viruses that indoor environments are much more risky. This is because they can be passed on through droplets that we are more likely to come into contact with indoors from someone breathing or speaking close to us, or landing onto surfaces that we might touch. Indoor environments with poor air circulation means viruses stay in the air and can be recycled with poor ventilation, so we breathe them in more easily.There are examples from studies of Covid- transmission in restaurants, during choir practice, in work places, and in food factories. The most high risk area by a long shot is our own homes, where it is clear that sharing bedrooms, bathrooms or other living spaces provides multiple opportunities for infection to spread.Many months on from the start of the pandemic, researchers have been able to assess the risks of indoors vs outdoors. Late last year a review was published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases, suggest that the odds of indoor transmission are around  times higher than outdoors, based on research from Japan that analysed a series of cases and clusters of outbreaks. From all the published studies that the authors identied on Covid- from a number of countries, fewer than % of coronavirus infections happened outdoors.This type of evidence helps inform government guidelines in Scotland and where when deciding what changes can occur, and in what order, as stay at home restrictions are eased. The bottom line is that having a coffee on a park bench with a friend in the open air is much less risky in terms of Covid- transmission that popping into a friendrsquos house to do the same.It also contributes to why in Scotland children under  have been able to play outside in groups during lockdown, as policy makers have weighed up the risks of them losing out on exercise and social interaction with their peers vs infection risk to them . It explains why the easing of lockdown starts with small groups of adults and teenagers being able to meet outside in larger numbers than before ndash and why I expect hospitality venues to be able to serve customers outside rather than inside when lockdown eases this year, as was the case in .But going back to my point about how viruses evolve in nature, this doesnrsquot mean that we canrsquot lsquocatchrsquo Covid- outdoors. We can, but what determines risk outdoors is how close we are and how long we spend with others. You donrsquot need to be an expert in infectious diseases to understand that lots of people embracing, shouting or singing in close proximity outdoors means someone who is carrying the viruscan pass it onto someone .As we look ahead, there are some key measures that will allow larger outdoor gatherings in future. The first is that when people meet up outdoors, distancing still matters. If we are to get back to sporting events with punters in seats, then spacing will be key and will limit how many people can watch a match or attend an outdoor concert. Face coverings will help, particularly in communal areas outdoors, for example queuing to get in, or to access toilets.A further big question is how much vaccines will reduce transmission. Early findings are positive and may mean that, as in Israel, people who have been vaccinated can access indoor venues that others canrsquot. Israel is providing lsquogreen passesrsquo to people who have received both doses of a Covid- vaccine. These are shown on a mobile phone app to provide entry to indoor public venues such as gyms and hotels. This type of certication is controversial and could be a isive policy that will disadvantage those who donrsquot take up vaccines or are last in the queue for vaccination, like young adults and children. But it is actively being considered in a number of other countries.For now, we have spring and summer to look forward to in Scotland. We canrsquot rely on sunshine, but longer days mean we can do more outdoors. Many of us will be able to reconnect with family and friends while keeping the risk of infection low as vaccines continue to be rolled out.Linda Bauld is Chair of Public Health at the University of Edinburgh.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Because it is.But, unashamed, the UK Governmentrsquos argument is  the SNP, despite its rhetoric, does not believe in devolution, ie sharing power, because it wants to have it all in an independent Scotland and  it has used the devolved settlement not to improve Scotsrsquo lives but merely to further the push for independence.This week, the mother of all shovels-in-the-ground projects was highlighted with the UK Government announcing that a multi-billion plan for a bridge or tunnel across the Irish Sea would be scoped by two top civil engineering experts.It may come as a surprise to some that a plan for a ldquofixed link across the Irish Sea is not new.As long ago as  when the Act of Union between Britain and Ireland came into being, William Pitt, the PM, had a doozy of an idea to build a bridge between Holyhead and Dublin to cement the new relationship, quite literally.A century later, architects were eagerly drawing up grand designs not for a bridge but an undersea tunnel in the North Channel between Scotland and Northern Ireland.In , when a Tory MP in the Commons enquired about the project, Arthur Balfour, First Lord of the Treasury, told his colleague dryly: ldquoThe financial aspects...are not of a very promising character.Yet the dream persisted.MPs throughout the th century continued to broach the possibility of a tunnel across the Irish Sea.While the Dublin Government insisted it would not be economically viable, the idea was revived by Northern Irelandrsquos Democratic Unionists, who even made a feasibility study into a tunnel or bridge a precondition of their support for the UK Government in the event of a hung parliament in the  General Election. Thankfully perhaps for David Cameron, the Tories won a majority.But it was when the idea was resurrected by an academic three years later that Borisrsquos imagination suddenly took flight and he insisted a bridge would create a ldquoCeltic powerhouse fuelled by increased trade across the water.By the time he became PM in summer , Mr Johnson was firmly committed to exploring the fixed link idea, hence this weekrsquos scoping plan in the Union Connectivity Review.However, of the two options a road bridge seems the unlikeliest.As one engineering expert pointed out maintaining a -milelong bridge would be an even greater task than building it. Costs would be ldquoeye-watering, he warned.And to put the scheme into context, a Celtic Crossing on this scale would make it the second longest road bridge in the world after the Bang Na Expressway in Bangkok. It cost poundm back in .So, a tunnel then This project would be comparable into the Eurotunnel but it has been pointed out it would have to be erted to avoid Beaufortrsquos Dyke, a ,ft deep trench, which is loaded with more than m tonnes of munitions dumped there from the days of the Second World War.The Eurotunnel cost pound.bn to build a new version would cost at least three times that today. So, a Union Tunnel would be one of the biggest infrastructure projects ever to be built in the UK. From the PMrsquos point of view, it would solidy the ldquowonderful Union and be part of his legacy alongside Brexit.But will Britain, and more specically Scotland, buy into the Unionist vision of a Strategic Transport Network with better road, rail, air and sea links, making the UK a simpler place to get around.On Wednesday, the Scottish Secretary snapped that the Scottish Government was ldquopathetic for not engaging in the connectivity review because its title contained the dreaded word lsquoUnionrsquo while Michael Matheson, the Scottish Governmentrsquos Transport Secretary, huffed that transport was a devolved issue, dismissing the fixed link idea as Borisrsquos ldquovanity project.While some people will admire the PM for his Panglossian outlook, others will feel the idea of a Union Tunnel will simply go the same way as those much-loved flights of fancy: the Boris Island airport hub the garden bridge across the Thames and le grand pont to la belle France.All of which have been quietly filed away in a distant Whitehall drawer under B for bonkers."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12403340.jpg?type=article-full","title":"sas-red-notice-outlanders-sam-heughan-action-role-rival-james-bond","story":"The Outlander star, , plays special forces operator Tom Buckingham in SAS: Red Notice, an adaptation of former SAS soldier Andy McNabrsquos novel of the same name.:Outlanders Sam Heughan inspires fundraising duo to raise pound, for Lyceum TheatreThe film finds Buckingham on a train to Paris in the Channel Tunnel when it is hijacked by heavily armed mercenaries, who hold all the passengers hostage.Heughan, best known for his role as Highland warrior Jamie Fraser in the historical drama Outlander, explained that filming the movie had been \"very physical.\"He said: ldquoIt is an action movie and there are a lot of fights but strangely I loved it.

I agree with him on Syria. I agree with him on the geopolitical issues of the day.Galloway has been censured by the UKrsquos media watchdog because of his coverage of the  Salisbury attacks. He has cast doubts on whether the Putin regime attempted to assassinate anti-corruption campaigner Alexei Navalny. And he has denied any suggestion of Kremlin interference in UK politics. He did all of this on RT, while preparing for an election campaign.I donrsquot believe many unionists will think these are credible positions.

No positive impacts were noted.The report states that in Orkney, “the total impact is estimated as . FTE jobs and £, in gross salaries. These jobs and salaries will be lost in  under ATMS.”Mr McArthur has been calling on both HIAL and the Scottish Government to halt the centralisation plans for a number of years and has described the report’s findings as making this case ‘stronger than ever.’Commenting on the findings, Mr McArthur said: “We’ve known for months that HIAL’s plans are damaging for our islands, but the impact assessment has revealed the full scale of this decision for our community.“The report not only underlines what HIAL’s own advisers warned them at the very beginning, that this is the riskiest and costliest option, but also details in no uncertain terms that these proposals will have a detrimental long-term impact on our leline services and local economy.“Nobody has ever questioned the need to modernise air traffic control services but HIAL’s insistence that they do it by deploying ATMS is becoming less credible each day.#With costs for the project continuing to rise at a time when the aviation sector is facing considerable uncertainty, the case for halting the strategy is stronger than ever.“Ministers must also absorb responsibility for these damning findings and, along with HIAL, take heed of the warnings outlined in this reportwe are to safeguard air traffic services in the islands and uphold the credibility of island impact assessments.#Serious consideration must be given to calling time on these centralisation proposals.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This ensures that local authorities are fully funded to operate their internal ferry services.“This delivers a key ask from the Scottish Government#s local authority partners at a time of unprecedented financial pressure on the Scottish budget.“Of course for Orkney it facilitates the introduction of Sunday services and Road Equivalent Tarfon inter-island ferries.“The Scottish Government has stated that it is well aware of the growing need for local authorities to replace ageing ferry fleets and infrastructure. While responsibility for funding replacement infrastructure remains with the councils, Scottish Ministers are committed to continuing engagement.“The passing of the budget also means £. million is coming Orkney Islands Council’s way, up £. million on last year — a . per cent hike.”Both Mr Leslie and Orkney#s MSP, Liam McArthur, welcomed increased spending in areas such as mental health services, education, green initiatives, business support and agri-environment.Mr Leslie added: “I am sure folk across Orkney will join me in welcoming this budget, there is plenty in it for islanders to be pleased about as we look to build a better, fairer and greener future for us all.”Meanwhile, Mr McArthur welcomed a number of concessions included in the budget, notably the additional funding for Orkney#s internal ferry services.But he says this now needs to be a long-term commitment from the Scottish Government and backed by support for new vessels.Commenting on the budget, Mr McArthur said: “Over the last year, along with my Scottish Liberal Democrat colleagues, I have sought to hold the government to account over its handling of this crisis. I have done so, however, constructively and with the interests of supporting constituents and our community at the forefront.“That approach has remained the same during this year’s budget negotiations and I’m pleased that we’ve secured funding for a number of areas that will be important for our country’s recovery. A signicant increase in investment for mental health services, for example, delivers on a key ask from the Scottish Liberal Democrats as we look to address our country’s mental health crisis.“The additional funding for Orkney’s internal ferry services is also very welcome after years of broken promises and Orkney being short changed.  It’s vital, though, that this is not just a one-off pre-election gesture but part of a long term commitment by government that also includes addressing the urgent need for new vessels.“Meantime, I’m glad that cross-party agreement could be reached on this budget at a time when politicians from all parties should be absolutely focused on putting the recovery first.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Centralisation remains the most expensive and most economically damaging option and yet HIAL are determined to continue with it.“The proposal of yet another independent study on generating further economic activity falls far short of what is required here. HIAL should immediately pause this project and commission a genuinely independent report considering the feasibility of an alternative localised model,they refuse to do so then the Scottish Government must step in.“This is a major test of the credibility of the Islands Act which was intended to stop projects like this and ensure organisations considered less damaging alternatives. If organisations are allowed to simply ignore these Assessments then the whole Act will be rendered little more than a PR exercise.”On the issue of staffing he added: “The report also confirms Prospect own survey which found that staff in island communities will not relocate to Inverness. HIAL need to explain how they intend to live up to their promise of no compulsory redundancies as all evidence suggests that widespread redundancies now seem inevitable.#While HIAL has claimed that the report proves that an alternative local surveillance solution is #not viable#, Prospect fundamentally disagrees with this assessment.Mr Avery said: “HIAL’s claim that local implementation is not viable or that this report endorses their position is simply not true. This report states HIAL’s position, it very clearly does not endorse it. Any attempt to claim the contrary is just more desperate spin.“Local implementation of air traffic services including surveillance is how air traffic is implemented at almost every airport across the UK including at HIAL’s own Inverness airport. It is a viable workable and resilient alternative but HIAL refuse to consider it.#Meanwhile, HIAL has promised to engage with local authorities across the Highlands and Islands region as it seeks to deliver #viable solutions# to secure the future of leline air services.The company#s managing director Inglis Lyon, said: “We have always known there would be impacts by undertaking such a signicant and complex change management programme.“To date, there have been no alternative proposals that provide a solution that fully addresses all of the challenges HIAL currently faces.”“We hope that everyone with a vested interest in the long-term future of air traffic services in the Highlands and Islands will work us to deliver viable solutions that will maintain leline services and essential connectivity for generations to come.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

absolutely right and proper that the Scottish Government’s energy consents unit have extended the consultation period for the Stornoway Wind Farm planning proposal, to afford the Stornoway Community Council more time to make any representations with regard to any objections they might have.All the statutory consultees have been aware of the development and its environmental impact assessment since being notied as far back as the th of May  .The residents of Stornoway were also ‘leafleted’, grazing committees and councillors informed, and everyone was invited to view the public consultation events held in the town hall.Not a single objection was forthcoming.The conclusion that there was “no public interest in holding a public local inquiry” was, correctly, based on this.A hastily cobbled together Facebook poll, quickly seized upon, concluded otherwise.Stornoway’s own community council was only formed after the initial notications were distributed, thereby missing out, initially, on the opportunity to participate.They should be heard.They are highlighting several impacts on the town area.All of these were covered in the report that appeared before the planning application board, indeed all of the negative impacts of such a large-scale development were highlighted in the submissions , but, with the proviso that the comhairle work with the developer, statutory consultees and the Scottish Government’s energy consents unit to best mitigate these ‘impacts’.As vice chairman of sustainable development, and also a member of the planning applications board and the Action for Arnish group, I could not ignore these benefits.A lot does hinge on this particular application.The consultation deadline is March th.When it comes to visual impacts, down here in the ‘Republic’ of Point we have been subjected to the sight of no fewer than  turbines as we drive towards ‘Gotham’, for the best part of five years.Only three are of any meaningful benefit to our economy and they belong to us.Does this, to a degree, make them easier on the eye EDFhas long been subjected to a well-orchestrated campaign of opposition.The reasons are myriad, historical and complex.That the comhairle, the Stornoway Trust and most other local landowners failed to capitalise on the potential bounty on our own doorstep in the early s is hardly their fault.Blame previous administrations,you must.Yet for having the temerity to be foreign, have a confirmed lease, have a business plan, a grid connection offer and the finance to capitalise on the potential that we so obviously missed out on EDF have been hugely vilied at almost every turn.Of course it would be betterthe island was reaping all of these financial rewards for the complete benefit to the local community economy , but several factors must be taken into consideration.Should the comhairle be looking to build turbines now The dficulty arises with the ability to fund a project on which the comhairle has absolutely no sighting on the energy price which can be realised at the forthcoming Contract for Dference auction.The council needs to be looking to maximise the potential which can be gleaned from the renewables ‘regime’, while minimising its exposure to risk, unplanned spending, or speculation.The time for building turbines, or investigating the possibility of building turbines, was to  years ago and the opportunity was missed.Circumstances change and I’m sure that those trusted with the policy decisions of the comhairle, armed with all the facts they had at their disposal then, made what they considered the correct choice.The council’s current energy strategy is to attempt to generate income for the people of these islands who do not directly benefit from the current crop of excellent schemes, as listed above.The joint venture between the comhairle and the trust seeks to maximise, with no risk to either body, the potential income from their stake in Stornoway and Uisenis wind farms.That being said, the ‘playing field’ has changed signicantly and the days of ‘wine and roses’, currently enjoyed by those fortunate enough to have had the foresight to build historically, will not, in any way shape or form, be comparable to any future, post CfD, landscape.It would be dficult to go to the bank, ask for a loan to buy an ice cream van, without any idea what the market price for ice cream was.So why is the success of Stornoway Wind Farm so crucial The issue of windfarm development in Lewis is a challenging and complex one that requires negative impacts to be weighed up against signicant benefits. It is always a balanced decision that requires a host of issues to be taken into consideration.Here are a few things to consider for those asked to respond to Stornoway Community Council’s consultation.The island grid, supplied by a shaky distribution link from Fort Augustus through Skye, is full to capacity and closed to new connections – it has been for years.SSEN have decided to replace the failed Skye to Harris cable with a like-for-like kV cable.The new kV cable will offer  per cent more export capacity, enough to provide firm connections for our existing community generators .SSEN will not build a second kV cable without solid demand for it, in terms of prospective wind farms with approved planning permission and solid grid connection contracts.This effectively means that the only way to achieve additional capacity for the islands is to back the planned MW transmission link with its MW of ‘headroom’ for future projects.Only the commercial wind farms, Stornoway Wind Farm, Uisenis Wind Farm and Druim Leathann Wind Farm , have the financial wherewithal to underwrite the planned transmission link .Ofgem will authorise the transmission link onlyStornoway Wind Farm goes ahead.• Any attempt to derail Stornoway Wind Farm is an attempt to derail the £ million deep water terminal, since it is premised on a renewables and a hydrogen economy.With no transmission link, no commercial wind farms, no community wind farms, no low cost electricity, continued dependence on imported fossil fuels, an undermined deep water terminal, an undermined Arnish fabrication yard and a hydrogen economy set back by ten years what is the alternative I love my wild and unspoilt vistas, my beaches and my hills as much as the next islander.I’d love the notion of population growth and sustainability, based on gin, tweed, tourism, crofting and salmon farming to be a reality but it isn’t.There needs to be, and I’ve said this before, a ‘mix’ of the strands that make up the fabric of our island#s economy.And we need to add another strand to move in anyway the right direction to reverse the current trend.There are several sides to every argument.We count the peatland, the visual impact and the hen harriers on the one hand and all the rest, outlined above, on the other.We take everything on board and hope that we are making the right choices for the benefit of more than just Stornoway.If there are any better alternatives, they’ve managed to remain hidden from view for far too long."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ARMADALE-STORES-OPEN-1-scaled.jpg","title":"new shop opens its doors in south","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineWhen the old shop, post office and petrol station closed in , the Sleat Community Trading board, management and staff expected to be operating out of their temporary container in Ardvasar for six months.Covid caused understandable delays, but eighteen months later the staff have now left their cold and draughty temporary shop behind.Shop and post office manager Mhairi Cousins said: “I can’t praise the staff, board and volunteers highly enough.

We’re not complaining about that — the ferry pays its dues — but we have to find a way of reconciling the effect that has on Ullapool#s tourist trade because the place where visitors congregate to admire the loch and the view is Shore Street.In addition, the -year-old sea wall will be replaced with a higher structure to protect the village from rising sea levels.As part of the pre-application consultation, an online Zoom meeting will be held tonight at pm when the proposals will be presented for the first time and as many people as possible are being urged to take part.To join the meeting people can visit the website: http:www.ullapool-harbour or phone    and enter meeting ID:  to listen in.Anyone who wishes to make representations can do so by contacting Fiona Henderson, Affric Limited, Lochview Office, Loch Duntelchaig, Farr, IV AW, or by email: consultation@affriclimited, by th March ."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ARCHIVE-CENT-ANGUS-OG-6.jpg","title":"chust lovely angus og finds a new home in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe collection of the comic strips were handed over to the Skye and Lochalsh Archive Centre in Portree, in recognition of Angus Òg creator Ewen Bain and his family links to Skye.Ewen was brought up in Maryhill, Glasgow but his father John hailed from Waternish and his mother Flora from Staffin.

Picture - Kevin Scott   Belfast Maureen ColemanTwitterEmailMarch   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThe Northern Irish public can resolve any issues around Brexit and should not be written off as “the crazy cousins”, Patrick Kielty has said.The comedian hit out at how Northern Ireland had been viewed as an “inconvenience” during the negotiations and said most people knew there was never going to be a good outcome.He made the comments while discussing his new show, Borderline: A Postcard From the Edge, with Connor Phillips on Radio Ulster.The documentary was recorded in Dundrum, Kielty’s hometown, and will be aired as a BBC Radio  special about Brexit’s effect on Northern Ireland.“The reason I wanted to do it is because we’ve been told in Northern Ireland that we were someone ’s problem, that we were an inconvenience,” he said.“How many headlines have you seen saying, ‘How can you solve Northern Ireland ’, ‘How can you solve this problem ’“Growing up where we grew up, we sometimes had this inferiority complex that we should maybe be someone . Wouldn’t it be nice to be as normal as English people or people from down south “What I’ve realised, and what is at the heart of this show, is that we aren’t the problem. Because of what we’ve been through and the fact that we don’t want to go back there, you should maybe listen to us a bit more because we’re maybe the solution to some of the decisions that you’re taking.”Kielty said that having two nationalities and two identities meant people had to learn about compromise.“Maybe we’re not the crazy cousins after all. Maybe we’re the people that are clean and sober and turned up at your doorstep to say that you might need to see somebody instead,” he added.Kielty, who recently finished shooting his debut movie role in the bittersweet comedy Ballywalter, said there were always going to be problems around a land or sea border and pointed out that Northern Ireland voted against leaving the EU.“We could see this coming down the tracks in slow-motion and were watching everybody  going double-speed down the tracks to get to the place where,you’re from Northern Ireland, you’re going ‘no, no, no’,” he explained.“That’s why I wanted to write this show. Also, it meant having a  to speak to the rest of the UK and say, ‘Actually, we might know stuff that you might think about listening to’.”The dad-of-two, who is married to presenter Cat Deeley, stressed that living in the US during the Trump presidency had taught him that people had a tendency to “nationalise traits”.He said: “When people say to me that Trump is a typical stupid Yank, I say, ‘No, he’s a -year-old man who made his money from construction, cheats at golf and always thinks he’s right. There is one of those guys in every pub in Ireland.“Humans are humans and traits are inidual traits. Everyone is dferent, so to collectively say, ‘That’s that group for you’, is wrong.”Kielty, whose dad Jack was shot dead by loyalist paramilitaries in , also discussed My Dad, the Peace Deal and Me, his award-winning documentary, aired in .He revealed that when the show went out, he was in the US and too frightened to watch it in case he let down people at home.“The responsibility was to tell the story of the place and how far we’d come, but also not to be self-indulgent because we’ve all been through it,” he said.“The only thing I cared about was what people at home thought about it.”Borderline: A Postcard From the Edge will be aired on Radio  on March Belfast Most ReadTributes paid to veteran loyalist Ken WilkinsonBoris Johnson refuses to meet SF leader Mary Lou McDonald during Northern Ireland visitJuror flees to France after UDA threat to set accused freeHughes Insurance moves staff to permanent home working with more jobs and cash paymentCooperative employing paedophile has lease endedTop VideosPlayVideo: Celtic fan struck at Belfast airport - Warning Strong LanguagePlayFight breaks out in front of Carl Frampton#s car in BelfastPlayGerard McMahon mother says police have to learn lessons over death of sonLatest BrexitBoris Johnson urges loyalists not to rail against Northern Ireland protocolArlene Foster: People feel like #lesser citizens# because of Northern Ireland ProtocolBoris Bridge: Foster left bemused by critics of proposed Northern Ireland-Scotland connectionUUP#s Beattie rounds on Coveney for #almost Trumpian levels of spin#Latest from Belfast Parents jailed after over infant son’s broken ribs and bruisesMancharged after north Belfast stabbing Boris Johnson urges loyalists not to rail against Northern Ireland protocol‘Positive meeting’ held over Old Firm after Yousaf postponement threatWinner of Comic Relief egg and spoon race announced,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Neil Gibson, who is chief economist with EY Ireland, said businesses will be able to compete for funds as we exit lockdown.The potential for a strong consumer recovery is signicant with perhaps £bn of consumer spending but we have to be mindful that not all of that will flow back in so there is the potential for prices to rise quite signicantly, which will bring challenges, he said. A phasedto full-time office working is planned for step three of the Executive plan for easing Covid- restrictions.However, analysis of day-to-day costs shows the financial benefits from home-working.At the start of the pandemic last March, fuel prices fell to their lowest level since the  financial crash. The AA had reported last February that Northern Ireland had the lowest prices in the UK, amounting to .p per litre for unleaded on average, and diesel at .p per litre.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseNeil Gibson, chief economist with EY Ireland FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueNeil Gibson, chief economist with EY IrelandA motorist with an average commute of , miles a year and a car that drives around  miles per gallon of petrol would save over £, in petrol costsasked to work at home.Many office workers enjoy a coffee to start the day. In one of Northern Ireland#s more ubiquitous cafes, Costa, a medium cappuccino costs £.. Buying just one cappuccino a day for  days of the year - which does not account for weekends or  days of holidays - will cost £. In comparison, a coffee made by a Nespresso machine at home costs anything from p to p per pod and a spend of £ a year for two drinks per working day alone in comparison. Or Lidl#s Deluxe Columbian Roast and Ground Coffee weighs in at £.. For a bag a week, this will cost £. a year. At lunchtime, workers may avail of a £ meal deal at supermarket chain Tesco, around £ a yearbought daily. Lunch still needs to be eaten at home and a g block of cheese will cost £. at the same supermarket. Buying a loaf of bread for less than a pound and a packet of ham for £ on average, will provide lunch for the week - and some money to spare. Commuters could also save, with an adult travelling by bus from Antrim to Belfast city centre usually being charged £. for a Translink  journey ticket. From Ballyclare to Belfast, a Smartlink ticket is £ or to travel from Coleraine to Belfast by train is £ for a monthly ticket. Even in the Belfast area, a dayLink ticket costs £ for a working week, adding up to £ a month. The American financial planner Pete Dunn has said % of our take-home pay should be spent on clothing. For those earning the average Northern Ireland wage of £, a year, take home pay might be in the region of £, a month. That equals £ a month for clothing. We can now get away with wearing leggings to our desks and are left with £, annually. Many households have found their spend on utilities has increased, having amounted to £- a year for electricity and £ to almost £ for gas or £. on average for  litres of home heating oil before lockdown, according to the Consumer Council. These bills can see a signicant bump now double the time is being spent there during the day. In the financial year ending March , UK households spent £ per week on activities now largely prevented by coronavirus restrictions, allowing room for spending or making up shortfall in other areas. HMRC has now launched a microservice that means even those required to work at home for just a day can claim tax relief for being asked to do so, accepting expense claims for a full tax year worth £ or £ depending on your tax bracket.Dr Esmond Birnie, a senior economist at Ulster University, said those of us who are now working largely from home have gained by not having to pay or spend time commuting, a reduced spend on lunch and relaxed dress code - but we have had to spend in other areas. In the opposite direction, perhaps more is being spent on heating the house, running gadgets, buying paper and ink for the printer and even getting more practical furniture, he said.Belfast Most ReadTributes paid to veteran loyalist Ken WilkinsonBoris Johnson refuses to meet SF leader Mary Lou McDonald during Northern Ireland visitJuror flees to France after UDA threat to set accused freeHughes Insurance moves staff to permanent home working with more jobs and cash paymentCooperative employing paedophile has lease endedTop VideosPlayVideo: Celtic fan struck at Belfast airport - Warning Strong LanguagePlayFight breaks out in front of Carl Frampton#s car in BelfastPlayGerard McMahon mother says police have to learn lessons over death of sonLatest CoronavirusArlene Foster: People feel like #lesser citizens# because of Northern Ireland ProtocolArmed Forces to help with Covid- vaccine rolloutPandemic a chance to change society, Erin Brockovich tells NI summitCoronavirus Northern Ireland: One death and  new cases reported as Boris Johnson visits Enniskillen vaccination centreBan on sport driving kids to self-harm, says Glenavon boss HamiltonLatest from Belfast Boris Johnson urges loyalists not to rail against Northern Ireland protocol‘Positive meeting’ held over Old Firm after Yousaf postponement threatWinner of Comic Relief egg and spoon race announcedPolice investigate attack on two boys in north Belfast‘Positive meeting’ held over Old Firm after Yousaf postponement threat,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Officials hope to be able to administer , shots a week.It is unclear what role the military will play and whether personnel will be involved in logistics, providing a supporting role at vaccination centres, orthey will administer the vaccine. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said: “I authorised the deployment of  defence medics to support the vaccine rollout in Northern Ireland from the end of this month. “Our Armed Forces are once again stepping up to support the UK’s response to the pandemic, working around the clock to protect our people in all four corners of the nation.” The Department of Health has been contacted for comment. Official figures released on Friday suggested the Kent iant of the virus — now the dominant strain in Northern Ireland — was hindering attempts to bring the pandemic under control.The number of people diagnosed with Covid- over the past seven days rose by % compared to the previous week. According to the Department of Health’s daily dashboard, , new cases were diagnosed over the past seven days, compared to , over the previous seven-day period. A department spokesman said: “Data suggests that the B-iant now accounts for % of infections “That means in circumstances where people are having more contacts, the epidemic will grow even more quickly than it has done previously. “This is something that we all need to be cognitive of as we gradually begin to ease out of restrictions in the weeks and months ahead.” The Office for National Statistics’ weekly Covid bulletin, also released on Friday, showed more people in Northern Ireland were infected with the virus than in Scotland and Wales at the end of last week. But there were fewer people here infected than in England, where one in  was infected. The report said: “In Northern Ireland, the percentage of people testing positive appears to have levelled off in the week ending March . We estimate that , people in Northern Ireland had Covid-, equating to around one in  people.” The Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agencyalso released its weekly bulletin on Friday morning. It showed another decline in the number of people losing their lives as a result of Covid-. There were  local Covid deaths recorded between February  and March , down from  the previous week. It was the sixth week in a row in which there was a drop in the number of death certicates citing coronavirus. According to Nisra, there have been , Covid-related deaths in Northern Ireland since the start of the pandemic. A further  new cases and one death were recorded in the past  hours.

There’s been over , tests done and, as far as I’m aware, there have only been three positive cases,” he said. “It’s not backing up the statistics that are being put out there, especially when you consider that most Irish League players are working as well. “It’s madness. We’re taking away everything from kids. Mentally, we are destroying them. Physically, they’re not getting any activity. Socially, it’s been a mess also.”The manager said he could not understand why children were banned from playing sport when they had started ing to school.“Basically, what the Government and people in power are doing is destroying kids’ lives,” he added.“I have two kids. They love football and I’ve seen a dference in them. They’re not the same kids they were six or seven months ago.”Mr Hamilton also pointed to the impact the ban could have on his side’s youth academy, with the club potentially losing four or five kids out of every age group.Addressing Stormont decision-makers, he said: “Come out and think about the kids. We don’t want kids depressed. We want healthy young kids.”Under current Covid rules, only elite-level sport is allowed.A court challenge to the ban cleared its first hurdle on February  after the Department of Health declined to contest the matter.The case, brought on behalf of a child, argues the restriction is harming youngsters’ wellbeing.A judicial review hearing is due to take place on March .Belfast Most ReadTributes paid to veteran loyalist Ken WilkinsonBoris Johnson refuses to meet SF leader Mary Lou McDonald during Northern Ireland visitJuror flees to France after UDA threat to set accused freeHughes Insurance moves staff to permanent home working with more jobs and cash paymentCooperative employing paedophile has lease endedTop VideosPlayVideo: Celtic fan struck at Belfast airport - Warning Strong LanguagePlayFight breaks out in front of Carl Frampton#s car in BelfastPlayGerard McMahon mother says police have to learn lessons over death of sonLatest CoronavirusArlene Foster: People feel like #lesser citizens# because of Northern Ireland ProtocolArmed Forces to help with Covid- vaccine rolloutPandemic a chance to change society, Erin Brockovich tells NI summitCoronavirus Northern Ireland: One death and  new cases reported as Boris Johnson visits Enniskillen vaccination centreLatest from Belfast Company fined £, over roofer’s ‘avoidable’ deathTalks continue over Sarah Everard vigil in London following High Court rulingBusiness Secretary in talks with unions over Liberty SteelEconomist to lead commission on giving Stormont more tax powersParents jailed after over infant son’s broken ribs and bruises,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We were effectively shut down, and that was a moment for us to turn inward to seeing things, self-renewing, re-evaluating what’s important, a time to ask ourselves, ‘Did we get lost along the way ’“This very moment, I feel more hopeful of our future in this reset, in seeing what we’re missing. We are getting back to the values, the soul of who we are and what we need to protect to be a productive, happy, healthy society.”The leadership conference was staged virtually for the first time in its history, drawing , delegates to each of its two days. Attendees logged in from across the UK and Ireland and from as far away as Bermuda, South Africa, Poland and the US.Day one of the conference last week featured speakers including Great British Bake-Off winner Nadiya Hussain and Belfast digital innovation commissioner Dr Jayne Brady.IoD NI national director Kirsty McManus said: “After what has been a dficult year for many in our local economy, it was a great pleasure to gather with such a large audience of business leaders, albeit virtually, to celebrate International Women’s Day.“We were pleased to have attracted such a high calibre of speakers across both days from Ireland and across the world, each of them with their own unique story to tell. “I know these will serve as an inspiration to all of us as we continue our journey of leadership within our own organisations.”Lisa McLaughlin, partner of the law firm Herbert Smith Freehills, which sponsored the event, added: “To attract an audience of more than , from across the world is truly remarkable.“It was fantastic to see many delegates joining virtually who wouldn’t have been able to attend in person. “We are very grateful to all of our speakers for showing true leadership by sharing their knowledge and experience so honestly and powerfully. “They have taught us the importance of seeing failure and adversity through a dferent lens — as an opportunity to grow and develop.” Associate sponsors of the conference included the Open University, Translink, NIE Networks, Investec, SONI, Danske Bank, and KPMG. Mrs Brockovich worked on the largest medical lawsuit in history, involving hundreds of people unknowingly been exposed to toxic waste. The movie about her featured Albert Finney as Ed Masry, her lawyer and boss. As well as Roberts’ best actress Oscar, it earned a best supporting actor nomination for Finney. It was also nominated for best picture, best director and best original screenplay.Belfast Most ReadTributes paid to veteran loyalist Ken WilkinsonBoris Johnson refuses to meet SF leader Mary Lou McDonald during Northern Ireland visitJuror flees to France after UDA threat to set accused freeHughes Insurance moves staff to permanent home working with more jobs and cash paymentCooperative employing paedophile has lease endedTop VideosPlayVideo: Celtic fan struck at Belfast airport - Warning Strong LanguagePlayFight breaks out in front of Carl Frampton#s car in BelfastPlayGerard McMahon mother says police have to learn lessons over death of sonLatest CoronavirusArlene Foster: People feel like #lesser citizens# because of Northern Ireland ProtocolArmed Forces to help with Covid- vaccine rolloutCoronavirus Northern Ireland: One death and  new cases reported as Boris Johnson visits Enniskillen vaccination centreBan on sport driving kids to self-harm, says Glenavon boss HamiltonLatest from Belfast Parents jailed after over infant son’s broken ribs and bruisesMancharged after north Belfast stabbing Boris Johnson urges loyalists not to rail against Northern Ireland protocol‘Positive meeting’ held over Old Firm after Yousaf postponement threatWinner of Comic Relief egg and spoon race announced,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Childrens voices carry down Station Road, in contrast to the eerie quiet of the Lurach Centre play park. Crows cackle in the trees above the Walled Garden and the smell of freshly slurried fields attacks the senses on the way through. The Largantogher Walkway cuts through the town. Through the dense trees lies the disputed Maghera High School site, ground zero in a long-running battle between the council and a local environmental group over its new purpose.

Keep Out notices are festooned along theof the fence. On the corner, two metal slats have been prised off for access. On the way back up the Tobermore Road, two children come down on their bikes, their mum running alongside them. A treat on the final day of homeschooling, perhaps. Back on Main Street, tattered Slaughtneil flags hang outside the Dugout Bar, clinging on in defiance as it continues to wait for a reopening commitment. Two men in caps are chatting outside Kellys Eurospar. A woman opens the door of the pharmacy across the road and calls out. She wants to knowhes going in for the paper.     “Ive no money on me,” comes the reply. The chapel and Fairhill Youth Centre are deserted, but at Crawfordsburn four children move in tandem on the swings. Two teenage girls walk down Glenview, eating from a bag of chips. Its a case of small mercies for the young amid the pandemic. An empty playground at Crawfordsburn. Children have been hit hard by the pandemic. A mounted sign at the entrance to Crawfordsburn Drive urges Solidarity with Palestine. Across the road, a more understated sign from Watty Grahams GAC urges people to take home their rubbish. On the way back in the road, the play park is once again deserted. Neither young nor old are hanging around too long these days. At the corner of Fairhill, McKennas Bar is operating their off licence, and doing a brisk Friday afternoon trade. A table cordoning off the entrance and a screen that drops down from the ceiling bring a sobering reality to the scene. Caitliacuten McKenna is actually reading the Derry Post as I arrive and says it might be the first time shes given us her real name. Shes referring to the Out and About pictures, smiling revellers appeasing the photographer for a two-page spread that is sadly no longer a possibility. For now. Caitliacuten, Caoimhe, and owner Sean McKenna, are all pining for those better days. “Last summer was good craic out in the beer garden,” says Caitliacuten. “Wed always had that space but we revamped it a good bit to make more use of it. Even people who knew it was there were surprised at how big it was when it was overhauled. “Its not too hard to get your , steps a day carrying pints out there.” “Its been a big change, serving people through the hatch and not letting anybody in. Youd have been used to people around the bar a lot of the time,” adds Sean. Sean, Caoimhe and Caitliacuten McKenna hard at work in McKennas Bar. “This is a social hub, youd have had people in and out all the time, whereas out there, though they may be some of the same people from the bar, theyre only staying for a minute and away they go again. “Another change is Im sitting at home on a Friday or Saturday night from  oclock thinking I should be doing something.” The flow of customers interrupts our chat. People finishing up work for the weekend, some calling in on a whim, others a more regular sight. Caoimhe tells me it has been hard on those regulars for whom the pub is very much an arena for conversation. “You do get some who will stand and have a wee chat, because its maybe their only social interaction,” she says. “Its been a while since theyve seen some people, so you get a wee bit of gossip out there that you miss out on having the bar closed. “Then when it gets to  oclock, its mad out there, just before closing. Everybody ends up having a chat with each other at the hatch. “Theyre more likely to meet someone they know then. You also get a lot of people waving in while they are out for their exercise as well.”  We mention the general dferences between the current period of restrictions and the previous lockdowns, but its interesting to view them through the lens of the pub owners. “People arent buying as much drink as they were the first time round,” says Caoimhe. “The weather isnt the same and people cant sit outside in their gardens at the minute. It was a novelty, and people were almost treating it like a holiday. “The town is busier than last time round. It was really, really quiet before, but there is definitely more traffic and more people about than the previous lockdown. “We have noticed a wee bit of a change with a lot more people buying craft beer that they might have had access tothey were out in bars further afield – Belfast or Derry maybe. “A lot of people were making cocktails the first time down. People were asking for all sorts of things at the start that wed never had before because they were making cocktails.” On the way out, Sean draws my attention to the crystal Kalashnikov hanging above the off licence tills. From Russia with love. Covid-, a less welcome import from the East, has brought down a muffled filter on the streets of our towns and villages. Conversation is terse, interaction limited. Hope might spring eternal but you cant gulp on it forever. Magheras Covid rate fell into double figures last week, and despite a slight increase this week, expectant eyes turn towards the decisions of the NI Executive. Heading home on the Coleraine Road, the site of the old police station is busy with construction, the new leisure facilities moving closer to completion. Maghera is poised and ready when normality gets the green light.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Its a brilliant opportunity to showcase those who have gone before. One thing you notice is the pleasure people get from chatting about the past. Everyone has a story to tell. And in a way, it is a therapy for the sporting landscape they crave. In recent weeks Danny Quinn lted the lid on Derrys progression through the eighties. At a glance, it was a mixture of a competitive club scene and school conveyor belts feeding a minor and U group that took Ulster and beyond by storm. Danny puts the current Derry football landscape alongside the one he toiled in. And everything comes in cycles. googletag.cmd.push I agree wholeheartedly. Things are starting to pick up again. Since Derry minors chinned All-Ireland favourites Donegal in a  Clones ambush on the way to a first Ulster title in  years, the Oakleaf has been rising. The digger man is long since gone. The foundations have been poured, the first floor joists have been laid and the brickies are shaping the house towards wall-plate height in project Derry. In an aside, Damian Cassidys new football development committee have peeked into Kerry and Dublin, to see what it takes to turn one house into a new development. They have jotted down their findings, dotted their is and crossed their ts. The planning permission has been applied for. Its a waiting game now to see how much their proposed development can grow. googletag.cmd.push For now, Rory Gallagher is finding a way to get Derrys current side to roof height and beyond. Its often said that defeats are analysed more than wins. There always needs to be a reason for loss. Rory will no doubt have picked through the rubble of their championship defeat last year. The manner in which Donegal pulverised Armagh would suggest that a first Ulster title since  was beyond Derry. But one thing is for certain, victory that night in Celtic Park was well within their grasp. Chrissy McKaigue suggested it as much before the game. Theyd certainly be competitive, he assured me, as I briefly wished him good luck a few hours before the game.     Defensively,theyd have got anything out of the first  minutes, theyd have won a first Ulster championship game since . They were carved open too easy for the first four points. Possession was coughed up and when play ed to Derrys defence, there wasnt a hand put on Rory Grugan , Jamie Clarke or Jarlath Oacuteg Burns as they kicked Geezers charges into a grip of a game they never lost. Trailing by six at the break, Derry were a dferent animal in the second half and had more about them. Had they not been as wasteful during Armaghs  minutes without the black-carded Jamie Clarke, it was another reason why theyd have won. In time, Derry have the tools to build a team to oxter their way into the top table in Ulster. Like Cavan did, to lever themselves inside Donegal and Tyrone at the head of the queue. For now,we are going to break the mould and take a championship performance to a level where we are putting tiles on the roof, a medium to long kick-out strategy needs to be added to the locker. Of Odhraacuten Lynchs  kick-outs, on his championship debut that night,  of them found a red and white jersey. All but two of those won were uncontested and mainly in the defensive parish, eight of them by Padraig McGrogan who peeled into space. It is possession, but it only takes you so far. At the other end, when Derry had the full press on and were gnawing away at Armaghs lead, Blaine Hughes kicked over the top of midfield. It hurt Derrys defence. Three of the kick-outs in particular were won by impact substitute Niall Grimley. It was enough to stem the tide. Odhraacuten Lynchs legs are like rocket launchers. Roll back the years to the  MacRory semi-final over Maghera when he thumped the ball well into their defence. The previous year, when Bessbrook looked like they were taking the semi-final replay to extra-time, Lynch had other ideas. No sooner had the umpires white flag signalled Liam Kerrs equaliser, the Convent netminder grabbed a second ball from behind the goals and arrowed his kick-out down the wing to Conall Devlin. It was instinctive and in the white heat of championship. And seconds later Kevin Smalls winner had Magherafelt into the final. The conundrum for Gallagher is an absence of natural midfielders. Those who will pluck a ball when needed. Conor Glass is only back in the country five minutes and Oisin McWilliams has a paltry  minutes inter-county experience behind him. Aside from Emmett Bradley, thats Derrys out and out midfield options. Niall Holly is not on the  and the rest of the midfielders in the county are mobile runners. The Padraig Cassidys, Ciaran McFauls and the Danny Heavrons. Players who mainly operate there at club level because of their engines rather than a leap to pluck kick-outs. At club level, Lynch, Slaughtneils Antoacutein McMullan and new Glen keeper Connlan Bradleys games all revolve around using the spaces to find these men. Its effective. But, at county level, Derry need to find a couple of longer options. One could be an overload of players on a given wing, something built around a set of signals. For example, plonk Conor Glass on one flank, with breaking ball scavengers within running distance. A tactic could be a low trajectory kick in Glass direction and the area is flooded to create an overload. It wouldnt work every time, but it only needs to come into the game to offer iation. A second option would be the kick to the outside, something Steelstown used to perfection. A line of men down the middle and once goalkeeper Marty Dunne began his run, blue jersies peeled left and right to give him options. Like Devlin did for Lynch in that aforementioned MacRory game. Another example was Michael McEvoys selfless decoy runs, from wing to wing, in the  league final against Leitrim in Croke Park. He rarely handled the ball, but it opened so many doors for others and Thomas Mallons kicking into the spaces was a joy to watch. Kick-outs dictate so much of what direction a game takes. The kicking tees helped coaches find a way of convincing slender U keepers to stay between the posts a year later when faced with kicking a bigger ball, the size five, off the ground. With Stephen Cluxtons high standards, now the number one jersey is an attractive option for young players. Goalkeeping is now cool, but it is only as successful as the tactics further out the field and runs made. Rory Gallagher has found a goalkeeper with an age profile that can helphim grow into a long-term option for Derry. If a short-term success story is found to the countys terrible Ulster championship record, safe possessions in defence must be replaced with winning the ball further up the field to hurt teams and keep them guessing. Only then, will the ridge tiles find themselves on the roof. Rome wasnt built in a day. Neither was a house.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Chivers, the current Club Chairman, was an advocate of kicking the ball. He would later train the All-Ireland winning team he helped build. The relentless kicking drills instilled the message that led to their first All-Ireland final goal. Johnny McGurks high ball created panic in the Salthill defence. Alan Mulholland made a catch, but then he tried to play himself out of danger, Seamus Downeys tackle led to Don Mulholland finding the net. Spirit and kicking in the same sentence, on the biggest of days. “Sometimes we gave it away, but we were a smaller team and the quicker we moved the ball the better,” McGurk adds. “If the full forward line was out in front you kicked it andthey werent, you took another hand to toe. You didnt hold the ball unless you had to.” Hugh Martin McGurk, at , was the oldest player on the starting team. But it took a brave decision at the start of the  season to set them on their way. A defeat to Dungiven in , McGurk felt, was a watershed moment. When John Brennan came in as manager the following year he had a decision to make. Back youth, or go for what had been before. “John had a big part to play in our overall determination and our healthy attitude for winning, he put that into us,” McGurk added. “John came in and bred a pile of young ones from those minor teams. At the risk of being caught out badly, he had the faith in us and it was a big thing.” It paid off when they saw off Newbridge and  years after watching Hurley lt the cup, McGurk looked on as Henry Downey did likewise and he could reach out and touch the championship medal he craved. *** By the start of the  season Brendan Convery took over as senior manager, with Paddy Chivers on board and Laveys dream season was about to get off the ground. Also part of the management team was Paddy Dillon and Brendan Henry, who mixed secretary duties with his magic sponge. “Nerowasnt a man for coaching and ball drills,” Johnny points out. “He wouldve watched training and picked up things about players, it helped him to make changes at important times. “He didnt get too annoyed at any stage. He had the character of a golfer, which he was, so he was relaxed and just watched.” Laveys road to glory began with a very testing game with Castledawson. After a convincing win over Ballerin, it set up a semi-final clash with Dungiven, a rivalry that seemed to pen a new chapter every year between football and hurling. “They were a serious outfit,” McGurk said. “Theyd players with county titles and plenty who had represented the county over the years at all levels. “It was always dog eat dog until itwas over but there was a healthy respect. Lavey and Dungiven wouldve always have got on off the pitch, wouldve sat and had a pint with each other.” After a tight opening spell, Brian McCormicks long kick from defence, won by Seamus Downey, led to Collie McGurks goal and Lavey went on to control the game. With Paddy McGurk and Liam McElhinney clawing for a loose ball, it ended up in the Lavey net to give Dungiven a leline. When Eunan OKane later levelled matters, it took points from McCormick and Johnny McGurk to put Lavey into the county final. After shipping an early Sean D ONeill goal in the final, a similar fisted effort to the Screen net by Seamus Downey had Lavey back in the game. In the final quarter, McCormicks goal opened up a six-point lead before Hugh Martin McGurk netted a third to put the result beyond doubt. “There was never a moment when we felt wed have a chance of winning an All-Ireland,” McGurk replied. “Most teams, they think about the next game and its one less and you just keep going... you think two games ahead, youre gone.” Donegal champions Naomh Columba were waiting in the first round of Ulster in Ballybofey, a team that included county stars John Joe Doherty, Paddy and Noel Hegarty. Two Felix Convery points saw Lavey emerge from a tough encounter. As the players mingled with supporters after the meal back in Jacksons Hotel, there was a sense that something special was brewing. To help create a matchday atmosphere, the team travelled by bus for the rest of the season, even their home semi-final with Armaghs Sarsfields in Ballinascreen. “There was a routine for the last  or  minutes before coming out and wed always have Sean South of Garryowen belting out in the bus as we arrived at the pitch,” McGurk remembers. It was a tempestuous game and another one of inches. In the dying moments, Brian McCormicks scrappy goal, greeted by Collie McGurks somersault to celebrate amid a deafening din of air horns, told Lavey they were in an Ulster club final. The final against Kingscourt was a walk in the park. Despite having Cavan county players Jim Reilly, Pat and Michael Faulkner, Lavey cut through them and won by  points. The party was in full flow when word filtered through out of the blue of their pending All-Ireland Quarter-Final with a star-studded Tir Chonaill Gaels, who boasted Mattie McGleenan and James McCartan in their ranks. “We thought we had the Christmas break and well have a few pints all week,” McGurk remembers of their celebrations eventually put on the back burner. A lack of preparation or knowledge of their London opponents left it another sticky game. It wasnt helped with the wintry weather leaving the game in doubt less than -hours before. “They gave us a fright,” McGurk said, of Laveys three-point deficit as the final minutes ticked away. James Chivers won a throw-in in front of the stand before feeding Seamus Downey, who kicked the ball forward. Their coaching drills always had them finding the man in space. This was dferent. It was the pressure cooker. All shape went out the window. It was all hands to the pump. In the end it was the old dog for the hard road. When corner-back Damien Dohertys low shot came back off the butt of the post,  year-old Anthony McGurk slam dunked the rebound to the net to level the game and Lavey won after extra-time. It was David versus Goliath in the All-Ireland semi-final at Celtic Park against Dublin giants Thomas Davis, who had Dublin players Paul Curran and Dave Foran in their side. Lavey had prepared a scouting trip to watch them in the Leinster final that turned into a bonding day in a Kildare hostelry. The fog had descended by the time the bus, with both players and supporters, arrived in Newbridge and the game was postponed. It took two goals to get Lavey over the line against Thomas Davis, with James Chivers having a hand in both. His fist past teased the Dublin keeper off his line, but the incoming Don Mulholland, who was second favourite to get to the ball, had no reverse gear. He got a hand to the ball, and seconds later Seamus Downey slammed to the net. In the second half, Chivers high ball forward saw Hugh Martin McGurk fouled. He took the kick himself and when it somehow squirmed to the net, Lavey had one foot in Croke Park. They still had to breathe a sigh of relief when a late Thomas Davis snapshot, the last kick of the game, flashed across goal “Theyclapped us off at the end of the game and that was a very fitting thing to do,” McGurk remembers. Teenager Brian McCormick kicked - as Lavey finished the job against Salthill to seal their All-Ireland. It was the final step in an enthralling journey. The outpouring of emotion befitted the endless hours of toil and development to reach the pinnacle. It was a victory for community and channelling everything into putting themselves on the map. Johnny McGurk raises the Andy Merrigan Cup at Croke ParkLater in the year, the Derry championships competitive edge was again evident when Dungiven knocked them off their perch, taking all three titles in one swoop in another tense encounter at Glen. Lavey won Ulster again in  before retaining their title the following year, the last time John McLaughlin paid a visit. There is always the regret of missing a second All-Ireland. After having two men sent off, they left themselves too much to do against Skibbereen, who went the whole way. McGurk feels the sendings off were harsh. “I think wed have won it had we got over them,” he laments. “People say we got lucky the year we won the All-Ireland, but there were other years when we were unlucky not to have won a county title. It was hard to win the Derry championship and like most Derry sides, wed have been competitivewed got into Ulster.” When the parish of Lavey wakes up next Wednesday, the first thing theyll remember will be that magical day,  years ago, when a wave of emotion, on the back of years of toil, carried the Andy Merrigan Cup into their lives.\",\"keywords\":\"Lavey,,Johnny McGurk,All-Ireland Champions,Derry\",\"articleSection\":\"GAA\",\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"description\":\"Thirty years ago Lavey were crowned All-Ireland club champions.

Captain Johnny McGurk looks back on a year of memories and what made their journey special. Michael McMullan tells the story...Spirit. Johnny McGurk may be scanning back  years, but his answer is instant. What immediately comes to mind when he reflects on  and Laveys -game march to dreamland  Those two syllables say it all for the skipper. The Andy Merrigan Cup in McGurks grasp is like the parish he represented on that magical March Sunday. Small in appearance, but massive in every other way. Joxer was just  years of age when Niall Hurley held aloft the John McLaughlin Cup to end a -year Derry championship famine in . Hed always dreamt of winning a championship. “I remember standing behind the goals with a pile of other wains,” McGurk said of that afternoon in Magherafelt when Paddy Chivers pass set up Joe Boyles clinching goal in a - to - win over Ballinderry. googletag.cmd.push Standing in the Hogan Stand, on St Patricks Day , the clubs greatest day, the entire parish congregated below him, awash with orange and black. They emit pride and joy in equal measure. For McGurk, every man, woman and child represented the players the same as the players did for them. It was a two way street. Right down to Parish Priest Fr ODonnells fanatic support of the team. “After games, you werent as much a player, you were just part of the whole setup,” McGurk outlines. “Everybody was in the middle of it and nobody got any special treatment. There was a wave and everybody was on it...thank God it kept going. The spirit and atmosphere in the parish is something that always sticks with me.” googletag.cmd.push The Lavey team and some of their young supporters after the  Derry county final Lavey needed every ounce of their resilience in a season littered with turning points. On the face of it, their Derry, Ulster and All-Ireland finals offered the most daylight on the scoreboard. “Its easy to say that after a final,” McGurk says in disagreement. He digs deeper. Finals were there to be won. Moments from Laveys five-point win All-Ireland final win over Salthill were tense enough. It took a fullsave from Brendan Regan to prevent Mark Butler a certain goal that wouldve levelled the game in the second half. The same player denied Collie McGurk, Don Mulholland and the Downey brothers Hogan Cup glory with a late winning point seven years earlier.     “I dont relax in games, the only time I enjoyed was after them,” Johnny admits. Growing up, to win a Derry championship wouldve been a focus. Winning the top prize was never in his wildest dreams. “To come home with the cup on the Sunday night after the All-Ireland final was one of the most special moments youd ever have in your le.” After stepping off the bus, the kit-bags were stowed away in the dressing room before they paraded into the packed hall. On the stage behind them was a series of stars, each with their name. Goosebumps stuff. “It was a packed house for most of the nights that year,” McGurk recalls. “Population wise, we hadnt the greatest of numbers, but whoever was in any way attached to Lavey was there.” Last autumn, his sons Patrick and James retained their minor championship title on a team playing a ied brand of football. Johnny and Seamus Downey coached the team that includes their sons. The new crop are beacons for the future. Like all the clubs teams, the black star on the back of their jersies is the imprint of , when Lavey stood tallest. *** A November birthday isnt an underage players best friend. Especially one as slight as Johnny McGurk. Derrys U leagues didnt begin until he was overage. After primary school, there was nothing until U. Coming from a family of  and one of eight boys, sport was never far away. Their mother Catherine Bradley came from a family steeped in music and dance in Tobermore, while also lining out for Desertmartin camogs. “To throw a ball or a hurling stick out in the evening was as big a rest for my father and mother as anything,” Johnny said. Sadly, their father Hugh A tragically died after taking ill while watching his sons in championship action for Lavey against Newbridge on at Greenlough in . Growing up, he had high standards. Three things werent accepted, as Johnny outlines pulling out of a ball, not putting in the necessary effort and needlessly lying down. As a  year-old, Johnny shipped a decent tackle on a wet night against Banagher. A voice from outside the pitch, told him, in no uncertain terms, to get back on his feet. It was his father. “I got up brave and sharp, I can tell you,” Johnny laughs. “Hed let you know, but he was your biggest fan at the same time.” Packed into the car, with more bums than seats, to watch his older brother Anthony play for Derry in far flung corners of Ireland ignited a desire to play at the highest level. GAA was always top of the menu, but the local soccer games between Lower and Upper Gulladuff sharpened the competitive edge, the sort that end at dark or a call for dinner. “We were known as Upper Gulladuff. There werent too many of us and there were plenty of them, but that was kicking lumps out of each other every evening,” Johnny remembers. “There was a competitiveness about it which stood to us in later years.” At U level, Lavey were on the wrong side of a few hidings and the dream of winning a championship medal was light years away. Glenullins talented teams were ahead of them. They couldnt compete with the numbers Glen, Bellaghy and Dungiven had, while Kilrea also dished out hammerings. “We were well down the pecking order coming up,” was Johnnys take on the early years. Persistence was an important ingredient in the process. An U title arrived, followed by back to back minor titles in  and . It would form the backbone of a senior team on the cusp of making the breakthrough. “Paddy Chivers wouldve been instrumental in the younger years and the Doctook us as well, he was a great influence,” Johnny points out. Chivers, the current Club Chairman, was an advocate of kicking the ball. He would later train the All-Ireland winning team he helped build. The relentless kicking drills instilled the message that led to their first All-Ireland final goal. Johnny McGurks high ball created panic in the Salthill defence. Alan Mulholland made a catch, but then he tried to play himself out of danger, Seamus Downeys tackle led to Don Mulholland finding the net. Spirit and kicking in the same sentence, on the biggest of days. “Sometimes we gave it away, but we were a smaller team and the quicker we moved the ball the better,” McGurk adds. “If the full forward line was out in front you kicked it andthey werent, you took another hand to toe. You didnt hold the ball unless you had to.” Hugh Martin McGurk, at , was the oldest player on the starting team. But it took a brave decision at the start of the  season to set them on their way. A defeat to Dungiven in , McGurk felt, was a watershed moment. When John Brennan came in as manager the following year he had a decision to make. Back youth, or go for what had been before. “John had a big part to play in our overall determination and our healthy attitude for winning, he put that into us,” McGurk added. “John came in and bred a pile of young ones from those minor teams. At the risk of being caught out badly, he had the faith in us and it was a big thing.” It paid off when they saw off Newbridge and  years after watching Hurley lt the cup, McGurk looked on as Henry Downey did likewise and he could reach out and touch the championship medal he craved. *** By the start of the  season Brendan Convery took over as senior manager, with Paddy Chivers on board and Laveys dream season was about to get off the ground. Also part of the management team was Paddy Dillon and Brendan Henry, who mixed secretary duties with his magic sponge. “Nerowasnt a man for coaching and ball drills,” Johnny points out. “He wouldve watched training and picked up things about players, it helped him to make changes at important times. “He didnt get too annoyed at any stage. He had the character of a golfer, which he was, so he was relaxed and just watched.” Laveys road to glory began with a very testing game with Castledawson. After a convincing win over Ballerin, it set up a semi-final clash with Dungiven, a rivalry that seemed to pen a new chapter every year between football and hurling. “They were a serious outfit,” McGurk said. “Theyd players with county titles and plenty who had represented the county over the years at all levels. “It was always dog eat dog until itwas over but there was a healthy respect. Lavey and Dungiven wouldve always have got on off the pitch, wouldve sat and had a pint with each other.” After a tight opening spell, Brian McCormicks long kick from defence, won by Seamus Downey, led to Collie McGurks goal and Lavey went on to control the game. With Paddy McGurk and Liam McElhinney clawing for a loose ball, it ended up in the Lavey net to give Dungiven a leline. When Eunan OKane later levelled matters, it took points from McCormick and Johnny McGurk to put Lavey into the county final. After shipping an early Sean D ONeill goal in the final, a similar fisted effort to the Screen net by Seamus Downey had Lavey back in the game. In the final quarter, McCormicks goal opened up a six-point lead before Hugh Martin McGurk netted a third to put the result beyond doubt. “There was never a moment when we felt wed have a chance of winning an All-Ireland,” McGurk replied. “Most teams, they think about the next game and its one less and you just keep going... you think two games ahead, youre gone.” Donegal champions Naomh Columba were waiting in the first round of Ulster in Ballybofey, a team that included county stars John Joe Doherty, Paddy and Noel Hegarty. Two Felix Convery points saw Lavey emerge from a tough encounter. As the players mingled with supporters after the meal back in Jacksons Hotel, there was a sense that something special was brewing. To help create a matchday atmosphere, the team travelled by bus for the rest of the season, even their home semi-final with Armaghs Sarsfields in Ballinascreen. “There was a routine for the last  or  minutes before coming out and wed always have Sean South of Garryowen belting out in the bus as we arrived at the pitch,” McGurk remembers. It was a tempestuous game and another one of inches. In the dying moments, Brian McCormicks scrappy goal, greeted by Collie McGurks somersault to celebrate amid a deafening din of air horns, told Lavey they were in an Ulster club final. The final against Kingscourt was a walk in the park. Despite having Cavan county players Jim Reilly, Pat and Michael Faulkner, Lavey cut through them and won by  points. The party was in full flow when word filtered through out of the blue of their pending All-Ireland Quarter-Final with a star-studded Tir Chonaill Gaels, who boasted Mattie McGleenan and James McCartan in their ranks. “We thought we had the Christmas break and well have a few pints all week,” McGurk remembers of their celebrations eventually put on the back burner. A lack of preparation or knowledge of their London opponents left it another sticky game. It wasnt helped with the wintry weather leaving the game in doubt less than -hours before. “They gave us a fright,” McGurk said, of Laveys three-point deficit as the final minutes ticked away. James Chivers won a throw-in in front of the stand before feeding Seamus Downey, who kicked the ball forward. Their coaching drills always had them finding the man in space. This was dferent. It was the pressure cooker. All shape went out the window. It was all hands to the pump. In the end it was the old dog for the hard road. When corner-back Damien Dohertys low shot came back off the butt of the post,  year-old Anthony McGurk slam dunked the rebound to the net to level the game and Lavey won after extra-time. It was David versus Goliath in the All-Ireland semi-final at Celtic Park against Dublin giants Thomas Davis, who had Dublin players Paul Curran and Dave Foran in their side. Lavey had prepared a scouting trip to watch them in the Leinster final that turned into a bonding day in a Kildare hostelry. The fog had descended by the time the bus, with both players and supporters, arrived in Newbridge and the game was postponed. It took two goals to get Lavey over the line against Thomas Davis, with James Chivers having a hand in both. His fist past teased the Dublin keeper off his line, but the incoming Don Mulholland, who was second favourite to get to the ball, had no reverse gear. He got a hand to the ball, and seconds later Seamus Downey slammed to the net. In the second half, Chivers high ball forward saw Hugh Martin McGurk fouled. He took the kick himself and when it somehow squirmed to the net, Lavey had one foot in Croke Park. They still had to breathe a sigh of relief when a late Thomas Davis snapshot, the last kick of the game, flashed across goal “Theyclapped us off at the end of the game and that was a very fitting thing to do,” McGurk remembers. Teenager Brian McCormick kicked - as Lavey finished the job against Salthill to seal their All-Ireland. It was the final step in an enthralling journey. The outpouring of emotion befitted the endless hours of toil and development to reach the pinnacle. It was a victory for community and channelling everything into putting themselves on the map. Johnny McGurk raises the Andy Merrigan Cup at Croke Park  Later in the year, the Derry championships competitive edge was again evident when Dungiven knocked them off their perch, taking all three titles in one swoop in another tense encounter at Glen. Lavey won Ulster again in  before retaining their title the following year, the last time John McLaughlin paid a visit. There is always the regret of missing a second All-Ireland. After having two men sent off, they left themselves too much to do against Skibbereen, who went the whole way. McGurk feels the sendings off were harsh. “I think wed have won it had we got over them,” he laments. “People say we got lucky the year we won the All-Ireland, but there were other years when we were unlucky not to have won a county title. It was hard to win the Derry championship and like most Derry sides, wed have been competitivewed got into Ulster.” When the parish of Lavey wakes up next Wednesday, the first thing theyll remember will be that magical day,  years ago, when a wave of emotion, on the back of years of toil, carried the Andy Merrigan Cup into their lives.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Job Retention Scheme was introduced last March to support businesses and organisations who had to temporarily lay off staff due to the pandemic. The government said it would pay up % of the salary of employees placed on furlough. At one stage, the local council had placed  employees on furlough. The council had agreed to pay the remaining % of the furloughed workers salaries during the lay-off period to ensure they received their full pay. Almost half of the council employees have ed to work but  remain on furlough. Details on the money saved by the council as a result of the furlough scheme were outlined on Tuesday at a meeting of the councils Governance and Strategic Committee. googletag.cmd.push A report shared with councillors at the meeting revealed that from March last year to January this year, the council had recouped a total of pound,, from the furlough scheme. The furlough scheme had been due to end on April  next. However, Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak, this week announced that the scheme would be extended to the end of September this year. The Job Retention Scheme has protected more than  million jobs since its inception last year and has been credited for slowing the pace of job losses as businesses remain shut. googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

These included Brooke Park, Pennyburn Play Trail, Ballyarnett Play Park and Strathfoyle Park. A total of  parks were assessed to be in the upper mid band category which means they offer a good level of play value but require ongoing maintenance. Some of the local parks in this bracket were St Columbs Park, Galliagh Park, Irish Street Park, Rose Court and Lapwing Way. googletag.cmd.push The next bracket was lower mid band and  parks in the Derry and Strabane council area were placed in this category. In Derry, these included Oakland Park, Shantallow Park, the Fountain Park, Bull Park and Primity Crescent. According to the Playboard NI report, these parks offer a low value of play value and will require upgrading to bring them up to an adequate standard. The final bracket was called the lowest. A total of  parks within the council area were placed in this category by Playboard NI, who said the facilities currently offer a minimal level of play value.     Among the local parks listed in this lowest bracket are Stevenson Park, Fountain Hill, Currynierin, Rossdowney Drive, Hazelbank and Ballynagard. The Playboard NI report put forward a number of recommendations on how the local play facilities can be improved. Karen McPhillips, the councils Director of Environment and Regeneration, said they have started to consider the high level costs needed to improve local play facilities and how the funding can be secured. She said the cost would run to tens of millions of pounds. “We do need to think about how we are actually able to do that and the number of funding sources and cocktail funding that we have in the past been very successful at using to refurbish and develop play facilities and can continue to do so, she said. “The better the funding strategy and the more finances as a council we are able to both lever in and create through our own capital plan, the quicker we will be able to get through all of these.” It was agreed at the meeting that a detailed plan should be put together on the costs involved in upgrading the play facilities and brought before councillors later this year for approval.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Two years ago, Derry City and Strabane District Council commissioned Playboard NI to carry out a detailed audit of all the play facilities available in the local area. The findings of the audit were outlined yesterday at a meeting of the councils Environment and Regeneration Committee. The report found that more than a third of the  parks in council area were of a poor standard. This included the Currynierin park. Speaking at the meeting, Sinn Fein councillor Christopher Jackson said the details of the audit report highlighted the scale of the task that is in front of us all in relation to improving local play facilities. googletag.cmd.push He said he had a number of concerns, particularly in relation to areas of the Waterside. Cllr Jackson said many of the issues had been red-flagged for a considerableof time. He said a consultation had been carried out with the community in Currynierin and a new play facility had been designed for the area and taken through the planning process. He said the project has been spade-ready for a number of years but work has not started. “As a council we have built up expectation in the local community but we delivered absolutely nothing,” he said. “It is not good enough that we bring play facilities or schemes up to the stage where it is spade-ready and then it sits on a shelf.” googletag.cmd.push Cllr Jackson asked for a report to be prepared by council officers specically on the Currynierin park plans to show what funding opportunities have been explored and what barriers have been put in place in relation to the delay with the project. Cllr Jacksons comments were supported by Alliance councillor Philip McKinney who described the current play facilities in Currynierin as an absolute disgrace. Cllr McKinney said thatchildren from the area wanted to use good playing facilities they have to cross two busy roads to access a play park in Drumahoe. In response, Colin Kennedy, the councils Parks Development Manager, said that a funding application for the Currynierin park had been submitted to the Department of Justice but it had been unsuccessful.     He said a further application had been made to the Department of Communities for the necessary funding but added that bid had been left underdetermined. Mr Kennedy said they would bring back a comprehensive report on what has been done to date in relation to the proposed Currynierin park and what the next stages are. He added that there was a huge amount of work to be done on how the council is going to find the funding to deliver on all the proposed play schemes in the local area. DUP Alderman David Ramsey described the park at Rossdowney Drive in the Waterside as dangerous and said that what equipment remained needed to be removed and replaced. It was agreed at the meeting that a detailed plan should be put together on the costs involved in upgrading the play facilities and brought before councillors later this year for approval.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The call comes from Lilian Seenoi-Barr, from the North-West Migrants Forum, who was speaking after figures showed the Derry and Strabane district recorded the biggest increase in racist incidents in the North last year, as well as the second-largest increase in racist crimes. Speaking to the Derry News, Mrs Seenoi-Barr said: “Racism and hate crime instil fear into entire communities and undermine social cohesion. “We cannot allow such fundamental rights violations to persist at their current high levels. googletag.cmd.push “We need to have serious conversations about race and racism in Derry before it gets out of hand. “It is now time for Derry City and Strabane District Council to develop a local action plan to tackle racial inequalities and racism in Derry. “We also need political and religious leaders in the city to take a proactive approach to tackle racism and prejudice towards people of minority ethnic backgrounds. They cannot simply be bystanders. “Political will and leadership are vital to countering racism and hate crime. The opportunities enjoyed by both political and religious leaders to shape opinions and set agendas come with a responsibility to unequivocally denounce expressions of racism and related intolerance.” googletag.cmd.push Sinn Feacutein Foyle MLA Karen Mullan has said the new figures were very concerning. “There is no place for racism in our community. “It’s imperative on us all to work together as a society to stamp out racism and a build a more equal society free from discrimination. “All incidents of racism should be reported to and dealt with by the police.” On Monday, Mrs Seenoi-Barr was among a number of anti-racism groups who met with local councillors to discuss racism, sectarianism and anti-semitism. During the meeting, she told councillors that the Derry City and Strabane area had seen the largest increase in racist incidents between January  and December , adding that in her view it was fair to say we are going backwards in relation to racist incidents in the city.     Foyle SDLP MLA Sinead McLaughlin described the reported rise in racists in- cidents in Derry and Stra- bane as deeply disturbing.  She said: “In Derry we are proud to call ourselves a welcoming city but these statistics expose how that welcome does not always extend to all. “It is also incredibly worrying that so few victims actually receive justice. Of the  racist hate crimes recorded in Derry and Strabane policing area last year, outcomes such as charges or cautions were recorded in just four cases from April to December. “I suspect that these statistics only just scratch the surface. The PSNI must work to build trust with black and minority ethnic communities and ensure victims are adequately supported. That must be an urgent priority. “Every single one of us has a role to play in actively challenging racism, in all its forms, within our communities. These conversations arent always going to be easy or comfortable, but they are absolutely vitalwe are to stamp out racism and build a society in which everyone feels safe and respected.” Meanwhile, a UUP councillor on the local authority has apologised after making insensitive comments in relation to the Black Lives Matter movement during Mondays meeting. Alderman Derek Hussey said the Black Lives Matter movement was not fully inclusive, and added that this weeks meeting was addressing issues which go beyond Black Lives Matter However, in a statement issued by his party the following day, he said: “I apologise for my comments which were insensitive. “I was grateful for the opportunity to hear from those who presented and to expand my own understanding of racism in Northern Ireland. The Ulster Unionist Party opposes all forms of racism and we want to see hate crime legislation strengthened in Northern Ireland as soon as possible.       --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Whenever I got in to do my A-Levels, I didnt have as much time for soccer.” He is also a talented Gaelic footballer. His attacking prowess helped his school St Michaels Enniskillen to prestigious MacRory and Hogan Cup titles in . It attracted the attention of Fermanagh senior manager Ryan McMenamin, but Glynn turned down offers to join up with the Erne squad to concentrate on his soccer career. googletag.cmd.push “Declan got in contact with Ballinamallard manager Harry McConkey and I had worked with Declan through the IFAs Club NI system for a couple of years at U and U,” Glynn told The Derry News. “When he heard the Ballinamallard season was null and voided, he gave Harry a call to seeI would be interested in giving it a go until July. It was an open offer, so I couldnt turn it down and in July, Derry can either offer me a contact full time or I can go back to Ballinamallard.” Glynn joins other signings Marc Walsh, Will Patching, William Fitzgerald and Joe Hodge ahead of Derrys league opener, away to Longford next Saturday.     Just three days after his arrival at the Brandywell, Glynn played  minutes in the first game, a goalless draw against Bray, followed by another  minutes in a - draw with Finn Harps and half an hour last Sunday against Bohemians, another game ending goalless. “I have been training nearly every day, as much as I can. Im trying to get the minutes in because its been a while since I have played soccer,” points out Glynn, who hasnt featured since Ballinamallards pre-season. “At the minute, I am enjoying it and its going well so far,” he adds. At the minute, it involves a -mile round trip from his home in Derrygonnelly. “The team are training four mornings a week and Im in for all of them, it changes every week with the friendlies. I am in no set routine, but hopefully when the season starts Ill get into a routine and be more settled.” Glynn speaks of the buzz in the Derry camp, with the hopes of getting their season off to a winning start against Longford, who were promoted from the First Division after a - win over Shelbourne last season. “Its exciting, there is good hunger in the squad to succeed,” Glynn said of his progress so far. “I have played with a few of the lads before and they have been great and very welcoming. “It is a very young squad, there are a few lads who have been there and done that and they are setting a great example. Declan has been telling us to learn from them as best as you possibly can.” “For now, it is a matter of keeping pushing, keep the head down in training every day and see what comes of it. Hopefully things go well.” Derry lost - at Dundalk in last seasons opener and chase a first winning start since their - win at home to UCD in . In the last  seasons, the Candystripes have won their first game on four occasions, drew - with Shamrock Rovers in  and last the other five.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The redevelopment plan has the potential to provide a boost for existing traders who have been at the heart of the town centre economy for decades.News of progress to redevelop the town centre site comes after recent confirmation that the location is one of a number of high profile schemes included in a real estate portfolio designed to attract potential national and international developers and investors.Newry, Mourne and Down is one of five local councils which are part of the Belfast Region City Deal consortium and is hoping for a share of a near poundbn Treasury and Northern Ireland Executive investment package.As work to secure city deal funding continues, the local authorities which form the consortiumhave come together to launch a new portfolio of real estate development opportunities within their respective areas with the aim of attracting global investment, boosting tourism and creating sustainable regeneration.The Irish Street regeneration proposal is one of  schemes being showcased in the so-called Belfast Region Investment Guide which have been identied by the ious councils. The portfolio details potential uses for each site with the guide used to market the development opportunities to developers and investors, both locally and overseas.City Deal members say the compilation of the portfolio is the next step in the progression of the consortium with the overriding aim of creating more and better jobs and attracting investment.Newry, Mourne and Down is hoping to secure money from the city deal for a multi-million pound flagship tourism project in Newcastle, with the so-called Mournes Gateway proposal a series of ambitious projects which includes a gondola ride into the heart of the Mourne mountains..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/10Mar2021-Council.jpg","title":"Council 159% rates rises third lowest in province  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council has imposed the third lowest rates rise in Northern Ireland.The above inflation .% hike to fund the local authorityrsquos poundm budget was unanimously agreed last week by local politicians who described the increase as ldquofair and balanced.New figures confirm that the rise was the the third lowest across the provincersquos  councils, while three local authorities mdash Antrim and Newtownabbey, Lisburn and Castlereagh and Mid Ulster mdash froze their district rate.The smallest increase of .% was made by Mid and East Antrim Council with the second lowest imposed by Fermanagh and Omagh Council mdash .%.With Newry, Mourne and Down in third spot in terms of the lowest increase, fourth place went to Derry City and Strabane Council which increased its rate by .%.Belfast City Council hiked rates by .%, while Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon sanctioned a .% rates rise.

Cars parks across the resort were full for most of the weekend.People who live in the resort are particularly concerned that with the deadly coronavirus still in circulation, such a large influx of visitors has implications for public health.Local politicians had also highlighted the need for people to continue exercising social distancing and adhering to public health advice, insisting that there was no room for complacency at this crucial time, despite and increase in positive Covid cases across the district and the roll-out of a comprehensive vaccination programme.Senior Newry, Mourne and Down Council officials had met with police ahead of another anticipated busy weekend in a bid to signicantly reduce the number of visitors, with council officials placing cones in the Tollymore and Bryansford areas, with others located at Carrick Little near Slieve Binnian and in the Mournes.In addition, police set up a number of rolling checkpoints on the main approach roads to Newcastle last weekend, with officers also deployed in the heart of the resort.Police also managed parking at the hugely popular Bloody Bridge area on the outskirts of the resort, expressing concern that some drivers had shown little care or attention for pedestrians or other road users by the way they had parked their vehicles, one of which was a Transit van.Mournes councillor, Willie Clarke, has praised the response from PSNI, local council, the districtrsquos Policing and Community Safety Partnership, the emergency services and others for their response to managing visitors to main tourism hotspots.He said there was a greater presence on the ground which has been welcomed by residents following the ldquodangerous level of visitors who flocked to Newcastle and other ious parts of the district the previous weekend.ldquoI welcome the co-operation between all the ious agencies to improve the safety of residents, continued Cllr Clarke.ldquoThe local council placed traffic cones in a number of areas popular with visitors, while the PSNIhad vehicle checkpoints at main arterial routes into Newcastle area. There were also a number of mobile police patrols in the resort, with tickets issued to motorists for causing an obstruction at a number of areas including the Trassey Track and Bloody Bridge.Cllr Clarke said these measures helped ease the pressures on what he described as ldquonatural environmental treasurers as the district moves into the Covid recovery phase.He added: ldquoIt is clear that extra resources are required to manage and maintain our rights of ways, forests, beaches and our parks. The local council and PSNI will continue to share social media messaging on restricting travel to within  miles, with police confirming that they will continue to remain active across the entire district, not just Newcastle.Many people took to social media after another busy weekend to ask why visitors from outside the district who had travelled quite a few miles were not stopped and sent home.

So I started to think about what I could do and this is where the business came from.After  years of working with adults with learning disabilities, Louise came up with the idea of creating sensory boxes.ldquoRiley is registered blind and is deaf, so he needs a lot of sensory input. I came up with the idea of providing affordable sensory toys and products for children who need them, explained Louise.ldquoAs a special needs mum, I find thatyou go online to find sensory toys, they are hugely expensive.ldquoIrsquove spent four years buying stuff for Riley and I have a good idea of the things that you wouldnrsquot necessarily buy as a sensory product, but that will provide a similar sensory experience.ldquoI tailor my boxes to the child and find out about their sensory needs to determine what type of things would help them, such tactile items or fidget stuff to help with concentration and children who are hyperactive, or visually stimulating items such as light-up toys, calming products or growing products for a darkened room. There are so many sensory needs out there.Louise has been supported from the Go For It Programme in association with Newry, Mourne and Down Council.The programme is part funded by Invest Northern Ireland and the European Regional Development Fund under the Investment for Growth and Jobs Northern Irelandprogramme.Louise sells mostly through her Facebook page and word of mouth recommendations.ldquoI put up a post on Shop Ireland and I wasnrsquot really expecting the numbers of responses that I got. In the run-up to Christmas I had  orders. I had to turn people away, she explained.The support of the Go For It programme was a key part of the impetus to get the business up and running.The programme is delivered free of charge by a team of experienced business mentors through Northern Irelandrsquos wide network of enterprise agencies and provides expert advice and help with developing a robust business plan to help turn ideas into a commercial enterprise.Louise joined the Go For It scheme through Down Business Centre and was able to access training.ldquoIt gave me the expertise in what to concentrate on first - I went and saw the accountant and got registered, she says.ldquoI was a bit apprehensive because I had absolutely no business experience, just a good idea. But the project gave me the reassurance that it was a good idea and we have put together a business plan.ldquoJoan OrsquoHara has helped me massively throughout the last few months and continues to be available for guidance should I need it or would recommend the best people to talk to in the subject I need.More recently, Louise has got her mum involved, branching out into making tactile and fidget cushions which are suitable for dementia patients and people with ADHD, autism and anxiety.Cllr Laura Devlin, chairwoman of Newry, Mourne and Down Council said: ldquoThe Go For It Programme provides new entrepreneurs with accessible, free and tailored support in the start-up stage of her business in areas such as financial and business planning, and sales and marketing to help get their business up and running.ldquoI wish Louise every continued success in developing and growing her enterprise and encourage anyone thinking about starting their own business to get in touch with the Go For It Programme.Joan OrsquoHara, business advisor at Down Business Centre added: ldquoItrsquos great to see Louise doing so well with a product that will undoubtedly support a childrsquos development through sensory play.If you have a business idea yoursquod like to develop oryou are thinking about starting a business contact the Go For It Programme on    or visit: www.goforitni.

While friends with John and Junior, Alan said he was also proud to have known their father very well.ldquoTo say that Jim was an acknowledged engineering genius is no overstatement, he continued.ldquoJim told me that he served his apprenticeship at Stewartrsquos Motor Works in Downpatrick before World War Two and thought the world of James Stewart whom he referred to as lsquogolden handsrsquo because he could turn his hand to anything.ldquoJim then worked for the former Ulster Transport Authority during the war and opened his Antrim Road Garage in Ballynahinch in late  which he purchased with a loan from a family friend.Alan also revealed that Jim and his son John sponsored him when he used to race cars.He continued: ldquoOnce Jim, or JN as he was known, started to help me with mechanical development, I quickly moved from being a back marker to a front runner in no amount of time.

It is intended that existing school campuses would be used ldquopending capital investment for a one site solution.The final decision on the way forward will be taken by Mr Weir who met via Zoom with a delegation of parents and St Patrickrsquos Grammar representatives last Wednesday.The Board of Governors at St Patrickrsquos is opposed to the merger, while both De La Salle and St Maryrsquos are in favour of the plan going ahead.Members of St Patrickrsquos Board of Governors have urged parents, past pupils and the public to respond to the ongoing consultation, asserting that the outcome ldquowill have a lasting impact, not just in the school, with staff and pupils, but its ramications will be felt throughout the local community in East Down.The Board of Governors and school management say they do not believe the case has been made for the proposals as currently outlined and will be re-stating the reasons for this as part of the public consultation process and insist that they are focused on achieving the best outcomes for all concerned.De La Salle High School says the merger will ensure that families in the greater Downpatrick area will have an opportunity to finally get behind the vision to secure the town as a model of good practice, where childrenrsquos education is a priority, while St Maryrsquos High insists that an all-ability school can cater for the gted and talented and also support children who need it.Mr Harvey said he was delighted to be able to secure the meeting with the education minister on behalf of St Patrickrsquos representatives and the ldquomany concerned parents who have contacted him on what he described as ldquothis important issue.He said has been working with them over recent days to ensure that their opposition to the current proposals is made clear to Department of Education officials.ldquoThese efforts culminated in last weekrsquos meeting with the education minister and served as a productive opportunity to enlighten him in respect of many of the key issues on the ground that, I believe, make the current amalgamation plans wholly unworkable, said Mr Harvey.ldquoThe plans, as proposed by CCMS, would reduce academic choice for parents and children from Downpatrick and the surrounding areas.ldquoIt would deny many Catholic schoolchildren the opportunity of attending a local selective Catholic grammar school and the proposed intake criteria would place children living in the rural areas beyond the urban Downpatrick area at a severe disadvantage in terms of the likelihood of being offered a place.Mr Harvey is also urging anyone who has views on the merger of the three Downpatrick schools to take part in the ongoing public consultation which closes on March

True to his word, he informed me right away, sayingPeter Scudamore could do it, so could he.The race saw  of the  entries go to post, with Frankie making the early running. With three fences to go, the leader was Dave Anthony, ridden by John Bright, with Brian Hamilton chasing on John Turleyrsquos Friendless Friend.Anthony then crashed out and Hamilton was unseated from Fearless Friend, leaving Frankie on Killinick Robyn to win from Darragh Cross owner Judith OrsquoGradyrsquos Another Partner, ridden by James Lamb, with Raymond Martinrsquos Kasperova and Paul Parkin third.The best horses that Frankie rode over the years were Jim Gloverrsquos Hopersquos Choice, trained by his father and namesake, Frankie Sr.Frankie Sr also owned and trained young Frankiersquos first winner under rules, Bright Trick, in a Hunterrsquos Chase at Downpatrick in .One of his most notable winners was Joe Rearsquos Palo. Trained by Peter McCreery, it was the result of a big gamble the day that Frankie rode it to success at Navan.His reward that day from Joe, renowned as Downpatrickrsquos ldquobusy draper, was a new suit. I believe he still wears it on special occasions.The following week at Johnnie Grantrsquos Ramble Inn at Ballykilbeg, Frankie threw a big party for all his friends in the sport.

Top riders like Patrick Mullins, Derek OrsquoConnor, Noel McParlan, Jamie Codd, and Barry OrsquoNeil are as effective as any professional.They are working with horses every day of the week, so it is a big disappointment for them and many others.Congratulations to Cumbria- based Downpatrick jockey Danny McMenamin on riding his th career winner.

H. Shepard’s six-feet-apart Pooh and Piglet and the stay-at-home Christopher Robin, the online exhibitions applied a ied array of cartoons related to the pandemic and its irritating accoutrements. There was a ‘Guide to How to Self-Isolate’ with cautionary forewarnings on ‘How Not To!”There were cartoons about public transport, walking in the country, home-alone pleasures, pastimes and preoccupations, and staying safe, happy and well. \"First Day Back at School by Cartoonist Bill StottThe artworks radiated optimism and good humour, with a liberal garnish of sentiment and nostalgia, “to remind us” said Dr Beetles, “that even during times of greatest national challenge, Britain remains strong in spirit.”And now, as our youngstersto their classrooms, in dfering ages and proportions around the UK, the Chris Beetles Gallery is presenting a new online exhibition of cartoons and illustrations collectively entitled ‘Back to School.Running to March . , one of the headline artworks, very appropriately, is St Trinian’s cartoonist Ronald Searle’s ‘Welcome back Molesworth!’ illustrating his other comically dysal school.Nigel Molesworth was the supposed author of a series of books, illustrated by Searle, about le in an English prep school called St Custard’s.\"Kathryn Lamb CartoonThe first book, ‘Down with Skool!’ was published in October .‘Welcome back Molesworth!’ appeared on the front cover of The Young Elizabethan Magazinein October .The cartoon shows a black-robed teacher, grimly shaking his cane at reticent-ee Nigel.The narrative accompanying the online exhibition states, “Children ... It’s freedom at last no more pretending that your parents know anything at all about anything, least of all turning a computer on. “It’s Monday morning, the school term commences, and the cartoonists are here to help ease you back in, and reassure you about the orange, stick-thingy that nice Mr Hancock wants to shove up your nose twice a week.“Parents ... Hooray, holidays start now, and don’t pretend you were any good at that school stuff anyway, just get going again on that unfinished West Wing Box Set and the Midsomer Murder repeats. “Quickly, now, they will be home again at four o’clock! No more pretending to work, no more staring at the screens while longing for friends and teachers and proper games. But it might all be a bit scary, this re-run of the First Day of School, so we need a bit of parental ingenuity to ease them back in!”Cartoonist Bill Stott’s picture of a little boy, back in school with a broken arm bearing a badly spelt note from mother to teacher, beautully illustrates the “bit of parental ingenuity”!The exhibition’s narrative continues :“The teachers have missed the children…and have already forgotten all the drawbacks in their role as ‘loco parentis’, and it surely won’t take long to re-establish the dynamics of the relationship.” Amongst the many other uproarious artworks is cartoonist Edward McLachlan’s graffiti on the school wall of St Cuthbert’s Comprehensive - ‘Owr Inglish Teecher is rubish!!’Cartoonist Nick Newman is represented by a number of his drawings, mostly about Covid testing.One depicts a little boy who can’t go back to school, as the wee lad’s mum explains, because “he has a swab stuck up his nose”.The exhibition narrative optimistically philosophises “social scientists tell us that back under the watchful eye of the teacher and the stimulating input from their peers, the children can expand their le skills and social integration and get out of those bad habits they slipped into at home and of course how right they are!“We are told that children need a bit of discipline in their lives and that they crave clear guidelines and strict parameters of behaviour. “Parents are such softies that their kids are all dying to get back to school so that can follow the rules and get stuck into a bit of serious social distancing. “But the pleasures of the day can’t last forever and from the blissful, busy comradeship of schooldays children must be ed to their homes.”A homecoming that’s wonderfully illustrated by cartoonist Kathryn Lamb, whose little boy, home from his first day back at school, tells his father “Homework  Sorry, I’m not working from home anymore.” For more information about the ‘Back to School’ exhibition, and the gallery’s other online shows, plus their Instagram, Facebook and Twitter feeds, visit www.chrisbeetles  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularBoris Johnson was prepared to cut NI loose, says ex-advisor to Theresa May – but we also failed Northern Ireland over BrexitMichelle O’Neill refuses to greet Boris Johnson during Northern Ireland visit after PM decides not to meet with Sinn FeinCovid: Orange Order preparing for possiblity of typical Twelfth... but no final decision yet‘IRA offered me revenge upon UVF killer – I turned them down’Peter Robinson: Sinn Fein holds an airbrush in one hand and a halo in the otherMost PopularBoris Johnson to fly into Northern Ireland today as centenary plans are revealedLeo Varadkar left red faced after wrongly claiming Sinn Fein has no Protestant TDsMan accused of exposing himself in Subway had Kinder Egg full of drugs in his backside, court toldCovid: ‘Apprentice Boys hopeful of bigger parades than last year’Government sets out plans to mark Northern Ireland’s centenary – and possibility of G meeting coming to NI this year                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\" ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-cmTdod sc-jwKygS gRMrbt\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadLocal BuysAdvertise My BusinessPublic NoticesFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"  to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

If nationalism wins then unionism must face the reality of a border with Britain not just in the sea but as a matter of fact. Such a referendum would have to be a once in a generation thing as a referendum every seven years isn’t a test of democracy but rather a war of attrition.The terms of such a referendum should be that another one couldn’t be held for another  years unless a majority of people in an assembly election voted for parties that were clearly designated as nationalist in which case it would be reasonable for a secretary of state to call a referendum at any time. The Good Friday Agreement is not compatible with an Irish Sea border. If the British, European and American governments want to respect the Good Friday Agreement and republicans want a border poll then let us have one in     on the understanding that the result will be respected unlike the result of the Brexit referendum which was not respected for the two-thirds of unionists in Northern Ireland who voted for the winning side.Mr RG McDowell, Belfast BT——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

It is judged on those awards and the quality of your signings, and wersquore proud wersquove managed to gain that title.ldquoPenarth is also home to drum and bass clothing brand Concrete Junglists which has become known worldwide, and High Contrast ndash who is a drum and bass icon ndash was born here.Talking more about how he got into the industry, Mr King said: ldquoI always wanted to be involved in the industry and realised by  I wasnrsquot going to make it as a musician.ldquoIt just wasnrsquot coming together and didnrsquot feel like it was me.ldquoItrsquos something Irsquom really passionate about but it started off as quite a light-hearted thing just giving away free music.ldquoThen it started to grow slowly and some people started to approach us, and then in  it just boomed with the top  acclaim. We started getting lots more people approach us, and wersquore now in a great position. Itrsquos been surprising.A host of top DJs including Miaszmafrom Florida, and Austrian duo Divisionand Seculahave signed up to the label, and Incurzion has grown exponentially in Florida, Austria, Germany and Russia.But strangely, Mr King says, he doesnrsquot think the label is known about by many people in Penarth.ldquoI feel wersquore starting to get rewards now for the way wersquove tried to really stand out in what is a saturated market, he said. ldquoWe feel wersquove done that by trying to offer a dferent sound and brand.ldquoOur style is deep and dark drum and bass, dark branding and graphic design ndash almost like horror.ldquoBut most of all itrsquos about bringing on board top quality musicians, and thatrsquos what wersquove managed to do.ldquoItrsquos been a massive shock to see how much interest our music is getting from Florida since Miaszma signed. Itrsquos really exciting.ldquoI donrsquot think people living in Penarth really know about this townrsquos standing in the drum and bass industry. Itrsquos quite unbelievable for a small town to have such a big connection, and I think it needs to be celebrated more.As lockdown hit last March, so did all of Incurzionrsquos events, which kept Mr King busy every week.He believes musicians have been ignored throughout the pandemic, which he worries may have caused a mental health crisis in the industry.ldquoAs live events go wersquove been absolutely decimated, he said. ldquoThe financial impact of that on venues and on companies like ours, as well as inidual musicians, has been unbelievable.ldquoBut fortunately for us our digital sales have been through the roof. That might be because people have more time on their hands at home to explore dferent genres, and itrsquos great they feel they want to purchase our music.ldquoBut the major thing for this industry is the live events, wersquore nothing without those, just like every other label and performer.ldquoThe funding has been awful, and the impact this will have on mental health seems largely ignored.ldquoThis is what we do every single week, and to have that stripped away from you for so long is dficult. Itrsquos also our place to network, so to not have that space will have long-term ramications.ldquoI know venues in Cardf that have had next to no support, andit carries on you canrsquot see how theyrsquod survive.With cases going down by the week, he hopes the music industry will be able to start up just in time for those venues and for musicians.ldquoWersquore obviously very eager to get back to le as it was, and to pick up where we left off.To find out more about Penarthrsquos Incurzion Audio, visit https:www.incurzionaudio Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
