In his second spell at Spurs, Bale has carved out a niche which, though not entirely virtuous, could be very useful this week.

Spending as much time indoors as we all have lately, setting it up is something that would improve my life immeasurably. A competent friend of mine helped me get the projector up in my last place. But between lockdowns and just plain asking too many DIY-related favours from the poor guy, I realised if I wanted to put something up on the wall, I was very much on my own. So I did what all humans do in times of need: I turned to the internet. Being an older millennial, I’d assumed that TikTok was beyond me. It’s the place where young people mime to music, right? Could the TikTok community really help? I have to confess, I was sceptical. To test the water, I decided to see what help I could get for putting up a picture – using hashtags to search TikTok for relevant videos. The picture I sought to hang is a wonderful illustration of my beloved cat Itzi, to serve as a constant reminder of who’s boss in the house. So it wasn’t something I wanted to mess up. To start with, I find a top tip from Kim, a home decor blogger who posts TikTok videos under the handle @clippercityhouse. She suggests filming myself holding a picture at different heights to decide on where I should place it. This is a great idea if you’re working on your own – as I was.I put the hook in the wall, and move on to the fiddly part of trying to get the hanging wire over. After struggling for a bit, @goodleyearth comes to the rescue with his tip to use an unexpected item of cutlery. Under calm tutelage, I place a fork upright on the nail and use it as a guide to get the picture on – I get it right the first time. Now this is the stuff I’m here for! I discover that DIY videos on TikTok are like having access to countless experts sharing learned knowledge, saving hours of misery, frustration and unnecessary holes in the wall. No more skipping through long, painful videos trying to find the relevant 30 seconds. After some nervous tea drinking, the picture of Itzi remains vertical. And so bolstered with caffeine and perhaps too much confidence, I set my sights on the shelf for my projector. After a quick search, I find that @haizzly has a useful video about prepping and priming wood. Soon the board is sanded, primed, sanded again, painted (is it starting to sound like I know what I’m doing yet?) and left to dry overnight. Woodshop Diaries – under the handle @woodshopdiaries – shows me how to drill wood without splitting, and even takes me through the basics of how a drill works in a cheerful and straightforward way. While it’s not necessarily essential for this particular task, it was a nice touch I really appreciated. And @constructiontips proves to be a treasure trove of, well, construction tips. Most of them are for tasks far above even my most lofty ambitions – however, there is a nifty trick I can see myself using in the future. It’s actually intended for picture hanging, but works well enough for a small shelf. Using tape and cardboard, I mark the drill points and have a template of where to drill the wall. Minimal fuss and no scrawling. Next, I check out @mcp_thats_me, who gives a brilliantly efficient overview of getting screws in the wall. Once this is done, I’m finally able to mount the shelf. The other useful thing about these TikTok tutorials is that they play on a loop, which is particularly handy if your hands are covered in paint, or you’re holding something heavy.A few days later, the shelf is still standing, the projector is working as it should and the wall is looking more interesting than it has in a long time. As I sit, I start to think about other projects that could now be possible. Revarnishing a coffee table? My previous doubts abated, I fire up TikTok to find out.

The upcoming UN Climate Change Conference, COP26, will be the last realistic chance to correct our shared global course in a world overheating due to human activity and fossil fuel burning. In advance of the summit next November, the Dublin Climate Declaration will be issued, with many key figures in climate geopolitics backing a global call to action.That will be the culmination of two days of deliberation next week under the Dublin Climate Dialogues (DCD) initiative, with representatives from the biggest carbon-emitting countries taking part. Delegates from the UN, international leaders in politics and business, climate justice campaigners and representatives of countries most vulnerable to the climate threat will gather around the virtual table.There is new optimism about climate action, seen in big polluting countries such as the US and China promising to do more, and giant corporations embarking on meaningful crusades to achieve net-zero emissions. There are some too, undoubtedly, availing of the opportunity to “greenwash” or disguise their continuing fossil fuel use.At one level, “climate risk” is the new huge headache for every major business enterprise, which may prompt financial crises that will be a whole lot worse than the recent banking crash if capital markets believe it has not been correctly factored into asset and corporate valuations. And yet there are grounds for hope in the attractive price of renewable energy – especially solar and wind, the cheapest energy source, and getting cheaper.The one indisputable truth, however, is what science indicates. And that points to a glaring ambition gap. More greenhouse gases are going into the atmosphere and global temperatures are rising faster than at any time in human history.Nature, instead of being a central part of the solution, is being placed under intolerable strain. All this is pushing Planet Earth closer to an abyss when heightened risk of irreversible climate change will kick in from 2030 on.Factoring in current decarbonisation rates – rather than promises – the hard data indicates global climate ambition has to increase by a factor of 10 to meet the Paris Agreement goals, and that is still no guarantee it will arrest climate disruption.Science indicates 2021 is the critical year in setting a new course for the planet in the hope of avoiding irreversible impacts and dangerous tipping points by keeping to within a 1.5-degree temperature rise. Halving emissions by 2030 makes a net-zero world realisable within three decades.COP26, taking place in Glasgow and hosted by the UK government, is the essential mechanism to make that happen. It’s true that more and more countries – including Ireland – are committing to net-zero emissions and advancing plans to decarbonise their economies, but the overall pace is too slow.The Paris Agreement was a landmark achievement underpinned by unprecedented collective action, but its voluntary aspects have, arguably, been its undoing – a get-out-of-jail card facilitating poor delivery, as was the case in Ireland. However, since 2019 Irish ambition has scaled up, and the country is gaining credibility in seeking to rank among global leaders on climate.It was against that backdrop that the UCD-hosted DCD event emerged. Organised by global experts in renewable energy, climate science and economics based in Ireland, it will be chaired by former European Parliament president Pat Cox.It may have been regarded as an insignificant or even naive attempt to influence the complex and often intractable process of herding nations in their collective interest on climate, but the Government has come on board – as has the UK, whose COP26 envoy John Murton will receive the Dublin Climate Declaration, with an endorsement by Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney.This week US climate envoy John Kerry also confirmed his participation – he believes COP26 is “the last best chance to get real” in avoiding climate catastrophe.Kevin O\u0027Sullivan is Environment and Science Editor and former Editor of The "},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 vaccine tracker what s available in the republic of ireland and what else is coming","story":"It has been over a year since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the Republic of Ireland. Since then, over 250,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,900 people have died.Globally, over 150 million people have been diagnosed and over 3\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th.\u0026nbspHow many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?The HSE is currently vaccinating people in the top nine cohorts:\u0026nbsppeople aged 65\u0026nbspand older who live in long-term care facilities (cohort 1), frontline healthcare workers (cohort 2), people aged 70 and older (cohort 3), people aged 16 to 69 who are at very high or high risk (cohort 4 and 7) and those aged 50 to 69 (cohorts 5 and 9).\u0026nbspThe next groups to be offered a vaccine after this will be residents of long-term care facilities aged 16-64 (cohort 8), followed by people aged 64 years and younger, alongside people aged 64 and younger who are living or working in crowded settings.

Photograph: Damien Eagers  The  The Government will move to put aside significant percentages of new-build homes for first-time buyers, under plans to be considered at Cabinet this week. Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien is set to bring the plans to Cabinet on Tuesday. The current basis of plan is to introduce an amendment to the Affordable Housing Bill, currently making its way through the Oireachtas. This is seen as the fastest way to introduce a change, as that legislation is expected to pass before the Dáil summer recess. However, it may also be introduced by amending the Planning and Development Act, or by the introduction of standalone legislation if judged necessary by the Attorney General, sources said. Reports in Sunday newspapers suggested the percentage put aside could be as high as half the units in some new developments, although sources suggested no final decision had been made on the split. When combined with percentages put aside for social and affordable housing, new rules carving out homes for first-time buyers would see significantly more than half the units in some new developments earmarked for purchase or use by specific cohorts of buyers.“We will do everything we can and use all levers of the State to support home ownership,” Government chief whip Jack Chambers told RTÉ’s Week in Politics programme on Sunday. Mr O’Brien is also set to propose to Cabinet that density be used as a key determinant for allowing the bulk purchase of units in estates or other housing developments. He is planning to issue a circular to local authorities which would allow for bulk purchases in higher density areas, such as city centre cores. This would encourage ongoing investment into apartment building, while in effect barring the bulk purchase of units in suburban housing estates. Meanwhile, the Department of Finance has defended investments made by the Irish Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) in a company which purchased significant numbers of homes in Co Kildare. The ISIF put €60 million into a firm called Urbeo in 2018, which, according to a report in the Business Post went on to purchase more than 200 units in two housing estates in Maynooth. A spokeswoman for Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe said the investment in Urbeo, and other housing investments by ISIF “are designed to increase the supply of housing by acting as a catalyst for both domestic and international investment in delivering more homes in Ireland”. “All ISIF investment - whether in the owner occupier, private rental or social rental sectors - is exclusively used for the construction of new homes, as opposed to the purchase of existing housing stock.”It is understood that the Department’s position is that the funds referenced forward funded new housing supply which otherwise would not have been built, unlike the previous story in Maynooth, where a fund competed against inidual house buyers.

And at the end of the day, we have more in common with Britain than what separates us,” he says.The encounter between the two was perhaps the apogee of her visit a decade ago this week, where she broke into a smile of genuine warmth as O’Connell quipped about calling an ugly monkfish, “the mother-in-law fish”.Deteriorating linksBut that was then and this is now. O’Connell is an astute observer of politics and is in no doubt that Anglo-Irish relations have deteriorated since, spurred by Brexit and everything that has happened since.He puts the blame at British prime minister Boris Johnson’s door: “In many ways, I think Boris is a mini-Trump. He doesn’t speak the truth and he is more interested in himself than his country and he’s sold a pup in a lot of ways.“He said it wouldn’t hurt Britain to be out of Europe but I think it’s created huge difficulties for Britain. And there will be more to come because I think the devil is in the detail of that deal and we are only seeing the start of it.”However, he finds grounds for optimism in the British visitors that used to call to his stall in the English Market prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, and will do so again once it lifts.“We’ve always had a lot of British people coming in but, after the queen’s visit, they were a bit more relaxed about it.

Just calm down”.Campus security guards are told not to ask a black member of staff if they are lost because this carries “assumptions of criminality”.Imperial’s guide adds that uttering the phrase “I’m not racist. I have several black friends” is denying minorities’ experience of bias.Staff should not say “I believe the most qualified person should get the job. We need excellence!” because this perpetuates the “myth of meritocracy” that BAME people are not disadvantaged.Meanwhile, Edinburgh University has told staff and students not to say “your English is really good” to anyone who is black, Asian British, Nigerian or American because this is a “microinsult.This means a subtle snub, conveying insult to the recipient and denying bias.It comes as the Government unveiled new free speech laws in the Queen’s Speech to tackle “rising intolerance” on campuses.In a crackdown on cancel culture, students and academics will be able to sue for compensation through the courts if they feel unfairly silenced.Toby Young, general secretary of the Free Speech Union which has dealt with 100 cases of campus censorship in the past year, said protections from “over-reaching ersitycrats” trying to police speech and thought are urgently needed.“Universities have no business telling their academic staff what they can and can’t praise about their students’ work,” he said.“Surely, the way to create a welcoming environment for BAME students at a university is to assure them they will be treated in exactly the same way as every other student? To hold BAME students to a lower standard than white students is incredibly patronising.“These misguided woke initiatives, which undermine academics’ autonomy and professional integrity, is exactly why we need more protection for free speech on campus.”Imperial’s microaggressions guide and video, produced by the Faculty of Engineering, urges staff to think about how they make others feel in all interactions, and ensure they acknowledge race, age and gender.Edinburgh University, which declined to comment, also urges students in ersity training not to engage in avoidant behaviour around BAME people or say they are being oversensitive if they feel offended, as these are “microinvalidations”.A spokesman for Imperial College London said: “A video on the experiences of BAME colleagues does not ‘threaten free speech’, and we would reject any efforts to shut down these important discussions.” ENDSMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"reaction conflict israel has shown complete corbynification","story":"When Jeremy Corbyn was cast into well-deserved political oblivion at the 2019 election, those of us who considered that he posed an existential threat to Britain’s Jewish community breathed a sigh of relief. And when Sir Keir Starmer used his first speech as Labour leader to apologise and promise to make rooting out anti-Semitism from his party his priority, we listened.But facts have an awkward habit of getting in the way of spin. And the last week has shown that Sir Keir’s fine words are just that: spin. The existential threat Corbyn posed was dependent on his winning power. In Israel, Jews – and Israeli Arabs – are being actually killed by rockets fired by a terrorist organisation, now. And what does Sir Keir have to say about the kind of anti-Semitism that murders Jews? Nothing.On Monday, as Hamas rockets rained down on Israel, he posted a tweet that was positively Corbynesque: “The violence against worshippers during Ramadan at the al-Aqsa mosque was shocking. Israel must respect international law, and must take steps, immediately, to work with Palestinian leaders to de-escalate tensions.” Sir Keir did not consider it relevant to mention that it is those very Palestinian leaders who have been sending a barrage of rockets to Israel with the aim of murdering as many Israelis as possible.Whatever progress Labour has made under Sir Keir in dealing with anti-Semitism in its ranks – and there has been some – was wiped out in that one tweet. The message was unambiguous: dead Jews don’t matter.Not that anyone should be surprised. Corbyn did not emerge out of nowhere. He may have been an obscure figure to most people when he won the Labour leadership in 2015 but he was well known within the party. The members who elected him with 59.5 per cent of the vote knew what he thought about almost every major issue, because he had spent decades droning on about them. And for Labour members, and the Left generally, Israel is a major issue.It is now an idee fixe on the Left that Israel is the cause of most of the world’s ills. In this context, it makes no difference that Sir Keir is plainly neither an anti-Semite nor an extremist – indeed his wife is Jewish. He is leader of a party in which a visceral hatred of Israel is now in its DNA and which has no interest in the murder of Jews.Stephen Pollard is editor of the Jewish ChronicleMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"russell group university accused soviet style censorship2","story":"A Russell Group university has been accused of Soviet-style censorship after requiring new humanities courses to “move away” from a “white, Eurocentric” curriculum.Academics at Exeter University’s department of Social Sciences and International Studies (SSIS) have been told that they should “integrate” these changes when updating existing modules or creating new ones.One lecturer said he is “shocked” at the stipulation and claimed the faculty - which oversees a number of disciplines including law, politics, sociology, philosophy, and anthropology - is undermining academic freedom “in the most profound sense”.It is just ridiculous - we are supposed to be a leading Russell Group university. This affects thousands of students and hundreds of academics.”The academic said the movement to “decolonise” the curriculum has swiftly progressed from a “faddish fringe theory” to being “adopted as the new orthodoxy” in universities.“What’s the difference here in the UK, where we are supposed to be a free liberal democracy?” he said.Academics, students or visiting speakers will be able to seek compensation through the courts if they suffer loss from a breach of free speech rules.A document titled “SSIL Accreditation Coversheet”, seen by The , states that all new modules or changes to existing modules must be sent to the SSIS Quality and Standards Team.Academics are asked to “reflect on how you have considered and integrated” various concepts into their module design, such as providing a welcome learning environment, supporting equality and ersity and promoting participation of students.As part of the accreditation process for courses due to begin this September, lecturers must also think about how they are “broadening epistemological and ontological horizons by moving away from a white, Eurocentric curriculum”.The academic said this goes against the university’s own policy on academic freedom and also creates a “chilling effect”.He said: There are lots of people here who feel the same way as I do but no one will come forward because there is a deep culture of fear.”An Exeter University spokesman said: “Guidance from the Quality Assurance Agency asks us to consider the needs of all students - including those studying at different locations, from different culturaleducational backgrounds, with additional learning needs, or with protected characteristics – when we design modules.“We are an international organisation with staff and students from around the world, and from a wide range of backgrounds, and it is right this is recognised in our teaching, curriculum content and assessment.” An Office for Students spokesman said: “Freedom of speech and academic freedom are crucial components of a successful higher education system. Students should be able to study from a range of texts, including from those scholars who depart from orthodoxy.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"three days inaction let indian variant take hold britain","story":"In the end it may come down to what happened during three crucial days in April.As cases of the highly transmissible new Indian variant of Covid begin to rise in parts of Britain, questions are being raised as to how it was allowed into the country in the first place.Alarming reports of the spread of a new highly infectious variant of Covid on the Indian subcontinent first emerged early last month.The Government acted by adding Pakistan and Bangladesh – India’s direct neighbours – to its red list on April 2, barring foreign travellers and forcing 10-day hotel quarantines on returning UK citizens.The decision led to concerns among epidemiologists, who questioned why India was not included.Health officials had started to detect an increase in the arrival of Covid cases from India. Public Health England (PHE) data now shows that of the 3,345 people arriving from India between March 25 and April 7, 4.8 per cent tested positive, compared to 0.1 per cent of people in England.PHE also detected the arrival of three Indian variants around the UK. The most worrying of these, B1.617.2, which is spreading most quickly and has claimed at least four lives here so far, was initially detected in tests carried out on travellers arriving from India during the week ending March 29. According to PHE, at least 122 passengers arriving from Delhi and Mumbai between late March and April 26 were carrying this variant of concern.With India not on the “red list”, all but a handful of these travellers would have been allowed to leave the airport and travel home, as well as being asked to self isolate.Meanwhile, Boris Johnson, the Prime Minister, was determined to press ahead with a planned visit to India on April 25.The plan was that he would be able to announce that early discussions were now under way over a new trade deal. But as more and more data from India began to ring alarm bells, he came under pressure to call off the trip. Downing Street eventually pulled the plug on April 19, on the same day Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, told the House of Commons that India would also be added to the red list – but only from 4am on April 23.This was despite Downing Street having briefed journalists when the scheme was first unveiled that countries could be added at a few hours\u0027 notice.The result of the three-day delay was inevitable. Demand for flights between India and the UK rocketed amid a “desperate frenzy\u0027” as families tried to beat the deadline and avoid having to quarantine in a hotel. Thousands of extra passengers travelled into Britain from the subcontinent.On April 19, Labour’s shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds criticised the delay, telling LBC: “It is not good enough to try and shut the door after the horse has bolted, by adding countries onto a ‘red list’ when it is too late.”On April 20, Professor Sir Mark Walport, former chief scientific adviser to the Government, admitted the ban on travel from India had been tardy, telling BBC Breakfast: “These decisions are almost inevitably taken a bit too late, in truth, but what\u0027s absolutely clear is that this variant is more transmissible in India.”Mr Johnson on Friday defended the delay in adding India to the “red list”, saying cases at the time had been higher in Pakistan.Asked why India was not added to the “red list” on April 2, along with Bangladesh and Pakistan, Edward Argar, the health minister, also told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme on Saturday that India had a good genome sequence programme and therefore a new variant was not considered such a threat at the time.But the impact of the delay in implementing the travel ban appears to have been reflected in the numbers of cases.Between April 4 and May 2, the B 1.617.2 variant rose from 4.9 per cent of all cases detected among travellers, to 40.9 per cent. The single biggest increase came in the week which included the three and a half days between the afternoon of April 19 and the early morning of April 23.Realisation of the growing threat posed by the Indian variant had a dramatic impact on the mood at Number 10. On May 10, Mr Johnson was still in a characteristically confident mood. Announcing the biggest easing of lockdown so far, with indoor dining and drinking allowed from May 17, he declared Britain was on the “road back to normality”. There was even talk inside Downing Street of doing away with face masks and ending social distancing for good.But that same day a meeting of the Variant Technical Group under the chairmanship of PHE’s national Covid-19 incident director was shown evidence of the alarming spread of B.1.617.2. Modelling showed the NHS could yet again be overwhelmed.The meeting concluded: “If B.1.617.2 does have such a large transmission advantage, it is a realistic possibility that progressing with all roadmap steps would lead to a substantial resurgence of hospitalisations.”These concerns were relayed to Downing Street and had a marked impact on the Prime Minister’s mood. On May 12, he told the Commons the Indian variant was now of “increasing concern” and could pose “a potentially lethal danger”.Over the next 48 hours two main courses of action were decided by the Government. The first was to “flex” the vaccine rollout so that around 10 million over-50s or in vulnerable categories will now get their second vaccine after eight weeks, rather than 12.The second was to bring surge testing on the ground in Bolton.A Sage meeting on May 13 then suggested there is a realistic possibility that the Indian variant of Covid-19 is 50 per cent more transmissible than the one that emerged in Kent. The group of scientists said that if higher levels of transmissibility are confirmed, moving to step three of the roadmap on Monday could lead to a substantial resurgence of hospitalisations (similar to, or larger than, previous peaks).SAGE has said there is no clear evidence that this variant causes more serious illness but government advisors have warned vaccines are “almost certainly less effective” at reducing transmission of Indian variant.If B.1.617.2 establishes itself as the dominant strain in the UK – sending numbers of cases surging once again – it could threaten all the suffering and sacrifices of the third lockdown and raise the prospect of renewed restrictions.And that would beg the question of why Mr Johnson left it so late to impose restrictions on travel from India, and why travellers were allowed those extra three and a half days to come to the UK.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"no future left labour party accepts finished","story":"The writing is on the wall for Labour, said David Miliband on Friday. It was a strong image, drawn from the Book of Daniel. The writing on the wall prophesied the end of the Chaldean monarchy, a prophecy that was realised almost immediately: “In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain. And Darius the Median took the kingdom.”Will Labour be similarly supplanted? Not so abruptly, perhaps. There will doubtless still be something calling itself the Labour Party for years to come, just as there are still an SDP and a Liberal Party descended from the factions that refused to support the 1988 merger. But might we look back on the period from 1923 to 2019 as the Labour era – the time when that party was the chief force on the centre-Left?As I write, Labour is 15 points behind in the opinion polls. If anything, that figure flatters it. Labour has lost Scotland, and is slipping across the North of England and the Midlands. It is making a small comeback in the South East but first-past-the-post means that it can pick up many more votes in the Home Counties without winning seats.In one sense, Sir Keir Starmer has been unlucky. His leadership has been dominated by the pandemic – a circumstance almost guaranteed to favour an incumbent government. When that government is firehosing money about the way this one is, it becomes impossible to argue that it should spend and borrow even more. The lockdowns changed the fiscal terms of trade: the PM went from “Brexity Hezza” to “Brexity Jezza”, forcing Labour off economics and onto its weakest ground, the culture war. A party that is seen as unpatriotic, anti-police, obsessed with identity politics and iffy about the Armed Forces will struggle everywhere except in university towns.I don’t expect my children to have “a job” in the sense that we understood that word in the twentieth century. They are likely to go through life freelancing and constantly reskilling. In such a world, parties linked to industrialised workforces and trade unions are lumbering mammoths. Socialist parties have been hammered in France, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, Germany and most of post-Communist Europe. They cling on at the Continent’s edges – in Sweden, Denmark, Portugal and Malta – but, elsewhere, they have been displaced, sometimes by parties that lean Left on economics but Right on culture, sometimes by Greens, sometimes by populist radicals.Blair glimpses the vastness of the crisis. Labour, he argues, “needs total deconstruction and reconstruction”. But what party wants to hear that message? Especially from Blair, for whom many Labour activists reserve a loathing deeper than anything they feel towards Tories. In the 45 years since Jim Callaghan took over, there have been eight Labour leaders. Seven of them failed to win a single general election. But if you think that fact earns Blair a sympathetic hearing in the party he used to lead, think again.Labour, as currently constituted, cannot win a majority. Its structures are too ungainly, its nostrums too old, its activists too angry, its mood too sour. In Britain, as in any country, there is a chunk of the electorate in the market for a Left-of-centre party. But the language of picket lines is as foreign to that electorate as the language of “defund the police”.Labour’s engines can’t be repaired, but neither does anyone seem ready to cannibalise its parts and build something new. And so it lies there, wrecked and rusting, blocking the tracks and preventing the emergence of an alternative party. There was something almost pitiful about the way it banged on about imagined sleaze while the PM got on with leading the country through the vaccination programme. It started with wallpaper for Boris. It ended with curtains for Keir.  More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"tories should stop treating london permanently left wing city","story":"London is widely deemed to be not just a Left-wing city, but growing more Left-wing by the year. Thanks to the irresistible forces of demographic and cultural change – a rising proportion of graduate voters, for example, and chunks of the middle class becoming culturally woke – it is said that the capital will no longer be merely inhospitable to Conservatism but toxic. Many Tories accept this narrative. Some write off their future prospects in the city. Others think there is political benefit elsewhere in the country in actively levelling it down.But what if it’s a myth? Sadiq Khan won a joyless victory over Shaun Bailey in this month’s mayoral vote. But the gap between Khan and the Tory challenger narrowed since the last elections, as did the gap between the Labour and Tory vote shares in the London Assembly. Has the Tory vote now found a floor? In the second round of the mayoral election, Bailey received a similar percentage to Steven Norris in 2004. On that view, London has become no more or less Left-wing over the past 20 years.There are caveats. Khan was a singularly bad candidate, isive and weak. The Conservatives haven’t won in London, a strongly Remain city, since well before Brexit. In the last Westminster elections, they continued to fall back although they maintained their seat level. The pandemic may have masked temporary demographic shifts that flattered the Conservative vote in low turnout elections. Across the western world, the general trend is of a cleavage between more progressive metropolises and more conservative provinces. The Tories have made progress in attracting ethnic minority voters, but not enough.But it is strange that pundits insist that London is now the Labour heartland, when that dubious honour is surely more appropriately given to Manchester or Liverpool.Other things follow. While the Government may not have written off London exactly, its policies do appear designed to entrench the idea that the capital is lost to the Left. This is obvious in the case of so-called low-traffic neighbourhoods (the closure of residential streets to through traffic) which ministers strongly support. Not only do they annoy Tory-leaning voters, but by making it harder to have a car in the city, they make it harder to bring up a family. A flight of aspirational families from London would hardly be conducive to Conservative prospects. Then there is planning policy, which appears to prioritise densification and high rise development. All home ownership should benefit the Right, but more so if it is houses with gardens.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"covid families slam dithering boris","story":"NewsCovid families slam dithering Boris Johnsons delay to act on Indian iantEXCLUSIVE: On the eve of restrictions further easing, Covid- Bereaved Families for Justice say the PM’s failure to stop travel from India in early April had allowed the mutant to take seedmirrorShareCommentsByKaren RockettJohn Siddle:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video johnson-indian-iant-could-pose-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:lXNoLB,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : #

On the eve of restrictions further easing on Monday, Covid- Bereaved Families for Justice warned ministers were not learning lessons – more than a year into the pandemic. The group, which represents , families, blasted: “The Government has once again been indecisive on closing our borders – repeating previous mistakes which cost lives.After the success of the vaccine rollout, fears the Indian iant might mean cases rising substantially are harrowing for bereaved families.” On Friday, the Government admitted the mutant iant could threaten the planned June  end to restrictions. India was put on the travel red list on April  – despite reports of a fast-spreading strain and neighbouring Pakistan and Bangladesh being added on April . It has been claimed the PM dithered over adding India to the list in April. Some  cases of the iant entered the UK from India before it was added to the hotel quarantine list – requiring a ten-day isolation. Labour ’s Angela Rayner said the delay is looking “more reckless, misguided and dangerous by the hour.” Mr Johnson sought to reassure the public at a briefing on Friday, saying there is “no evidence” current vaccines will not be effective against the new strain. There he was also accused of acting too late – a charge levelled against him at the start of the pandemic, and again in autumn. Jo Goodman, co-founder of the Covid justice group, called for the Tories to bring forward a public inquiry they intend to kick back to next year. Jo, who lost her father Stuart to Covid, said: “The only way the Government is going to overcome the virus is through learning the right lessons and this is why the statutory inquiry can’t wait.” Health Minister Edward Argar tonight defended adding India to the red list later than Pakistan and Bangladesh. He said Britain has the right border controls “to minimise the risk of not just this iant but other iants in future”. A Government spokesperson said: “We have some of the toughest border measures in the world. We took precautionary action to ban travel from India on rd April, six days before this iant was put under investigation and two weeks before it was labelled as of concern. We have since sped up our vaccination programme and put in enhanced local support to curb transmission. Prior to India being placed on the red list in April anyone coming to the UK had to test negative and quarantine for  days. Vaccine arms race Britain stepped up its vaccine race to beat the Indian Covid iant with the announcement second doses of vaccines will be accelerated for the over-s and the clinically vulnerable across the country. Instead they will be given eight weeks after the first dose instead of the current  weeks. The race to beat the Indian iant comes after it emerged most of the patients hospitalised with the virus in Bolton, which has the highest rates of the Indian iant in the country, are eligible for the jab but have not had it. Huge queues formed outside pop-up jab centres in the Greater Manchester town with anyone eligible to receive a dose urged to do so.  Dr Francis Andrews, medical director at the Bolton NHS Foundation Trust, said: “The increase in admissions is seen across the age range from -. The majority of patients have not received a vaccination dose, but many would have been eligible.” Bolton has been severely hit by the Indian Covid iant, which now makes up the majority of it’s new cases. The area’s infection rate is the highest in the country with  cases per , people as of yesterday. Meanwhile, Scottish National Party health spokesperson Dr Philippa Whitford warned you ‘cannot out-vaccinate the iant’ due to the time taken to build immunity once someone gets the jab. Second doses of vaccines will be accelerated for the over-s and the clinically vulnerable across the country, so they are given eight weeks after the first dose instead of the current  weeks. Meanwhile in East London surge testing to be deployed in Hackney and Shoreditch where there has been an outbreak of the Indian and South African iants.  Everyone over the age of  who lives or works in targeted areas within Shoreditch and Dalston should take a COVID- PCR test. But the spread of the Indian iant isn’t expected to derail the roadmap out of lockdown just yet. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said yesterday: “The crucial road map date for theatres, music venues and sports has always been step . “So I understand this is an anxious time as we assess the situation over the next couple of weeks. “We continue to make good progress with the vaccine rollout and with testing the safeof audiences through the Events Research Programme, but must accept we enter a period of heightened vigilance with the new fast-moving iant. “We will keep engaging with, and updating, organisations to allow everyone to plan their full reopening.”  Today around , fans flocked to Wembley for the FA Cup Final between Cha and Leicester City. It was the biggest crowd at a live event in the UK since the first lockdown last year led to matches being played behind closed doors. The Duke of Cambridge joined , supporters of each team plus local residents, key workers and FA guests for the showpiece which Leicester won -.

Lockdown-weary Brits will be able to go abroad for foreign holidays from tomorrow, with a handful of countries like Portugal included on the quarantine-free green list. But fears are mounting over the spread of the Indian iant in places like Bolton, as the Government faces criticism over delays to shutting the border to India last month. Askedforeign holidays should be allowed without quarantine, Ms Cooper told the BBCaposs Andrew Marr Show: The Government needs to slow down its plans. I donapost understand why itaposs lting some of its international travel restrictions tomorrow.  I think they should be being much more cautious about that. She said there still signicant gaps in the home quarantine system and called on ministers to publish weekly data on the situations abroad. I think this has to be assessed on a month by month basis, but as we are now, I donapost think itaposs possible to be lting restrictions at a time when we have got so many new iants, she said.Some , people are believed to have travelled to the UK from India as Boris Johnson dragged his feet over shutting the border.Bangladesh and Pakistan were added to the red list on April , with the measure coming into force on April . But India was not added to the list until April . The Sunday Times estimated that at least , passengers who could have been infected with a virulent strain of Covid- entered during the delay. Ms Cooper said: Look at what theyaposve done on the India iant. This was not inevitable. They should have put India on the red list at the same time as Pakistan and Bangladesh. Since then weaposve had this three week period in which thousands of people have ed from India and that probably includes hundreds of these new iant Covid cases.  Health Secretary Matt Hancock defended the decision to axe quarantine-free travel to India weeks after neighbouring countries were put on the red list. But he dodged questions on whether the decision was linked to Mr Johnsonaposs planned trip to the country. He told Sky News: This iant was notied as a iant under investigation after weaposd already put India on the red list. The decision to put India on the red list was taken because of the high positivity rate of people coming from India and looking at the epi-curve in India. When we put Pakistan on the red list at the start of April thataposs because the proportion of people testing positive coming in from Pakistan was three times higher the proportion coming from India, and it was only after we put India on the red list that this iant went under investigation, and then earlier this month it became a iant of concern. Asked whether it was linked to Mr Johnsonaposs planned trip to India to boost trade talks, Mr Hancock said: We take these decisions based on the evidence.FOLLOW USMirrorPoliticsFollow @MirrorPoliticsCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnCoronavirus"},{"url":null,"title":"matt hancock defends support tory","story":"NewsMatt Hancock defends support for Tory ex-minister to secure £m PPE dealThe Health Secretary said it was perfectly reasonable to send on emails to officials handling procurement from Brooks Newmark, who resigned as a minister in  after sending sexually explicit photographs of himselfmirrorShareCommentsByLizzy BuchanPolitical Correspondent:,  MAY NewsMatt Hancock defended his involvement in helping a Tory ex-minister secure a PPE contract \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get US and UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The Health Secretary defended passing on emails to officials handling procurement from Brooks Newmark, who resigned as a minister in  after the Sunday Mirror reported he had sent sexually explicit photographs of himself. An aide to Mr Hancock reportedly asked for the bid to be brought to the personal attention of the Government’s PPE tsar Lord Deighton, describing it as “excellent” and calling for it to be dealt with “urgently”. Mr Newmark had teamed up with Zoe Ley, the owner of a dog food company who had set up a firm, Le Partners, to broker PPE deals for international suppliers, the Sunday Times reported. Internal Government emails, obtained through freedom of information laws, show Mr Newmark told the Health Secretary on May  last year that he had “chatted with your spad [special adviser] . . . He will be circulating this idea to you, Michael [Gove] and Liz [Truss].”  The former Braintree MP included a detailed proposal explaining he had links to a well connected and powerful person in China but that he needed government help in accelerating deals, the newspaper added. Mr Hancock replied: Thanks. Definitely one for the PPE team who are firing on all cylinders now. The Department of Health reportedly awarded a £ million contract for protective goggles to the firm on June . Challenged over whether it was appropriate for Mr Newmark to lobby him, Mr Hancock told the BBCaposs Andrew Marr Show: Yes it was absolutely appropriate for people to get in contact with anybody at the Department of Health when the country desperately needed PPE and I sent this contact straight on to the PPE team and they looked at it. I donapost have anything to do with the award of contracts. AskedMr Newmark received special treatment, Mr Hancock replied: No, I just pinged it on.  Mr Hancock confirmed he wanted it to be looked at, adding: By the way,  million goggles later, Iaposm glad that I did. I sent it, as you can see, and said this is one for the PPE team and thataposs the right thing to do. Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner said: It is a recurring theme of the pandemic that ministers have bent over backwards to help their donors, friends and supporters while other companies have had to beg to provide equipment that could help.Returning to normal after this crisis is over must not mean ato Conservative cronyism, deals for mates, and one rule for them and another for the rest of us. Mr Newmark declined to comment. Sources close to him told the Sunday Times that he merely helped chivvy along an existing process. Ms Ley told the paper she had only ever worked through formal channels. It comes as Labour accused Priti Patel of a “flagrant breach” of the ministerial code by allegedly lobbying Michael Gove over a £million PPE deal.The party urged Cabinet secretary Simon Case to investigate the Home Secretary over alleged efforts to sway the award of a contract. Documents, obtained by the Mail, show Ms Patel contacted Mr Gove last May over a PPE deal for the healthcare firm Pharmaceuticals Direct Ltd .The contact for the firm was listed as Samir Jassal, who has stood as a Conservative candidate at two elections and has met both Boris Johnson and David Cameron.Ms Patel said the firm have committed stock and secured supply, exposing them to considerable financial risk and pressures. The late stage in which the Government has decided not to use them has caused these problems, Ms Patel wrote on May  last year.  I would be most grateful fiyou could review this matter urgently, ensure direct contact is made with this company over the stock they have secured, ascertain what contractual obligations the Government should meet and work with the company to distribute and supply these masks. Her efforts failed after Mr Hancock said the masks were “not suitable for use in the NHS”, according to disclosure in response to a pre-action letter by the Good Law Project. But PDL was awarded a £. million contract weeks later in July to provide a dferent type of mask. A spokesman for Ms Patel: The Home Secretary rightly followed up representations made to her about the vital supply of PPE. During a time of national crisis, failure to do so would have been a dereliction of duty. PDL has been contacted for comment.FOLLOW USMirrorPoliticsFollow @MirrorPoliticsCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnConservative PartyBrooks NewmarkPriti PatelMichael GovePoliticsCoronavirus"},{"url":null,"title":"im 44 jealous people try","story":"NewsI’m  and jealous people try to get my girlfriend, , to dump me constantlyModel Michael Stomatuk, , says his girlfriend has been messaged by strangers, claiming that hes been unfaithful, and says he is often hit-on by admirers on his TikTok accountmirrorShareCommentsByRosaleen FentonAudience WriterAmy Walters:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsOver time, they realised they were head over heels for one another. \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

But it wasnapost until she received a Zoom call from People’s Postcode Lottery ambassador Matt Johnson that she learned how much she had won. When Matt revealed the cheque, tearful Vicky said: “Oh my God! Are you serious  Thank you so much, that’s amazing!” Vicky plans on treating her two children, who are six and eight years old, to a trip to Disneyland when restrictions allow. And she also has plans to splash out on an extravagant purchase for her home, which she shares with her husband.  She added: “We wanted to get a hot tub. I was going to have to work extra nights and days to save up for it and now I can actually get it, I’m so excited!“ One of the reasons Vicky plays People’s Postcode Lottery is because of the support going to good causes. She went on: “I always like to give a bit to charity, and I can’t always do all of them, so I thought this is the perfect one to do because it covers quite a few. And obviously there is always a chance of winning so that is an extra bonus on top!” People’s Postcode Lottery costs £ a month to play and there are guaranteed winners every day. People play with their chosen postcode and are automatically entered into all draws.People’s Postcode Lottery ambassador, Matt Johnson, said: “I’m over the moon for Vicky! A big congratulations, I hope she celebrates today and enjoys spending the cash.” A huge % of ticket sales goes directly to good causes and players of People’s Postcode Lottery have helped raise over £ million for good causes across Britain and internationally since . This draw was promoted on behalf of Unicef UK, which has received over £.million in funding thanks to players.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorMore OnBettingLottery"},{"url":null,"title":"brits bask 20c heatwave uk","story":"NewsBrits to bask in C heatwave as UK to be hit by  consecutive days of sun next monthThe changeable weather certainly hasnt been ideal for the reopening of outdoor hospitality, and the reopening of indoor dining cannot come soon enough for many.

But as we head towards summer, things are finally starting to look up.The weather experts at AccuWeather are forecasting scorching temperatures for the majority of next month. In London, itaposs forecast that on  consecutive days, temperatures will hit C minimum, MyLondon reports.But the picture looks good across the rest of the UK as well. In Manchester and Newcastle, the same run of days boasts top temperatures of C. The -day hot streak starts on June  and ends on July , so pencil that in your diaries, hopefully running over the date when Boris Johnson will announce an end to Covid- restrictions.As it stands, only a few days of rain are forecast in June, making a nice change from the May weather weaposve dealt with. Sadly, the rest of this month isnapost looking so good. The Met Office describes the last couple of weeks of May as cold particularly in the north of the UK, with heavy showers punctuating most days.They predict: Unsettled conditions continuing, with scattered showers again developing across most areas. To start the period, these may be heavy, and at times wintry in the far north, especially over hills. Further into this period, it is likely to remain changeable with a mixture of sunshine and scattered showers, though heavy in places with a risk of thunder. Brief spells of more organised cloud, bringing rain and strong winds, remain possible, particularly in the south. Generally staying breezy throughout.  While temperatures by night are likely to below average, frost is expected to be restricted to prone locations, especially where winds fall light. By day, temperatures are likely to be around or slightly below average, notably cool in the South but cold in the North.

Charles wants Buckingham Palace, Clarence House, Windsor Castle, Sandringham and Balmoral to be transformed from private spaces to public places, according to The Sunday Times. The newspaper said the heir to the throne wants these royal residences to open more widely for longer periods during the year. Charles is reportedly speaking to the Duchess of Cornwall, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and other royals about the plans. The newspaper said Charles is considering opening Buckingham Palace and gardens throughout the year when he is king, including when he is in residence.  In April, high public demand for tickets to picnic on Buckingham Palaceaposs lawns and explore its garden forced the Royal Collection Trustto temporarily stop taking new bookings. Thousands logged onto the website of the charity, which organises the openings of a number of royal residences, hoping to book a ticket after the self-guided garden tours were launched. But the RCT said very high interest meant it had to suspend sales. The traditional summer opening of Buckingham Palaceaposs state rooms and themed exhibition, which normally welcomes thousands, has been cancelled for a second year due to the pandemic.  But self-guided garden tours have been announced from July to September, giving the paying public the chance to wander through the Queenaposs private -acre site and discover the wildle-rich oasis in the heart of London. Its landscape dates back to the s when George IV turned Buckingham House into a palace, and today it is home to a rich bioerse habitat, with more than , trees and  dferent wildflowers and grasses. Visitors will be able to explore a route through the garden that takes in its -metre-long herbaceous border, plane trees planted by and named after Queen Victoria and Prince Albert and views of the island and its beehives across the .-acre lake.  The unique opportunity to enjoy a picnic on one of the sweeping lawns will be part of the visit. From May to September, small guided tours of the palace will begin, featuring many of its magnicent State Rooms, furnished with treasures of the Royal Collection, including paintings by Franz Xaver Winterhalter, Sevres porcelain and what is said to be some of the finest English and French furniture in the world. From July, access to the garden will be included in the visit.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnPrince Charles, Prince of WalesBuckingham PalaceRoyal Family"},{"url":null,"title":"couple who lost both children","story":"NewsCouple who lost both children to rare conditions find purpose again by fosteringKaren and Paul Ledsham faced every parents worst nightmare when their one-year-old daughter died, followed a few years later by their son, .

Your information will be used in accordance with ourPrivacy Notice.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeA couple who lost both of their children to rare conditions have found purpose in their lives again after becoming foster parents. Karen and Paul Ledsham were devastated after losing their daughter Abigail to a rare disease that attacks the nervous system, then their son Harrison to cancer five years later. They thought they’d never recover from the unbearable grief of losing both of them but then remembered a wish Harrison,, had after his sister, one, fell ill, Lancashire Live reports. “He mentioned that when she goes to heaven could we let somebody come and live with us because, obviously, he’s got nice toys he wants to share because he won’t be able to share with his sister anymore, and that kind of conversation was there,” said Karen, , a nurse.  “At the time we said well, it’s something to think about after she died.” But the couple went on to follow Harrison’s advice and are currently fostering two siblings under the age of ten, reports LancsLive. The Ledshams, from St Helens, Merseyside, say it “brings purpose” to their lives. “We feel, or felt, ‘well what is the point ’” Karen said. “Lots of people don’t have children, but we’ve had them and lost them and with that we’ve lost our hopes and our dreams and our futures. “So having this now, it keeps us going, keeps us busy and our minds occupied. “It makes the house a home again.”  It was in  that the couple’s daughter Abigail died just five days before her second birthday, after becoming unwell with Sandhoff disease, a disorder that attacks the nervous system. It was then that Harrison first asked his parentsthey’d consider fostering. Harrison himself became ill with osteosarcoma, a form of bone cancer, about five years later, and suggested the idea again. “He did bring it up again, saying ‘it would be lovely to have children in the house’,” Karen recalled. “I think sometimes he was lonely.” Harrison’s illness was diagnosed when he suffered a pain in his leg, which turned out to be a fracture caused by a tumour.  It was the worst news imaginable for Karen and Paul. “After Abigail died, we did wrap him in cotton wool,” she said. “Any time he got an ache or pain, or was ill, you have that little niggling feeling at the back of your mind – whatit’s something  “You try and carry on, and you do, but that day when we found out, it was , the world crashed down.” The desire for the family to foster children was very much in character for Harrison, according to his parents. “He always wanted to help people,” Karen said. “He always wanted to be a doctor, he said he wanted to find a cure for the condition his sister had.”Paul, , a delivery driver, added: “I know everybody says this about their children, but he was the nicest boy you would ever meet.”The cancer in his bones meant Harrison ultimately had to have his leg amputated above the knee. But he went into the surgery with medical staff not knowing whether the amputation would be necessary. After coming round from the surgery he thanked the theatre staff. “He woke up and said, ‘have you took my leg ’ and hesaid yes. And he said, ‘well I know you did your best, thanks very much’,” said Paul.  Sadly, despite the surgery, the cancer spread, and Harrison died six years ago aged . Then any thought of fostering was put to back of his parents’ minds. But  months later, their interest was reignited when they walked past a stall while out shopping, offering information about fostering. Following discussions, the couple decided to apply and about a year later they were approved. Because of their circumstances, some friends and family expressed concerns about how they might cope with fostering – particularly when the children moved on. “That’s something that we had to consider,” Karen said. “But, we talk about this all the time, nothing is the same as our children going where they’ve gone. “So we knewwe can deal with that, we knew we could deal with other children moving on and leaving our lives, as long as we’ve made a dference and given some happiness and some stability.” Paul said fostering was “challenging” but had brought “laughter” back into their lives as well as rewards that were worth the hard work. “We are making a dference,” he said. “We know we are, we can tell the dference.” And it is all the more meaningful because by fostering they are honouring one of Harrison’s final wishes. “I just hope he’s proud of us for doing it, which I think he would be,” Karen added. “And he is watching down somewhere knowing that we’re doing something that he wanted.”FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnCancerFosterChildrens Hospital"},{"url":null,"title":"covid vaccines less effective reducing","story":"NewsCovid vaccines less effective at reducing Indian iant transmission amid case surgeSir Mark Walport, a member of Sage, said that while vaccines still seemed to be protecting people from severe Covid cases, they appeared less good at stopping transmission of the Indian strainmirrorShareCommentsBySam BlewettMike BediganMilo Boyd:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video boris-johnson-anxious-discusses-indian-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:mvaKOPA,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

As the number of cases of the mutant strain continues to rise sharply in the UK, questions around its infectiousness and deadliness have become more pressing. Sir Mark Walport, a member of Sage, said that while vaccines still seemed to be protecting people from severe Covid cases, they appeared less good at stopping transmission of the Indian strain.The deputy chair of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation , told BBC Radio aposs Today programme that the race between the spread of coronavirus and the vaccination rollout was on a kne edge.Prof Harnden said: The vaccines may be less effective against mild disease but we donapost think theyaposre less effective against severe disease.  But in combination with being less effective against mild disease, theyaposre almost certainly less effective against transmission. He added: Thataposs why weaposre imploringto get out there and vaccinate their unvaccinated people. More positive is the fact that hospitalisations in the over-s, who are most at-risk from serious infection but who are also most likely to be vaccinated, remain low. Data also suggests that the AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines are effective against the iant. Ministers are pushing on with a major easing of restrictions on Monday despite rising coronavirus case numbers.  Boris Johnson is believed to be sticking by plans to allow mixing indoors and greater physical contact in England as scientists warned the strain could be  per cent more transmissible than the Kent iety.Health minister Edward Argar said on Saturday that the Government was acting coolly and calmly in carrying on with step three in the road map to ending lockdown restrictions. However, the British Medical Associationsaid the move is a real worry while many are still awaiting vaccination. Mr Argar was also forced to defend border restrictions, saying it is impossible to completely hermetically seal the nation amid criticism of the delay in adding India to the travel red list.  The Prime Minister warned on Friday the iant could cause serious disruption to plans to ease the lockdown and may delay the planned ending of all legal restrictions on June . The Scientic Advisory Group for Emergenciesconcluded there is a realistic possibility the strain is  per cent more transmissible than the one that emerged in Kent. If the higher transmissibility is confirmed, the experts said moving to step three could lead to a substantial resurgence of hospitalisations that is similar to, or larger than, previous peaks. Mr Argar told BBC Breakfast: All the evidence so far suggests there is no evidence of increased severity of illness or that it evades the vaccine. So, at the moment, on the basis of the evidence we are doing the right thing, coolly, calmly continuing with Monday, but keeping everything under review.  Mondayaposs easing will allow people to socialise indoors in homes, pubs and restaurants, and will permit physical contact between households for the first time in more than a year. Mr Argar said people should take personal responsibility when deciding whether or not to hug loved ones, when allowed to do so. You have to take all the facts into consideration, he said. Itaposs about personal responsibility, itaposs about making the right judgment call. The BMAaposs public health medicine committee co-chairman Dr Richard Jarvis urged the public to take a cautious approach to social and physical contact. With key segments of the population still not vaccinated and clusters of iants, including the rapidly increasing Indian iant, becoming a growing concern, we must approach this next stage of easing lockdown with the utmost caution, he said.

A temporary vaccination centre has been set up at one of Boltonaposs secondary schools in a bid to tackle the spike in infections, the Manchester Evening News reports.Council workers are also delivering coronavirus tests door-to-door, with plans to hand out up to , kits this weekend. Teams in high-vis vests have been lugging black trolleys filled with kits from one house to the next. It is all part of a huge operation aimed at tackling a surge in Covid- cases in the town.  It is not the first time Bolton has held been the UKaposs worst Covid hotspot. It consistently recorded the highest rate of new cases for several weeks last September - but the pace of the recent spike has taken many here by surprise. It is thought to be driven by the Indianstrain of coronavirus and has predominantly affected areas to the south-west of the town centre. Official data shows that the Lever Edge ward, in Great Lever, currently boasts the highest infection rate in England at just over  cases per , people. A total of  new infections were recorded there in the week up to May  - an increase of  on the previous seven days.  It is no surprise, therefore, that most of the efforts to crackdown on the virus are targeted here. Testing has been stepped up as the council aims to track the spread and ensure those who are infected are isolating. Over the course of this weekend, council teams hope to distribute testing kits to between , and , homes. One of those who has been handed one is Sheikh Shamsi, who lives in Calvert Road. It will be the first time the -year-old security officer has ever been tested for coronavirus. Itaposs good that they are giving these out, he said. We have to be careful.  Mr Shamsi says he has booked in for his first dose of the vaccine later this month, but remains concerned by the rising number of cases in Bolton. Iaposm worried, he said. People donapost seem to care. Some of the people where I work think Covid is not here - like it is a rumour. I have followed the rules all along. Another of those who is worried about the rapid spread of the virus is Samuel Koomson. I donapost know how it is rising, said the -year-old. Any time I go out to the supermarket, everybody is wearing masks and keeping their distance. Mr Koomson tested positive for the virus earlier this year, but says he never developed any symptoms. He has since been invited to have the vaccine, but says he has no intention of doing so. It is not going to benefit me, he said. I am healthy.  If I get the vaccine, I can still get the virus and have to social distance and wear masks. What is the sense  Those leading Boltonaposs vaccination programme have expressed concern that areas with a lower uptake - Great Lever, Rumworth and Deane - are the same places where rates are rising fastest and cases of the Indian iant are being found. Vaccine uptake in other areas of Bolton among over s is above  percent, but drops lower in Deane, Rumworth and Great Lever. Asked why people in those parts of town seemed less inclined to get their jab, Dr Helen Wall, senior responsible officer for the vaccination programme in Bolton, said it was down in part to social factors such as deprivation, as well as the availability of the vaccine. Shirley Taylor, , is one of those who has been fully vaccinated. A nurse at a care home, she is proud of the fact she has worked right throughout the pandemic. It has not been easy, and three of her colleagues have died of the virus. She says she was looking forward to better days, so her frustration over the rising infection rate is clear. Ms Taylor said: “Three weeks ago, we had one of the lowest rates in Bolton. “It’s re around here now.  The highest infection rates in the town are being seen among younger people, with official data showing a huge spike in cases among schoolchildren. The number of positive tests among children under the age of  has tripled in a week, figures released by Public Health England revealed. The data shows that there has so far been no increase in infections among the over s, who are the most vulnerable to serious illness caused by Covid-. However, Ms Taylor fears the virus will start to spread further when restrictions are eased further on Monday. Leaders initially linked the rise in cases in Bolton to international travel, particularly India and Pakistan, but there is now evidence of widespread community transmission, including in schools and workplaces. “There is no way I am going near a pub at the minute, she said. You donapost know who you are sitting next to. I hope they get it under control. I just want le to go back to normal. “I’m worried about another local lockdown. “It’s not our fault. We’ve been abiding by the regulations, going out only when we needed to and wearing masks.  “I wouldn’t let people into my house until I checked their temperature. As part of the efforts to control the infection rates, a mobile testing centre has been set up at Essa Academy in Great Lever. The pop-up site attracted huge queues on Saturday as a total of , Pfizer jabs were made available to people who live, work or study in the BL or BL postcode areas. Younger people cannot turn up and expect to get a Covid- vaccine at the site, despite earlier claims that “anyone” could queue for a jab. A councillor deleted a tweet on Saturday in which he claimed “anyone” with a Bolton postcode and registered with a local GP could visit a vaccine bus and get jabbed. Naveed Deeba, , was one of those queuing up to get vaccinated at the site this weekend. Everybody who can get the vaccine should be coming, he said. I think itaposs the only way out of Covid-.  I have two kids and I canapost really afford to fall sick. My we has already had the jab. I was just not getting my turn through the NHS and I was told you could come here and get it done so here I am. I wouldnapost want to pass it on to my parents, my two kids, my we just went through a pregnancy. I think the risk to them is bad and itaposs betterI get immunised.At a press conference yesterday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson pledged to send the Army in to support the mass testing efforts in Bolton.Bolton Councilaposs director of public health, Dr Helen Lowey welcomed the extra support and urged residents to get tested. She said: Itaposs really important that people take the tests, eventhey donapost have any symptoms. We want to stop the spread of the virus and contain it. What we are finding is that it is community transmission. What you tend to find is that the rates within schools or businesses, at the moment it is reflecting that. We know this particular iant is highly transmissible, so we really want to reduce the numbers. If anybody does have symptoms, please isolate and book a test.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnCoronavirus"},{"url":null,"title":"it turns out im really","story":"AdvertorialIt turns out I’m really good at it - man turns health challenges into sport and TV successHow actor Ekow Otoo went from a teenager facing a debilitating condition to a lead role in The National Lottery’s stunning new TV admirrorShareByLaura Tait:,  MAY AdvertorialThanks to CGI, Ekow is transported into the middle of a Viking invasion in The National Lottery adImagine being a ft in, -year-old man and finding two pizzas too heavy to carry, but not knowing why. That was what happened to Ekow Otoo – an actor, spoken-word poet and model. “My legs had been giving me problems for years I was suffering a relapse and felt too weak to cook, so I’d ordered a takeaway. I remember being pinned to the wall when I took the pizzas from the delivery guy – they were too heavy to walk with,” says Ghanian-born Londoner Ekow, now . Ekow, who now knows he has multiple sclerosis , started experiencing issues aged . “I tried to get out of my bed one morning and my legs wouldn’t follow. After a nap they were fine again, but next time I played basketball I couldn’t run – my knees would buckle and I couldn’t get any speed.” A GP put the issue down to Ekow shooting up six inches in just one year. “They just thought I’d grown too quickly and my muscles were catching up.” MS is an inflammatory disease in which the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord are damaged. Slowly the disease affected Ekow to the point he had to give up sport entirely. “I couldn’t even walk two roads without resting on walls.” At university Ekow struggled to get information from his brain to the page. “I think they thought I was lazy,” he says. “I didn’t connect the problem with my legs, though.”  Help and advice In February , Ekow went to bed with a chest infection. “When I woke I felt funny, sat down and couldn’t stand up again. I ended up in hospital with a doctor standing over my bed, saying: ‘This is MS.’ I remember thinking, ‘Wow, there’s a name for it.’ “It was such a relief to have a definitive diagnosis. I knew it wasn’t all in my head.” When he was first given his wheelchair, Ekow was, “overcome with peace”: “I thought it was going to be a massive struggle, but I sat in the chair and pushed for the first time, and it was like all the stress melted away. “It turns out I’m really good at it. I can travel faster than I used to, without worrying I’ll fall over, look strange or have to stop.” Since his diagnosis, Ekow has relied heavily on The National Lottery-supported MS Society which proved a vital source of information and help when he needed it. He has also benefited from sports, including wheelchair racing – mentored by Paralympian Vanessa Wallace – and adapted rowing with another National Lottery-supported organisation, British Rowing. By playing The National Lottery, you raise £M for good causes every week* “Getting back into sport was the first step in finding my confidence as a wheelchair user. I just loved it – I took part in a development programme with British Rowing for a year and, in , won a para-rowing gold in the British Championships.” Ekow has even excelled at acting, and was recently picked to play the lead role in a stunning new National Lottery TV advert, which sees him performing dramatic stunts in his wheelchair.  Thanks to some clever CGI, viewers watch as he is transported from a street corner into the middle of a Viking invasion, before tearing through a museum and then taking off above the city skyline. At one point Ekow is even flung into the air as he travels through a skate park.

Since the latest lockdown began in January , international travel has been against the law, except for those who have an essential reason. From tomorrow it will no longer be against the law to travel – but the traffic light system will dictate whether you are advised to travel. For those travelling to green countries, they can travel without having to quarantine upon . Brits are advised against travelling to amber and red countries – and there are strict quarantine rules in place for those who do have to travel.But everyone will need to take several coronavirus tests in order to limit the spread of the disease. So what are the new rules for travelling  And what will your airport visit involve  Here is everything you need to know. New rules for travelling The most important thing to be aware of before travelling is the traffic light system. What you need to do before you leave, and when you , depends on whether your destination is on the Green, Amber or Red list. Green: Low Risk – You can go on holiday to a country on the green list, but you will need to take a pre-departure test in that country before you . On, or before, the second day after arriving in the uK they will need to take a PCR Covid- test from a private provider. These y in price, but usually cost around £. Those arriving from green countries do not need to quarantine, unless they receive a positive test. Tests must be booked and paid for in advance.  Amber: Medium Risk – People are being asked not to travel to Amber countries for leisure. If you do need to travel to an Amber country, you will need to take the usual pre-departure test, and then PCR tests on day two and day eight after coming home. In addition, arrivals will need to quarantine, either at home or at the place where they are staying. You have the option to have an early release from quarantine. This is called Test to Release. In this case you need to take another test on day five –it comes back negative they can leave quarantine. However, they still need to take the pre-departure test, as well as the test on day two and eight. Red: High risk – Similarly to Amber countries, you are urged not to travel for leisure. With so much changing so quickly, keep on top of what is happening with the Mirroraposs news updates by email. Delivered straight to your inbox, our daily coronavirus briefing will keep you informed of what is happening with Covid, lockdown, the vaccination rollout and the impact on how we live.here. If youaposre ing from a red country you must quarantine at a government-approved hotel for  days when you , at your own expense at £, a head. As well as the pre-departure test, you will also need to take a PCR test on day two and eight of your hotel quarantine. This is the same as the Amber group, however, you wonapost be able to pay for Test to Release. You can see the full list of green, amber and red countries as of May  here. What will travelling through airports involve  From May , you no longer need to complete a declaration form to travel abroad. However, when youyou will need to submit a passenger locator form. Those who have had a full coronavirus vaccine coursewill be able to demonstrate their status in order to enter some countries. This can be proved using an app, or a letter. Other countries will determine their own health rules, so you should check entry requirements for the country you are travelling to.  You may need to prove you have had a negative Covid- test before entering certain countries. If you do, you should book a private test – you canapost use the NHS Test and Trace service. Some airports, such as London Stansted, offer an airport testing facility. This will need to be booked before you arrive. When you arrive back into the UK you will need to show proof of a negative Covid test, as well as proof of booking two further tests. As well as a proof of a negative Covid test, depending on where youaposre going or coming from, you may need to show paperwork such as your passport or visa.  At the airport you will be expected to wear a face covering and follow social contact rules. There will no doubt be enhanced cleaning, and other measures such as perspex screens and sanitiser stations. As restrictions relax, people will be allowed to dine and drink at the airport. Non-essential retail will also be open, so you can still do your pre-flight shopping. Bear in mind that because of the additional measures, things can take slightly longer at the airport – so make sure you have enough time.

Exciting new research suggests the vaccines work not just against Sars-CoV-, but other coronaviruses as well – and could stop emerging pandemics in their tracks.Scientists at North Carolinaaposs Duke University in the US tested mRNA vaccines similar to the approved Covid jabs on monkeys, and found the jabs induced antibodies that could guard against other coronaviruses, thereports. The research, published this week in Nature, also says the vaccines may already offer some protection against viruses like MERS, as well as threats that have not yet been discovered. The researchers said: These results demonstrate current mRNA vaccines may provide some protection from future zoonotic betacoronavirus outbreaks [coronaviruses crossing from animals to humans], and provide a  for further development of pan-betacoronavirus vaccines. The team also tested a new protein nanoparticle vaccine which showed stronger cross-protection against other coronaviruses, including all known iants of Sars-CoV-, bat coronaviruses, and Sars-CoV-, which causes Sars. Dr Anthony Fauci, Americaaposs most senior infectious diseases expert, told a White House press briefing this week that there were caveats because the experiments were conducted on monkeys rather than humans. But he hailed the discovery as an extremely important proof of concept that we will be aggressively pursuing as we get into the development of human trials.  The research was led by Professor Kevin Saunders at Duke Human Vaccine Institute.Professor Danny Altmann, an immunologist at Imperial College, London, told the : Itaposs an optimistic message from a very strong vaccines group that we’ve pretty much got the vaccines to get around not just this coronavirus, but also other relatives coming around the curve.Scientists have warned another deadly pandemic – triggered by an unknown aposDisease Xapos – could be just around the corner. Mark Woolhouse, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh, said: You could use the phrase aposit is when, not apos. He said: We canapost put a handle on when, of course. The precise mechanism by which a virus comes out is always extremely unpredictable. You can never predict precise events, so you have to do it on sort of statistical grounds probability.  Professor Jean-Jacques Muyembe Tamfum, a doctor who helped discover Ebola, has sounded the same alarm about the emergence of new diseases. We are now in a world where new pathogens will come out, he told CNN. And thataposs what constitutes a threat for humanity. Asked whether he believes future pandemics could be more apocalyptic than Covid-, he said: Yes, yes, I think so. Ebola, for example, had a death rate as high as  per cent. Prof Woolhouse said every year or two, scientists are discovering one or two viruses that are transmissible to humans, and the rate has been constant for more than  years. He added: Thataposs going to keep happening.

The programme will feature a fictional politician who is popular with voters but cannot reign in his sex drive. American entrepreneur Ms Arcuri, , who told the Sunday Mirror she had a four-year affair with the PM, has given the script to US producers.Netflix, Amazon and Disney+ are said to be to be interested in the sensational script.The now married American says she saw the sleazy world of London politics at first hand during her time with Boris when he was mayor A source told The Sun: Jenner saw first-hand the sleazy world of London politics for four years. She’s a lot of material from her time with Boris — stuff which might be really embarrassing for him.

There’s a hidden world of sex and corruption behind closed doors in British politics and she’s going to expose it.” Ms Arcuri was studying business in London when she met the then-Mayor of London in . They exchanged numbers while she was serving as a volunteer on his re-election battle bus.  She revealed they had sex for the first time just hours before Mr Johnson appeared in public at the  Paralympics. She also told The Mirror how Mr Johnson would make desperate pleas for racy photos during overseas trade trips, paid for with public money. And Ms Arcuri said she had sex with Mr Johnson in the home he shared with we Marina Wheeler, while she was at work. But she described him as a “cowardly wet noodle” for not standing by her in the row over her presence on foreign trade trips suggesting he may not come out looking too good in the TV drama.Boris Johnson is facing an inquiry by the Greater London Authority - responsible for the mayor’s office - over claims his failure to declare his relationship with Arcuri may have been a breach of the Nolan Principles of Public Le, which are contained in the Mayor of London’s code of conduct.Arcuri was granted access to events at three top level trade missions, despite her businesses not meeting the criteria for the trips. She also received received £, of public money in event sponsorship and grants for her tech business.The Independent Office for Police Conduct said there was no evidence he’d committed the criminal offence of misconduct in public office but he may have breached the Nolan Principles. Len Duvall, the chair of the GLA oversight committee which is conducting the investigation said: “Our investigation will consider whether Boris Johnson conducted himself in a way that’s expected from anyone in that position.“It’s important we get those answers, because Londoners deserve to have their politicians held accountable.”However Ms Arcuri told us: “I never needed Boris to have a seat at the table. I never asked him for any favours.“I didn’t need to trap him. He chose to pursue me. “ And I cared for him fiercely.Mr Johnson denies any wrongdoing and insists he acted with honesty and integrity in their work relationship.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnBoris JohnsonJenner Arcuri"},{"url":null,"title":"princess charlottes favourite snack surprisingly","story":"NewsPrincess Charlottes favourite snack is surprisingly fancy for a six-year-oldThe young royal has a refined taste in snacks, her mum Kate Middleton has revealed, while her younger brother Louis is also a fan of a finer culinary things in lemirrorShareCommentsByBeth CruseMilo BoydReporter:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video beaming-princess-charlotte-celebrates-sixth-,customFields:,clearance:Site Only,source:ceaefcdbe,sourceUrl:PA,site:Mirror,brandSafety: General news – passed for ad targeting,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:vFdNhXi,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

West’s daughter Mae fears her mum – a partner in crime to serial killer Fred West – may know the answers. Mae, , is desperate for Mary’s family to be given closure. But she is worried callous Rose, , will take the secrets to her grave. Mae spoke to the Sunday Mirror on behalf of her siblings in an exclusive interview days after it emerged police had begun digging for Mary under a café where she worked – and where Fred was hired to do building work. Mae told us how:Rose may be hiding details revealed by Fred about what happened to Mary, feared to be his first murder victim. She faces the daily “torture” of being born to Britain’s most evil parents. The police search sparked “intense” emotions over her parents’ past. She has not spoken to her mother in  years and they have grown so distant that she doesn’t even expect to be told when Rose dies. Mae’s monstrous father is feared to have snatched and murdered schoolgirl Mary, , in . For the past week police have been excavating a café basement, half a mile from the Wests’ “House of Horrors” home at  Cromwell Street.Mae told the Sunday Mirror: “I definitely want Mary’s family to have closure. It’s just so dficult that it all can’t be sorted out in one go. I would definitely want closure for her family.” Askedshe thought Rose would give information about Mary’s murder, Mae said: “She won’t. I think Mary’s murder was before her time but how do I know what they discussed ” Tonight a tent remained at the Southgate Street café in Gloucester, with officers searching for clues.The café was where Mary worked as a waitress and Fred was a regular customer.A business owner near the café said: “It’s terrying – we’re told the dig will be going on for weeks. You can hear the drilling. “Everyone in the world is focused on this little corner of Gloucester.” Rose’s fellow lags at New Hall jail in West Yorkshire will be following the news but sources say the killer is unlikely to be tuning in herself. Mary went missing on January , , while waiting at a bus stop on Gloucester’s Bristol Road on her way to see boyfriend Trevor Merrett. She was clutching a Monopoly board game she planned to play. Several of its pieces were found on snow-covered ground near the bus stop. A silver locket, which the family believes belonged to Mary, was found by police at the Wests’ home.Rose first met Fred at Cheltenham bus station in early . She had just turned  and he was . Over the next two decades they embarked on one of the UK’s worst killing sprees.Mae said: “I probably asked mum about Mary when we were in safe houses. Police said we were the best officers they’d known – we’d question mum about things that they had just told us. “She never said anything. I don’t know how she would have known, because mum would have been  when Mary disappeared. “That’s not to say that they didn’t speak about it between them.” The latest twist in the West saga came after a TV team led by Sir Trevor McDonald uncovered potentially vital evidence. The crew – making a documentary for ITV – took a cadaver dog, trained to detect human remains, to The Clean Plate café. The animal reportedly reacted positively at a spot in the basement. Radar is also said to have shown an image – apparently consistent with human remains – at the site of the old toilets.The production company alerted Gloucestershire Police and the property was sealed off and place under -hour guard.A month before Mary went missing, West is said to have carried out work in the café’s basement, laying a concrete floor and converting an area to the side of it into toilets. But Mae wonders whether her father would have left a body there. She said: “How can they have evidence of a body being there  “We’ve been trying to work out what they’ve found because they never contact us. My dad needed to know where everything was, so would he have taken that risk in the middle of a busy town I know he [committed murders] in fields, but I just felt that he wouldn’t have risked that, doing it in a business with people coming in and out all the time. “But it was early days, you just don’t know.” Mae was beaten by her mother and sexually abused by her father as she grew up at the home where nine skeletons were found buried in the cellar and garden in .She was the second of the couple’s eight children. Her older sister Heather, , and step-sister Charmaine, eight, were among the murder victims. Fred, , killed himself in jail in January  before he could stand trial on  murders. Rose was convicted of  ­killings later that year.Mae kept in touch with her mother for  years after she was jailed but cut ties after Rose refused to reveal the truth about her crimes. Nowadays she says she lives a “dferent le” where she hides her horric past from friends, colleagues and family under a new name. Mae said: “You get on with your le and it just comes up again. “It’s brilliantthey can put it all to rest for Mary’s family, but it just brings it all up again. “It’s torture, especially when you are getting on with your le. I’ve got a job and a husband and children but things like this bring it all back. “People I work with don’t even know. It’s like a completely dferent le and when it comes up I struggle with it.I normally avoid stories but this time around, I don’t know why, I have seen it. It’s upsetting the family, my sisters are upset about it, but it feels much more intense than the usual things that come out.Because it’s a search for a body it seems so much bigger than before. I thought the next thing would be mum’s death.” She added: “When I heard that mum had a bad illness, I called the prison and got told that I was not on her ‘list’ so I wouldn’t be told. I’m sure I’ll hear about her death online, before we even get told.It’s  years since I spoke to her, that’s the last time I went to visit her. She’s an odd woman. You don’t question things. If you start to question things, it’s over.” Fred is reported to have admitted killing Mary to his son Stephen. But in police interviews, he denied any guilt. Gloucestershire Police have said geophysical survey equipment is being used in the café cellar.Family liaison officers are supporting surviving members of Mary’s family. Her parents and elder brothers have passed away. A family spokesman said: “We are aware of the ongoing developments.” FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorMore OnRose WestSunday MirrorCrime"},{"url":null,"title":"royal aides want harry meghan","story":"NewsRoyal aides want Harry and Meghan to give up titles after Princes podcast attackPalace aides have called for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex to give up their titles after Harry criticised Prince Charless parenting in a damning podcast interviewmirrorShareCommentsByLaurie Churchman:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video meghan-harry-expert-urges-dispensing-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:HakXA,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

He spoke of a genetic pain passed down through the family. But Royal aides say Harry and Meghan should now have to relinquish their titles. One insider told The Mail on Sunday : There is a growing feeling thatyou dislike the institution that much, you shouldnapost have the titles.The Duke of Sussex has now spent a signicant amount of time emphasising that heaposs no dferent to anyone  and attacking the institution which he says has caused him so much pain. Harry and Meghan pledged not to use their HRH titles after stepping back as senior members of the Royal Family, but have continued to use Duke and Duchess. In the palace, there is said to be resentment at the coupleaposs decision to speak publicly.A royal source told The Times earlier this week: “Nobody is shocked any more. It is more: ‘Here we go again.’ But he should be told that these grievances should be aired in the privacy of your own home.Don’t do it publicly in a podcast. Get on with your le.” This is the latest development in the family feud after the coupleaposs bombshell Oprah Winfrey interview in March. Meghan spoke of the intense pressures of being in the Royal Family, and claimed she had been left feeling suicidal.  She alleged racist comments were made to Harry about the potential skin colour of their then-unborn child Archie, and the couple said a Royal Family member had expressed concerns over how dark their sonaposs skin might be. In the interview Harry also spoke of his troubled relationship with his father, saying Prince Charles had stopped taking his calls after the coupleaposs shock break from the Royal Family. He suggested Charles and brother William were trapped in the Royal Family. He said he felt really let down by his father, and added that the family had cut him off financially.There were hopes father and son could repair their bond after the death of Prince Philip last month, but the relationship still appears to be strained.

Your information will be used in accordance with ourPrivacy Notice.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeThe Rule of Six will be reintroduced indoors from tomorrow, Monday May , as lockdown restrictions ease further.Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that step three of the government’s roadmap out of lockdown can continue as scheduled.Under step three, the restrictions on indoor gatherings will change. People will be able to meet friends and family indoors, and pubs and restaurants will be able to serve customers indoors. However, although the rules around indoor socialising are being relaxed, there are still some rules still in place. Here we explain the Rule of Six and how it works in indoor settings. What is the Rule of Six   You may already be aware of the Rule of Six, which has been in place for outdoor gatherings since March . Crucially, this same rule will be in place for all indoor gatherings – this includes domestic and hospitals settings. It means you can meet six people from dferent households in an indoor setting – or two households of any size. The rule was broadened to include two households of any size, rather than a blanket ban of groups larger than six, to “provide greater flexibility, recognising the dferent situations faced by families and iniduals,” the government explained.  Children of any are are included in the count, but professional carers do not. Support bubbles count as one household. This means you can visit someone’s home, as long as there are not more than six people from dferent households there. From May , you can also stay overnight – but the same Rule of Six applies. While previously, social distancing rules would be in place for groups meeting up from dferent households – this will be eased.  It will allow family and friends who aren’t part of the same household to hug each other again for the first time since March .

Germany, Spain, the Netherlands and Switzerland became the latest nations to ease restrictions on foreign visitors who have had both doses. Vaccinated travellers will be able to enter the countries without having to do a PCR test or go into quarantine. Germany said yesterday it is even allowing people from higher risk amber nations and all will be exempt from having to self-isolate on arrival, while those requiring a test to enter will be given one for free. Spain and the Netherlands, meanwhile, are allowing anyone from countries with low infection rates and they donapost even have to prove vaccination status. The former is considering a  or  per , case rate threshold, while the later has set theirs at , which would include the UK. Switzerland is also dropping quarantine for jabbed people from safe countries.Have your holiday plans been affected by Covid  Let us know at webnews@mirror In contrast, Britain requires anyone from just  green-listed countries to take a test on or before the second day of arrival, eventheyaposve been vaccinated. Those include Portugal, Israel, Gibraltar and Iceland. It comes after Portugal announced Brits would be allowed to enter the country from Monday when the borders re-open following hours of uncertainty. Anyone coming to the UK from an amber listed country, which includes Spain, Germany, Switzerland and Holland, as well as France and Greece, must quarantine for  days and have two PCR tests after two and then eight days.  As such, the UK has been criticised for being too cautious, despite the threat being posed by the Indian iant. Johan Lundgren, chief executive of easyJet, said tougher rules meant not only are Brits going to be beaten to the sun loungers by the Germans, Dutch and Swiss but this will leave them picking up a bigger bill for their holiday, coupled with an onerous, expensive and unnecessary testing regime for low-risk countries. We donapost want Britons to be left behind in the race to the sun when the huge success of our vaccination programme does mean travel can safely reopen, he added.  Tim Alderslade, of Airlines UK, said: The UK will rapidly fall behind the rest of Europe unless it looks again at its overly cautious approach to international travel. There is no reason why our green list canapost be expanded to include the US and the most popular European hotspots, or for the UK not to follow the EUaposs lead in exempting vaccinated travellers from restrictions. There are fears that the B.. strain will hinder the UKaposs pandemic recovery and could lead to the final lting of restrictions on June  being postponed. As experts say vaccines have saved , lives, a surge in cases in Bolton threatens to scupper progress. Scientists and government figures are holding urgent talks amid fears it could delay the end of lockdown rules. Boris Johnson today said he was anxious about the B.. strain, which almost tripled in a week to  UK cases as of May .

The Prime Minister only added India to a group of countries with the strictest travel restrictions on April , three weeks after he placed Pakistan and Bangladesh on the red list. Now there are concerns that the Indian iant could derail lockdown easing plansit is able to spread widely in the UK.  A government source has now told The Times that they are not able to say whether the June  lockdown lting will go ahead as planned until a week before the event. The lack of uncertainty is sure to leave many peopleaposs summer holiday plans up in the air. While the date of the much awaited lockdown lting finale is in doubt, the government is going ahead with plans to ease rules on Monday. Under the penultimate step of the route out of the restrictions people will be allowed to socialise indoors in homes, pubs and restaurants. Physical contact between households will be permitted for the first time in more than a year.  Limited audiences will also be allowed back into theatres, music venues and sports stadiums and foreign travel to some countries will be allowed. Although the restrictions are being lted, the coronavirus situation remains concerning. Sir Mark Walport, a member of Sage warned today that while vaccines still seemed to be protecting people from severe Covid cases, they appeared less good at stopping transmission of the Indian strain.The deputy chair of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation , told BBC Radio aposs Today programme that the race between the spread of coronavirus and the vaccination rollout was on a kne edge. Prof Harnden said: The vaccines may be less effective against mild disease but we donapost think theyaposre less effective against severe disease. But in combination with being less effective against mild disease, theyaposre almost certainly less effective against transmission. He added: Thataposs why weaposre imploringto get out there and vaccinate their unvaccinated people. Public Health England data shows a rise in cases of the Indian iant of concern from  to , this week in the UK.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnBoris JohnsonCoronavirus"},{"url":null,"title":"voice sunday mirror enjoy yourselves","story":"NewsopinionVoice of the Sunday Mirror: Enjoy yourselves as rules relax without killing othersJust because we can mix with friends and family indoors for the first time since January, it doesn’t mean we should slobber all over themmirrorShareCommentsByVoice of the Mirror:,  MAY NewsopinionWe might have more freedoms from Monday, but we still need to be careful \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Just because we can mix with friends and family indoors for the first time since January, it doesn’t mean we should slobber all over them. Of course this newspaper welcomes the reopening of indoor hospitality. God knows, it needs the custom. Of course we feel for families desperate to be reunited with loved ones – for the grandmas and grandpas who yearn to speak to grandchildren in person, not just in a Zoom call. All this has been made possible by the sacrices everyone has made during the lockdowns.  And all that progress could be thrown away unless we proceed with caution. The worrying spread of the new Indian iant makes taking care all the more important. The Indian iant is not the first mutation we have faced, and it will probably not be the last. Despite the phenomenal success of the vaccination programme, scientists do not rule out a iant that can get past the vaccine. We have lived with masks and social distancing for so long, it will not hurt to live with them a little while longer where they are necessary. We do not want to be killjoys. We are just asking for everyone to enjoy themselves without killing others.  Even up rights Now that cohabiting couples are the nation’s fastest-growing type of family unit, it is timely to review the rights and responsibilities that living partnered-up with another person entails. Because the fact is, there are no rights. The concept of common-law marriage is a myth. Too few people know that. So we applaud the inquiry by the Commons Women and Equalities Committee into the legal changes neededcohabiting is to be brought into line with marriage and civil partnership. But we accept MPs are about to step into a legal minefield. Married couples enjoy - claims on property the instant they say “I do”. There is no such landmark moment when two people just start living together. The Law Commission recommends that couples should only have similar rights once they have been living together for five years – or just twothey have children together. And that is as good a point as any for MPs should start their deliberations from.

I’ve adhered to social distancing, I’ve worn my mask and I’ve worked at home. I’ve kept myself safe, and in doing so have kept others safe too.

Never miss a moment by signing up to our newsletter here.  I’m so glad to be getting back to some kind of “normal”. Throughout the lockdowns, I’ve been one of those people shouting from the rooftops about giving people the opportunity to test themselves for Covid. That way,they test positive they could immediately isolate themselves from others. So why is it that now the lateral flow tests are free, I haven’t ordered any and haven’t been bothered about testing myself  I realise it’s complacency. In my mind, there’s now no need for regular personal testing because we have the vaccine, cases of Covid have plummeted and the death rate is vastly reduced. But my ignorance about the benefits of testing was brought home to me when I met someone who had actually had Covid. Four months on, she still can’t smell or taste anything. She asked meI was testing, and I immediately thought, “Here we go, Covid police”. And with an eye roll I said, “No”.  “Have you had Covid ” she asked. “ No, I’ve really kept myself safe.” Shocked, she said: “Saira, I’ve kept myself safe, but through no fault of my own, I was infected by someone who was asymptomatic. Thank god one of his friends, who wasn’t feeling well, told him to take a test, which was positive. He was then able to let others he’d been in contact with know so they could self-isolate and so stop it spreading further.” She told me how having Covid was “bloody horrible”, something she wouldn’t wish on anyone. It certainly made me realise how sheltered I’ve been from the reality of catching the virus. Even though the vaccination programme has been out­­standing, we don’t fully know how big a risk we are to others even after the jab. And we must be especially cautious because of the new Indian iant. I will be regularly testing myself, and I urge you all to please do the same. It’s not a big ask. The thought of putting anyone at risk because I couldn’t be bothered to test fills me with dread. We can’t be complacent. We must all continue to wash our hands, wear a mask, keep our distance and – most important of all – test.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnNHSCoronavirus lockdownCoronavirus"},{"url":null,"title":"zara tindalls savage comment prince","story":"NewsZara Tindalls savage review of Princess Eugenies wedding revealed by lip readerPrince Harry and Meghan Markle joined Zara Tindall and the rest of the royal family at Princess Eugenies wedding, and the cousins were spotted exchanging a quick review of the daymirrorShareCommentsByZoe ForseyFeatures Editor:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video zara-tindall-chats-prince-harry-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:ewlAgLXX,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

Princes William and Harry, Princess Beatrice, Princess Eugenie and Zara Tindall can always be seen chatting at official royal events and enjoying private jokes together.

While weaposre sure it was just a bit of fun, the Queenaposs granddaughteraposs quiet words about Eugenieaposs royal wedding could have got her into trouble with her more-senior cousin. Harry and Zara and their partners Meghan Markle and Mike Tindall had some of the best seats in the house when Eugenie married Jack Brooksbank in October  at St Georgeaposs Chapel in Windsor.However as Zara took her seat she made a passing comment to Harry which could have caused some upset.She was seen leaning back to say a few words to Harry about his own wedding to Meghan, which had taken place a few months before.According to a lip reader, she told the prince: Itaposs very quiet compared to the screaming at your wedding.  In response, he asked: Mine  Eugenie and Jack picked the same wedding venue as the Sussexes for their special day, but they were very dferent occasions. Despite Harry being more senior than his younger cousin, Eugenie actually had more guests, which Prince Andrew said was because his daughter has so many friends. Both guestlists were filled with celebrity guests, with George and Amal Clooney, Oprah Winfrey and the Beckhams joining the royals for the Sussexesapos big day.  Meanwhile, Ellie Goulding, Cara DeLevigne, Demi Moore, and Naomi Campbell were at Eugenieaposs.Eugenie was reportedly upset at her wedding when Meghan used the occasion to tell members of the family she was pregnant.The couple told the world they were expecting their first child on the eve of their royal tour of Australia and New Zealand, but shared the happy news with close family at the evening reception. In their book Royals at War, investigative journalists Dylan Howard and Andy Tillett claim Meghan made the decision to tell people - and it didnapost go down well with Harry. They claim that it left the Duke of Sussex embarrassed, and Princess Eugenie and her mum Sarah Ferguson furious. They write: Meghan put her foot in it when she decided that it would be the ideal moment to announce that she and Harry were expecting their first child. This was a huge social gaffe, evenyou were not a Royal – stealing the limelight from Eugenie, who was furious, as was her mother, Sarah.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnZara PhillipsPrince HarryMarriageRoyal FamilyWeddings"},{"url":null,"title":"man mortified after neighbour sends","story":"NewsMan mortied after neighbour sends note begging him to ‘have quieter sex’Stephen Cummingham, , was left in stitches after his neighbour dropped a \"friendly note\" warning him that sound can travel, and asking him to keep the noise down at nightmirrorShareCommentsByKirsty FeerickJournalistRosaleen FentonAudience Writer:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsThe note warned that sound can trave \" %, rgba, rgba, url\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your dayInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.SubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Stephen told the Record: “I sent my boyfriend a text immediately. “He just laughed though and over the course of the day with everyone commenting and laughing on Twitter I quickly got over the embarrassment. “I moved in last September to the block of flats.

And now one social media user has claimed that our Apple phones have also been taking photos of us every few seconds. In a viral TikTok video, a woman shares her conspiracy theory, filming her phone with an infrared lens, which shows a flash going off every five seconds.And while it does look like itaposs taking pictures, experts have explained thataposs not actually the case. According to a number of people in the comments, the phone is actually scanning to seeyou are looking directly at the screen - and it only occurs on iPhones that have the Face ID feature.Itaposs whataposs known as an Attention-Aware feature, meaning that the phone will check whether youaposre paying attention to the screen, before dimming the display, lowering the volume of some alerts or expanding a notication.Responding to @itsconspiracyseriously and @briethomasons video, people compared the feature to the way Amazonaposs Alexa devices are always listening out for the aposAlexaapos command. One person said: Of course it doesyou have Face ID set up. Itaposs like Alexa or Google Home. Constantly listening for the Hey Google or Hey Alexa. Same concept.Another said: The phone is not taking pictures, itaposs only seeingyou are looking at the phone so it wonapost lock while you are looking at it. You can deactivate that. Others claimed to have seen the flashes on their baby monitor and been confused as to what they were. If youaposre not keen on the idea of your phone constantly scanning your face, you can disable the feature in settings. You simply go to Face ID  Passcode, enter your passcode and then scroll down to attention. Here you have two options you can deactivate - Require Attention for Face ID and Attention-Aware Features. The first feature says: TrueDepth camera will provide an additional level of security by verying that you are looking at iPhone before unlocking. Some sunglasses may block attention detection. The second, attention-aware reads: iPhone will check for attention before dimming the display, expanding a notication when locked or lowering the volume of some alerts.Did you know about these features  Let us know in the comments below.

Take what happened to one woman who shared a spine-tingling story of what she recently discovered in her home. Angelica, , was urged to move house after sharing the creepy artwork she discovered behind a wall.Upon exploring a little further, she discovered it was covering a hole that connected to their bathroom and was filled with rubbish including an empty cup. She explained that she initially discovered the artwork after getting a kitten who loves to hide around the house.  But Angelica and her boyfriend were left creeped out after stumbling upon a mysterious hole in the kitchen while looking for their moggie. In a video, Angelia showed off the cute cat - and the artwork they discovered while looking for her. She explained: So me and my boyfriend got a new kitty recently and she was hiding. So we were trying to find out where she was. We tried looking behind the couch and we couldnapost find her anywhere. Then we look in the kitchen and we see that thereaposs a hole here. She then zoomed in on the hole in her skirting, and helpfully held up her hand to show off its size.  Inside, there was an unusual hangman style picture - which left viewers creeped out. Angelica continued: Let me just show you what we found. Iaposve put my wide-angle lens on so you can see it better. This hole is really tiny compared to my hand, but when you go in here, thereaposs a picture. I donapost know what the hell that means. In another video, Angelica said her cat wouldnapost leave the hole and kept looking at the artwork. After researching online, she said the document resembled runes, but she couldnapost find a match online. Other TikTok users were terried by the disturbing discovery, with many urging her to get a Priest to visit her house. The couple then took out their stove, in order to examine the picture more closely, and found it was discovering a hole. Angelica said: This made everything way creepier, just because we didnapost know what the hell was back there. So the hole is connected to our bathroom, what youaposre seeing right now is our bathtub.  We ended up finding a - cup that looks like itaposs from  and also a random piece of cardboard. So we still donapost have a concrete answer so we decided to burn the paper. Lots of people were left creeped out, and many urged her to move house. One warned: The cat is trying to tell you something, while another joked: Oh hell no, thataposs how scary movies begin. Another added: It means get a new house in a dferent country, while another replied: Leave, leave now with what you have on you.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @MirrorWeirdNewsCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnUmm what "},{"url":null,"title":"woman urged move house after","story":"NewsWoman urged to move house after spotting creepy black wires hanging from tapA woman has shared the rather unfortunate discovery she made in her bathroom, leaving people horried, and many urging her to leave the house after she shared a video onlinemirrorShareCommentsByRosaleen FentonAudience Writer:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video tiktok-user-spots-wires-hanging-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:JBFMrcV,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

The sense of panic as you mentally calculate how far away it is and at what speed it could get to you, is sadly very real. So spare a thought for one poor woman, who had a very unpleasant encounter in the bathroom. The woman, only known as Lucy, shared a video of how she discovered spotted black wires hanging from her tap. But it wasnapost actually wires - it appeared to be the legs of a spider that was firmly wedged inside the tap, ready to shoot out when the water was turned on.  Her video of the discovery has gone viral, with more than , views, although some pointed out that it could be a plastic spider. In the caption, she wrote: So I saw these things sticking out the bath tap, before zooming in up the spout of the tap. She then turned the taps on, which dislodged the uninvited house guest - and sparked a wave of comments from arachnophobes. The video left many people unnerved, as one joked: I wouldaposve died, while another wrote: That thing was about to take my le out. Others joked that they couldnapost watch for fear something would jump out the tap, and many admitted they didnapost finish the whole video. But one person claimed: Thataposs a toy spider, Iaposm not having it. Lots of people urged the woman to leave, with one commenting: Pack your bag and burn the house down. Another agreed, commenting: Simple solution is to move house.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @MirrorWeirdNewsCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnViral"},{"url":null,"title":"woman urges people trust gut","story":"NewsWoman urges people to trust gut after suspicious wedding guest has affair with groomA woman has encouraged people to always trust their instincts, after a suspicion she had about a guest at her sisters wedding turned out to be even worse than she could have imaginedmirrorShareCommentsByCourtney PochinAudience Writer:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsThe woman wore white and sat in the brides seat\" %, rgba, rgba, url\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your dayInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.SubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

However, we frequently hear tales where relatives and friends show up on the big day, wearing white gowns, attempting to upstage the bride.But one woman has shared a story where a guest at her sisteraposs wedding went one step further. Writing anonymously for Kidspot.au, the woman explained how a guest she didnapost know turned up to the wedding in a slinky white dress and then at the reception, stole the brideaposs seat while she was up, doing the rounds. The sister explains how she had a bad feeling about the way the guest looked far too comfortable sitting in the brideaposs seat, talking closely with the groom. She didnapost like it one bit, so marched up to the table and said: Thataposs my sisteraposs seat. Neither of them did or said anything. I don’t know who you are, but you shouldn’t attend a wedding wearing white and then sit in the bride’s seat when it’s not your wedding, she continued. Some of the guests had started looking at them at this point, so the guest decided to get up and leave, saying to the groom: Iaposll speak to you later. Neither the bride nor the family wanted to make any more of a fuss about it and risk ruining the special occasion. But the sister claims she knew in her heart that something was not right about the two of them. The incident wasnapost spoken of again for two years - but it turns out she had been right.We discovered two years later the woman and my brother-in-law had been having an affair, she told the publication. In some ways, I was furious with myself for not speaking up. All my sister had now was a marriage of two years that had been a lie. She added: I wish Iaposd made a bigger fuss at the wedding about that woman being in that seat so that more people could have seen. And spoken to my sister openly about my concerns. This is why wise people advise, ‘Trust your instinctsapos.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

securing Premiership football next season after seeing off Raith Rovers in the play-off semi-final.The Dark Blues were in the driving seat ahead of the semi-final second leg after winning - in midweek at Stark#s Park.However, James McPake#s men were stunned when Rovers opened the scoring in the first half through Lewis Vaughan.Rovers had further chances against a nervy-looking home side but Dundee held on to progress to the final against either Kilmarnock, Ross County or Hamilton # although basement club Accies require something special on Sunday to get there, needing to beat Kilmarnock by nine goals.Rovers had an early chance in just the third minute with Dan Armstrong coming in off the right wing to send an angled drive towards goal but his shot was easily dealt with by home keeper Adam Legzdins.Dundee then broke from inside their own half, with Paul McMullan playing the ball wide to Jason Cummings but the striker#s shot was deflected for a corner.The home side had another chance as Charlie Adam fired a deep free-kick into the Raith box, with centre-half Lee Ashcroft shooting just over Rovers keeper Jamie MacDonald#s crossbar.However, it was the Fe side who broke the deadlock in the st minute when a ReganHendry shot fell to Vaughan inside the Dundee box, with the forward swivelling before producing a fine finish past Legzdins.Raith were on top and Dundee boss McPake could be heard screaming at his players to stop sitting so deep.In the th minute, the home side carved out a promising opening as the overlapping Cammy Kerr cut the ball back to Max Anderson but the midfielder#s shot was well saved by MacDonald.Just before half-time there was a big scare for Adam when he handled the ball # having been booked shortly before # but referee Don Robertson was content to just award a free-kick.There was a Raith claim for a penalty in the th minute when a Vaughan shot was blocked by Jordan McGhee, with the ball appearing to strike the defender#s hand but Robertson was not convinced there was a case to answer.Rovers continued to press and had another good opportunity as Kieran MacDonald teed up Armstrong but his shot was deflected wide for a corner.However, the Raith challenge finally ran out of steam, with Dundee going through despite losing on the night.Dundee v Raith Rovers: John McGlynn opens up on serious illness battle which makes him treasure this

with other households, physical distancing and travel, amongst other things.Many Scottish islands will move to level one of restrictions, allowing more guests at funerals and weddings and stadiums and events to reopen and reboot.However, Moray and Glasgow will remain in level three for at least another week first minister Nicola Sturgeon announced on Friday.Here#s everything you need to know about the changes coming into place on Monday, May :Places and business that can open at level two include:Places and business that must close at Level  include:From Monday, May , Orkney, Shetland, Na h-Eileanan Siar, all islands in Highlandand the Argyll and Bute islands of Coll, Colonsay, Erraid, Gometra, Iona, Islay, Jura, Mull, Oronsay, Tiree and Ulva will move to level one. Islands not at level one will move to level two.Places and business that can open at level one include: Moray will remain under level three of Covid restrictions for at least a further week.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon confirmed this news in parliament on Friday, with Glasgow also remaining at the same level, as the remainder of mainland Scotland looks forward to restrictions easing from Monday.Financial help will be offered to businesses in the regions, with £, given to Moray Council to help with this.Ms Sturgeon said that this was a “dficult” decision but she was “optimistic” that the region could move to level two when the situation is reviewed at the end of next week.Moray has experienced a surge in Covid cases in recent weeks, with the region’s infection rate hitting more than  per , earlier this week.Those numbers have fallen slightly, but remain high at  per ,.Elgin has been the focal point of the rise in cases, with more than  cases confirmed at Elgin Academy.New outbreaks have also been reported in Aberlour and Keith, with mobile testing units being brought in there.Speaking to Parliament on Friday, Ms Sturgeon announced that Moray and Glasgow would be staying in level three for at least another week.She said: “In Moray, the latest available data shows that the number of cases per , is  and the test positivity is .%.“I’m pleased to say that both of these measures are declining and so there are now grounds for cautious optimism that the situation in Moray is improving as a result of the public health interventions that have been taken.“However, case numbers remain more than double the Scottish average and so the judgement of the local incident management team which has informed this decision is that it is prudent for Moray to remain at level three for a further week so that we can be more confident that the situation is firmly under control.“The position will be reviewed again at the end of next week, at which point I do hope that Moray will move to level two.“I know this will be disappointing for residents and businesses in Moray, I will come back to the point about business support shortly, however in my judgement it is sensible although dficult to be cautious now and allow Moray to move with more confidence to level two rather than ease restrictions prematurely and risk having to go backwards later.”  For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/syndicatenews/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/05/KFX-040321-02-06_38116158-558x372.jpg ","title":"drink driver flipped car while more than four times limit","story":"A drink-driver crashed and flipped his car onto its roof while more than four-and-a-half times the legal alcohol limit.

It shows new reported cases and deaths in the last day, as well as the total cases in each area since the pandemic began. After a second wave over winter, most areas of the country are starting to see figures fall again.The proportion of people who test positive every day was trending downward since December.The chart below shows local positivity rates. This is now a key metric that is considered when putting each area into tiers. The colour scales refer to the potential levels recommended by the World Health Organisation.Another key metric is the rate of cases per , people. The chart below shows the seven day rate in each local authority. Similar to the chart above, this chart is also colour coded by the potential levels as recommended by the WHO.In the early stages of the pandemic, cases were more concentrated in older generations. In the last few months this has shted towards cases being more prevalent in younger people – however, cases are declining in the more vulnerable age groups as the vaccine rollout progresses.As the number of daily new cases reduces, the cumulative totals for the health board areas become less important. The heatmap below shows the number of new cases by health board area.The chart below shows the daily number of deaths after a positive test as well as the cases where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certicate.The heatmap below shows the age demographics of the people who have lost their lives to the virus. The chart below shows a daily snapshot of the number of people in hospital and ICU with Covid-. Use the dropdown to navigate to your health board. The chart below shows the number of new tests reported each day. This figure shows all tests carried out, regardless of the result.In October, Public Health Scotland released testing data at a regional level.

making it an lsquoancillaryrsquo centre which will only be used during major events or as back-up.The move will mean people arrested in East Lothian and Midlothian, who would have been taken into custody in the Midlothian station now face being transported to St Leonardrsquosin Edinburgh for lock-up.A meeting of East Lothianrsquos Police, Fire and Community Safety Scrutiny Committee, was told that the proposals would free up two additional local police officers for the county.However, concerns were raised by councillors about the additional journey time it would take for officers to transport people in custody to the Edinburgh station.Suzie Mertes, from Police Scotlandrsquos Criminal Justice Services ision, said that the number of people being taken into custody in Scotland had halved from , to , in recent timesand changes were being made as part of an annual review.She told the committee that providing custody services at St Leonardrsquos would be better for prisoners who might be vulnerable as more support services were available and would benefit local officers who were currently drafted in to ldquobackfill for custody officers when they were on leave.It was not made clear whether the decision to take custody officers away from Dalkeith would see opening hours of the station reduced or changed.However, Ms Mertes stressed that the custody facilities would not close completely and would be available for major events in the area or times when it was felt they were needed.And she said that current custody staff based at Dalkeith would be given the option to transfer their services to support local policing.She added: ldquoIn terms of Dalkeith, should someone need to be brought in for an interview it will be open.ldquoThis is a flexible model that will allow us to push and pull resources into Dalkeith when needed.Concerns were raised about the additional journey time for officers transporting prisoners to St Leonardrsquos for custody however, Ms Mertes said that the benefits outweighed the disadvantages, pointing out that officers could sometimes find themselves manning empty cells at Dalkeith when they could be spending time on local policing.Councillor Jim Goodfellow, committee convenor, said that the move could prove beneficial to those who found themselves spending a night in the cells as well.And the decision was welcomed by the committee convenor to downgrade Dalkeithrsquos custody centre from a full-time operation to lsquoancillaryrsquo.He said: ldquoThere are some concerns that there is movement towards the centre of Edinburgh but there may be some benefit for the poor souls taken into custody.ldquoIf they are released from Dalkeith, getting back to North Berwick is an absolute nightmare, whereasthey are released

It is a scenario that will be familiar to many Scottish voters, for this has been the  Days Later election for these pandemic times.Anything that involved coming within two metres of a stranger was out of the question . So cheerio doorstep debating, rallies, walkabouts, all the usual fun and games, and hello masks and Zoom.The battle began in routine fashion with the dissolution of the Scottish Parliament. Some MSPs were not seeking re-election, among them Ruth Davidson, who was leaving to spend more time with her ermine.For everyone  it was off to the constituency or region to prepare for government. Or,you were a Scottish Labour candidate, to prepare your excuses. With Anas Sarwar in charge there was a certain spring in the partyrsquos step, with the new leader even joining in with an outdoors exercise class dancing to Uptown Funk. Yes sir, he can boogie.Willie Rennie continued his quest to stage the most ridiculous photo op ever, with shots of the LibDem leader at a penguin parade, in a giant deckchair, and boxing. Not wishing to be left out, Scottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross continued his partyrsquos tradition of clambering on to the nearest military vehicle, in his case an armoured personnel carrier. And he wasnrsquot even campaigning in Castlemilk.Mr Ross received a lot of help from his predecessor, Ms Davidson, who even fronted the party political broadcast. Her omnipresence contrasted with the complete absence of Boris Johnson. Having said that wild horses wouldnrsquot keep him away, the Prime Minister preferred to stay in London and dodge questions about gold wallpaper rather than take his chances with rebellious Scots .Try as the parties did to generate excitement, the campaign was proving as empty and devoid of interest as Celticrsquos trophy cabinet. Then it happened. Cue movie trailer voice guy: ldquoThe sky darkened. Birds ceased singing. Jaws dropped. HE was back. And this time HE had brought a whole new party with him. After the initial shock of Alex Salmondrsquos , observers turned to more serious matters, like how to pronounce the Alba Partyrsquos name. Some said ldquoAlapa others ldquoWallopers. Mr Salmond came bearing the promise of a ldquosupermajority of independence-supporting MSPs who would make Johnson an offer he could not refuse.The media was delighted to see theof Mr Salmond, and reporters were soon asking SNP leader Nicola Sturgeonshe would work with her predecessor. Ms Sturgeon gave the impression she did not wish to be on the same continent as her old boss, never mind in coalition with him.The SNP leader conducted a lot of her campaign from her by-now-famous conservatory. FDR had his fireside chats, Nicola has natters in the greenhouse. Consensus had it that the election was in the bag for her. It only remained to be seenshe would win a majority, and which party would take second place to the SNP, the Conservatives or Labour.The TV debates gave voters a chance to see the party leaders in action. Not all the leaders, however. BBC Scotland and STV limited participation to the five largest parties in the Scottish Parliament, which meant no podium for Mr Salmond or George Galloway, the leader of the All for Unityparty.Mr Galloway tried to whip up interest in a mano a mano with the Alba leader, moderated by Andrew Neil. Viewers might have been interested had David Attenborough not featured extensive scenes of walruses fighting in his last televisual masterpiece.So five went off to debate, with Sarah Smith and Glenn Campbell holding the jaikets for the BBC, and Colin Mackay doing the same for STV. Channel rsquos Krishnan Guru-Murthy came all the way from London town to show us he was as familiar with Scottish politics as Donald Trump was with third-wave feminism.The televised debates were missing a live audience in the studio, and turned out to be horribly dull in consequence. Scottish Greens co-leaders Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater ided the debate work between them, though Steve Arnott-dress-a-like Harvie hogged more of the limelight.Anas Sarwar adopted a ldquoWhy canrsquot we be friends approach to the debates, albeit the offer clearly did not extend to the Conservatives, who were the focus of everyonersquos attacks. Douglas Ross seemed spectacularly cross in most of the encounters, while Ms Sturgeon tried hard not to look humongously smug or bored.Election day arrived, and with it the chance to exercise that age-old right to take a photie of the dug at a polling place and post it on Twitter.The one million Scots who had registered to vote by post had already done their bit, quietly and without fuss, in keeping with the mood. In one final insult from the heavens, the counts were not starting till the morning after, so voters were denied the thrill of spending the night with Kirsty Wark and Bernard Ponsonby.It had been that kind of election, that kind of year. May we never see its likes again."},{"url":null,"title":"katherine-kelly-not-good-spinning-lots-plates","story":"Katherine Kelly: I#m not very good at spinning lots of platesKatherine Kelly as SallyKatherine Kelly: I#m not very good at spinning lots of platesMichael Stevenson as Brown, Laura Rollins as Paine, Shaun Dooley as Braithwaite,ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgt Janine Wood as Hollltspan classtruncate-full-screengtinsKatherine Kelly is recalling the moment she realised she was working too much.It was before the much sought-after actress - star of Liar II, Cheat and Mr Selfridge - had started a family.Filming a scene where her character had to order at a bar, it dawned on her she had no idea what people would drink in real le anymore.\"It had been so long since Id really truly gone to a pub - and not some sort of red carpet where youre handed a bottle of champagne,\" says the Barnsley native, . \"I was like, Do people drink lager and black anymore  Is that a thing \"And it really bothered me, because I thought, How can you represent real leyoure not in real le \"I felt that going from job to job was actually diluting what I was doing, and then I wasnt bringing as much richness to the characters that I play.\"Now Kelly - who shares two daughters with IT consultant Ryan Clark- reflects on how she makes a conscious decision to be picky with what she stars in.\"Ive always been of the attitude that I would rather be a smaller part in something good than the lead in something crap. I dont have that ego.\"She continues, candidly: \"For me, its quality, not quantity - and Im very all or nothing.\"Im not very good at spinning lots and lots of plates. Ive realised that about myself as I get older, and Ive turned down jobs when I feel like Ive got a bit too much on - especially when theatres were around.\"Her latest role is the second series of ITV psychological thriller, Innocent, written by Chris Lang and Matt Arlidge.The first series, which starred Lee Ingleby, Hermione Norris and Dan Ryan, was a ratings success.In this four-parter, Kelly plays Sally Wright, a schoolteacher who was alleged to be having an affair with her -year-old pupil, Matty Taylor.The four-part series follows Sally as she is released from prison and fights, against all odds, to prove her innocence. It also stars the likes of Marcellas Jamie Bamber, as her husband Sam, and Its A Sin actor Shaun Dooley - who also hails from Barnsley - as DCI Mike Braithwaite, who has been given the task of reinvestigating Mattys murder.\"Sally wants her le back,\" explains Kelly. \"She wants to be back in the town where she was and integrated back into society.\"I enjoyed reading her quiet journey of that. I felt like I hadnt really seen that on-screen very much.\"In preparation for the role, did she speak with people who had been through similar situations \"I couldnt in the end, because of lockdown. But I had worked with Clean Break, a theatre company who work with people who have been in prison. I was really moved by that and the people I met.\"She had to do her research in a more remote way instead.\"YouTubes a fantastic source of real people just chatting, thats not filtered or edited. I read a couple of fantastic books. I wanted to read some really current prison diaries.\"There are some fantastic documentaries Louis Theroux, he talked to Amy Beck [who turned herself into police in  for having a sexual relationship with her former student], so I did a bit of research on her. But I think the most helpful thing for me was a series thats still available on Channel , called Prison.\"The show was filmed during lockdown, and you could argue that isolating during shooting gives a bit of an insight into what it would have been like for Sally.\"We live in a free country, and some of our freedoms have been taken away. It certainly felt very strange to me to not, in theory, be allowed to go somewhere and do some things,\" she muses.Discussing her characters experience further, she notes: \"When she comes out of prison, youll see its very cinematic. Sally stops the car, because she can, and she winds down the window, because she can, and then she puts her feet in the lake, because she can.\"Everything would have been decided for her, and thats very extreme. And, because she was rumoured to be a sex offender, she would have then probably been isolated for her own safety - she wouldnt have even had what can be a prison community.\"With the last  months, we can all probably relate to that loss of freedom. And hopefully, you do watch her come back to le hopefully, she looks very pale and drawn at the beginning and then you see her slowly, slowly get her energy and her le back - and maybe thats what will happen to us.\"Kelly says she cant wait for theatres to be open again soon, what with lockdown restrictions easing, because \"I dont just like the dferent characters, I like the dferent mediums as well\".But any Coronation Street fans hoping she might one day reprise the role of ladette Becky McDonald - who she played from  to  - should prepare to be disappointed.\"That character was very much of her time, and I think, in all honesty, she would be a bitter disappointment to revisit,\" she admits.\"I would hate for her to be spoiled in any way, because it was such a perfect character, at a perfect time. Beckys better left with a fondness.\"Innocent airs on STV over four consecutive nights, from tomorrow at pm."},{"url":null,"title":"pro-union-parties-indyref2-obsession-fuelling-debate","story":"In part, this obsession has led to the SNP being let off the hook for its failures in government as was reflected in this weekendrsquos election results and perpetuated by every media outlet across the country zoning in on constitutional questions.Over the past few weeks, the majority of pro-Union politicians have used every sound clip offered to them to exclaim their anti-independence thoughts rather than explain how they propose to get this country back on its feet and how they could work with the Government to put recovery first.With all eyes focused on the constitution, it has worked in the favour of the SNP who have managed to be elected to Government with a record number of votes, despite their failings over the past  years in charge.The First Minister herself admitted during the campaign that she had taken her ldquoeye off the ball as Scotland racked up the highest drugs death in Europe. But there doesnrsquot appear to have been any rebuke for the drugs deaths crisis, their failed education record, missed hospital waiting time targets, rising child poverty rates, the exam results scandal, or failures in local policing.The next Scottish Government has an opportunity over the next five years to make amends for past failures and getting caught up in an independence campaign will only take the SNPrsquos eye off the ball once again.However, the SNP did not win a majority in the election and as a minority government will require support from other parties to pass budgets and any major reforms.The Scottish Greens will likely prop up the SNP in future policy discussions, but this will requirepolicy trade-offs infor budget support.With COP firmly in the sights of both parties as an opportunity to showcase Scotland as a leader in tackling climate change on the global stage, will the Scottish Greens be willing to lend support to independence which could risk the SNP taking its focus off meeting its emissions reduction targets of % by  ndash which it has done for the past two years in a row.They have already said they want bold action from the Scottish Government and now they are in a position to bargain for this.Read more:Indyref and a blinkered green agenda could harm Scottish farmings futureDuring Sundayrsquos Andrew Marr programme, a suggestion of next spring to hold another referendum was put to the First Minister, to which, of course, she said she was contemplating. Nicola Sturgeon hasnrsquot officially committed to a timescale, other than the first half of the next parliamentary term, but it would appear that the media is setting the ball rolling by proposing such a timeline. As much as I have criticised the SNP for pedalling talks of Indyref during a pandemic, journalists are also guilty of fuelling the debate and diminishing print space or airtime for more immediate and pressing issues.Over the past week I have been moving into my new house, which has involved many hours of deep cleaning whilst tuned in to my radio and coverage of the election.Hats off to BBC Radio Scotland team for managing to fill three daysrsquo worth of election coverage with very little to report on other than the one major news story: would the SNP gain a majority Although they covered results and reaction across the entire country, the main topic on every reportersrsquo lips was whether the SNP would have a mandate to hold another referendum. So, for every listener tuned in, we are being told that this is the discussion we need to be having, this is the headline we should all be taking away.In between googling tutorials on how to sand kitchen worktops, I checked in to the community Facebook page for my local village and was struck by the fact that none of the members were remotely engaged in discussions over the election, let alone independence. Like many other communities across the country, this village is still in the grips of a pandemic, so quite understandably, most posts and discussions revolved around Covid advice and best practice, information about the local youth club reopening, as well as a series of church services.Read more:Scottish election: Indyref cant continue to dominate the next five years mdash there are bigger issuesMembers were posting aboutfitness camps and slots which had come available for hairdressers and beauty salons. Local businesses desperate to rebuild and get customers in their doors.Economic recovery is what matters to so many, yet we are so embroiled in constitutional questions that we lose sight of the ramications the past year has had for so many businesses and iniduals who have lost their jobs and families living below thepoverty line.There is no denying the fact that there is indeed an appetite to reopen the debate around independence, the recent vote shows an almost   split down the middle, but I do not believe it should be up to the media to frame the discussion.There is a huge job ahead for the next Scottish Government to deliver on a national recovery and all opposition politicians and members of the press must be focused on holding them accountable for the measures they are taking to get the country back on its feet.Letrsquos not do Alex Salmondrsquos job for him by inadvertently holding the SNPrsquos feet to the fire over independence but instead hold their feet to the fire over the nationrsquos recovery from the pandemic.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

It seems to have started off, in medieval times, as Grymisdyke or Grymersquos Dyke, this being an older or northern version of Graham. If you were Graham, it was Grym up north.But who was Graham  Well, according to the medieval chronicler John of Fordun, he might have been the grandfather of an ancient king called Eugenius. There was a Gryme who allegedly stormed the wall in the th century AD, when it was still supposedly of use to those living south of it.One Robert Graham also crops up in an inscription dated rather dodgily to , and thought to be a forgery.

So, that would make it Devilrsquos Dyke. Griacutemr or Grim are also handles for Odin or Woden, who were considered devils by Christians.At any rate, as walls go, Graham is seen as a poor manrsquos Hadrian, with much of that perception due to the fact that little of it survived, which is what happens when you use turf and wood rather than stone like that big fancy effort  miles south.I should say this is more of a Roman than a Scottish icon. If yoursquove never heard of the Romans I can exclusively reveal they were a ghastly bunch of fascists who tried to militarise the world. Their only saving grace was that the peoples they conquered were often even worse, though hopelessly disorganised.Emperor Antoninus Pius ordered the wall to be built as a northern frontier against the barbarians . You might ask why the Romans decided to stop there rather than going the whole hog. If yoursquore a common or garden anti-Scottish Scot, you say: ldquoThey could have taken all of Scotlandthey wanted to but there was too much forest and stuff. Naw. They couldnae. It was an ever-expanding empire. They didnrsquot say: ldquoDrsquoyou know what, I think wersquoll just stop here. And the whole of Britain was forest. They built a wall there to stop themselves getting skelped. RAB:Declaration of Arbroath.

It was constructed by the soldiers of three legions ndash the nd Augustan, th Victorious and th Victorious Valerian . Itrsquos thought that these fellows were mostly auxiliary troops, drawn from across the Empire, often from places with better climates. They must have had a blast, living in leather tents or wooden huts and singing morosely through the rain at the end of another dayrsquos labour: ldquoAll in all, itrsquos just another turf in the wall.There were around , soldiers stationed at the wall, and itrsquos not known what they did all day other than marching up and doon, like these goons guarding things that you see in movies.

RAB:How did we end up with the Saltire as our national flag Other items have been found, such as altars and childrenrsquos shoes, which are more interesting than that usual standby from archaeology: pottery. They must have had a lot of evening classes in the subject back in ancient times.Some lucky archaeologists who get to examine ancient poop have found that the soldiersrsquo diet was mainly vegetarianand consisted of stuff like figs, herbs, berries and nuts. Ooh, yummy.They werenrsquot vegetarians on ethical grounds. A distance slab found at Bridgeness, West Lothian, depicts a bull, a pig and a sheep being led to sacrice, with musicians drowning out their screams.The Romans, precursors of western civilisation, believed that offering animals to their gods brought good fortune. This was because, like all people in the past, they were nutters.

To paraphrase Einstein, the unionists cannot solve their problems with the same thinking they used when they created them.We can travel back as far as we want for examples of unionism creating its own problems, however we need only look back a decade to see exhibit A. In , after an unrelated meeting in Downing Street, I was asked for my view on the upcoming independence referendum, with polls at that time recording - percent for No.I told my questioner thathe fought the referendum on the basis that lsquoNo means status quorsquo he would win narrowly or, on a bad day, might even lose. He looked at me the way you might look at someonethey vomited on your kitchen table. I was told that they would fight on the status quo and win by  points, before I was dispatched.A couple of years later, just three days before the referendum, a petried Downing Street put lsquoThe Vowrsquo on the front page of the Daily Record, leading to the Smith Commission and the third tranche of devolved powers.If it looked like a panicked, half-hearted and disingenuous bung, itrsquos because it was. Just like the Calman Commission before it, which was the unionist response to the SNP victory of , this was peak reactive unionism.It could have been very dferent. In a conversation which was little known at the time, but which has since become accepted fact, when the Yes campaign was polling somewhere less than one-third, then First Minister Alex Salmond offered then Prime Minister David Cameron a dferent kind of referendum. The proposal was that there would be two questions on the ballot paper the first a lsquoyesrsquo or lsquonorsquo to constitutional change, and the second an lsquoindependencersquo or lsquodevo maxrsquo to the type of constitutional change.Had Mr Cameron accepted the offer, it is not a stretch to suppose that the devo max option would have won by a seismic margin polling at the time certainly pointed towards this. Had that happened, it is also not a stretch to suppose that the immediate and growing momentum for a second plebiscite would have been absent from mainstream debate, confined to the -or-so percent who always have, and always will, believe that there is a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.The core determinant in Mr Cameronrsquos refusal of the offer by Mr Salmond is the same core determinant which is preventing unionists from making rational decisions in the wake of this latest SNP landslide ndash psychology.In the final analysis, saying no to Mr Salmondrsquos offer was the only logical output from a coterie of people who are emotionally and psychologically unwilling to embrace devolution. It is primarily a Tory phenomenon, but Labour-types should not be naive enough to believe that it doesnrsquot, at times, infect them too.They suffer from a very British disease which sees decentralisation as defeat. Unlike in the Anglo-Saxon countries to which we exported democracy, British unionists view pockets of power outwith the capital suspiciously, as a threat. Where Americans fiercely protect the power of state government, we fiercely protect the power of the central government. Where Canadians see separate provincial political parties as an expression of local ersity, Brits see them as a slippery slope to political separation. Where Australians celebrate their states having codied and clearly understood governance, we tinker with localism according to the prevailing politics of the day.And what good does that do us  Which of the four countries in question is in danger of fragmenting  Only ours.Unionismrsquos problems are not the creation of nationalists. In truth there has not been much of a pull-factor. They are entirely self-inflicted unionists have pushed middle Scotland away. It is true what some say, that change now may be too late. The current is strong, and it is pushing unionism out to sea. However,they want to at least put up a fight, unionists must reimagine unionism.The only viable United Kingdom, now, is a looser kingdom at ease with its many identities and embracing its political ersity. It is a kingdom enthusiastic about decentralisation, aware that localism is the adhesive which keeps it together, not the wedge which drives it apart.People sometimes ask: but what powers do you want  There are direct answers to that question, in both taxation and legislative arenas. However, this is no longer so much about what unionists do, as it is about how they do it.Devolution through gritted teeth will never change opinion, because it is so transparently grudged. The enthusiasm of Canada is missing. The cooperation of Australia is missing. The partnership of America is missing.The model of the Union Connectivity Review and the levelling up agenda, for instance, is sound, and is actually borrowed from federal systems. But the bitter, cynical, conniving undertone is turning it from a celebration of partnership into an attempt to create into a constitutional version of Stockholm Syndrome.Unionism can still prevail. It can win a referendum. But this is about far more than tactics and strategy. The uncomfortable truth is that, in the case of very many unionist leaders, their head is in devolution, but their heart is not. Changing that may not be a sufficient condition to win, but it is a necessary one.bullAndy Maciver is Director of Message MattersOur columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

It has no mains electricity, no public water supply, no cars, no shop, no GP, no ferry, no surgery and no school.A visit here would open most peoples eyes and by the time Miss Dooley left Gometra she had seen the good and bad of living a simpler le and learnt about the need for everyone to do their bit to save the planet.In the Eco Warriors episode of her Sleepover series, which airs on the W channel at pm on Monday May ,the acclaimed documentary maker vows: \"I am going to leave here and think about where I travel, what I eat, what I consume.\"The presenter is seen settling down for a candle-lit evening in, with island owner and environmental campaigner Roc Sandford and his daughters, Savannah, , and Blue, .Mr Sandford said: \"Stacey is amazing, she did fit in, but I think she was a bit apprehensive at first because she didnt know what she was coming to.\"He added: \"She made reference to herself as being a city girl, who didnt know what she was doing in the country, she did say she should have brought two torches, but she did bring a thermos flask which she left, so thats my souvenir of the visit.\"There is no television in Gometra House and The Sandfords, who are all environmental activists, and Miss Dooley, chatted over dinner.Mr Sandford recalled: \"We had rice and dahl that Savannah made and Stacey made the bread, it was delicious, we showed her how to grind the flour.\"After dinner entertainment saw the family perform mini plays, as they do in the Gometra Theatre Festival, which is normally held in the summer when a few visitors join the island population, which hovers between five and nine.The film crew and Miss Dooley, who held a candle to light up the action, joined in the fun, and reflecting on the evening in her programme, she said: \"At home I would be on the sofa, watching Netflix with a cup of tea.\"While the film crew slept in bothies Miss Dooley stayed in a bedroom in Gometra house, with no heating and no hot water.During the day she turned her hand to chopping logs and went walking over the rocks with Savannah and Blue, but passed on the offer to join them for a dip in the sea. No swimsuit packed perhaps Blue, who hit the headlines in February having spent  days in an underground tunnel at Londons Euston Square Gardens, in a protest against HSs high speed rail project, and Savannah, are environmental activists.In a deeply poignant moment in the programme they tell Miss Dooley of their decision never to have children, because of the state the world is in.While Mr Sandford finds his daughters choice sad, he believes it is their decision to make. His personal mission is simple, he wants to stop the destruction of the planet as a result of a man-made climate emergency.He wants people to examine the way they travel, what they eat and how they keep warm, to slash carbon emissions.His own efforts include following a vegan diet and shunning the luxury of a heated bedroom, even in the icy depths of a Hebridean winter.He added: \"When its cold I will have one quilt beneath me and two quilts above me - the thirteen tog types.Then I will wear thick socks and two layers of woollen long johns, a woollen vest, woollen polo neck, a woolly hat and a hoodie.I am extremely comfortable, you can be comfortable without polluting.\"The  year old ditched his car, along with flying, years ago.

Five years after his incendiary visit to Haram al -Shar it was Sharon, who in  and by then Israelrsquos prime minister, implemented his plan for Israel to disengage from Gaza and the removal of Jewish settlements.Depending on which side of the razor wire, checkpoint barriers or security fences you lived on, whether you were Arab or Jew, the start of the Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip was seen as either the end of a dream, or the chance of a new beginning.For many within the Jewish settler community in Gaza who were far from happy, it was indeed the end of a dream.ldquoThe moment of truth, ldquoa test of unity and ldquothe ultimate betrayal were just some of the responses I recall settler groups calling the Israeli governmentrsquos decision at the time to remove them from territory in Gaza they believed to be part of a greater Israel.Among those settlers angry with Sharonrsquos decision that I met back then was -year old Dan Amiel, who had lost his leg in a Palestinian rocket attack on the settlement of Kfar Darom  months earlier. ldquoI already left my leg here. Now they want me to leave behind my le, he told me bitterly when we met that day as the forced removal of settlers from Gaza got under way.Kfar Darom was part of a group of settlements in the Gush Kat block that sat just a few miles, but worlds apart, from the Palestinians on the other side of the ide in Gaza slum districts like Khan Younis.On the settler side, it was a world of red-roofed houses, scrubbed streets, glitzy shopping malls and childrenrsquos playgrounds. On the Palestinian side, it was iniably a ghetto of rundown refugee camps, decrepit concrete buildings almost half submerged by Gazarsquos drting coastal sand and the heaps of rotting garbage that lay stinking in the fierce heat of the sun.Historical hopesFor those Palestinians who lived in places like Khan Younis and indeed across the Strip, Israelrsquos disengagement from Gaza really did bring hopes of a new beginning. It was around this same time that I also met a Palestinian man in Khan Younis called Abed el Nasser, whose father had gone to prison after refusing the Israelis permission to cut a neighbourhood road by setting up a checkpoint on land the family owned.ldquoEven during times of peace our family has had trouble with the Israelis because our land is so near to Gush Kat, Abed el Nasser told me back then, as we watched the Jewish settlers prepare to leave.So, what dference would the Israelisrsquo departure make to him and his family now, I asked.ldquoIt will be a paradise again. We will not be demoralised anymore. We will rehabilitate the land, see our children continue their education, learning computer skills instead of living with shooting. We will be able to speak with high spirits, he told me, briming over with optimism that day, though probably aware that such ambitions were little more than a pipe dreamSubsequent events over many years and those again over the past week have sadly borne that out, proving certainly for Palestinians in Gaza thatanything they are even more vulnerable now than in .Irsquove sometimes wondered how the lives of Dan Amiel and Abed el Nasser have played out in the intervening years. Should he still be alive does Dan Amiel, deprived of his dream of Gaza as part of a greater Israel, perhaps take solace today knowing that Israelrsquos settlement expansion goes on unabated in the West Bank and east Jerusalem For his part, was Abed el Nasser able to realise the peaceful ambitions he cherished for his children and their education Looking back now on then-prime minister Sharonrsquos controversial decision to disengage from Gaza, itrsquos clear that it was never undertaken with Palestinianrsquos wellbeing in mind. Sharon, as history has proved, was never that kind of Israeli leader.Instead, Israelrsquos Gaza disengagement was simply a restructuring of its occupation, so that instead of controlling the lives of the people of Gaza from within, it would do so from without. While Sharonrsquos troops redeployed to the edges of the Gaza Strip, they would still continue to keep control over the air space, the sea space, and the land borders.Despite claims from Washington that Gaza was just the start of the disengagement process, the reality was something quite dferent. And so the situation continues under prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as Israel again engages in another of its periodic military operations aimed at degrading the capacity of organised Palestinian groups like Hamas and Islamic Jihad.It is ordinary Palestinians, of course, who inevitably bear the brunt of the disproportionate Israeli military bludgeoning which also exacerbates an already dire humanitarian crisis. But this appears, as always, to be an acceptable part of the Israeli governmentrsquos calculations.If it was Ariel Sharon who brought about Israelrsquos disengagement from Gaza by the removal of its Jewish settlements in , then it was his son, Gilad, who made clear in a November , , op-ed in The Jerusalem Post the new kind of ldquoengagement Israel would have with Gaza.ldquoWe need to flatten entire neighbourhoods in Gaza. Flatten all of Gaza. The Americans didnrsquot stop with Hiroshima ndash the Japanese werenrsquot surrendering fast enough, so they hit Nagasaki, too. There should be no electricity in Gaza, no gasoline or moving vehicles, nothing, he insisted in his article entitled ldquoA decisive conclusion is necessary.Ground assaultTo date, so far, there has been no ldquodecisive conclusion despite the Israelisrsquo launching of ldquoOperation Cast Lead in   and ldquoOperation Protective Edge in . And so, once again, the world watches as Gaza is pummelled and braces itself for what yet could become a full Israeli ground assault into one of the most densely populated places on the plant.It is precisely because of this population density, though, and the very nature of Gazarsquos often labyrinthine neighbourhoods, that Israeli forces will only enterall  fails in neutering Hamas, who this time around appear better armed with a greater supply of rockets and other weaponry.As any infantryman will confirm there is nothing worse that close-quarters urban fighting, and Israeli casualties would almost certainly rise were a ground assault launched. Equally, Israel has always shown itself determined to respond to rocket attacks and this time is no exception.The latest Israeli operation has included at least  aircraft as well as tanks and artillery firing from outside the Gaza Strip, Israeli military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Conricus told Reuters News agency on Friday.ldquoWhat we were targeting is an elaborate system of tunnels that spans underneath Gaza, mostly in the north but not limited to, and is a network that the operatives of Hamas use in order to move, in order to hide, for cover, Conricus told foreign reporters, adding that the network was dubbed ldquothe .But there are other operational concerns for the Israelis. In the West Bank there have been intensying clashes between Palestinian protesters and Israeli security forces that left five Palestinians dead on Friday.Above all, though, itrsquos the near-unprecedented intercommunal rioting and violence in Israeli cities that have rattled its politicians, civilians, and outside observers alike. The hostilities have fuelled tension between Israeli Jews and the countryrsquos  per cent Arab minority. Over the past few nights, violence has continued in mixed communities with street fighting and tit-for-tat attacks that prompted Israelrsquos president to warn of civil war.Quite simply, the pressure cooker long building has exploded among many Arab citizens of Israel who feel increasingly discriminated against as the inexorable rise of Israeli ultranationalism has made its presence felt.Cited bylast week, the veteran analyst and sometime Palestinian negotiator Hussein Agha said he believes the Arabs of Israel or ldquothe Palestinians of , as he calls them, have an increasingly vital role to play in carrying the banner of traditional Palestinian nationalism.With Palestinians in Gaza under the control of Hamas and Islamic Jihad, and those in Jerusalem and the West Bank kept in check by the Palestinian Authority , real political clout now lies in the hands of Israelrsquos Arab citizens, says Agha.Their political muscle flexing at precisely the same time as Israelrsquos ultranationalists have exerted their own influence and are prepared to take to the streets partly accounts for the volatility of the past week.ldquoThey say Gaza is spiralling out of control, but what is happening here scares me more, said Majd Abado, an Arab resident of the mixed city of Acre, where people from both communities said they were afraid to leave their homes.Expansion plansMany Israeli ultranationalists, too, are allied with Jewish settlers determined to expand their presence in east Jerusalem. Itrsquos there that for some time now dozens of Palestinian families, despite living in the locale for generations, have faced eviction.It is a move, they say, by the Israeli authorities to displace them with the wider aim of turning Palestinian neighbourhoods like Sheikh Jarrah and Silwan into full Jewish settlements. For the moment, the elements of this already complex conflict are twisting kaleidoscopically but as ever itrsquos Gaza that will continue to be the cauldron in the coming days and where the frontlines are more clear cut.Currrently, speculation continues as to whether Israel is prepared to repeat its ground invasions of  and . Likewise, diplomatic activity has stepped up to try to bring about a ceasefire, with President Joe Biden saying little beyond endorsing Israelrsquos ldquoright to defend itself.Yesterday, Palestinians marked the rd anniversary of the Nakba or ldquocatastrophe as they call the day when more than , of them were forced out or fled during Israelrsquos founding in .Khadeja Ayoup Gharab was nine years old then when her family was driven out of Ashkelon by the fighting and mass expulsions of that year. She remembers it as a time when seven of her family were killed in a bombing attack that destroyed their home.Rescued from the rubble, alive but injured, Khadeja, her parents, two brothers and a sister walked all the way from Ashkelon to Gaza, arriving with only the clothes they were wearing.It was in  when I met and talked to her in Gazarsquos Beach Refugee Camp, and she told me how she had also recently lost one of her sons.ldquoMohammed was shot by the Israelis four months ago. He died in the dunes, where he had been throwing stones, Khadeja quietly explained as we sat drinking tea at a table on the sand outside her ramshackle cinder block house. ldquoHe was  years old, she added.Looking at my old notebooks again these past days was to remind me of the seemingly interminable nature of this conflict. The pages are punctuated with dates from before I was born to more recent times: , , ,  and now .Back in the days of the first Palestinian intada in  it was the Israeli writer Amos Elon who once described this conflict as an ldquoirresistible force colliding with an immovable body.

It has now had to be moved to the \"more sheltered\" Islay run.The others that are over  years old are Hebridean IslesLoch Linnhe , Loch RiddonLoch Striven , Loch Ranza , Isle of Mull , Lord of the Isles , Loch Dunvegan , Loch FyneLoch Buie , Loch TarbertCaledonian Isles , Isle of Lewisand Loch Bhrusda, which was completed in May, .:CalMac confirms fth delay over repair of its biggest vessel as latest chaos emergesA separate analysis using official data shows that from , before devolution, to ,  ferries with a combined tonnage of , were launched - a replacement rate of one in . years.In the following  years, while the SNP was in power, only five ferries with combined tonnage of , were built - a replacement rate of one every . years.If the current replacement rate is maintained, the new Scottish Government would not be able to replace the  ferries that are past their working le right now for another  years.Inverness-based ferry expert and consultant Roy Pedersen, who is a member of the Scottish Governments Ferry Industry Advisory Group has told CalMac managing director Robbie Drummond that catamarans must be considered \"in the interest of better addressing future vessel acquisition and improving the poor productivity of the current CalMac operation\".Mr Pedersen, who was commissioned by the part-Scottish Government funded and Transport Scotland create Highlands and Islands Transport Partnershipto examine the ferry service said: \"The ferry crisis of breakdowns, unreliable service and lack of capacity goes from bad to worse.\"The CalMac situation really is pretty scandalous and has been building up for decades.\"He raised concerns that SNP MSP for Cunninghame North Kenneth Gibson reported that following a meeting with Mr Drummond, the CalMac MD had said that \"catamarans are not suitable for the Clyde as they are less stable and passengers more prone to seasickness\".Mr Pedersen has told Mr Mr Drummond in a letter that catamarans were more stable than a typical CalMac monohull vessel and that there was no evidence that there was a greater risk of seasickness He said: \" I respectfully, but strongly suggest it is time to abandon the unjustied anti-catamaran prejudice.\"Andrew Banks, head of Pentland Ferries has has admitted being mystied at how CalMac and Transport Scotland will not charter an emergency catamaran to resolve their breakdown crisis.Andrew Banks, head of Pentland Ferries has revealed that both inquired about chartering his MV Pentalina catamaran on March  - nearly three weeks before the Loch Seaforth engine failure.The Pentalina was being offered by ship brokers in the summer of last yearCampaigners have been appealing with both to charter the vessel as an emergency back-up before because of a series of breakdowns to CalMacs ageing fleet.\"I have no idea why Calmac has not pursued charter of the MV Pentalina,\" he said. \"I have no idea why there does not seem to have been pressure internally from Transport Scotland and ministers to recty the appalling situation communities and businesses on west coast routes are continuing to experience.\"I understand that there will be lots of factors at play in making decisions around appropriate relief for vessel breakdowns but I suspect that the situation with the MV Loch Seaforth will not be the last.:CalMac ferry network crisis as breakdowns cause three day island freight shutdown\"As we enter a period of economic recovery it is absolutely vital for these small communities to have consistent reliable access in place and, as both an islander and a service provider to island communities, I understand the frustrations felt locally. \"Martin Reid, the Road Haulage Associations director of Scotland and Northern Ireland said the situation surrounding ferries and the services to the islands was \"disgraceful\".He said it had been known for years that the ferry stock was getting too old and was in need of investment.\"It is not acceptable to the many companies who move goods that they are losing money, losing reputation and potentially losing market share through the slipping standards of others,\" he said.The issues come off the back of the countrys ferry building fiasco with two leline vessels being built at nationalised Ferguson Marine, owner of the last civilian Clyde shipyard. They were due to be in service in early , are now up to nearly five years behind schedule and their is now over double the original poundm contract.The first of the ferries the MV Glen Sannox is now destined for the Arran to Ardrossan route - Scotlands busiest ferry crossing - between April  and June, .Ferguson Marine, led by tycoon Jim McColl went into administration in August,  following a dispute with Caledonian Maritime Assets Ltd- the taxpayer-funded company which buys and leases publicly owned CalMacs ships on behalf of the Scottish government - over the construction of the ferries under the fixed price contract.The Scottish Government then pushed ahead to take full control of of the shipyard company as it went under with blame attached to soaring costs of the ferry contract.Gavin Fulton, chairman of the Arran Ferry Action Group said: \"There is no doubt that the lack of investment is the reason that we have aged and unreliable ships now and that that is a big part of the problem.\"There is also no doubt, without making a political point, that the SNP government in power for the last fourteen years, wholly own this problem.\"The need to build new ships should not have been conflated with the wish to preserve ship building jobs on the Clyde. The result as has been amply demonstrated as catastrophic failure.\"The ultimate irony of this situation is that for the poundm plus squandered on the two white elephants at Ferguson Marine they could have built about ten smaller, simpler, standardised ships which would, by now, be on the waters of the west coast.\"Joe Reade, chairman of the Mull  Iona Ferry Committee said it was seeking a poundm catamaran to serve their communities but has met with resistance.\"Rather than grasping the opportunity with both hands, it seems instead to have been kicked into the long grass for opaque reasons.\"A catamaran of the right size could provide all the same benefits but at much lower cost and without the port upgrades needed ndash but such commercially-minded decisions seem to escape CMAL and government, who seem to repeat the same mistake over and over again. Plenty of money is being spent ndash but it is being spent very badly.\"Transport Scotland said the the three to four week mobilisation period meant that the Pentalina was unable to provide short term cover.Mr Drummond confirmed said it was currently investigating with Transport Scotland the option of leasing the Pentalina on a long-term hire to provide additional resilience across the network.He said: ldquoWe would welcome the addition of any vessel that is deemed to be both safe and suitable for the routes we operate.\"A CMAL spokesman said: ldquoVessel choice is informed by a wide range of factors: current passenger and freight demand as well as future projections, comfort, safety, reliability, sustainability, efficiency and cost - to name a few. An important factor in all vessel choice for the Clyde and Hebrides Ferry Serviceis compatibility with specic routes, as well as flexibility to meet vessel redeployment needs across the network.ldquoWhen considering replacement vessels for the network, no vessel type is off the table. However, any future vessels being built must be safe, reliable, provide a resilient service and address climate challenges. All of these factors have been taken into account during our recent procurement of the replacement vessels for Islay.ldquoVessel dry docking, repair, maintenance and crewing are all the responsibility of the service operator , as the vessels are bareboat chartered to them. The redeployment of ferries across the network also lies with them as the operator.ldquoCMAL is very clear that vessel replacement is required and that it should be accelerated ndash this is fully explained in our recently published corporate plan. This has been recognised by Scottish Government and has been backed by their  year infrastructure plan, which commits poundm in capital from   to   regarding both vessels and port assets."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-independence-poll-shows-split-whether-scots-believe-mandate-indyref2","story":"The poll, carried out by Savanta ComRes for Scotland on Sundayfound that percent of Scots believe the SNP do have a mandate for a second vote, with the exact same percentage believing they do not. percent said they do not know.:Rebecca McQuillan: Values of Scottish voters are shting.

Worldwide, the loan payment system is said to be now worth pound. trillion.The idea appears straightforward. The third party provider settles a companyrsquos bill with a supplier early and ingets a fee. This enables suppliers to get paid quickly while businesses can smooth out their debt payments over a longer period. Everybody is happy in theory.In , Greensill provided an estimated pound billion of financing to businesses in more than  countries.When Covid struck a year later, causing economic uncertainty, supply-chain financing became a very lucrative market and banks alone were raking in many billions in fees.But as the pandemic deepened, turbulence hit the global economy and Greensill, the largest non-banking provider of supply-chain finance, collapsed after its insurer refused to renew cover for its business loans.The fear now is, in this world of creative accounting, early payment loans provided by supply-chain financiers were not only being made for deals done in the past but ones expected to be done in the future.Indeed, profits have been recorded on the basis of future business, giving the appearance some firms are faring much better than they actually are. This lay behind the collapse of the outsourcing company Carillion.Apart from the Governmentrsquos own commissioned inquiry and the parliamentary probes into Greensill and lobbying, the Financial Conduct Authority is now focusing its gimlet eye onto the collapsed finance firm and what it alarmingly described as ldquopotentially criminal allegations.It doesnrsquot stop there.We now also learn the Serious Fraud Office is examining the business empire of Liberty Steel owner Sanjeev Gupta over suspected fraudulent trading and money laundering, including its financial arrangements with ndash Greensill said to have had around pound.bn of exposure to Mr Guptarsquos business.So, Mr Cameron now finds himself in the eye of an increasingly turbulent storm.Appearing before MPs, the multi-millionaire sought to portray himself as, not an ex-premier on the make, but someone who was continuing his role as a sincerely dedicated public servant.ldquoLobbying the UK Government was never intended to be part of my role, insisted Mr Cameron.Yet last spring as the pandemic struck he lobbied and lobbied away, sending dozens of text messages to, among others, Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor, Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office Minister, Tom Scholar, the head Treasury official, and Sir Jon Cunlfe, the Deputy Governor of the Bank of England. Some were signed off ldquolove DC.Greensill wanted access to the UK Government-backed loans scheme to help small businesses survive the pandemic. The former party leader said he believed its supply-chain financing could help ministers cope with the ldquoeconomic heart attack threatening the country.But, when pressed by Mel Stride, Chairman of the Commons Treasury Committee, whether his ldquoopportunity to make a large amount of money was under threat as he sent that ldquobarrage of e-messages, the -year-old ex-politician insisted nothing could be further from the truth.ldquoI would never put forward something I didnrsquot believe was absolutely in the interests of the public good, declared Mr Cameron, stressing how, as he lobbied Whitehall, he did not believe there was a ldquorisk of Greensill falling over.The former Conservative chief admitted he was paid a ldquogenerous, big salary by the finance firm, ldquofar more than the pound, a year he received as PM.ldquoI had a big economic investment in the future of Greensill, so I wanted the business to succeedhellipto grow, explained Mr Cameron.:I got into politics to make a dference...to my bank balance ndash David Camerons My WeekBut when asked just how much that generous, big salary was, the ex-premier became coy. Dismissing as ldquocompletely absurd suggestions he was in line for pound million, he politely declined to disclose his true remuneration, saying it was a ldquoprivate matter.One of the Greensill perks revealed was the use of a private jet, which Mr Cameron took advantage of on several occasions to fly to his ldquothird holiday home in Cornwall.With allegations of cronyism levelled against Boris Johnson and his Government, the fellow Old Etonian admitted there were ldquolessons to learn and a formal letter rather than a flow of chummy text messages would, in future, be more appropriate.Stressing how lobbying government was a ldquonecessary and healthy part of the democratic process, Mr Cameron nonetheless accepted former leaders had to ldquothink dferently and act dferently given the continuing influence they enjoyed.Having an ex-PM engaging on behalf of commercial interests, ldquono matter how laudable the motives and cause, could, he admitted, be ldquoopen to misinterpretation.But his lsquorather a fool than a knaversquo approach did not cut any ice with Labour politicians.Rushanara Ali, who represents Bethnal Green and Bow, branded Mr Greensill a ldquocon artist and told Mr Cameron his own reputation was now ldquoin tatters.Siobhain McDonagh, another London MP, accused Dave of having ldquodemeaned himself ldquoby WhatsApping your way around Whitehall on the back of a fraudulent enterprise based on selling bonds of high-risk debt to unsuspecting investors.The problem for the former PM is his humiliating ordeal may not be over.:Greensill Capital: David Cameron says he had lsquobig economic investmentrsquoGiven all the inquiries, not least the ones looking into suspected criminal activity, the ex-party leader - who made clear during his parliamentary interrogation that he had broken no rules and there had been ldquoabsolutely no wrongdoing on his part - might, nonetheless, find the Greensill story and its potential ramications reverberating in the Cameron head as tonight it slowly hits the pillow."},{"url":null,"title":"cop26-pope-francis-intends-address-world-leaders-summit","story":"Kerry said that the Pope intends to come to Glasgow to address world leaders on climate change at the summit which takes place in Glasgow from November  - November .:Kevin McKenna: Earthly powers wont like Popes sexuality messageIn a video, Kerry said: \"Well the Pope is one of the great voices of reason and compelling moral authority on the subject of the climate crisis.Pope Francis intends to come to Glasgow to address world leaders at the COP summit on the climate change emergency.

This is an extended version of one of them.Michael Faraday was one of the world’s greatest scientists.He was also one of the first to recognise the importance of reaching a wider audience and he had the perfect venue for this, at the Royal Institution in London. The lecture theatre there is probably the most famous in the world, thanks to the Christmas Lectures he began in , which have been televised since . It was designed by an Orcadian, Thomas Webster.Thomas’s father Alexander was English, but his mother Mary was the daughter of Thomas Baikie, the minister at St Magnus Cathedral, and Thomas grew up in Orkney.According to his entry in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, he attended Kirkwall Grammar School, and then went to Aberdeen University in , where “he assisted Professor Patrick Copland, a populariser of science.” Professor Copland was a pioneer of public education, whose extramural classes ran from  to . He also pioneered the use of demonstrations in his lectures, so Thomas may have taken a few new ideas with him when he went to London.Thomas Webster enrolled at the Royal Academy Schools in London as an architectural student in , and had his own business by . He began “a school for mechanics,” and this came to the attention of Count Rumford, one of the founders of what became the Royal Institution. Rumford’s aim was to encourage the use of mechanical inventions and improvements, and to encourage “the Application of Science to the Common Purposes of Le.”At the age of , Webster was engaged as treasurer and secretary of the Institution and, as Clerk of Works, superintended the transformation of a house into a suitable building. In January , he was told to prepare plans for a new lecture room. Many years later he wrote:The theatre of the Royal Institution is pronounced to be the most perfect room of the kind in the kingdom for possessing the properties of allowing the lecturer to be well heard and seen by the audience and for affording them easy entrance and exit, c . . . it has been stated by Faraday, in his late examination before a committee of the House of Commons, to be ‘almost perfect as a lecture room,’ and that ‘although architects are continually measuring and drawing it to copy from, and many other rooms have been built in imitation of it in which he has tried his voice, yet none of them proved equal to that in question.Sir Humphrey Davy was the first scientist to draw crowds to the lecture theatre, which could seat  people. He also made good use of the laboratory which Thomas Webster had installed, using electrolysis to discover sodium and potassium. Webster wrote later: “The chemical laboratory in which so many valuable discoveries have been made was not only designed and built by me, but owes to me its very existence, for, though I inserted it in my plans, the managers did not at first consider it necessary.”Count Rumford had assured Webster that he was going to establish a science school for workmen and, as he wrote to a friend:It was through the prospect of being employed in this way, which would have been as agreeable to my habits of thinking as useful to my interest, that I was induced to give up the school which I then kept and the other business in which I was engaged, and to accept of a situation and salary in the Institution by no means equivalent to what I should have considered myself as entitled to under other circumstances.Eighty years before compulsory education, he had found that new techniques in building needed better-educated workmen.Knowing from previous experience what it was possible to effect in their improvement, I conceived the idea of giving to mechanics for this purpose a species of scientic education suited to their condition, and I believe I was the first person in this country who took active steps for effecting so desirable an object. I was not unacquainted with the political feelings of that time, but I did not think a little learning was a dangerous thingjudiciously bestowed . . . My idea was to make good mechanics, not to force them like hot-bed plants out of the sphere in which they are so useful.Webster succeeded in convincing the managers that the school was a good idea. News of the school was published, and was very well received. Sadly, after all the preparations were made, ideas changed.I was asked rudely what I meant by instructing the lower classes in science. I was told likewise that it was resolved upon that the plan must be dropped as quietly as possible. It was thought to have a dangerous political tendency, and I was told thatI persisted, I would become a marked man!Webster decided to leave the institution and embark on another career, as a landscape artist.This somehow led to work on textbooks and a commission in , to draw one of the first geological maps of England. Geology was a very new science the Geological Society had only been founded in . Sir Henry Englefield, President of the Society, commissioned Webster to survey and draw the geology of the Isle of Wight. This was published in .Ten years later, Webster became the secretary of the Geological Society and curator of its museum. Soon, he was back at the Royal Institution.Notices of lecture courses in the s include Faraday on chemistry and Webster on geology. He gave the Christmas Lectures, “suitable for a juvenile auditory,” in .University College London was founded in , and Webster became its first professor of geology in .He is described as the first professional geologist, because it was then still seen as a gentleman’s hobby. Unfortunately, this meant that he was poorly paid and, although he was awarded a government pension of £ a year for services to geology, he had to find other sources of income.For the last ten years of his le, he worked on a commission from Longmans Publishing. The enormous  Encyclopedia of Domestic Economy brought together all “the information useful to persons who have to superintend domestic establishments.” It begins with where to build your house, and goes on to cover everything from the dferent options for heat and light to the preparation of every sort of beverage, from gin to coffee.It is now well known that Isabella Beeton stole material shamelessly for her Book of Household Management, published in .Her main source was Webster’s Encyclopedia: on the Arrangement of the Kitchen and General Observations, on beverages, bread, etc. Thomas Webster was unable to complain about her plagiarism.He had died aged  in December . He was a man ahead of his time, so got neither the payment nor recognition that he deserved but his writing, though uncredited, has stood on more bookshelves than all other Orcadian writers put together.Mrs Beeton’s Cookbook sold two million copies in its first decade alone.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Subsequent site investigation works were undertaken, and confirmed the presence of oil contamination below part of the area, which falls within the council’s ownership.However, after writing to the MoD, it was in November  that confirmation came that OIC was unsuccessful in its request that the MoD foots the bill for the clean-up operation.According to the MoD, the evidence did not support them assuming liability for the contamination.The ambition to attract new businesses and industries to Lyness, transforming and breathing new le into the area with signicant new job creation, has been held by OIC for years.Its potential and the characteristics the area boasts have been lauded by the authority for some time, but aside from interested glances and preliminary works carried out by companies, nothing has come to fruition.The last of these was in , when plans to revitalise the area into a decommissioning base to serve the oil and gas industry failed to materialise.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

A key upgrade will be the installation of the Systems and Information Management System, also known as SIMS.#The average anticipated cost of each le extension upgrade is £. million, signicantly less than the cost of designing and building a brand-new class of leboat to replace the Severn.Angus Watson, engineering and supply director, added: #I am so excited to announce our plans to extend the operational le of our Severn class leboats.#Our Severns are often located in the more remote locations across the UK and Ireland, where the crews are often required to sail out longer distances in the most challenging sea conditions.#Work is already underway on the first vessel to receive its le extension upgrade with all work on the initial seven vessels from five stations taking place at the RNLI’s all-weather Leboat Centre in Poole, Dorset.The NorthLink ferry Hrossey fouled a propeller on her way to Aberdeen Harbour on Tuesday morning, which prevented her from being able to dock.

There followed four years of painful negotiation Theresa May was anointed, became a lame duck, and departed as PM to be replaced by Boris Johnson.Johnson saw off Jeremy Corbyn and ‘got Brexit done’ as he said he would, but post-Covid he might yet be done for himself.

All facilities will be smaller – with Covid distancing  We will have no care home and Eoligarry [Primary] School will be closed.“The comhairle is spending millions on decanting pupils instead of building the new school just near the old one.

There was a huge amount of rope and all sorts of litter.“Beyond that there was general litter such as Coke bottles, beer cans, and a few face masks. The only odd thing we found was a massive oxygen tank.”Highlighting the volume of rubbish encountered during the clean, he added: “Nearly everyone who came along was from the community and they had seen this litter building up over the last two years.“The beach clean is an annual event we tend to do in April but we had to cancel last year’s so this year is basically two years’ worth including two winter storms’ worth.”When asked how much of the responsibility for the mess he believed lay with local people, he went on to say: “Some of the litter will certainly be from local industry but so much of it will be dropped from people on the island – whether locally or swept in.“The problem is not just local to here, it’s a UK-wide issue.”Addressing the challenges facing the village more broadly, Mr Watson said: “On Friday one of our contractors pulled up two trailers of fly-tipped metal down the side of one of the bridges away from the beach.“That has been years’ worth of local people dumping bikes, climbing frames and all sorts of bits and pieces. Both the Woodland Trust and the Uig Community Trust were speaking today about how we can make a bigger impact through this event, and how we can cover the whole of the community.“There is real potential for the event to be an Uig clean as a whole and not just a beach clean.“A lot of people were saying that it was the first event that they had been to in well over a year, while some of the older people hadn’t seen anyone for months.“It was a real feel-good event from that side of things.“There was a mixture of working-age parents through to retired folks.“It was great to see the kids there and have a chat with their parents. The children were appalled at the amount of litter on the beach, and we were talking about what they can do to help.

Personally I would think social housing should be a priority.”While Helen Grianan said: “Will these houses be £, or under  If not, they are not affordable housing for locals or key workers.”Calum J Morrison from North Uist was in favour of the scheme saying: “Sounds like a good type of thing in my opinion, the dude seems to know what he’s doing, good luck to him I say!”Annie B Campbell, meanwhile, highlighted broader issues with housing on the island, stating: “Key workers, like some NHS and teachers, are being outbid for most of the houses that come on the market in Skye.“They are not ‘officially’ homeless so do not have enough points to qualy for council housing.“Some are forced to skip between illegal short term lets. This is not simply a locals versus incomers issue.“Key workers coming to fill essential jobs on the island and local families need somewhere to live. There is a very real housing crisis.”Mr Garton Jones said the price of the houses could not be confirmed until planning permission was obtained.However, in the last few days, he took to social media to try to address worries that people on the island will be priced-out of buying the properties.“There has been a lot of focus on the larger family house we are hoping to build but  of the  houses we are building are smaller, three bedroom, houses,” he commented.Kevin McMahon simply asked: “Will there be a first refusal for locals and the children of local families ”In response, Mr Garton Jones said: “I am happy to confirm that the properties will not be sold via the Scottish ‘sealed bids offers over’ system but will be sold at a fixed price on a first-come, first-served basis.“Obviously until we have planning, we cannot sell the houses, but we have opened up a ‘waiting list’., which is the only place the houses have so far been mentioned or advertised – have emailed me to express their interest in the houses.“Many of them do, indeed, appear to be locals, although we will not be checking birth certicates as part of the sales process.”He added: “There are  houses in total, soyou would like your name added to the list, please email me via charlie@gartonjonesChisolm talked about his own chances of finding a home, questioned the effectiveness of the Highland Council in its current form, and underlined the importance of investing in smaller communities on the island.“I am living with my parents, and with my work I am fortunate to still live on Skye,” he said.“Saying that, I haven’t taken any steps to purchase a home as the prices do not justy the property, or are just too expensive.“I know people who have taken steps to purchase but were outbid either at the start or last minute.”Chisolm has worked for CalMac since  and says he has thought about moving to the Western Isles due to his poor prospects of finding a home on Skye.He said: “I have strong family connections to Lewis and Harris, and I might have the possibility of moving across as house prices haven’t been affected as much as on Skye in terms of second homes and holiday homes. However, it is now on the rise as on other neighbouring islands.”Chisolm believes a revamp of the local authority is needed to force meaningful change.“Skye is facing issues linked to the lack of investment and communications. That makes me question why are we governed by people in Inverness and not the people of Skye and the surrounding islands.“I look at the Western Isles, and I’m seeing housing developments across the islands in dferent areas with the goal of helping local people stay where they are from, sustaining school numbers — including Gaelic communities — and helping small areas grow.“That should be critical here and not just developing in Portree. Roads, housing, harbour investments are just a few aspects that link together and time is critical.”He added: “It’s very important for young people and young families to stay on the island with the support of affordable housing, whether that’s purchasing or renting.”Chisolm said he had been encouraged by responses to Iomairt an Eilein’s call to action.“Political responses ahead of the election have been very welcoming and we are grateful for the support,” he added. reported on plans to build a new -home private scheme on the outskirts of Portree.Commenting on the merits of the proposal, Chisolm said: “I welcome the new development in Portree, I’m sure many young people and families from Skye will benefit from thesethey are available at an affordable price.“That being said, I do question why we’re only developing in Portree. I can name many schools in surrounding communities that would benefit from even a half of a development like this.”Painting a stark picture of the dficulties facing townships such as Staffin, he said: “Smaller communities are missing out and our school numbers and Gaelic communities are suffering. This should be a wake-up call to our government and ‘our’ council that more housing investments in rural areas will have more of an impact and better outcomes.“We all have a right to articulate our viewpoints and opinions.

There is a good support network out there for foster carers to avail of, so you are not alone in this role.”For more information on Adoption or Foster Care please contact HSC Northern Ireland Adoption and Foster Care on T:    or visit W: www.adoptionandfostercare.hscn.net  "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3800422.jpg--.jpg?1620900292000\n","title":"brave jessica is an inspiration","story":"JESSICA Philpott’s battle back from le changing surgery would put many an adult to shame!This is the view of proud mum Julie who told the  this week that her -year-old daughter has coped remarkably well.“Every day Julie has pushed on with courage, resilience and sheer determination that would put any adult to shame,” said Julie.It was back on April  that Jessica, who was born with Apert Syndrome, a Craniofacial condition that affects the development of the head and limbs, was operated on for  hours by a team of  highly skilled surgeons, ranging from neurosurgeons to craniofacial surgeons to plastic surgeons, each playing a vital role in the reshaping of Jessicas face and skull.This surgery carries high risks, risks that they were all too aware of due to the fact that surgeons were operating so close to the brain.Julie explained that distraction of Jessica’s face started on Tuesday, May , and the plan is to continue with this twice a day for - weeks.“We are already seeing a massive dference to the structure of Jessicas face and she is loving the change and has shown such grace and dignity throughout the last  weeks, we are immensely proud of her,” said JulieNo chat with Julie or Jessica is complete with a mention of the Slemish College pupil’s beloved Ballymena United!“The love and support for Jessica from everyone at the club over the last few years has been amazing, but in particular over the last few weeks theyve been there willing her on,” outlined Julie.Meanwhile, the surgery that Jessica has just had is actually one of,not the most expensive surgeries in the world!“Great Ormond Street Hospital has fully funded this surgery for Jessica and we cannot thank them enough for what theyve done for Jessica and I during our stay here so far,” said Julie.“Not just the surgeons, nurses and medical team, but also the auxillary staff, domestic staff and catering staff, they all play a vital role and have been a tremendous source of support and encouragement to us as a family. It truly is a wonderful place and there is nowhere  Id rather be at this stage of Jessicas Journey.”Jessica also asked her mum to share pictures of her with her frame on, saying it will give people the chance to see what she looks like now.Mum Julie recalls the day of surgery, describing it a “bit of a blur” for her.“The Team came to the Ward to see me. Professor Dunaway, the lead surgeon, was smiling, they all were. He said they were finished and all went exceptionally well. I sobbed, happy tears, tears of sheer relief that it was over. He went on to say that there had been absolutely no complications. In fact Jessica had sailed through the surgery. She hadnt even needed a blood transfusion which is almost always a given with this type of surgery. The team advised that it would be another two hours before Jessica would be in recovery.”Julie said those last two hours “were definitely the longest of the day.”“Around pm the nurse took me to recovery, nothing could have prepared me for what I was about to see. Jessica bruised, swollen and had wires, tubes and drains everywhere. But there in the middle of it all her little voice said Mummy can I have something to eat,” recalled Julie.Mum explained that over the next seven days they had “good days and not so good days.”“But the staff on the High Dependency Ward were nothing short of amazing. They looked after me as much as they looked after Jessica. They actually made us feel like we were the only family on the ward, They are very special people who go above and beyond every day for families like ours.”Jessica has amazed staff, surgeons and family with her recovery.On Day  Professor Dunaway told Julie in his entire career he has never seen a recovery like it, describing it as “amazing.”“I replied Our God is amazing, it really has been nothing short of a miracle,” said Julie.As the week progressed the Surgical Team gradually informed Julie of what they had done in theatre.They explained that because Jessica was coping so well under the anaesthetic, they decided to do a little bit extra to ensure that Jessica had the best possible outcome from the surgery.“They didnt just fit the frame as planned, they bone grafted her a new nose, they gave her a cheek lt and plated her forehead. So, in light of all of this it made her recovery even more of a miracle,” smiled Julie“It also re-iterated to me that these surgeons are very special people, who go above and beyond on a daily basis for children like Jessica. They want the very best for them and they will do everything in their power to improve their quality of le. Thank you just doesnt go far enough, we will be eternally grateful to that Team.”Husband Lawrie was able to join Jessica and Julie for the weekend - “to help us with the move”, quipped Julie.“We’ve managed to accumulate quite a bit of ‘stuff’ over the last seven days, but it was horrible having to say goodbye.”Julie reports that Jessica has started to eat and drink more orally so not requiring as many tube feeds, swelling is going down gradually and continuing to improve daily!Regarding her frame, the screws will be turned twice a day for the next few weeks, gradually changing the shape of Jessica’s face.Mum Julie is always very mindful to thank all those who have sent texts, cards gts and prayed for them.“It has been absolutely amazing and were so thankful to have the first week done with no major complications. As someone said to me ‘first week done , a road never to be traveled again’.“It was tough, there were tears . There were good days, there were not so good days but we’ve done it and know that God was with us and will continue to be with us in the days and weeks ahead,” said Julie.And Julie makes no secret of the fact that faith has got her through this very challenging time.“Obviously our faith has been a major factor in how we, as a family, have been able to cope with all of this. And the outpouring of prayer, practical and emotional support from our own church, Ballyloughan Presbyterian, Connor Presbyterian where Jessica attends GB and Youth Club and Woodlands Presbyterian in Carrick who have adopted us, along with many other churches and iniduals from every denomination has been special. And we would like to thank everyone whos been praying and offering practical support, it has meant so much to us and it has been wonderful to see so many people being the church.”Julie said they had every faith in the Surgical Team, and “and more importantly we knew that Jessica and that team were covered in prayer leading up to and for the duration of the surgery. Churches of all denominations, iniduals and groups of people from all faiths had prayer rotas going throughout the day, and so we had a peace about this surgery from the outset.”Indeed, a verse of scripture that was very poignant in the week leading up to this surgery was Isaiah : -  So do not fear, for I am with you, do not be dismayed, for I am your God, I will strengthen you and help you, I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.“This verse was in my head as I walked out of the anaesthetic room that morning, it was the most dficult thing I have ever had to do. But I knew that God was in complete control and would carry Jessica, the team and me through that day and in the days to come,”said Julie.The Jessicas Journey Facebook and Instagram pages have been a real source of encouragement to them as a family over the last couple of weeks.“We currently have .K followers and so I think we have achieved our aim of raising awareness of Craniofacial conditions. The comments, well wishes, prayers and support of thousands of people on the page have carried us through the dark days - thank you to each and every person whos taken the time to comment or message, you really have made a dference and you have restored our faith in humanity,” concluded Julie.

You should be ashamed of yourselves and the BBC should be ashamed of yourselves for starting from that position,” he said. Read MoreEdwin Poots set to pressure Arlene Foster to quit First Minister post earlySuzanne Breen:OpinionEdwin Poots’ honeymoon won’t last long Mr Poots, a Free Presbyterian, is “entitled to be the leader and he’s entitled to have his faith”, said Mr Paisley.“He has never been in a position where he would try and force his faith down your throat or anyone ’s throat and he would not allow those things get in the way of how he engages in policy and policy-making.”A spokesperson from the BBC said on Saturday: “At no point did anyone on the programme mock religious beliefs.”Mr Paisley said as DUP leader, Mr Poots interest is “making Northern Ireland work”.“He has an excellent track record of working with Sinn Fein [and] other people across the board to make this place a better place.”Mr Poots will be an “authentic voice” for a community which currently feels “you’re not allowed to have an opinion that might offend someone in some other quarter, that opinion can now be voiced”, Mr Paisley added.“I’m reminded of the Frank Skinner line, you can be anything in Britain today except a Christian.”After Arlene Foster was recently overthrown by the party, Mr Pootswas named her successor on Friday after a successful leadership campaign in which his only rival was MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson.Mr Paisley, a supporter of Mr Poots, said his leadership of the party will be focused on several key issues, one of which is the Northern Ireland Protocol which he pledged to “fight”. Mr Paisley said on Friday night the protocol could be “fixed”.“The protocol with regards to business in Northern ireland is destroying business, whether you’re a Catholic businessman, a Protestant businessman a businessman or woman from any other tradition, it’s destroying business, lets try and fix it,” he said.A meeting has taken place with the Secretary of State Brandon Lewis to address the issue, he added. “Every single unionist in this country is opposed to it, it is not sustainable.“Within Article  there’s a lawful way of changing it, [it] allows us to ensure those elements that affect the society, the economy, which create destabilisation, those elements can be fixed and changed.

She was co-opted back as MLA for Foyle in March . Ms Mullan replaced Ms McCallion as a Foyle MLA in June .Gone too are a number of key figures who were at the helm of the party in Derry for decades.Sinn Fein have said this “review” is so they can rebuild the party after two disastrous elections — the  Foyle loss followed a poor showing in the council elections in Derry earlier that year.But people close to the party in the city say that change was long overdue and the reasons for the review were more complicated than simply whose name might be on the ballot paper.The Belfastspoke to a range of well placed sources close to the party in Derry. Most did not want to be named but all concurred with the outcome of the review and the need for it.One source said: “Bad election results can be down to bad messages or bad mechanics but this is deeper than that.“There have been major issues within the party for a number of years and I don’t believe they centre around elections. The governance of the party has been a big issue, there were a series of really bad decisions.”They added: “These issues have been allowed to grow and fester and I am glad the national leadership have reacted in the way they have.”A second source added: “It is clear that the status of the party in Derry has plummeted in recent years and that is seen by the turnout at local government and Westminster elections in .“I don’t think the party had much of a choice other than to investigate why its political fortunes have been damaged.“I do know what they found was not a pretty picture and it was decided that the current party structure and personnel in the city were not suited to a period of revitalisation and rebuilding, including the two co-opted political representatives in Stormont.”While results suggested the performance and perception of the two elected representatives seemed less than inspiring to the electorate, it was the less public faces around the table that rankled voters.Our source explained: “How the party has been organised and what rules it abided by has been open to speculation and ridicule for many years.”They said selection issue have played a part in the decrease of the solid working class vote the party has traditionally got in places like Creggan. Bogside, Shantallow, Ballymagroarty and the Waterside.The source added: “The votes in all of those areas were dramatically down. Losing five seats in the  local government elections was a big, big deal.”Sinn Fein’s power was never stronger in Derry than it was in  — the year Martin McGuinness passed away — but had he still been alive, those close to the party think the outcome of this review would have been the same.“I think Martin would have been a bit more diplomatic in his approach, particularly towards Martina,” one source observed.“People use their own style of party management but at the end of the day, the choices were still stark and the conclusions that the party has come to were inescapable.“It has all crystallised because of the election results and the Elisha McCallion debacle is seen as the final nail in the coffin.”Ms McCallion’s election as MP for Foyle in  was undoubtedly a pivotal moment for Sinn Fein in Derry and came two years after Derry City Council merged with Strabane District Council and Sinn Fein became the majority party.Seen by some as one of the party’s bright new names, just days after her election as MP, Ms McCallion posted pictures of the hotel room in Westminster borough, complaining about how small it was. It didn’t sit well with many grassroots Sinn Fein voters, and that it came a day after  people lost their lives in the nearby Grenfell fire that left hundreds of other homeless was even worse.Her crass comment did little to endear her to the electorate.Nor did a quip she made during the  election campaign to people living in a socially deprived area of Derry, where she would have expected votes, about how they could open their doors because she “was not the debt collector”.This cost Ms McCallion her Westminster seat but lessons were not learned and just weeks after her election to the Seanad in , it emerged she failed toimmediately a Covid payment of £, mistakenly paid into her account.In politics, perception matters and this could be the reason the national leadership of Sinn Fein concluded that Martina Anderson needed to leave the stage.Ms Anderson is perceived by nationalists as someone still stuck in the past but a lot of republicans viewed her dancing antics at a Hunger Strike commemoration held in Strabane in  as “highly disrespectful to those who gave up their lives”.Without a doubt, the way Ms Anderson has been shoved aside will rankle with some — the anger contained within the lines of her family’s statement at how she was treated will not have been confined to her relatives.But a source said the writing for Martina Anderson and her Stormont colleague was on the wall, adding: “I think republicans will have a natural sympathy and affinity with Martina because of who she is and what she had done in her le — between her IRA and prison record and then going to represent the party in Europe.“To be frank, Karen Mullan will get none of that, despite being in Stormont four years, she is relatively unknown, not tested and on the grapevine, she is deemed unelectable.“That is why they are being asked to go. It is not any personal gripe. Karen Mullan is deemed by the party to be unelectable and Martina is past her best and that has been evident in Derry for quite a few years.”The next Assembly election will most likely take place in May , giving Sinn Fein just  months to turn its fortunes around.Can it be done  There are those close to the party who think so.“The task now is about building up confidence of people both within the city and within the party in terms of leadership. It is about reassuring people that they can have their say and that it won’t be dismissed or undermined,” another source close to the party said.“Part of that will come down to the leadership — the type of people who will be in charge, they will need to be trusted and liked and valued as republicans as well. The message being sent out is that it is rebuild, refocus but whether it can be delivered in  months remains to be seen.“Ideally this should have been done two years ago and  months seems to be quite a high expectation but that doesn’t mean you don’t attempt to do it.”Key figures within republicanism in Derry unconnected with Sinn Fein think this sweep has come too late for the party but will create opportunities for the smaller parties and independents.One said: “It will be dficult for Sinn Fein to find a suitable candidate that people will get behind and vote for in time for the next Assembly election but people in Derry are fed up with them.“You only have to look at the last local election to see that — Gary Donnelly topped the poll in Foyle and other independents did really well. People Before Profit won two seats, Alliance won a seat.“I think an independent would do really well in an Assembly election, the only thing is, I don’t think there’s any that have the inclination or the money pot Sinn Fein has to run against them.”Ms Mullan has not commented publicly since it emerged she would stand down.In a video message posted online, Ms Anderson described the review’s recommendation as a “body blow” and acknowledged it had been a “dficult time” for her and Ms Mullan.She emphasised that she had been contacted by “comrades, friends and supporters from across Derry and beyond offering their solidarity and support” and said the “majority” had “urged me to stay on”.In a Facebook post, Ms Anderson’s sister, Sharon Burke, said the family believed she had been “sacriced” by the party.She said the party review in Londonderry “resulted in a massive miscarriage of justice” and the way it was done was “brutal”.The party “came into Derry to fix problems and left creating more,” she said.Earlier this week, Sinn Fein vice-president Michelle O’Neill defended the party’s decisions.“We believe the change we’re going to bring forward will hopefully command the confidence of the people of Foyle,” Ms O’Neill said on Wednesday.She added: “Both Martina and Karen will be part of that change, but there’s work to do in terms of building confidence.”Ms O’Neill described Ms Anderson as a “first class republican” and that she had worked with the party’s review group to shape its recommendations..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Belfast Most ReadBBC accused of Edwin Poots ‘lambast’ over religious beliefsEdwin Poots set to pressure Arlene Foster to quit First Minister post earlyLiving it up in the NI countryside: £.m house of the year perfect for shaking off city leIn profile: New DUP deputy leader Paula BradleyIn pictures: Rangers complete unbeaten season as Premiership trophy is presented and fans# celebrations engulf IbroxTop VideosPlayNew DUP leader Edwin Poots# full interview with Sunday LePlayEdwin on NI protocol\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news d .ece AUTOCROP wh fbbdaddabfecaef.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news d .ece AUTOCROP wh fbbdaddabfecaef.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayMass band parade against NI Protocol takes place in NewtownabbeyLatest Northern IrelandEdwin Poots: ‘I will not rest until NI Protocol’s removed’Black and Northern Irish: The experiences - good and bad - and achievements of black and mixed race people who call this place homeLegal changes will ‘traumatise’ asylum-seeking children in NISuzanne BreenOpinionEdwin Poots’ honeymoon won’t last longBoris Johnson promises to address legacy of the TroublesLatestMeet Gary Fisher’s ‘Mr Big’ ...the man with the UDA cocaine connectionsIvan LittleOpinionBoris Johnson adds insult to injury to Ballymurphy massacre families‘Skidmark’ barred rioter from AE by UDAT’Pau singer Carol Decker: ‘Music’s in my DNA… I’m not qualied to do anything ’Caught on camera... suspected Dungiven bomb-maker scooped,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

She is commonly described as outgoing, ordinary and sociable by Assembly colleagues.She is certainly the DUP’s most liberal representative on social issues. When asked about same-sex marriage by this newspaper in , she predicted that it would be legalised in the next decade due to “changing attitudes”.She voiced her disapproval of Gregory Campbell’s ‘curry my yoghurt’ mockery of the Irish language in . Neither was she impressed when Sammy Wilson refused to wear a red ribbon in solidarity with those living with HIV AIDS.“I#m a member of the DUP who has worked and formed really good friendships with people of dferent religions and sexual orientations,” she said.“I know those people for who they are and that has given me a broader outlook. I can see how some of the decisions we make affect people. I see faces when I make decisions.” Although she believes in God, she is not a practising Christian.Bradley grew up in Mossley in Newtownabbey. Her mum was a social worker, her dad was a driver, and her brother Daniel is a hairdresser. She had a big extended family and summers were spent in her grandparents’ caravan in Ballyhalbert.She has two adult children, Josh and Jess, with ex-husband Robert Bradley. They were orced at . “It wasn’t amicable and we’re not in touch,” she candidly admitted in a wide ranging Belfastinterview in .“We were too young. I was  when I got married. If one of my children had come home at  and told me they were getting married, I#d have said #No way#.”As a young mother, she got into debt, facing the repossession of her home after she separated from her husband. “He went back to England and I was left with a mortgage and two children. Financially, it was really, really hard,” she said.“They were coming the following day to evict me, then I told my parents. They went to the mortgage company, took out a loan and paid what I owed. The arrears had crept up, but I#d buried my head in the sand. I ignored the problem because I didn#t want to be seen as a failure as a mother.“It was a traumatic period. I had two children, aged seven and five, who needed me and I was the one who was supposed to look after and protect them.”On leaving school, she had worked in a canteen kitchen before joining the RUC as a part-time reserve when she was . Bradley was one of the few women in the force at the time. She says it was “an interesting job, but not the career I wanted.”She secured a communications job in DUP headquarters in . After that, she worked as a social care assistant for the Northern Trust from -, but she remained politically active.She was elected onto Newtownabbey Council in  and became mayor in . Nigel Dodds asked her to run for Stormont in . Her son told her to “wise up” but she talked him round, and she was elected.Bradley told this reporter last year that she had never experienced sexism at Stormont, and that her previous jobs in the police and health service had been much more challenging in that regard.But she said social media abuse was widespread: “You#re called horrendous names. I#m not just a politician, I#m a mummy and a granny.“I#ve been told #You should have been aborted at birth# and #I hope your children die#. My kids read this stuff. When I put out a statement online, I#m fearful of what will come.Yes she said there was a spirit of sisterhood in Stormont: “Women from other parties will ring each other and support each other when something horrible happens.”She has said she is frequently mistaken for Alliance MLA, Paula Bradshaw: “We both receive each other#s mail and emails. I quite like the idea because she#s younger and much slimmer than I am.”.app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Belfast Most ReadBBC accused of Edwin Poots ‘lambast’ over religious beliefsEdwin Poots set to pressure Arlene Foster to quit First Minister post earlyLiving it up in the NI countryside: £.m house of the year perfect for shaking off city leIn profile: New DUP deputy leader Paula BradleyIn pictures: Rangers complete unbeaten season as Premiership trophy is presented and fans# celebrations engulf IbroxTop VideosPlayNew DUP leader Edwin Poots# full interview with Sunday LePlayEdwin on NI protocol\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news d .ece AUTOCROP wh fbbdaddabfecaef.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news d .ece AUTOCROP wh fbbdaddabfecaef.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayMass band parade against NI Protocol takes place in NewtownabbeyLatest Northern IrelandEdwin Poots: ‘I will not rest until NI Protocol’s removed’Black and Northern Irish: The experiences - good and bad - and achievements of black and mixed race people who call this place homeLegal changes will ‘traumatise’ asylum-seeking children in NISuzanne BreenOpinionEdwin Poots’ honeymoon won’t last longBoris Johnson promises to address legacy of the TroublesLatestMeet Gary Fisher’s ‘Mr Big’ ...the man with the UDA cocaine connections‘Skidmark’ barred rioter from AE by UDAIvan LittleOpinionBoris Johnson adds insult to injury to Ballymurphy massacre familiesT’Pau singer Carol Decker: ‘Music’s in my DNA… I’m not qualied to do anything ’Caught on camera... suspected Dungiven bomb-maker scooped,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This was seen as an attempt to “break the silence”Read MoreSinn Fein ‘crushed our sister’: Family criticise party over Martina Anderson ‘humiliation’Officials were in “listening mode”, said a source privy to the detail, but the assessment was clear: there was no going back — the party needed to turn itself around or face further problems.McDonald and O’Neill knew they could not dismiss or ignore the recommendations and agreed to a complete clear-out of Sinn Fein in Derry. They were ruthless. Almost everyone at the top, including Stormont MLAs Karen Mullan and Martina Anderson — the latter one of its longest-standing members — had to go and a new strategy group put in place to plan for the future.Anderson and Mullan were summoned to meetings in Belfast and asked not to contest next year’s Assembly election and stand aside following the review.It is understood both elected representatives were told it was unlikely they would retain the votes needed to hold on to two Assembly seats and the party faced losing more votes to the SDLP.This “riled” Anderson, according to a source close to her, as she had only been drafted back in last year to “clean up the mess after the last election”, having served as an MEP in Brussels.“Martina was in Brussels during those elections, she wasn’t even here,” the source said. “She only ed to Derry to try to stop the freefall of the vote. She was their only hope.”Anderson is one of the party’s most high-profile members, having served as MLA and junior minister at Stormont. A veteran republican, she joined the IRA as a teenager and by  had been jailed on charges of possession of a firearm and causing an explosion. Released on bail, she went on the run. At , she was imprisoned for le for conspiring to cause explosions.Before being released under the Good Friday Agreement, she served  years in prison. “She has given her le to the struggle, yet she is expected to take the blame,” the source said. “The opinions in the review were not cross-referenced against anything Martina or Karen were doing, and that’s what republicans in Derry are finding most disturbing. Opinions are at the heart of this.”On the condition of anonymity, Sinn Fein members have spoken to the Sunday Independent, claiming “fear, loathing and paranoia” now overwhelm the party in Martin McGuinness’s old heartland — a charge described as “nonsense” by a Sinn Fein spokesman.“There’s a lot of finger-pointing and a lot of in-fighting in Derry, particularly around Martina Anderson,” one senior source said. “Sinn Fein members in the city were told, ‘OK, we’ll give you a lelong republican’s head on a plate — would that be enough for you ’”It is understood both MLAs fought their corner during exchanges with McDonald and O’Neill, reminding the politicians that the party in Derry is “not in a good place” and has “become disconnected from its grassroots”.“They were not allowed to have their say about how that might be wrong and show evidence on why that is wrong,” a source said.When Anderson was told her time as an MLA was up, she was advised that “brand Sinn Fein” is damaged “andthe brand is damaged, then you are damaged”, a source close to her said. “Those involved in the review are pointing fingers at Martina and Karen. You go into an area with that type of bad news and a number of people will run for cover and point fingers.“But it’s got nothing to do with them. The blame should be directed at the local structures not engaging with the membership and the weak council team. This has gone on for years, long before Martina or Karen were around.”News of the proposal to stand Anderson and Mullan down was “quietly leaked” to the Irish Examiner at the very time news of another ousting — that of DUP leader Arlene Foster — was making headlines.Anderson and Mullan were left “shocked and devastated”, the source said. “The public humiliation of that has floored them because it’s the wrong decision.”In a resignation video, Anderson described the verdict of the review as a “body blow”, adding that she had been contacted by “comrades, friends and supporters from across Derry and beyond offering their solidarity and support”. She said she was “urged” to stay on, and described it as a dficult time for Mullan and herself.“Throughout my le as a republican I have always put our struggle first and so, in wanting what the leadership believe to be best for it, I have decided not to seek the nomination to contest the next assembly election,” Anderson said.Behind the video was a republican who felt “humiliated” by a party to which she has dedicated her le. “Now you have people turning on one another because of what the party has done to Martina and Karen. It’s the art of psychology,” a source said. “Two people have been offered up — two heads — and two people who have had nothing to do with the problems.”For Sinn Fein, this “isn’t about personalities — it’s about politics”, a party source said.The party is not used to airing its dirty laundry in public, and a viral Facebook post by one of its members in Derry that has been shared widely shows the organisation is going through change.The Sinn Fein source claimed the “republican legacy of this city has to be denigrated and used by a small group of people within Derry Sinn Féin for personal control and power”.“Many lelong republicans, activists, SF party members, ex-prisoners and volunteers’ families have suffered at the hands of these people, the source added.The review of the party’s operations in the city began at the end of last year, following a string of problems, including poor election performances.Sinn Fein toppled the SDLP from Foyle in  when Elisha McCallion — Anderson’s niece — narrowly defeated incumbent Mark Durkan by only  votes to become Foyle MP.Then, in December ’s snap general election, McCallion stood again, but it did not go to plan.“I watched Elisha at a meeting before that election and it was embarrassing,” a source said. “It was more like a love fest, Martina saying how good Elisha was, Elisha saying how good Michelle was, Michelle saying how good Mary Lou is. That’s not politics nor how you win and defend seats.”The charm offensive did not work and McCallion lost to SDLP leader Colum Eastwood, who won with a , majority. McCallion then won the election to the Seanad after losing her Westminster seat, but was forced to resign after failing toa £, Covid- grant from Stormont that had been issued in error.It was a “final straw” for the party leadership in Dublin and Belfast.However, claims that non-elected iniduals were abusing their power within the party, with allegations of bullying and even corruption, are perhaps the most damaging for Sinn Fein.The move has been described as “dangerous and risky” by some republicans, including Eamonn MacDermott, who said: “They could end up making the situation worse. They got rid of the leadership, moved the MLAs — who are they going to get to take their place  There is anger, and that could cost them votes.”MacDermott believes Sinn Fein “got very complacent” and “weren’t hungry enough any more”.“They took too many things for granted, including their support base in Derry. They stopped doing the work, they stopped being seen,” he says. A party spokesman said those who took part in the review made it clear they wanted change.“Karen and Martina will continue to play a role in the rebuilding of the party in Derry,” he added..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadBBC accused of Edwin Poots ‘lambast’ over religious beliefsEdwin Poots set to pressure Arlene Foster to quit First Minister post earlyLiving it up in the NI countryside: £.m house of the year perfect for shaking off city leIn profile: New DUP deputy leader Paula BradleyIn pictures: Rangers complete unbeaten season as Premiership trophy is presented and fans# celebrations engulf IbroxTop VideosPlayNew DUP leader Edwin Poots# full interview with Sunday Le\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news d .ece AUTOCROP wh fbbdaddabfecaef.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news d .ece AUTOCROP wh fbbdaddabfecaef.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayMass band parade against NI Protocol takes place in NewtownabbeyPlayEdwin on NI protocolLatest PoliticsSuzanne BreenOpinionEdwin Poots’ honeymoon won’t last longBoris Johnson promises to address legacy of the TroublesBeattie will have my full supporthe becomes UUP leader, insists Butler£bn in Covid aid was pushed through by Stormont ministersGail Walker, Editor-at-LargeOpinionA letter from NI in  to its younger self... hang in there, you do have a place in the worldLatestMeet Gary Fisher’s ‘Mr Big’ ...the man with the UDA cocaine connectionsIvan LittleOpinionBoris Johnson adds insult to injury to Ballymurphy massacre families‘Skidmark’ barred rioter from AE by UDAT’Pau singer Carol Decker: ‘Music’s in my DNA… I’m not qualied to do anything ’Caught on camera... suspected Dungiven bomb-maker scooped,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Photo: ReutersREUTERS FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueNarrow win: DUP leader-elect Edwin Poots. Photo: ReutersAndrew Madden and Gareth CrossMay   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailMONDAYThe week kicked off with Edwin Poots setting out his stall for the job of DUP leader, vowing to end reactionary policy making.We can no longer sustain the ad hoc approach that has been a feature of recent years, with policy on the hoof and little regard to the wishes of the elected members who have to believe in and defend the policies of the party, he wrote in his manesto.During a debate on Northern Ireland’s first climate change bill in the Assembly, former nuclear submarine captain Steve Aiken acknowledged that he would seem an unlikely candidate to be an eco-warrior.He said that, while working in the Arctic while he was in the Navy, he observed a ,-year-old sea of ice. When he ed to the area a few years later “that ice had gone”.Jim Allister revealed to no one#s surprise that he isn#t a fan of the bill, pointing to its potential impact on the agri-food sector.“I am saying that the answer is not to take % of our animals and slaughter them or to take % of our production and export it to the depleting rainforests of Brazil and then sit back smugly and say, ‘Didn#t we do well # That is the ethos of the Bill, he said in the chamber.People, much as [DUP MLA Jim Wells] might not like it, will continue to buy meat. Do they buy the meat produced in north Antrim or the meat produced on land that has been stripped in the Amazon basin  That is an issue that politicians in the Western world have to consider.Ulster Unionist MLA Roy Beggs took issue with the emission targets in the bill, including a goal of zero emissions by . He said they are set over a compressed time frame and go way beyond UK Climate Change Committee targets.Green Party leader Clare Bailey, who tabled the bill, interjected. Does the member realise that his party#s manesto commits to net zero by , which is much faster and a much more compressed time frame  she said.I believe that that was a Westminster manesto, Mr Beggs replied.At a press conference addressing his resignation as UUP leader, Mr Aiken was asked which task was harder, commanding a nuclear submarine or leading the UUP. He wryly remarked: I think I#ll plead the fth on that one.TUESDAYThe climate change debate continued into Tuesday, with Jim Wells rounding on the Environment Minister, and his party colleague, Edwin Poots, over his opposition to the bill.Why are we giving planning permission for peat extraction and the development of peatlands when they have so much potential to store carbon  Why has the department not completed the area of special scientic interest, special protection area and special area of conservation designations  he said.The [conservation] Act came in in , and I am able to tell him how long ago that was because I was in the chamber when it passed. Here we are,  years later, and we still have not completed our [Areas of Special Scientic Interest] designation.Alliance#s Kellie Armstrong said: I thank the proposers of the motion it is an important debate. I will have to recommend myself for disciplinary action because I find myself agreeing with Mr Wells far too much.Oh no, replied Mr Wells.Sinn Fein#s Jemma Dolan raised a point of order later on in the chamber, saying she had secured an adjournment debate - a way of enabling the House to have a debate on a subject without considering a substantive motion - two weeks ago, but Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon released a statement on the same issue on Tuesday morning.That undermines the role of MLAs and the authority of the chamber to hold ministers to account. I ask the Speaker#s Office to look into this to see whether proper procedure and protocol were followed, she said.Speaker Alex Maskey sympathised: I say directly to the minister that, having seen that her statement was issued a number of hours ago, in advance of the adjournment debate that was scheduled for this afternoon in the order paper, I can understand why a member would feel aggrieved.It is not for me to judge why that happened, but I will write to the Executive again because I want to make sure that ministers reflect on when they issue statements, particularly on sitting days and when the minister is scheduled to come to a particular debate to make a statement.WEDNESDAYA potential sign of things to come was aired on Wednesday, when Edwin Poots no-showed a North South ministerial agriculture meeting. Nichola Mallon, the Infrastructure Minister, was also due to take part, stating it doesn#t bode wellthis is what the future holds. Powersharing requires leadership, she tweeted.It emerged Brexit minister Lord Frost and Secretary of State Brandon Lewis were in Northern Ireland on Monday meeting with the Loyalist Communities Council - but no one seemed to notice at the time.Independent MLA Trevor Lunn asked a Stormont officialshe knew Lord Frost was visiting.“It wasn’t wholly unexpected, but I wasn’t aware of the date in advance,” responded the official.Mr Lunn said: I think they must have smuggled him in and smuggled him out again.When the Assembly#s Economy Committee heard from Minister Diane Dodds on Wednesday, questions were raised around her own future.As she outlined her post-pandemic economic recovery plan Alliance MLA Stewart Dickson noted she might not be Economy Minister much longer.Edwin Poots has committed to reshuffling the DUP#s ministerial team.How do you see your successor, or a future mandate, taking forward your economy plan , Mr Dickson asked.Mrs Dodds replied: “What I do or I don#t do after this week or next week will be for the party leader and that is fine with me.THURSDAYThursday saw a meeting of the Health Committee, with members briefed on the topic of gambling addiction.Sinn Fein#s Colm Gildernew said he was “taken aback” before the pandemic to learn that one in  suicides “are linked to gambling addiction”.He asked an officialthere were any plans to develop services to tackle the problem, to which the official replied: There are no specic gambling addiction services.Nothing much gets past TUV leader Jim Allister. This week he received an answer to questions around why Union flags flown at Stormont to mark the birthday of Queen Elizabeth on April  were lowered before sunset. In a written response the Assembly Commission said the flags were lowered at .pm, ahead of the closure of the Assembly at pm, with restricted opening hours during the coronavirus pandemic. Previously the flags would have flown until just before pm.FRIDAYIt was a monumental day for unionism, with the DUP voting for their new leader. Outside party HQ in Belfast, Jim Wells was asked about the possibility of Sir Jeffrey Donaldson running as an MLA in his constituency in the next Assembly election.Mr Wells said Sir Jeffrey previously represented North Down and still has a lot of family there, however he is glad the Donaldsons on the electoral register voted for him the last time round.He hasn#t gone away, you know, he added.Alas, it was not be for Sir Jeffrey#s leadership ambitions, as he fell by two votes to Edwin Poots. The Agriculture Minister said during his acceptance speech he wanted to reach out to other unionists.Other unionists, it seems, aren#t going to give him an easy ride. Within minutes of the white smoke emerging from DUP HQ, outgoing Ulster Unionist leader Steve Aiken issued a statement calling for answers over the DUP#s Brexit dealings.Why did Edwin and ALL his colleagues endorse Boris Johnson’s proposals on October ,  for a regulatory border in the Irish Sea  Mr Aiken asked.“Why did Edwin and ALL his colleagues endorse Boris Johnson’s proposals on October ,  for border inspection posts to be establish at Northern Ireland’s ports Why did Edwin and ALL his colleagues endorse Boris Johnson’s proposals that all goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain must comply with EU rules and therefore be subject to the ongoing remit of the EU court Good luck, Edwin..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Belfast Most ReadBBC accused of Edwin Poots ‘lambast’ over religious beliefsEdwin Poots set to pressure Arlene Foster to quit First Minister post earlyLiving it up in the NI countryside: £.m house of the year perfect for shaking off city leIn profile: New DUP deputy leader Paula BradleyIn pictures: Rangers complete unbeaten season as Premiership trophy is presented and fans# celebrations engulf IbroxTop VideosPlayNew DUP leader Edwin Poots# full interview with Sunday Le\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news d .ece AUTOCROP wh fbbdaddabfecaef.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news d .ece AUTOCROP wh fbbdaddabfecaef.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayMass band parade against NI Protocol takes place in NewtownabbeyPlayEdwin on NI protocolLatest PoliticsSuzanne BreenOpinionEdwin Poots’ honeymoon won’t last longBoris Johnson promises to address legacy of the TroublesBeattie will have my full supporthe becomes UUP leader, insists Butler£bn in Covid aid was pushed through by Stormont ministersGail Walker, Editor-at-LargeOpinionA letter from NI in  to its younger self... hang in there, you do have a place in the worldLatestMeet Gary Fisher’s ‘Mr Big’ ...the man with the UDA cocaine connectionsIvan LittleOpinionBoris Johnson adds insult to injury to Ballymurphy massacre families‘Skidmark’ barred rioter from AE by UDAT’Pau singer Carol Decker: ‘Music’s in my DNA… I’m not qualied to do anything ’Caught on camera... suspected Dungiven bomb-maker scooped,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

If you have bought there in the last few years, then you should be quids in as values have taken a huge leap in the past  months. It#s so popular that supply isn#t meeting demand, as people moving in are there to stay, meaning fewer properties coming onto the market. The few that have recently become available are so sought-after that they have prompted bidding wars. Average property values here rose by £, in the past year to £,, but local agent Neil Templeton reckons that#s a conservative figure. A director of Templeton Robinson Estate Agents, he says: It#s been a good market since we came out of the first lockdown in June of last year but it has been particularly busy since Easter. I think that#s because people are seeing light at the end of the tunnel now, with the number of Covid cases down and vaccines being rolled out. While some people will have a tough time ahead because of employment, others have been told their jobs are safe. The dynamic of what people are looking for has changed and generally people want more space internally and externally. Also a lot of people have been told by their bosses that they will continue to work from home for the foreseeable future. Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseBelmont FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueBelmontPeople are attracted to this area by the great schools and many restaurants and shops and the close proximity of the City Airport. We also have something for everyone in terms of price brackets as there are houses from £, to £m.There are also people moving back home from England because they have the option of remote working. Neil says: They are looking for a better lestyle, a better education for their children, savings on school fees as well as a lower cost of living. These are people who maybe worked in London but have now been told they can work from home. We recently put a four-bedroom semi on the market at £, and had four bidders, three of them from England. The house sold for £,. The biggest increase has been in terraced properties, up by almost £, from £, to £,. He says better mortgage products - some at % LTV - have fuelled growth, especially for first-time buyers. If you can get your hands on a -% deposit then you can buy a terrace house in east Belfast and have mortgage payments which are lower than rent. People have been able to save money during the pandemic and a lot of first-time buyers are being assisted by their parents to get on the housing ladder. Semi-detached houses are at a premium, rising in price over the past year from £, to £,. Agents are now facing a shortage of houses and unabated demand. Neil says: There is very little land left to develop in east Belfast and generally people moving into the area are moving in to stay. Those already here don#t want to move so there aren#t enough properties for sale to meet demand. .app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Belfast Most ReadBBC accused of Edwin Poots ‘lambast’ over religious beliefsEdwin Poots set to pressure Arlene Foster to quit First Minister post earlyLiving it up in the NI countryside: £.m house of the year perfect for shaking off city leIn profile: New DUP deputy leader Paula BradleyIn pictures: Rangers complete unbeaten season as Premiership trophy is presented and fans# celebrations engulf IbroxTop VideosPlayNew DUP leader Edwin Poots# full interview with Sunday Le\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news d .ece AUTOCROP wh fbbdaddabfecaef.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news d .ece AUTOCROP wh fbbdaddabfecaef.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayMass band parade against NI Protocol takes place in NewtownabbeyPlayEdwin on NI protocolLatest NewsEdwin Poots: ‘I will not rest until NI Protocol’s removed’Black and Northern Irish: The experiences - good and bad - and achievements of black and mixed race people who call this place homeWaiting lists for properties by the lakes in FermanaghAllen SleithOpinionThought for the weekendNorth has Belfast#s top price hikeLatestMeet Gary Fisher’s ‘Mr Big’ ...the man with the UDA cocaine connections‘Skidmark’ barred rioter from AE by UDAIvan LittleOpinionBoris Johnson adds insult to injury to Ballymurphy massacre familiesT’Pau singer Carol Decker: ‘Music’s in my DNA… I’m not qualied to do anything ’Caught on camera... suspected Dungiven bomb-maker scooped,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Chair of DTUC, Niall McCarroll, says that as a working class movement DTUC has provided a voice for workers and social justice campaigns. It aims to further reach out with the launch of a local workers survey, as it extends its solidarity with the people of Derry and District demanding an end to the many hardships which workers and their families experience and have experienced for far too long. Mr McCarroll says: Like everyone  I have listened to plenty of guff over the years. Hang in there is the message from all sections of the establishment, we are sympathetic and very empathetic we know things are dficult butyou keep working for nothing with no improvements things will improve. googletag.cmd.push Nurses, hotel workers, health care assistants, nursing home workers, shop workers, classroom assistants, retail workers, community, voluntary sector workers and indeed call centre staff have all heard this and still they wait, we all wait. We need to organise and begin to direct our own affairs, we need to represent ourselves because we are not being represented. He adds: Derry Trades Union Council call upon all local workers to join a trade union, get active in your local branch and shape your trade union into a fighting, working class organisation. This is how we will change our lives make our communities better, create a culture of solidarity across all workplaces, uniting all workers. Lets begin to create this new modern workers movement. googletag.cmd.push Unionised workers of the past, including our local factory workers championed the cause of labour and won many of the rights we take for granted today such as maternity pay,  hour days and weekends off. Todays demands are not being won, workers need decent pay and we must collectively mobilise to end the scourge of poverty pay, creating the situation were no worker needs to work two jobs to survive. By completing the DTUC survey we can commence the call to mobilise, use this survey to bring us together - together we can make a dference - together we can deliver for each other.     We are told by the privileged few that we must wait to gain the same privileges. Time is up.

Jade Bradley, who is originally from Hatmore Park in the Foyle Springs area of the city, is the founder of Restore Nutrition, a wellness company that specialises in helping people with their nutrition to deliver a better quality of le. Jade embarked on her own mental and physical health journey several years ago having struggled with anxiety. She used a blended approach which included yoga, meditation, music, therapy and the input from a kinesiologist that advised on food issues and intolerances. googletag.cmd.push Within two months of implementing these changes, Jade saw a massive change resulting in better sleep, more energy and a feeling of being more ‘restored.’ It was this that sparked her desire to educate herself in naturopathic nutrition. She moved to London and studied at the College of Naturopathic Medicine and became a member of the Complementary and Natural Healthcare Council. She launched Restore Nutrition in  and the company has since gone from strength to strength. working with over  private clients and organisations including, Seagate, Business in the Community, Hurt, Waterside Neighbourhood Partnership, Belfast Food Network, Hillcrest, Culmore Hub, Foyle Women’s Information Group, Derry Well Woman and Youth Action. googletag.cmd.push Speaking about her new programme, Jade said: “We are living in a stressed out society, and having the main pillars of health and wellbeing in place is essential to help deal with stress and anxiety. If the fundamentals aren’t in place, it is impossible for us to excel.” Jade said these fundamentals were more important than ever given the challenging times we are all in. She added: “I centre our work around four pillars which we delve into on the ‘Kick Start’ programme namely: hydration, reducing toxic load, restoring with whole foods and managing stress and sleep.” She said she has found most people want a quick fix or a magic pill when it came to their health and wellbeing journey.     “Unfortunately, this does not exist,” she said. “It is best to make small changes incrementally and embark on this journey in stages starting off with the fundamentals which is exactly what we do in our new programme. “Furthermore, it is so important to tackle mental health issues with an all-round approach and this is why I have worked with local mental health therapist, Caroline McMenamin, on many projects over the past two years and plan to do more collaborations throughout the year.” The ‘Kick Start’ nutrition programme is available for business groups, charities, community groups and inidual attendees and runs over four weeks in one-hour sessions.

He is one of four Glen men listed to start on Saturday. Danny Tallon, who started all  games last season, isnt included in the starting line-up. There is no place for Slaughtneil defender Karl McKaigue who has made a full recovery from the torn Achilles sustained on club hurling championship duty last summer. The only three members of the current  yet to make their debuts are Bellaghy duo Ronan McFaul and Conleth McShane, as well as Glen goalkeeper Connlan Bradley. googletag.cmd.push Goals from Patrick Kearney and Paul Cassidy helped Derry to victory when the sides met last season at Celtic Park. Derry and Longford have met eight times in the last two decades, in league and championship.

By hook or by crook wed have liked to have got out of there with a victory, Gallagher commented after Derrys - to - win over Longford on Saturday night. We performed fairly well...very well at times in the second half. It was a lot more comfortable than wed ever have expected, he added. An upbeat Derry boss said the victory was a great reward for the efforts of the squad in the off-season. After getting the full squad back on board after last seasons Derry county finals, he felt the build-up to the Armagh championship game pleased him, after which the squad were left in no doubt of the effort required before Christmas, ahead of their  promotion push. googletag.cmd.push They have done the work with Peterand with Anne Marieand I am delighted with the condition they are in, Gallagher pointed out. Derry were six points clear at half time of Saturdays clash in a rainswept Pearse Park, but Gallagher admitted it shouldve been more. I was bitterly disappointed we only had eight points at half-time, we shouldve been sitting with - or - at our ease and that was Niallkicking a couple of fties in tough conditions. I felt we left scores too easily behind and to be honest,Longford had been more clinical or when you move up the gears against opposition higher up the isions wed have suffered for it. googletag.cmd.push Fermanagh were narrow winners over Ulster champions Cavan on Saturday night and come to Owenbeg next week for a top of the table clash.

Ahead of a k sponsored run this weekend in aid of the Mental Health Awareness charity, Eaacutebha and Ciaroacutens mother, Collette, has shared her childrens plea to break the taboo around mens mental health. “On May  , it will be  years since Ciaroacuten and I last saw our Daddy. With cold shock, I realise that means hes been gone for  years longer than I knew him,” wrote Eaacutebha. googletag.cmd.push “We were only five and three when he took his own le. For many people, a period of time relieves much of the pain, and makes it easier to move on. “But for us, in many ways, its got worse. Losing a parent at five and three meant we didnt really understand death. I didnt even know it was suicide until I was in P. “Our Daddys death has left us with years of unsolved questions, new and fresh situations to face without a father. “Even from the day he died, we are still finding out new things about him to add to the tiny memories we thankfully have. Five years is no time to know someone well. googletag.cmd.push “I wish we could go back to those days when we were just a little boy and girl, too young to notice how down our Daddy really was. Eaacutebha has posted details of the sponsored runs route on social media. “I wish we could spread them throughout the rest of our lives knowing what people are thinking and going through, hoping we could help them in any possible way. “Why cant we swap the day he held us as a baby at our Christening, so he could watch us play Gaelic, win big matches and watch us succeed in le  “Ten years on and we are still listening to his favourite songs, watching the one existing video of him to remember his voice, crying on Fathers Day or his birthday, or any random day.     “We still cant let our Daddy go. Everyone thinks we might have moved on, because it happened such a long time ago. “But they dont know how it feels to look at the same few photographs, knowing there will never be any more. “They dont know how strange it feels to think we once had two parents. They dont know what its like to sit and talk to your Daddy at a gravestone at  and  knowing that he didnt want to be here. “If we let him go, hes gone forever, and we cant take that. The effect of suicide isnt just the loss of the person who left you behind, its the shadow always at your heel.” Eaacutebha and Ciaroacuten have shared their story in the hope it will help others to speak out about their mental health. “Ten years on, and suicide is still the leading cause of death for men under ,” said Eaacutebha. “Every day, men who feel like our Daddy did bottle up their feelings, try to appear strong, and drive themselves further into darkness. “Every day,  of them take their lives, leaving people like Ciaroacuten and I lost and heartbroken. And every day, we wish we could change what happened. “For our Daddy, the sun will never come out again, but the more we talk about it, the more we listen, the more others will live to see another day and the more the shadows will fade.”] The k sponsored run in memory of Kieran Squealer Mullan will take place on Sunday May , with all proceeds going to the Mental Health Awareness charity.

Brooke McEldowney, a Primary One pupil at St Brigids Tirkane Bunscoil Naomh Briacuted, has appeared in Three Families, which aired this week on BBC One. Three Families explores the emotive issues around womens rights and tells the story of the grassroots campaign to lt Northern Irelands restrictions on abortion. Brooke enjoying herself on set. Brooke landed the role after her mum Kirsty received an email from a casting agency. “When I opened an email about NI filming and how they were on the lookout for a young child, Brooke fitted the description,” she told Derry Now. googletag.cmd.push “It was all very overwhelming as the world was going through a pandemic and my daughter was now going to be part of a cast. It all felt like a dream.” For Brooke, the dream was very much a reality, and although she began filming at just four years of age, the young County Derry girl made light of the heavy schedule.  “She has been such a busy girl, taking everything in her stride and having so many dferent roles in filming and completely loving it all,” said Kirsty. “During the lockdowns while everyone was at home, I was arranging my other kids childcare and driving to our next destination for long days ahead. googletag.cmd.push “She had attended local drama and dance classes for a short while - pre-Covid - so this helped. She loved all the attention and getting chauffeured to each set, a few places I never expected to be.” Five-year-old Brooke has a central role in the drama as the daughter of actor Colin Morgan, previously of The Fall and actress Amy James Kelly, who has previously featured in Coronation Street. “When I met them and signed the contracts I knew that this was a big deal and how I had to keep everything a secret,” said Kirsty. “I had to travel myself to each set every couple of days prior filming to get a Covid test. Thankfully, they were all negative so Brooke could always continue with her role.”     The future is already looking bright for the Maghera girl, and she was handed a unique birthday present in February when she began filming on a CBBC musical drama series. “It was so perfect and fitting on her th birthday and the cast, producers and directors spoiled her,” said Kirsty. “Her confidence rapidly grew and has been even given spoken lines for on screen. She has gained multiple jobs since and has now been signed up by an agency.” Brooke on set with Colin Morgan and Amy James Kelly. Keeping her feet on the ground amid the excitement of her new-found fame will be an easy task with the support of her community and her school. “When ing to school after lockdown Brooke had days off due to filming but the BBC always liaised so well with the school,” said Kirsty. “Brooke is a very independent, intelligent girl and likes a good routine. She was thrilled when her teacher, Mrs Convery sent work via Seesaw and was always keen to get the tasks completed. “We are so proud and it has been an emotional journey as I have been involved in the Arts for many years and know how challenging it can be. “It’s all such an amazing experience and the opportunities it has opened for her have been remarkable. I am so privileged that we get to go on this journey together as mother and daughter. “We are bursting with pride.” Three Families is available to watch now on BBC iPlayer.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Government Boundaries Commissioner Sarah Havlin has outlined further details about her review of the  district council boundaries and the proposed timetable and process for public consultation. This includes publishing a short information video to outline the review process and highlighting why and how people can get involved. This also coincides with the start of a series of ‘Meet the Commissioner’ briefing events with council representatives from across all  councils. By the end of July this year, the Commissioner plans to publish provisional proposals, outlining any proposed changes to local government boundaries. googletag.cmd.push The closing date for written submissions about these provisional proposals will be September  this year. After this, a series of public hearings will be held to gather further feedback and these will be subject to the relevant covid- public health guidance at that time. Thereafter, there will be a period of analysis of the representations and public hearing reports, before the preparation of revised proposals which will again be subject to further consultation. The review is something that by law has to happen every eight- years and although the last review took place in   with the final recommendations from that providing the basis for the last review of local government boundaries which after legislation and elections etc, took effect from  when the new councils came into being. googletag.cmd.push The last review, which saw Derry City Council and Strabane District Council combine to make Derry City and Strabane District Council, coincided with the change in local government which saw the signicant change from  to  councils so was more substantial in nature. This review will take into account changes in electoral changes housing changes among other things since  and make recommendation on the boundaries of the  current districts and the ious wards that make them up. It’s hard to know what the initial proposals will show as modelling electoral analysis etc is ongoing but there may well be some local government boundaries changing.     The review will also examine the potential for changes to the names of local wards to reflect local considerations. The review, when completed next year, will then need to be legislated on before any actual boundary changes would take effect. Boundary Commissioner, Sarah Havlin, is encouraging everyone with an interest to get involved in what she described this important review. everyone with an interest to get involved. “We have also published an information video to highlight how and why people should get involved. The outcomes will inform the make-up of local government in the foreseeable future andwill consider the impact of electorate changes since  and other recent developments. “The process is about independently ensuring electoral equality and fairness across Northern Ireland, with the aim that all the wards within a district should, as far as possible, have a similar number of electors. “With that I mind, it’s important that we hear the views of local people and their representatives on these matters, and I would encourage people to regularly check our website and social media channels for more information on how they can have their voice heard in this process.” Review details can be found athttps:www. lgbc-ni.org.uk or via Twitter and Facebook @LGBCNI.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Mourners at the service in Our Lady of Mercy Church in Lavey heard how Catherine showered the children she taught with love and was devoted to her family. Officiating at the funeral, parish priest Fr Eamon Graham said she was a beautul person. “If I was to mention this morning all the people who Catherine loved and who she in turn was loved by, we would be here all day,” he told the congregation. “The past few days I was trying to think how I would sum up Catherine she was beautul inside and outside, in every aspect of le. googletag.cmd.push “She loved all the good things in le. She always had her hair done and presented herself better than any of the rest of us. “Behind that, it wasnt a facade. It was a reflection of the goodness within her. She lived her le in a wonderful way.” Fr Graham told those gathered in the church how Catherine had doted over her many nieces and nephews, and encouraged them to keep her memory alive by following her example. Her love of both those in her family and the children she taught was central to her le, a le in which her faith was strong. googletag.cmd.push “You know every child she ever taught, because she brought all the childrens bothers and woes home. She loved the children she taught, particularly in Creggan,” he said. “She had a special love of her godchildren because her faith was important. She loved God deeply and many people are closer to God today because they encountered Catherine.” A proud Lavey woman, she was deeply involved in the local community. She attended the local primary school and was steeped in the areas GAA tradition. “In our own parish, Catherine was so involved in the GAA, the camogie. She was a pupil at our school and the teachers remembered her as a pupil and a student teacher,” said Fr Graham.     “When she was dealing with student teachers, she always went the extra mile. Teaching wasnt just a job for her, it was a vocation. “She was a perfectionist in every way possible, but she missed her mummy. It is our hope, prayer and belief that she is with her mother and with God.” Erins Own GAC led their own tribute to Catherine online. “Lavey GAC is greatly shocked and saddened to learn of the untimely death of our former senior camogie player, Catherine McCann,” they said. “Today and forever well remember Catherine McCann. Every team with Catherine on it was a better team.” Catherine taught for  years in Creggan Primary School, near Randalstown, County Antrim, and the school paid tribute to her kindness. “Miss Mc Cann taught in our school for  years. She was a model teacher in every way, always putting her pupils first,” they said. “An amazing friend to all the staff and parents and her displays of kindness to everyone she met came so naturally. “She always arrived to school dressed in the latest fashion and then quickly pulled the trainers on her to deliver sports lessons in her lovely pink trainers. “We cannot even begin to realise the void that is left in Creggan Primary School.” Concluding the homily at her funeral mass, Fr Graham said she had touched the le of every person she encountered. “I cant sum up Catherine – I wouldnt even try to – but the thought thats in my head is that she wove a thread of gold through le,” he said. “It touched every person she encountered and it was made out of love. Its up to the rest of us to take up that thread and bring it through le. “Thats the greatest tribute everybody can give.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

She loved God deeply and many people are closer to God today because they encountered Catherine.” A proud Lavey woman, she was deeply involved in the local community. She attended the local primary school and was steeped in the areas GAA tradition. “In our own parish, Catherine was so involved in the GAA, the camogie. She was a pupil at our school and the teachers remembered her as a pupil and a student teacher,” said Fr Graham.     “When she was dealing with student teachers, she always went the extra mile. Teaching wasnt just a job for her, it was a vocation. “She was a perfectionist in every way possible, but she missed her mummy. It is our hope, prayer and belief that she is with her mother and with God.” Erins Own GAC led their own tribute to Catherine online. “Lavey GAC is greatly shocked and saddened to learn of the untimely death of our former senior camogie player, Catherine McCann,” they said. “Today and forever well remember Catherine McCann. Every team with Catherine on it was a better team.” Catherine taught for  years in Creggan Primary School, near Randalstown, County Antrim, and the school paid tribute to her kindness. “Miss Mc Cann taught in our school for  years. She was a model teacher in every way, always putting her pupils first,” they said. “An amazing friend to all the staff and parents and her displays of kindness to everyone she met came so naturally. “She always arrived to school dressed in the latest fashion and then quickly pulled the trainers on her to deliver sports lessons in her lovely pink trainers. “We cannot even begin to realise the void that is left in Creggan Primary School.” Concluding the homily at her funeral mass, Fr Graham said she had touched the le of every person she encountered. “I cant sum up Catherine – I wouldnt even try to – but the thought thats in my head is that she wove a thread of gold through le,” he said. “It touched every person she encountered and it was made out of love. Its up to the rest of us to take up that thread and bring it through le. “Thats the greatest tribute everybody can give.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Ruaidhri Higgins’ team matched the champions every step of the way and the new manager has now taken seven points from his three away games. It took Rovers just over  minutes to really trouble Nathan Gartside and unsurprisingly it was Graham Burke at the heart of it, as he made a direct run at goal, playing a one-two with Rory Gaffney before breaking into the area, but his shot was pushed behind for a corner by the City goalkeeper. googletag.cmd.push Rovers were beginning to build momentum as half time approached, but they were very nearly caught out when James Akintunde dispossessed Ronan Finn on halfway, and picked out the run of Parkhouse, who turned inside and shot over the bar from  yards. Derry City needed Gartside to keep the scores level however, as the home side finally carved open their defence on  minutes, Sean Gannon’s low cross picking out Gaffney, who turned onto his left foot but couldn’t beat the City goalkeeper from close range. It was a hugely important save from Gartside. The game exploded into le early in the second half when Akintunde was brought down by Sean Hoare in the area, and referee Graham Kelly pointed to the penalty spot. It was a terric opportunity for City to take the lead and it was one which Will Patching did not waste as he sent Alan Mannus the wrong way to make it -. googletag.cmd.push That lead lasted barely six minutes however as Rovers levelled, and it was Rory Gaffney who got the goal, shrugging off Ciaran Coll before firing past Gartside from the angle to make it -. Both sides pushed for the winning goal in the closing stages and there was more drama, with both teams finishing the game with ten men, Sean Hoare red-carded for Rovers on  minutes, and Danny Lafferty receiving a second caution in the th minute.

Even so, he was also at pains to point out that he was not attacking the minister.ldquoThere are numerous issues regarding the Downe and Daisy Hill that need to be dealt with face to face with the minister, he said.ldquoWe have engaged with health trusts until we are blue in the face and we are getting nowhere. We need to put it up to the minister. We are in unprecedented times.Downpatrick councillor Oonagh Hanlon said she too was disappointed and urged Mr Swann to reconsider.ldquoThis is such an important issue, she said. ldquoWe are coming out of Covid and we need the restoration of services at the Downe. I am very disappointed, she remarked.Fellow Downpatrick councillor Gareth Sharvin said he acknowledged that Mr Swann was under pressure, but suggested that a virtual meeting could easily be arranged.ldquoThe Downe Hospital is extremely important to the people I represent, he said. ldquoWe need the minister to come out and say he is as passionate about the Downe as we are.His SDLP colleague, John Trainor, said the council needed to ldquoexplore every avenue, adding that councillors should ask the Stormont Health Committee to interveneMr Swann was to refuse to meet then a second time.Rowallane councillor Kathryn Owen, who nursed in a Covid unit at the height of the pandemic, said she wished to ldquoput on record her disappointment.She added: Knowing how important these two hospitals are and having worked in them, it was a weak response..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12thMay2021-45m.jpg","title":"£45m investment needed to upgrade Ardglass harbour  ","story":"INVESTMENT in the region of poundm is needed to upgrade Ardglass harbour to help maximise the portrsquos future opportunities, according to a major new report published on Monday.Stormont agriculture minister Edwin Poots has published the findings of the report which highlights the investment needed in Northern Irelandrsquos fishing industry and seafood sectors.The report was produced by the Fishing and Seafood Development Programmewhich was established by the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairsto conduct a strategic review of the opportunities for developing the sea fishing and seafood sectors across the province, including the potential role of new public investment in infrastructure.Focusing on recommendations in relation to capital investment at the main fishery harbours, the report highlights a number of challenges and opportunities for the wider industry that could be addressed through a future fisheries financial support scheme.The recommendations for Ardglass include enhancing capacity at the harbour to provide security for fishing and processing businesses, while the development of Kilkeel harbour as a ldquopotential Irish Sea hub for the fishing and maritime economy by increasing port capacity and shore side facilities is highlighted.More generally, the detailed report highlights the need to create conditions resulting in investment in more modern fuel efficient vessels with low emissions and better facilities for crews, further reducing the environmental impact of the fishing fleet, adopting novel technology to expand marine aquaculture and taking advantage of EU exit opportunities to build exports of high value seafood.The report confirms that a recent survey of the harbour walls in Ardglass revealed that some repairs may be required within the next one to two years but their condition will not prevent the deepening of the harbour mdash to nine metres below the waterline mdashthey are stabilised and protected from undermining prior to dredging operations.It says the current water depth and quaysideprevents larger fishing vessels from landing at Ardglass with tankers transporting fish landed in Belfast to the village for processing. Mackerel and Irish Sea herring continue to be landed in Ardglass.The report says there is inadequate space for growing the inshore fleet at the port as the quayside is dominated by the larger demersal fleet and occasional visiting pelagic vessels, with the adjoining marina for the exclusive use of leisure craft.A constraint to the landside development of the harbourrsquos estate is the mixed ownership of existing properties which prevents the Fishery Harbour Authority from having full control over activities at the port and limits the ability to plan strategically.As a result, the Fishing and Seafood Development Programme proposes a poundm budget to purchase properties and prepare buildings and land within the harbour for redevelopment.With the cost of the work at the main harbour estimated at poundm, the report explains the figure can only be revised following the completion of a bathymetric survey.Ardglass councillor Dermot Curran said he was keen to meet with Mr Poots to discuss the detail of the report and the level of work required.ldquoThe report highlights the development of an lsquoIrish Sea hub in Kilkeel and I know that many in Ardglass will be keen to hear from the minister what exactly this means. Ardglass plays a critical role in the Co Down fishing industry and its contribution to this key sector must be expanded, he said.ldquoThere are two major processing factories in Ardglass and work to dredge the harbour to facilitate larger vessels is a critical component of the investment that is required.Cllr Curran said investment was required to meet the needs of the existing fleet and future vessels.He added: ldquoThe village fleet has increased over the years and those who work in the industry say while they are not necessarily expecting a huge increase in the number of boats, they do anticipate an increase in the quality of boats and for that to happen, the harbour must be fit for purpose.Mr Poots said he hoped the publication of the report ldquomarks the beginning of a new chapter in the history of the provincersquos fishing industry.ldquoThe report highlights the considerable investment that is required to help the industry adapt to the challenges it faces and grasp the opportunities presented following the United Kingdomrsquos exit from the EU, he explained.ldquoWe need to build a stronger and more resilient fishing and seafood industry that can adapt to change.

Interested developers have already been informed of the pending opportunity to submit their proposals.Councillors were told that all of the work to date has focused on site access via current access routes from Market Street and Irish Street, with officials reaffirming that as part of the feasibility study, one option that was explored mdash but subsequently rejected mdash was providing a road access linking Irish Street with St Patrickrsquos Avenue.ldquoTo explore the purchase of additional lands at this stage would mean that the development brief process would have to be suspended and the business case revisited in line with land valuations, councillors were told.ldquoThe development brief has been drafted in such a way to allow developers to bring additional lands that they may choose to acquire to enhance their plans.The council paper added: ldquoAs part of the development brief, car parking provision will have to be demonstrated and how it is achieved will again be up to the innovation of bids brought forward. Car parking will be a key requirement in the assessment process and indeed planning approval process.Moving forward, there is an acknowledgement that the current Irish Street car park is badly laid out and that the redevelopment proposal provides an opportunity to address this, paving the way for it to be used for future events, markets and festivals, with the DfC and local council prepared to provide additional funding to allow this to happen.Signicantly, developers interested in the prime town centre site are being asked to focus on how their chosen scheme can potentially contribute to Downpatrickrsquos night-time economy post Covid, providing a boost for residents and help attract visitors to Downpatrick.As part of continuing work on the Irish Street revitalisation programme, graphics recently appeared on the front of the former police base, while the archway at the entrance to the Irish Street car park will be painted.Downpatrick councillors say they are acutely aware that the opportunity to redevelop a huge area of town centre land will not happen again, with the redevelopment plan having the potential to provide a boost for existing traders who have been at the heart of the town centre economy for decades..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12thMay2021-DundrumCricket.jpg","title":"Dundrum thirds make historic league debut  ","story":"SUNDAY was a momentous day in the history of Dundrum Cricket Club.For the first time the club have been able to enter a thirds team into league cricket and the Meadow was the venue as Dundrum took the field against Ards seconds with a team packed with experience and plenty of youth too.Dundrum captain Neil Reilly won the toss and elected to bat on a super wicket that the ground staff had prepared for the seconds the day before, but had not been used due to bad weather.In the first over, opener Eoin Moag nicked a gooddelivery which was caught frombehind by the Ards wicketkeeper,.This was followed in the second over by a Jack Calvert drive catching the edge of the bat and flying straight up to be caught, leaving Dundrum on  for .The tricky start was made worse when the captain was run out by a sharp piece of fielding from Ards, leaving the hosts on  for .This brought together a partnership between Keba Butler and Kristofer McNeill which finally found traction and started to produce a decent score.By the time Kristofer had been bowled for , the score had risen to  for  with some cracking shots by both batsman which on another day would have produced even more runs, but on a damp outfield restricted the number of fours.Andrew Hammond came in and produced a fast hitting nine to supplement Kebarsquos continued run chase which culminated in a not out score of  by the end of the allotted  overs.Ards came into bat and had a fast start, reaching  without loss after only three overs,.The captainrsquos second over proved to be a turning point in picking up two wickets for just a single run.

His plan to split the DUP leadership from first minister poses dficulties, not least the matter of who he will make NI’s head of government.If Mr Poots strikes a friendly tone, it will be easier for him to be firm on the Irish Sea border.

That has appeared to be clear since Arlene Foster’s downfall two weeks ago, but became unavoidably clear yesterday.Edwin Poots carries the DUP in his DNA. Unquestionably, he is more right wing, more instinctively hardline and more socially conservative than Mrs Foster.But this is about far more than simply the revenge of the Paisleyites – although that is part of this complex plot.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...The central clue to understanding what happened yesterday is the election of Paula Bradley. It would be impossible to find a DUP MLA more antithetical to a Free Presbyterian takeover of the DUP.The North Belfast MLA supports gay rights, supports abortion being legalised, and publicly criticised Gregory Campbell’s ‘curry my yoghurt’ Irish language jibe.The signicance of her election as DUP deputy leader – to replace a Free Presbyterian former assistant to Dr Paisley, Nigel Dodds – is not that it happened, but how it happened.Yesterday Mr Poots worked to help clear the way for Mrs Bradley’s victory over Mr Campbell, the ultimate old school DUP man.Mr Poots’ campaign manager, Paul Frew, was also a candidate for deputy leader. Yesterday morning he was part way through his speech to the electoral college when the North Antrim MLA announced that he was withdrawing from the race.Several days ago, one source in Mr Poots’s camp had predicted Mr Frew – whose central concern is reform of the DUP – would not let his name go forward for deputy leader and that Ms Bradley would be the victor in that contest.Nevertheless, his sudden withdrawal left veteran Jim Wells “dumbfounded”. Last night he said “it is obvious that there were some discussions between him and Paula Bradley’s camp.“It basically boiled down to whetherPaula Bradley became deputy leader, some of here folk were prepared to vote for Edwin Poots.“I have no doubt that Paula Bradley voted for Edwin Poots.”However, Mr Wells said that he had not voted for Ms Bradley. Yet he did not vote for Mr Campell either and instead abstained. He said that a DUP MP had also abstained.Why would DUP MLAs and MPs prefer the somewhat odd pairing of Mr Poots and Mrs Bradley, rather than the more obvious right-wing ticket of Mr Poots and Mr Campbell  And why would traditionalist supporters of Mr Poots abstain in the deputy leadership vote rather than back a social conservative, Mr Campbell The answer explains what all of this has been about. This was about overthrowing what had become the DUP’s royal family, an elite who survived in powerful positions under dferent leaders, just as the Queen remains when the prime minister changes.Mr Campbell and Sir Jeffrey were seen as people less likely to shake things up.The one signicant word spoken by Mr Poots on his way into party headquarters yesterday was “reform”. That was the key element of his manesto. That was what his supporters believed he represents: A new broom who will transform how the DUP operates, and refresh its small centralised team of power-brokers.That explains why Ms Bradley signed the letter of no confidence in Mrs Foster even though, like Mrs Foster, she abstained in the Assembly vote on banning gay conversion therapy.Expect Mr Poots to talk tough but the key thing to watch is whether he acts tough.It will be hard for the minister who allowed his officials to build the Irish Sea border and who to this day allows them to operate it to suddenly adopt a radically dferent approach.It will be equally hard for the pragmatist who two years ago was willing to accept an Irish language act when even Sir Jeffrey Donaldson was opposing it to now suddenly recant on that commitment.Those issues remain unresolved in this contest, largely because both candidates were kept away from public scrutiny.Now they will have to be addressed. Reforming the DUP might be the easy part.:Sam McBride: Don’t assume Edwin Poots is more hardline than Sir Jeffrey Donaldson – the truth is more nuancedSam McBride: From his s, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson was seen as a future unionist leader – now might be his final chanceSam McBride: Is stolen Northern Bank cash in politics  Alarmingly, no one seems botheredDUP places gagging order on Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and Edwin Poots, banning them from discussing leadership contest publiclySam McBride: How Arlene Foster fell: Even as she dismissed the threat, the knives were being plungedAs Edwin Poots steps forward to contest DUP leadership, Peter Robinson urges cautionGone without a fight: Arlene Foster walks away as DUP MLA says clear out of party’s top brass requiredSam McBride: The most important firm in Northern Ireland you’ve probably never heard of – but are paying forSam McBride: On the streets and in Stormont, the next few months look bleak for Northern IrelandAnarchy on the Shankill as men and women urge children to riot, with no hint of political protestSam McBride: A failure of unionist diplomacy has left it more isolated than for decadesLeaked internal DUP minutes show fear of looming electoral collapse, and dismay at party’s directionBrandon Lewis interview: Denial of the Irish Sea border is gone as SoS says parts of frontier are being ditched for good——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityVale of Glamorgan council put forward Aberthaw, a recently closed coal-fired power plant, as a potential site for a fusion prototype.The UK government last year called for suggestions for possible sites to pioneer the technology which could generate electricity with low carbon emissions.But opposition councillors on the Vale council have claimed the cabinet has ldquorushed through its decision to suggest Aberthaw as a site.More NewsCardf Tomasz Waga murder investigation sees two more arrestedFour coffee shops in Penarth for meeting a friend outdoorsThings to do in South Wales on May Bank Holiday weekend Plaid Councillor Ian Johnson said: ldquoIt was strange that the council leadership did not consult with other parties or ask a cross-party scrutiny committee to consider issues before making the expression of interest about a possible future use of the Aberthaw plant.ldquoEven though it is an early point, many people will have questions about the technology, the impact of the development and the process, and discussing this in scrutiny would open up the debate and ensure transparency.Fusion technology is still in its infancy and no fusion reactor has ever created more power than it consumes. But scientists say it could be cleaner and safer than fission, the nuclear technology currently used to generate electricity.If Aberthaw is chosen, the council is hoping the power plant could bring lots of high-tech high-paid jobs to the region. Westminster should decide on a site by the end of next year, and the power plant would be built by , costing about pound billion.But the Valersquos cabinet used controversial emergency powers last month to put forward Aberthaw as a site, without consulting the full council or any scrutiny committees. Council leader Neil Moore said this was due to the deadline for suggestions at the end of last month.     However, Westminster made the initial call for suggestions in December last year, meaning the council had four months in total to debate and scrutinise the decision to put forward Aberthaw. The council debated the issue in a meeting this week, after the deadline passed.Conservative Cllr Gordon Kemp said: ldquoThis is being dealt effectively without allowing any proper consideration or scrutiny.

During my  years as a community campaigner I have passionately campaigned for education, creating more opportunities for young people, tackling the housing crisis and the climate crisis. I was the regeneration officer for the Loudoun Square and Trowbridge redevelopment, and was selected as the Wales delegate for the International Association for Community Development and Commonwealth Games in Glasgow . Over the last  years Irsquove supported young people in Cardf South and Penarth to develop their skills in the arts and creative industries and to participate in a wide range of opportunities. I successfully gained the London  Olympic Cultural Inspire Mark for Butetown Community. I entered politics because of the increasing injustice around me - increasing food banks, homelessness, education, climate crisis, lack of opportunity for our youth, lack of affordable housing I was sick and tired of our communities being treated like second class citizens by the London elite. I want a fair deal for our communities for Cardf South and Penarth and for Wales.Alan Golding - Freedom Alliance. No Lockdown. No CurfewsRaised in Tonyrefail, Rhondda Cynon Taff, I have since lived in Brighton and Glasgow, moving to Cardf in . Since my early twenties Irsquove been interested in the workings of society and how we treat each other, animals and our planethellip and in the process Irsquove come to completely mistrust virtually all career politicians. I believe a new way of doing politics is needed in Wales with a new set of values across the whole system. I donrsquot believe the current political structure and its controllers have the interest of the people at its heart with regard to their mental and physical health, their quality of le and spiritual and economic well-being.     Paul Campbell - UKIPHello Im Paul Campbell and Im standing in the Cardf South and South Wales Central area for UKIP in the Senedd elections on MAY TH.Being. Born in Cardf and lived most of my le there I appreciate the Greatv Potential the pride and the Welsh Identity in Cardf and the Valleys towns. and I have seen how things have changed over the years with parts of the area unrecognizable from the place I remember.Areas of Cardf have become run down and standards have fallen with a loss of community spirit The surrounding Towns have been neglected with. A lack of investment and job creation initiatives.Mass immigration in the UK has put tremendous strains on cities like Cardf Newport and Swansea with wage depression and overstretched public services.. The Conservatives claim to be in control of immigration but they will only ever talk about it and under there watch in the in the last  years  million more people have come to our shires thats  cities the sthe size of Cardf . Increasingly they are choosing to come to Wales as Labour has encouraged them by a making Wales a Nation Of sanctuary.Helen Westhead - Green PartyOur current administration has ignored the climate emergency and has left so many people vulnerable and excluded. As we recover from the pandemic we have unique opportunity to create better ways of working - the influence of an elected Green in the room will be transformative.We see from across the UK, Europe, and beyond the incredible dference Greens make, holding government to account, speaking out against inequality, and representing real people and their communities, not political or corporate interest. Wales is long overdue that representation in the Senedd.We know that the way we recover from this pandemic and build back stronger is through investing in communities and public services, ensuring everyone has access to local facilities, and supporting small business. If elected, one of my main priorities would be better walking and cycling routes, connected to affordable public transport and green outdoor spaces that communities can enjoy. Advocating for a Universal Basic Income would ensure no one is left behind in our bold plan to transform Wales.With the more proportional voting system on the regional ballot in Wales, Labour cannot win regional seats. A Green vote on your second ballot is the only progressive option.Matt Friend - PropelPropel has led the campaigns on two of the most important issues affecting Barry, Penarth and Cardf.Wersquore the only party that has committed not to allow any nuclear mud to be dumped in our waters, including the mud dredged from outside Hinkley nuclear reactor in Somerset.And wersquore the only party that even mentions the scandal of dangerous fire risk cladding on so many of our flats and buildings. Through our Contract with Wales we have committed not to issue new building contracts to any housing developer involved in the scandal, until they have paid to fix the problem they created.Wersquoll also end the way leaseholders are getting rinsed by introducing a service charge cap, linked to the Retail Price Index. That will stop the double digit increases in service charges that leaseholders have had to put up with.Most importantly, wersquoll introduce a Coronavirus Recovery Act to end Welsh lockdowns, save lives and restore freedoms. We canrsquot just hope wersquoll get our freedoms back, we have to vote for them.The ten laws in our Contract with Wales will transform our nation. Wales needs champions. Vote Propel.Alex Wilson, Liberal DemocratsI live with my family in Penarth and I became involved in politics because of the widening isions that seemed to occurring our community. I feel that with the Liberal Democrat core values of tolerance and understanding we can bring people back together. We can cut through the shouting of partisan politics and once again listen to what people want in their community.The next five years is going to be critical and I feel the Senedd must put recovery first. That means recovering from the Covid pandemic, the recovery of our economy, better healthcare services and a happier community which can be achieved by better transport links, saving our environment and ato community values.Irsquove been around long enough to know a political status-quo without a strong opposition can breed complacency. Wersquove seen this in national and local government. If I am elected I will ensure that the voice of the people is heard. If yoursquove ever wondered how we almost lost the Kymin or how they plan to build over  homes on contaminated land at Cosmeston Farm in Sully, well itrsquos because our current political leaders often lack empathy with local communities.Other candidates standing are:Vaughan Gething - LabourAngus Hawkins - Gwlad The Welsh Independence PartyLisa Peregrine ndash Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party Alan Pick ndash Reform UKDavid Rolfe ndash IndependentLeighton Rowlands ndash Conservative article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Otherwise a coalition must be attempted.:Who can vote Anyone over the age of  can vote in the Senedd election provided they are:- registered to do so- living in Wales- not legally excluded from votingThis is the first time  and -year-olds have been eligible to vote. What impact that has on the result remains to be seen.How do I vote There are three ways - in person, by post and by proxy - however, the deadlines for latter two options have already passed.Voting at the polling booth with take place until pm today.Polling stations will be kitted out with hand sanitiser and distancing markers to help voters remain safe from coronavirus.Most crucially, voters are being asked to bring their own pen or pencil.Face coverings must also be worn, unless exempt.How does the voting system work Each voter will have two votes - one constituency vote and one regional vote.Youll be represented in the Senedd by five Members. One for your constituency and four for the region of Wales where you live.Constituency vote - this is for the person you want to represent you and your local area. Wales has  constituencies, with each being represented by one MS in the Senedd. Constituency votes are counted in a first past the post system - so the candidate with the most votes is elected.     Regional vote - This is for who you want to represent your region of Wales - South Wales East, South Wales Central, South Wales West Mid and West Wales and North Wales. There are  regional Senedd Members, elected by the additional member system.When will results be announced As with a lot of things this past year, the election has been hit by Covid restrictions.While voting will happen today, counting will not take place the same night as is usually the case on election night.Instead, the votes will be taken to the counting locations and kept secure until morning.They will then be veried - spoiled ballots removed - and counted.Due to Covid restrictions, this will likely take longer than in normal counts, but results are expected within two days of polls closing.Keep an eye on the Argus website for the latest, and results. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He was just one of a kind and will be sorely missed.     Stuart was a good family man. He married Janet, a NHS nurse, and they had a wonderful daughter Rhinna, whom he absolutely adored.Sadly, during the last couple of years his health had deteriorated, though he made brave efforts to carry on trying to help the struggling rugby club. At the end of October he had a stroke while driving his car and ended up in hospital, where the Covid- lockdown prevented him from seeing his family for several months, which left him very upset and both Janet and Rhinna heartbroken. ldquoHe lost ten stones in weight and seemed to have aged  years in  days, explained his daughter.Thankfully, he was determined to see his loved ones and say goodbye, as Rhinna explained, so he resolutely battled against the odds, making sure he was able to see them by the end of April when the lockdown was relaxed.ldquoHe has waited for us,\" said Rhinna. \"We went to see him and mum said that he was waiting for us and his brother Keith to say goodbye.There is very little doubt Penarth RFC will never be the same without Stu Davies. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The modernisation plans will also support a further  jobs during construction and development. Located at the busy junction of Dromore Road and James Street, the store will occupy an entire space of , sq. metres – more than double the size of its existing store – which will include an expansive sales floor of , sq. metres. The planning application lodged with Fermanagh and Omagh District Council will see the demolition of a neighbouring pub and private dwelling to make way for the expansion on a site that will also incorporate a-space car park with two electric vehicle charging points and new, complementary landscaping. Construction plans encompass Lidl Northern Ireland’s bold ‘concept’ design which prioritises sustainability, spacious, wide aisles, long tills, restrooms, employee and baby-changing facilities which will dramatically enhance a high-quality shopping experience. The site will also include a large warehouse and improved employee welfare facilities. The application follows an extensive local consultation of the plans undertaken in September  which was positively received by local representatives and the wider community. Conor Boyle, regional director for Lidl Northern Ireland, said: “We are delighted to confirm plans for a replacement store in Omagh which will see the existing store at James Street in the town double in size to provide a dramatically-enhanced shopping experience and new jobs for the area. Centrally located in the west of the region, the Omagh store serves a burgeoning and thriving community base and is conveniently positioned next to the A which is a major primary route and commuter corridor. As a major investor in our communities and in our local economy, the Omagh store is an important location for us, and I am thrilled to reaffirm our commitment to the local area as part of this multimillion-pound investment. We hope to receive planning permission for the site in the coming weeks and we look forward to opening the brand new, state-of-the-art Lidl store later this year, bringing shoppers even more choice of quality products at unbeatable value.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ccbcbdbdfbffa   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_abdfabdfc   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
