We have a thorough and robust duty of care protocol. It is not the case that the production has abandoned Lottie. The production team has repeatedly offered her various forms of support which she has failed to respond to.‘The negative Press coverage stemmed from Lottie’s language to another candidate, not the actions of the production.’There are some, of course, who would say that it is all fair game —that once you sign up for a reality TV show you have to take whatever comes your way. ‘People have to be reminded that just because I have decided to put myself out there on television doesn’t mean I’m not human,’ says Lottie. ‘There’s criticism and then there’s abuse.‘The sad thing is that generally I really enjoyed the process — but the aftermath has been horrible.’This week, that process came to an on-screen end, when Lottie’s business plan for her ‘socially elite’ country club floundered in the face of a lack of detailed figures. It left finalists Carina and recruitment company owner Scarlett Allen Horton, 32, to battle it out for Lord Sugar’s £250,000 investment.Lottie was, at least, afforded a gracious exit. ‘It didn’t show this on-screen, but Lord Sugar told me that he felt I had taken part in the process five years too early and I think he was right,’ she says.Little chance of her going back for more, of course — those bridges are well and truly burned. Instead, she is trying to focus on moving forward with her business plan — and focusing on the positive. ‘Love it or loathe it, the Lottie Lion brand is pretty well known now,’ she says.Few could argue with that.

Meghan\u0027s new life as a royal was followed by an estrangement from her father Thomas Markle and then a reported rift, first between Kate and Meghan, and then William and Harry (pictured in 2017)In 2016, William was branded \u0027workshy William\u0027 for the number of engagements he carried out in combination with his part-time air ambulance pilot role, but dismissed the criticism as \u0027part of the job\u0027.Philip sparked controversy in January 2019 when he was involved in a serious car crash involving a mother and a baby.Meghan\u0027s new life as a royal was followed by an estrangement from her father Thomas Markle and then a reported rift, first between Kate and Meghan, and then William and Harry.The Sussexes moved to Frogmore Cottage in Windsor and split from the Royal Foundation, setting up their own charity.They faced accusations of hypocrisy in the summer of 2019 amid a row over their use of private jets despite speaking out on environmental issues.Their taxpayer-funded official tour of southern Africa in 2019 was overshadowed when the duchess launched legal action against a newspaper group and the duke delivered a scathing attack on the British press.In an emotional ITV documentary, Meghan admitted to feeling vulnerable and Harry did little to dispel reports of a rift by saying he loved William dearly but they were \u0027on different paths at the moment\u0027 and had \u0027good days\u0027 and \u0027bad days\u0027 in their relationship.It was the Duke of York\u0027s association with convicted sex offender Epstein that caused the worst crisis through the decade.In 2011, the Queen\u0027s second son quit his role as UK trade envoy after photos showed him visiting the disgraced financier in New York after Epstein\u0027s release from jail for soliciting a minor for prostitution.It also emerged that the duke\u0027s ex-wife Sarah, Duchess of York was given £15,000 by Epstein to help pay off her debts, just 18 months after he was released.Four years later, Andrew faced allegations in civil court papers in the US that he had sex on three separate occasions with Virginia Giuffre, when she was still a minor under US law.The duke categorically denied the claims.In November 2019, in the wake of Epstein killing himself in prison, Andrew\u0027s attempts to defend himself against Ms Giuffre\u0027s accusations and explain his friendship with Epstein in a BBC Newsnight interview were branded a \u0027car crash\u0027 and led to him withdrawing from public duties.He was widely criticised for failing to show remorse for his association with Epstein or empathy with Epstein\u0027s victims.Ms Giuffre, who claims she was trafficked by Epstein, gave an interview to BBC Panorama and said she was left \u0027horrified and ashamed\u0027 after an alleged sexual encounter with Andrew in London in 2001.She claimed she danced with Andrew in Tramp nightclub, adding he was \u0027the most hideous dancer I\u0027ve ever seen in my life\u0027 and \u0027his sweat was ... raining basically everywhere\u0027.The Twittersphere takeover continues and the era of the Instafamous celebrity:The 2010s will be remembered as the decade of the streaming wars, as television and film watching habits were altered forever.It has seen a shift from appointment-to-view television on the small screen and buying a ticket and popcorn at your local cinema, to consuming nearly everything on a hand-held device of some sort.Global streaming services like Netflix, Amazon, Apple TV+ and others claimed their stake in the watching habits of people all over the world - and in doing so changed the face of consumerism irrevocably.The launch of series like House Of Cards and Orange Is The New Black on Netflix gave rise to \u0027binge-watching\u0027 culture and the risque internet euphemism \u0027Netflix and chill\u0027 invaded popular vocabulary.Thanks to Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and Snapchat - launched in 2011 - celebrities found a new way to connect directly with their fans. Cue self-named fan groups including Miley Cyrus\u0027 Smilers, Beyonce\u0027s Beyhive, Lady Gaga\u0027s Little Monsters and Justin Bieber\u0027s Beliebers.         The launch of series like House Of Cards (pictured) and Orange Is The New Black on Netflix gave rise to \u0027binge-watching\u0027 culture and the risque internet euphemism \u0027Netflix and chill\u0027 invaded popular vocabularySocial media also gave rise to a new generation of entrepreneurs: the YouTubers and Influencers. In the digital space, harnessing and monetising a social media fanbase became a full-time job, with youngsters like Britain\u0027s Zoella (real name Zoe Sugg) and Swedish YouTuber star PewdiePie (real name Felix Kjellberg) becoming self-made millionaires.The newly harnessed social media collective also exposed the dark side of fame, with internet bullying and social media trolling taking centre stage.While the noughties became the breeding ground for reality TV and nabbing 15 minutes of fame, the next decade has felt the backlash of big brother-style viewing and its impact on the people whose lives were put under the TV microscope.As the decade ends, a duty of care towards reality TV contestants is the new catchphrase going forward, especially following the end of former daytime TV staples like The Jeremy Kyle Show. The programme was axed following the death of a guest, and fellow ITV show Love Island also came under increased scrutiny this year over the aftercare it offered following the deaths of former contestants Sophie Gradon and Mike Thalassitis.While some reality TV careers waned, none became stronger in the last decade than that of The Kardashian collective. The American family - Kris Jenner and her daughters Kim, Kylie, Khloe, Kendall and Kourtney - have owned the last decade as their empire expanded beyond the borders of their E! series.Musical breakthroughs Ed Sheeran and Adele storm to chart-topping success:The British invasion of music continued in the 2010s with artists such as Adele and Ed Sheeran becoming some of the biggest acts in the world.Singer-songwriter Sheeran was named number one artist of the decade by the Official Charts Company for having 12 number ones across the singles and album charts in the UK between 2010 and 2019, more than any other artist. He has also spent the most weeks in the top spot across both charts over the decade, at 79 weeks.One of the most exciting genres of music to stake a claim on the charts in recent years is grime, the British electronic and hip-hop style that originated in London. Stormzy, Wiley and Skepta are among the artists who have helped grime enter the mainstream. Stormzy also made history in 2019 as the first black British solo artist ever to headline Glastonbury Festival.              The British invasion of music continued in the 2010s with artists such as Adele (left) and Ed Sheeran (right) becoming some of the biggest acts in the worldThe last decade has been huge in terms of celebrity romances, with some now-classic couples getting together and many others splitting up.Perhaps the most memorable split of them all came when Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin not only ended their marriage but also added a new turn of phrase to the modern popular lexicon when they announced they were to \u0027consciously uncouple\u0027.The amiable term caught on and it has now become a staple when people talk about their own break-ups. There were a handful of other major celebrity splits too, including Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes and Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck.There was some good news romantically, though, as some of the most popular star couples were formed over the past 10 years, including George and Amal Clooney, Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds and John Legend and Chrissy Teigen.#MeToo movement and focus on ersity in film and TV sees evil moguls fall:Diversity and inclusion have become buzzwords in recent years, with more and more broadcasters and people behind the scenes taking notice.On TV the BBC is among the organisations highlighting moves to make changes, hiring June Sarpong in a newly created role of director of creative ersity and offering shows such as Famalam and RuPaul\u0027s Drag Race UK.Jodie Whittaker also became the first woman to play the Time Lord in Doctor Who.However many broadcasters are still working to meet their ersity and inclusion targets as we go into the next decade.The BBC has attracted criticism since 2017 when the salaries of its highest paid stars were made public at the command of the Government. Talent such as Gary Lineker, Chris Evans and Graham Norton were revealed to be among the corporation\u0027s highest earners, while the BBC also faced a challenge from its former China editor Carrie Gracie.Gracie resigned from her position in January 2018 in protest at pay inequalities at the broadcaster, becoming a figurehead for other women after she made the announcement in an open letter.       On the big screen, many stars and creators have spoken out about the lack of ersity in cinema, particularly in terms of female voices and representation of people of colour. Marvel\u0027s Black Panther in 2018 was a major moment in Hollywood and the film was praised for having a predominantly black cast with a powerful message.But perhaps the most prominent cultural shift in Hollywood came in late 2017 following sexual assault allegations against leading film producer Harvey Weinstein. A number of major stars were among those who stepped out with claims against the mogul, including Angelina Jolie, Gwyneth Paltrow, Rose McGowan, Cara Delevingne and Lupita Nyong\u0027o, prompting the Time\u0027s Up campaign and the #MeToo movement, which encouraged people to share their own experiences of harassment to raise awareness.Since then, women in the industry have demanded equality across all jobs, and other names have faced allegations of sexual misconduct since Weinstein, who denies all accusations of non-consensual sex.The 2010s saw the deaths of a large number of major Hollywood, music and TV stars, with perhaps the most shocking year being 2016 when David Bowie, Prince, George Michael, Victoria Wood, Alan Rickman, Carrie Fisher, Caroline Aherne and Sir Terry Wogan died.Other deaths that shook fans were Amy Winehouse in 2011, Whitney Houston in 2012, Paul Walker in 2013, Robin Williams in 2014, Sir Bruce Forsyth in 2017, and Luke Perry and Keith Flint in 2019."},{"url":null,"title":"54 000 evacuate Italian city experts diffuse British WWII bomb","story":"Share this article At around 6.30am mayor Riccardo Rossi sat alongside emergency service chiefs inside a \u0027situation room\u0027 where drone footage was relayed of the bomb disposal robot at work.Adding to the complications the explosive had been damaged last month when it was discovered by construction workers.Experts from the military and the fire brigade took around 40 minutes to extract the fuse from the historic war bomb.Sources from the fire brigade told local media that the bomb had been successfully defused and would take it to a local quarry tomorrow to blow it up.

Here, Fiona Noble looks back on the year and, below, our pick of 2019 in each age groupChildren’s books have never been more relevant, echoing the big issues of the day. Titles about mental health and emotions are everywhere, from Sam Copeland and illustrator Sarah Horne’s funny Charlie Changes Into a Chicken (Puffin) and Rebecca Westcott’s Can You See Me? (Scholastic) – whose co-author is 11-year-old Libby Scott, a girl with autism – to Bryony Gordon’s teenage self-help guide You Got This (Wren \u0026amp Rook). Michael Morpurgo and Onjali Q Rauf were among those addressing the refugee crisis in Boy Giant (HarperColllins) and The Boy at the Back of the Class (Orion) respectively, while Malorie Blackman’s return to the world of Noughts \u0026amp Crosses in Crossfire (Penguin) combined taut thriller with themes of racism, ision and media bias.For a generation growing up with Greta Thunberg and climate strikes, saving the planet will be 2020’s lead story in children’s books, foreshadowed this year by Greta and the Giants (Frances Lincoln), written by Zoe Tucker and illustrated by Zoe Persico, Neal Layton’s A Planet Full of Plastic (Wren \u0026amp Rook) and Lily Dyu’s Earth Heroes (Nosy Crow), illustrated by Jackie Lay. In a world where news cycles and social media expose children to current events as never before, these are books that reflect reality and offer young readers, parents and teachers a place to explore.The cultural impact of children’s books resonated far beyond bookshops this year. The RSC’s musical adaptation of The Boy in the Dress by David Walliams is a smash hit, and after a decade of Christmas Day BBC animations, Julia Donaldson and Axel Scheffler are a veritable festive tradition (this year it’s The Snail and the Whale). Meanwhile, Jack Thorne’s eagerly anticipated adaptation of Philip Pullman’s His Dark Materials debuted to rapturous reviews. In July, How to Train Your Dragon author Cressida Cowell became the new children’s laureate and is already proving to be a formidable advocate of literacy, pursuing with enormous energy her “laureate’s charter” to improve access to books and to make school libraries mandatory.Finally, we bid farewell to two giants of children’s literature. John Burningham, who died in January, was a double Kate Greenaway medal winner, delighting readers from the 1960s onwards with the wit, warmth and imagination of works such as Borka and Mr Grumpy’s Outing. Judith Kerr’s debut, The Tiger Who Came to Tea, celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2018, beloved to generations of readers along with the Mog series and titles such as When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit. She died in May, just a week after she was named illustrator of the year at the British book awards. Fiona NobleWhether focusing on faraway places or far-out people, dangerous dinosaurs or polluting plastic, nonfiction picture books for the very young have flourished in recent years, and this year’s crop really had the wow factor.Fausto Gilberti has managed to bottle the wild spirit of some of the world’s greatest artists in his cheekily titled biographical series comprising (to date) Jackson Pollock Splashed Paint and Wasn’t Sorry and Yves Klein Painted Everything Blue and Wasn’t Sorry (Phaidon). In each book, the Italian author and illustrator combines inky black and white with a single pop of colour (blue for Yves Klein, egg-yolk yellow for Pollock), while his bug-eyed, zany artists recall the Minions from Despicable Me but with art history degrees and sharp suits.The books may end with an example of artwork and a more traditional biography but they’re not solely for art-loving children and families they celebrate iniduality and creative self-expression.“Be proud of your mad ideas, kids!”, Gilberti seems to say, as he imagines Pollock splashing paint while doing somersaults or cycling. “When he painted,” Gilberti writes, “his heart would beat like a drum and he could not stay still.”Picasso said: “Every child is an artist. The problem is how to remain an artist once he grows up,” and Gilberti captures perfectly the elements from the creative lives of these adults that will really tickle children. We hear how Klein dressed as a knight for his wedding, once released 1,001 balloons into the sky, and gave his gallery guests blue drinks that “made their pee blue, too!” Watch out for Yayoi Kusama Covered Everything in Dots and Wasn’t Sorry next year.The subject matter may be very different, but the pages of Sabina Radeva’s On the Origin of Species (Puffin) also vibrate with life and feeling. Radeva trained as a molecular biologist before quitting to study illustration, and her acclaimed debut combines these two worlds. Her retelling of Darwin’s seminal study doesn’t shy away from the complexity of his research, often quoting him directly but her beautiful drawings, which seem to crawl and canter out of the book’s spine, are so colourful and expressive that pre-schoolers as well as juniors should find it enriching.Picture books about the climate crisis were everywhere this year, and while some struck the right tone (inspiring rather than panicking the very young) it was Oliver Jeffers’s exquisite fable The Fate of Fausto (Harper Collins), sparked by a visit to the wild north coast of Antrim, that felt like the greatest hymn to nature. Made using zesty colours and traditional lithographic printmaking techniques, it’s an essential buy for picture book lovers aged five to 85.It was a year full of fantastic fiction. Sophie Dahl’s grandfather would have loved the adventurous girl at the heart of her debut children’s book, Madame Badobedah (Walker), while there was an air of the old man himself in Abi Elphinstone and Fiona Woodcock’s The Snow Dragon (Simon \u0026amp Schuster). This extended picture book features a “word-mangling” seven-year-old called Phoebe, who longs to escape the orphanage of the Trunchbull-esque Griselda Bone. When her snowman transforms into a snow dragon that takes her on a Christmas Eve journey, it’s reminiscent of Raymond Briggs’s The Snowman.Woodcock uses blown-ink to create snow-dusted, dreamlike images that give this sweet, uplifting tale a unique look.Little hands that love opening letters will also enjoy two of the year’s wittiest interactive books. For fans of the bestselling The Day the Crayons Quit, Drew Daywalt’s The Crayons’ Christmas (pictures by Oliver Jeffers Harper Collins) has festive mail from the crayons who have flown the nest (well, stationery cupboard), while Emma Yarlett’s vibrant Beast Feast (Walker) features RSVPs to a monster’s gruesome party. Like so many of this year’s best books, it will have children giggling with delight long after their Christmas dinner.Children’s fiction abounds with special powers and alternative worlds. Mutter an incantation, then, to magic away the top layer of bestselling children’s books at this time of year – the Walliamses, the Wimpy Kids and Dork Diaries, the Christmasaurus and David Baddiel. It will reveal a rather different terrain. This is a land less formulaic and more erse than the bestseller lists, packed with dazzling inventiveness, expert storytellers and series with resonance.You can’t really describe Katherine Rundell as a rising star any more, so fixed is she in the kid-lit firmament. Rundell flexed her historical thriller muscle in The Good Thieves (Bloomsbury), which pitted a young British girl and an unlikely alliance of streetwise youngsters and circus performers against New York gangsters and crooked politicians: justice was served with relish.Relative newcomer Sophie Anderson segued seamlessly from her previous hit, The House With Chicken Legs, into another book inspired by Russian folk tales, The Girl Who Speaks Bear (Usborne), and remained at the forefront of the zeitgeist for frosty, Russia-themed books. Who you really are and where you really belong are evergreen themes she explores well.Two more maestros of children’s fiction with moral compasses just as finely tuned remained surefire reads. Frank Cottrell-Boyce’s latest was Runaway Robot (Macmillan), a madcap escapade starring a boy and a delusional bot. Ross Welford’s The Dog Who Saved the World (HarperCollins), meanwhile, featured a canine plague, time travel and refreshing originality.Rock solid is Eoin Colfer, whose long-awaited comeback, The Fowl Twins (HarperCollins), found the kid brothers of Artemis Fowl laying their own thrilling trail of destruction (they narrowly avoid sinking Amsterdam). In this universe of armed fairies and inquisitorial nuns, tech and magic are the same thing, but you are never more than a few paragraphs away from a belly laugh.The doyenne of British children’s fiction, Jacqueline Wilson, never disappoints. We Are the Beaker Girls (Doubleday) was the second instalment in the new lives of the grownup Tracy Beaker and her daughter, Jess, a story about new beginnings and unexpected challenges.If those names are familiar, more deserve to be. A continuing success this year was 2018’s The Boy at the Back of the Class (Hachette) by Onjali Q Raúf, which won the Waterstones children’s book prize. Raúf’s follow-up was The Star Outside My Window (Hachette), which tackled the aftermath of domestic violence with a shining innocence.Authors from BME backgrounds should not have to write solely about society’s failings, however, so three cheers for Little Badman and the Invasion of the Killer Aunties (Puffin), by comedians Humza Arshad and Henry White and illustrated by Aleksei Bitskoff, and the vivid subcontinental adventure that was Asha and the Spirit Bird (Chicken House), the magic realist debut from Jasbinder Bilan.One book really stayed with me long after I finished it, however. Newcomer Darren Simpson’s debut, Scavengers (Usborne), seems set in a different world with its own language and customs. But the reader’s realisation dawns – alongside that of Simpson’s protagonist, a youngster called Landfill – that Hinterland, the only home he knows, is not what it seems. Things are not exactly as he’s been told by Babagoo, his strict but affectionate protector, either, a cantankerous soul given to expletives such as “flaming brownberries!” The discovery of where puppies come from throws young Landfill for a loop. Parents, though, will smile at a “woofler” called Orwell and a “mowler” called Atwood.Simpson skilfully avoids hammering any point home, but this emotive coming-of-age tale queries love and loyalty, our throwaway society, and what exactly it is that walls keep out and in. That’s a lot to pack into what is, at heart, a hard-to-put-down tale of tweenage derring-do.In Poems to Fall in Love With (Macmillan), the former children’s laureate Chris Riddell lets loose: cupids cavort with hearts, roses and embracing couples. His drawings seem blown speedily across the pages as if by a spring breeze. But the pleasure and surprise is that the poems themselves are not light as candyfloss. This is a stupendously well-chosen, feelgood anthology in which even feel-bad poems feel good. The Emilys (Brontë and Dickinson), Auden, Keats and Yeats rub shoulders with – and sometimes shed tears alongside – contemporary writers and unfamiliar poems.I was particularly touched and taken aback by novelist Neil Gaiman’s Wedding Thoughts: All I Know About Love, with its insights into not knowing affected by the embattled sorrow of Jan Dean’s Tomorrow when you will not wake and delighted by Grace Nichols’s Like a Flame, a poem of flaring passion. This little book is a must-have, with poems that make you feel more alive. As Wendy Cope concludes in The Orange:I did all the jobs on my listAnd enjoyed them and had some time over.I love you. I’m glad I exist.Three collections about nature deserve a warm mention: Poems from a Green and Blue Planet (Hodder) is a generous anthology, discerningly edited by Sabrina Mahfouz with a magpie’s eye for sparkling gems new and old. I was thrilled to see William Blake’s Eternity included. It is the most exquisite poem Blake ever wrote (although I’m not precisely sure how the message about letting go relates to our planet’s future).Moonstruck! (Otter-Barry) is a sweet sliver of a book (more new than full) with a gathering of accessible, unloony tunes. Celia Warren’s Poor Old Phoebe! empathises with a “trodden upon” moon that “still shines in poets lines” – and the book confirms this as poets marvel from a distance or are chummily familiar.Joseph Coelho’s A Year of Nature Poems (Wide Eyed Editions) is a beguiling poetic calendar – meticulously written, sophisticated and novel. The best anthologies work beautifully precisely because they are not for children in any strict sense. Many of the poems were written for adults but have been judged understandable enough to be read by children. It is this unpatronising, flatteringly grown-up approach that cultivates, early on, a real feeling for poetry.Shakespeare for Every Day of the Year (Macmillan) is a more questionable idea (do we want Shakespeare in soundbites?) but it is persuasively pulled off in this daily dose of soliloquies, sonnets and snippets from plays. The book is nicely edited by Allie Esiri (like its predecessors A Poem for Every Night of the Year and A Poem for Every Day of the Year) and what distinguishes it are its fascinating, scholarly prefaces (Professor Michael Dobson should take a bow). A lucky dip for all ages and a handsome Christmas ersion.The Riddell family rules the poetic roost this year. The “tasty” poems in Midnight Feasts (Bloomsbury Education) have been chosen by AF Harrold and illustrated by Chris Riddell’s daughter Katy – a talented chip off the old block. This moreish anthology – a menu of poetic snacks – is illustrated with beguiling, gentle humour. Christopher Reid’s Rabbit is a perfect example of the book’s charm. He maintains: “People who say the Rabbit has no song are wrong.” What rabbits celebrate is: “The Ballad of Salad”. Riddell’s rabbit has a priceless expression at the bottom right-hand side of the page – caught in the act – a lettuce leaf hanging from his mouth, helplessly involved in munching.The Hate U Give made Angie Thomas one of the biggest names in young adult fiction. Her second novel, On the Come Up (Walker), is set in the same universe, charting 16-year-old Bri’s aspiring rap career. Thomas tackles gritty topics, among them prejudice, poverty and racism, but is such a smart, funny and perceptive writer that there is no sense of her being heavy-handed. Her relationships, both familial and otherwise, feel authentic and full of humanity.Frances Hardinge is among the most original writers working today and Deeplight (Macmillan) one of her finest books yet. Here, her dazzling imagination has conjured the Myriad archipelago, a strange world of undersea gods, lush mythology and Lovecraftian submersibles. Two very human boys, orphans turned scavengers, make a dangerous discovery that drives a thrilling and unpredictable plot. She’s a writer who defies easy categorisation this will entice older children and far beyond.William Sutcliffe provides some much-needed comic relief in The Gifted, the Talented and Me (Bloomsbury), a deft satire on modern family life with shades of Adrian Mole. Happily average Sam moves to Hampstead with his newly rich family and finds himself utterly out of place at the North London Academy for the Gifted and Talented. More funny books for teenagers is high on my wishlist for 2020.Next, three outstanding and very different debuts to look out for. Murder mysteries were the year’s big ticket in young adult fiction. Holly Jackson’s A Good Girl’s Guide to Murder (Electric Monkey), set in the English town of Little Kilton, follows a sixth-former studying a notorious local crime for a school project. Not as slick as its American counterparts, perhaps, but the snappy title, addictive plotting and small-town secrets made it the bestselling debut of the year.Liz Hyder’s Bearmouth (Pushkin) is both bold and ambitious, written in an unusual first-person, phonetic dialect. The book takes place in the dark claustrophobia of Bearmouth mine, where workers are cowed by hard labour and religious indoctrination. In this nightmarish world, naive protagonist Newt is unsettled by a newcomer’s talk of “revolushun”. Hyder is a writer of considerable potential.Another remarkable new voice is Akwaeke Emezi, already acclaimed for their (the personal pronoun Emezi prefers to use) adult novel Freshwater. Pet (Faber) is set in the American town of Lucille, in a world almost like ours. Here, the revolution has been and gone and with it a purging of evil and corruption. Or so it seems, until the day a creature of horns and claws emerges from a painting and tells 15-year-old Jam that he is there to hunt a monster. A timely, nuanced book about the monsters living in plain sight.Finally, a winter classic to savour over the darkest days of the year. Susan Cooper’s famous The Dark Is Rising (Puffin), first published in the 1970s, has been reissued with a new introduction by Robert Macfarlane. On midwinter’s day, Will awakes to an ancient winter landscape and learns that he is one of the “Old Ones”, tasked with holding back the Dark at the potent time around the winter solstice.In his introduction, Macfarlane recalls first reading the book as a teenager in the 1980s, gripped by fear of nuclear apocalypse. Today’s fears, he writes, may be different but “the dark is always rising and the work of the greatest stories is to hold it back”.• To order any of these books for a special price, click on the titles or go to bookshop"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/731e08aff009585dd2647be537727deb9f5ff758/0_96_3591_2154/master/3591.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=edccf488c9817025d53086c3228f6504","title":"what matters is how the tories use their new found power","story":"A splurge of investment is needed in long-forgotten smaller towns such as Burnley and StokeFifteen years ago the idea of the prime minister paying a weekend visit to Sedgefield would have attracted little or no media interest. That, though was when Tony Blair was in Downing Street and represented the County Durham seat as its MP.When Boris Johnson turned up on Blair’s old patch on Saturday it was very big news indeed because Sedgefield is now coloured blue on the political map of Britain. In large parts of the country, from Blyth Valley to Bolsover, working-class communities have abandoned Labour and turned to the Conservatives. The Tories are the party of the working classes.There will be plenty of time to trawl through what went wrong for Labour as the party conducts its post-mortem examination into the result over the coming weeks and months. The reason there’s no great hurry is because defeat by such a thumping margin last Thursday means the Conservatives are going to be in power for at least the next five years, perhaps longer.As Torsten Bell, the director of the Resolution Foundation, put it: “This result is so bad for Labour because it’s happening when the economic and political cycle should mean Labour romping home. Official oppositions don’t often lose 59 seats – they’re generally in the business of whittling down a government’s majority or seizing power themselves.”That’s all true. What it means is that, for now at least, what Labour says or thinks about anything is neither here nor there. What matters is what the Conservatives do with their new-found power.Remainers who have been tin-eared to the anger among Leave voters that the result of the referendum had not been honoured now have to reconcile themselves to the fact that Brexit is going to happen at the end of next month. The strategy of trying to keep Britain in the EU has proved to be a catastrophic failure on many levels. It has eroded the public’s faith in democracy it has guaranteed that the UK has a harder Brexit than would otherwise have been the case: and it has shattered the blue-collar, white-collar coalition Labour has always relied on to win elections. This is a spectacular hat-trick of own goals that provides Johnson with the opportunity to build on the Tory advances in what what were previously Labour fiefdoms.Which is what he is now planning to do. The Tory manifesto made only modest tax and spending pledges but the need for the new Government to deliver on the prime minister’s one-nation rhetoric means the budget planned for February will be expansionary and targeted specifically at the less prosperous parts of Britain.An ambitious post-election budget runs counter to the received political wisdom that new administrations should take the earliest opportunity in any parliament to take tough decisions, on the grounds that it gets bad news out of the way early. But in this case, it is justified on both economic and political grounds.A fiscal boost would be appropriate for an economy that is flat on its back after three months in which activity has either declined or stayed the same. Politically, Johnson needs to show voters in seats the Tories gained that he wants a long-term relationship and not just a one-night stand. There will be modest cuts in national insurance contributions but the chancellor, Sajid Javid, has the leeway under his borrowing rules to invest more in public infrastructure than was promised in the manifesto. Expect him to use it, because it takes time for capital spending to have an impact. If Johnson wants voters to notice the difference at the next election there is little time to delay.That said, the Conservatives need to think carefully about how they spend the money. Weekend reports have suggested that NHS budget increases will be enshrined in law and an extra £78bn of transport spending for the north of England.But the common factor linking the seats Johnson won last week is how cut off they are. The trend has been for local hospitals to be closed in towns and small cities, with services concentrated in the metropolitan centres. Patients that have seen their hospital closed often face long and expensive journeys on a transport system that has prioritised road and rail projects that help big cities the most.So, it won’t be enough for the government to announce plans to spend more on teaching hospitals in Leeds and Manchester, or to continue finding more money to pay for HS2. There needs to be investment at a local level: in community health budgets and in local transport links.There’s one final piece to the jigsaw. Some of the most savage cuts in the past decade have been to budgets for further education. Universities have not had it easier either, but by comparison they have got off lightly. The towns and small cities that don’t have universities have – as with health and transport spending – come off worse. Spending more money – a lot more money – on vocational training is key to regeneration.Will this happen? It might, because the lesson the Tories have learnt from Scotland is that once Labour supporters stop voting out of tribal loyalty there is no guarantee they will come back. Johnson is not going to make it easier for Labour to win back seats it lost last Thursday by opting for an economic policy based on free-market ideology. Instead, the plan is to offer an interventionist economic policy – more public spending and a higher minimum wage – with a tougher approach to crime and immigration.Ignored for so long, people living in what was once Labour’s “red wall” are going to be in the unfamiliar position of finding both main parties bidding for their support."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bfc52f364a5bd60e24269d8c865961e1a033c4e4/0_65_2242_1345/master/2242.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=55159f7b753c40a06a15f94767a866f1","title":"unions colluded in fiction corbyns plan never win power","story":"So, although more than 17 million people voted for parties that wanted a second referendum compared with fewer than 15 million who did not, on 31 January Britain will leave the EU on Boris Johnson’s terrible deal. What he presents as an irrefutable, unarguable validation of Brexit is in truth a democratic travesty. When Brexit goes wrong, as it will, there will be a reckoning – if a sufficiently viable opposition exists to force it.Tactical voting had some successes, but so precipitate was the drop in the Labour vote and so resilient the Tory one that it was overwhelmed. Looking back, it is obvious that the Labour party should have joined the Remain alliance to avoid splitting the Remain vote, and its point-blank refusal to do so should not have been accepted so tamely.The country would have been voting for what it needs: staying in the EU at a perilous moment in world trade in order to secure vital economic growth, while launching a wholesale programme of national reconstruction and the resetting of its broken capitalism. The Tory party – not the Labour party – would be facing questions over its purpose and future.But even to write this paragraph is to recognise its impossibility. Simple majoritarianism is embedded in our political culture, and it was never going to be challenged by Jeremy Corbyn, in this context a supreme conservative, and a significant part of the Labour party. Instead, the mission on 12 December was to seek a mandate in a winner-take-all system for their radical socialist manifesto. The building of a broad coalition in today’s very particular circumstances, along with the overt political compromises, was not the political project. It was anathema, particularly to the sect that had won control of the Labour party.The paradox is that, had the party had an electable would-be prime minister it would not have needed the Remain alliance. The double paradox is that had Corbyn been part of it and thus potential leader of even a putative interim government, its vote share would have noseed. Our country may be quietly liberal, tolerant and good-natured – but it is also quietly and deeply patriotic. For too many, particularly in the working class, a vote for an apologist for the IRA and Hamas, an indulger of antisemitism and a convinced pacifist was an unpatriotic, anti-British act – however much they might sympathise with the direction of economic and social policy.Johnson might be a narcissist, a twister, a liar and a toff – but in his witty one-liners and breezy optimism they recognised him, however rogue and untrustworthy, as a member of the English officer class, on the battlefield, at least. Corbyn, in contrast, would have been at home as a conscientious objector. You can respect that position. But a majority of the British will never elect such a man their prime minister.A more surefooted Labour movement would have recognised this brutal truth from the beginning. Time was when the leadership of the trade unions, genuinely in touch with popular values, would have simply vetoed Corbyn’s candidature – or seen their error and dispatched him and his coterie. In this respect, Len McCluskey and the group at the top of Unite who backed Corbyn so uncompromisingly are also part of the crisis now engulfing Labour.They did so because they believed he would lead them to the promised socialist land – of which the 2019 manifesto was the quintessential expression, although on Friday McCluskey said it contained an “incontinent rush of policies”. I do not doubt Corbyn’s decency and his devotion to peace. But if you want to win a British general election with our toxic rightwing press, the precondition is a plausible leader and a feasible programme of government. Corbyn and Corbynism were neither. The danger now is that his followers will take no responsibility for what happened, lionise him as a martyred messiah and turn the 2019 manifesto into an unchallengeable icon. It is no such thing. It is true that no member of the liberal left can seriously challenge its laudable ends – a much more equal society, a transformation of our economic base to meet the environmental emergency and radically improved public services based on inclusion and universalism. But the trouble was the means. This was an indiscriminate, fantastically expensive statist push on all fronts – alongside some measures, like wholesale semi-confiscatory nationalisation, unnecessary to achieve the stated ends. There was no recognition that a vibrant, purpose-driven private sector is an indispensable part of any economic structure – and no attempt was offered to conjure it into being. Instead, the state and its agencies were to become Britain’s economic drivers. It stretched credibility to the limits.All this can and must be recast, especially as Johnson attempts to develop a wholly unthought-through “one-nation” prospectus, while preserving the powerful nexus of private equity and hedge fund operators who prey so destructively on British business and finance. They are his funders. Labour – and the Lib Dems who once again mistakenly retreated from a substantive critique of Britain’s capitalist structures – must have a credible alternative.Nor must the Corbyn clique be allowed to blame Brexit for the cataclysm. There are two million more Remainers than Leavers, the Tories own the Leave vote and Brexit is about to become deeply unpopular as it becomes clear that Johnson’s promises lead to the hardest of Brexits, with the spate of plant closures and disinvestment accelerating. Nor is there a majority in the country for a one-sided trade deal with the US. The right position in both principle and practice is to remain pro-EU, even though the country may be hyper-weary of the Brexit deadlock.Equally, Labour must be constitutionally creative. The Corbynite proposition that all Scotland wanted was Corbyn-style socialism was total nonsense. Only a full-blooded new federal deal has the remotest chance of saving the union – and enfranchising left-behind England.Is any of this possible? It may be that the McCluskey, Momentum and Corbynite hold on Labour is impossible to challenge. In which case it will be broken as an electoral force. Parties do not have God-given rights to prosper. Nor do countries. Britain, like declining civilisations before it, could be locked in an irresistible downward vortex.

In one sweep – on a clear night – the weather satellite can see the whole national park, from the forests in the south near Scarborough to the heather-covered moorland just south-east of Middlesbrough.When Richard Darn walks these hills – on a clear night – he can’t quite make out NOAA-20 as it scurries from pole to pole because the skyglow from Middlesbrough pollutes the darkness. Yet down in the southern forests, the night sky is pristine and ideal for satellite spotting. Places with truly dark skies like this are shrinking. In the areas where you can see why the ancients decided that a group of stars looked like a great bear, or scorpion, or Orion the hunter, the faintest dots of the constellations are being drowned in skyglow, or winked out by a brash neon sign or stray security light.The North York Moors National Park authority is concerned about this. On Monday, it will decide whether to commit £50,000 to a “dark skies” plan, to identify where those signs and security lights could be tweaked or shielded.Darn is an astronomer who hosts stargazing parties and works with several national parks, including the North York Moors, on dark sky conservation. “My personal feeling is that light pollution is significantly worse,” he says. “It’s not so much street lighting, it’s all the other ancillary light – supermarket car parks, lumberyards, industrial plants or even people’s houses.”“These days, people erect two or three of these absolutely searingly bright white LEDs. We don’t realise the profound effects it’s having, putting up light domes over small farms or villages – places that had no light dome before – and transforming the night-time scene from something quite beautiful into something numbingly banal.”The national park authority’s plan is to do a “lighting audit” of farms, pubs, campsites and other premises to improve the darkest areas, says Mike Hawtin, a senior park officer. It will potentially offer grants of up to £2,500 – funded by Sirius Minerals, a local mining company – if it decides lighting needs to be replaced or shielded.Why is darkness so important? Stargazing is a vital human activity, according to Darn, and listening to him talk makes it hard not to share his enthusiasm for watching shooting stars and the expanse of the Milky Way, or knowing where to find the Andromeda galaxy.“Where we live in space is as profound as where you live in the country or Europe or the globe,” he says. “You can see miraculous things, and you start to think of how long the light’s been travelling to get to your eye. And if you weren’t out there, if you weren’t somewhere dark, you wouldn’t see them.”But the soothing effect of watching the heavens is not the only reason why dark skies are being embraced by the national parks of the North York Moors, Northumberland, the South Downs and the Yorkshire Dales. There is growing evidence that lighting up the night is affecting bioersity and the welfare of creatures both nocturnal and diurnal, while also leading to insomnia and other health issues for humans.“These aren’t trivial shifts – these are similar kinds of scales of shift as climate change produces,” says Kevin Gaston, a professor of bioersity and conservation, who runs the Ecolight project at Exeter University’s Environment and Sustainability Institute.Huge numbers of species use daylight information as a clock, Gaston says. So birds may decide to migrate or lay eggs at a particular time of year, based on how much light there is. If they arrive too soon, before insect populations have boomed, they risk starvation. “The cues you might be using to decide when to lay your eggs and for nestings to emerge may be increasingly disconnected from when the food that you want to feed those chicks is actually available,” he says.It’s not just birds. Turtle hatchlings can be disoriented by skyglow and move away from the sea. Insects attracted to light are easier prey, which unbalances ecosystems. The International Dark-Sky Association lists more than 2,600 studies on the impacts of artificial light on clownfish, mice, worms, bats, coral reefs, katydids and tree sparrows.Even short periods of light can have an impact. Memorial light beams at the site of the World Trade Center in New York are shone on one day a year, 11 September, but they lure as many as 160,000 migratory birds off course, circling the beams. Now they are switched off periodically to let the birds disperse. There’s also evidence that the brighter, bluer street lights that replaced the orange glow of low-sodium lighting of the 1970s and 80s are having an impact on humans. A study in South Korea last year found an association between artificial light at night and the prescription of sleeping pills. There is already provision for local authorities to tackle light pollution, but they often lack the resources to do much about it, according to Emma Marrington of CPRE, the countryside charity. “Lighting can be a statutory nuisance in the same way that noise is,” she says. “So you can complain if you’ve got a real issue with the neighbours’ security light, for example. The environmental health team should support you in monitoring the lighting and then mediating.”CPRE runs an annual star count, encouraging people to check light pollution in their area by asking how many of Orion’s stars they can see. “If you can see fewer than 10, you’re under severe light pollution but if it’s more than 30 you’ve got pristine night skies,” Marrington says.Yet even people in cities can still find decent conditions to see events such as the annual Geminids meteor shower, which peaked is due to peak on the night of 14-15 December this year. “You don’t need to travel thousands of miles to see the Milky Way or shooting stars,” Darn says. “Sometimes just taking a walk in your local wood at night gives you an improvement straight away. You might not have a pristine dark sky, but you can have a night sky that’s really aesthetically beautiful.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96545f22217ecf75ceb2365071b9e42d35791374/0_114_3432_2059/master/3432.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0cc1699e14c0e7800095bbe5f40d2aec","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"The pick of the best flora and fauna photos from around the world, from an illuminated giraffe to an elusive southern elephant seal"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1317c43ee0561506bf7b0e66e17bd7eebc368ad7/448_131_2238_1343/master/2238.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db34060c409f43e9c00888c4e4a5c5c1","title":"anna karina an actor of easy charm and grace whose presence radiated from the screen","story":"From her landmark early films with Jean-Luc Godard to later work such as The Nun, Karina’s beauty and charisma shone outIt was Anna Karina’s fate, or curse, to be perpetually described as an “icon” or a “muse”: a devastatingly beautiful figurehead and inspiration-figure to all those male directors doing the creating or critics doing the rhapsodising – one male director-cineaste in particular. She certainly was every bit as beautiful as everyone ceaselessly said, but it was her easy charm, intelligence and grace which made that beauty visible and made it exist. It was the kind of acting talent that made her whole style and address to the camera look easy, or not like acting: the kind of thing that bad or inexperienced actors – or very good male stars – foreground as an effortfully meaningful performance. And she had parallel careers as singer, producer, director and novelist.In her famous “dance” scene in Bande à Part (1964), directed by her husband Jean-Luc Godard, she is Odile, who meets up with Franz (played by Sami Frey) and Arthur (Claude Brasseur), the people with whom she plans to do a robbery. For no reason at all, for the sheer subversive mischief and fun of it, and partly also because they are a little bored (arguably the motivation for everything else as well), they do an extraordinarily insouciant dance together in the middle of a café.It’s a dance that naturally challenges the expectations of realism because it looks like what it is: a choreographed number that the three actors have clearly been rehearsing all day, and which they amusingly still haven’t got completely right, but in which they look entirely and cheerfully at ease. Nobody is facing each other, partly in order to preserve the ambiguity of where among them the romantic or sexual connection is to be found. Godard characteristically shoots it from one camera position, with no changes when the three dancers turn their backs to us. But what is easy to forget is that the two men finally wander off, leaving Anna Karina’s Odile dancing on her own, almost childlike, and she finally beams a beguiling and bewitching smile at us.Famously, Godard first noticed Karina when she was a model doing a Palmolive ad, in a bath with soap bubbles all the way up to her shoulders, but her first film with him was the moment his obsession with her began. In Le Petit Soldat (released in 1963) she plays Veronica, a model who entrances Bruno, a French photographer in Geneva during the Algerian war who is doing dirty “black ops” work for an anti-Algerian government group and who winds up getting tortured and beaten by both sides. The action is suspended for a very Godardian dialogue scenes between this man (Michel Subor) and Karina: she is tellingly compared to a character by the dramatist Jean Giradoux, whose great theme was woman as an unattainable ideal. (It is to Veronica that Subor utters the famous line about cinema being truth 24 times a second.)The contrast between supposed male intellectualism and female beauty couldn’t be clearer, with Bruno being given a voiceover in which he is allowed to ruminate about culture, politics and society – and yet now in 2019 it is Karina who looks calmer, clearer and more natural. Perhaps it is actually Godard’s essential incomprehension of Karina, and of women in general, which paradoxically gives her that presence which radiates from the screen. To be fair, Godard did not habitually fetishise Karina’s body as such, in the way he ironically did with Bardot in Le Mépris. Another famous phrase attributed to Godard is the one about all you need to make a movie is a girl and a gun. In human, practical terms Godard was probably utterly naive about both girls and guns, but Karina could survive his naivety and transcend it.This idea is amplified, in a way to fascinate and exasperate posterity still further, with Godard’s Une Femme Est une Femme (AKA A Woman Is a Woman), his colour movie in the lighter vein of musical comedy, which places Karina at the centre of an à trois romantic set-up which was to be a feature of the New Wave in films such as Bande à Part and Truffaut’s Jules et Jim. She is an exotic burlesque dancer, who at one moment does an uproarious number in a modified “sailor-suit” creation for the implausible benefit of a bunch of slobbish male drinkers. Again, the movie’s tongue is in its cheek, and Karina beautifully handles the lightness and throwaway absurdity of that, and everything else in the film.She had another dance scene in Vivre Sa Vie (1962), which was perhaps the most demanding role for Karina in this run of early great movies: the woman who leaves her husband and child for the yearned-for freedom of acting and then sex work. Again, she is dancing for men who seem baffled by her and oblivious to her. It is here in this film, that her beauty looks to me a little different to the way it is usually described. She is not “doe-eyed there is something feline and leonine about Karina in these movies. But there was also something utterly innocent about her, too, playing opposite Jean-Paul Belmondo in Godard’s deconstructed crime thriller Pierrot le Fou, in which she, like him, sometimes looks like a little kid playing cops’n’robbers. There has to be that same element of satire and absurdity in Godard’s 1965 sci-fi conceit Alphaville when Karina’s eerily detached and affectless woman has a relationship with her ostensible lover, Lemmy Caution (played by Eddie Constantine), a meeting of minds (if not of hearts) represented by a eerie prose-poem of words and images in which Karina’s voice and face are a potent ingredient.Some of the films in Karina’s later career perhaps caricatured the stylish and sexy persona she created in this early work with Godard: she was the unstable lover of the expatriate Englishman played by Michael Caine in The Magus in 1968, and was Margot, the younger woman who bewitches Nicol Williamson’s middle-aged man in Laughter in the Dark (1969), directed by Tony Richardson. For Jacques Rivette’s The Nun (1966), Karina offered audiences something different: a sense of suffering and loneliness and spiritual imprisonment. Perhaps that stark, enigmatic, austere film tapped into a side of Karina that did not interest Godard: a kind of religious mystery. Anna Karina cast a magic spell on cinema."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ada344cdd4084052f251845c76968060b14def7/0_121_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7fcd4e4c144adf79af0136fe2c44a3b8","title":"anna karina french new wave icon godard a life in pictures","story":"The Danish born actor, who was to become one of the icons of French new wave cinema in the 1960s, has died at the age of 79.

But will Stormzy’s mum approve?Stormzy has asked me for a soup recipe (my work here is done). Something along the lines of the okra soup his mum makes at home. I wouldn’t dare attempt to emulate a much-loved family recipe, let alone that of Stormzy’s mum. I think back to the deep bowls of beef soup I have eaten in Ghana, rust-red with palm oil and tomatoes with enough chilli to make your chest burn. So James and I, who have cooked together for a decade, drop everything and spend a day at the stove roasting beef ribs and shredding ginger, slicing okra and being very, very careful with the angry, scarlet Scotch bonnet chillies. They make every cut on our fingers sting. As the evening draws in, we end up with a casserole of broth that is both warming and lively the meat is soft and sweet and Stormzy’s beloved okra has added a quality that is simultaneously soothing and unsettling.The next day, after a night in the fridge, the stew gets heated up again in a big pot over a low heat and I notice its rough edges have softened and its heat has calmed. Yet it would still put up its fists and fight. It warms every inch of my body. I’m hoping Stormzy likes it. I’m hoping his mum likes it even more.beef short ribs 900gonions 3, mediumgarlic 8 clovesginger 50gplum tomatoes 1.5kgoil or beef dripping 3 tbspcumin seeds 2 tspblack peppercorns 12cloves 4cinnamon stick 1Scotch bonnet chillies 1 or 2, to tastebay leaves 3hot beef stock 1 litreokra 350gGet the butcher to cut the ribs into short lengths.

Over the past couple of decades, the quality – and range – of rums available here has at last caught up with the likes of whisky and brandy. Where to start with a constantly evolving, heritage-rich scene? Guest editor and rum aficionado Stormzy gave us a couple of suggestions. First, one with an intriguing back-story, Equiano. Named for the Nigerian-born 18th-century writer, freed slave and abolitionist Olaudah Equiano, it’s a blend of molasses rums from two tropical islands in two continents, Mauritius and Barbados, making it the first-ever Afro-Caribbean rum. Aged for eight years and finished in ex-bourbon casks, it has a gorgeous honeyed mellowness, with soft vanilla and rich fruitcake flavours that, for this correspondent, are better suited to fireside curling-up than clubbing.Las Olas Spiced Rum, Barbados and Jamaica (£35, lasolasrumclub) Stormzy’s second choice, Las Olas, takes us into the realms of spiced rum. That’s a style that can get up purists’ noses – as if it were a form of cheating, somehow, that at least some of the flavour comes from adding spices, roots or fruits into the barrel, rather than it being, as with conventional rum, a reflection of the pure distillate or its slow interaction with a barrel over years. As with gin and vermouth, however, the keys to making the sort of quality spiced rums that have emerged in recent years lie in the skill of the blender and the quality of the raw ingredients – two factors that the three Londoners behind Las Olas seem to have got right with their king new release. A blend of rums from Barbados and Jamaica, it is refreshing and zingy where Equiano is smooth and relaxed, with a seasonal whiff of mince pie and a big hit of bright cherry on the palate.Follow David on Twitter @Daveydaibach This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Offensively so, according to my mother, who has left her slice uneaten on the side of her plate. My father has, miraculously, gone back for seconds. He will regret this later.“I just think the flavour is all right,” he says. “You just have to get over the fact that the texture feels like it’s raw, and feels like you’re eating playdough – which I haven’t done for some time.”Forcing my parents to trial three different versions of vegan ham was probably unkind. When we were children, my sister and I were not allowed to refuse to eat something until we had at least tried it, leading to one long afternoon at the dining table spent waiting for us to eat some pâté on a biscuit – a particularly middle-class form of child torture.Were those memories at the fore when I devised this experiment? Possibly. Revenge is a dish best served 25 years late and made of vital wheat gluten.The purpose of the vegan ham experiment – or vam-off, if you will – was to determine which of three vegan “ham” recipes would be the best porcine replacement at a meat-free Christmas dinner.The verdict, by universal agreement from two omnivorous boomers (mum and dad) and one vegetarian millennial (me), was: none of them.The options were: a glazed tofu roast the bright orange “vegan ham” seitan loaf and a pre-prepared Field Roast Celebration Roast, also made of seitan and flavoured like turkey stuffing. Watermelon ham was left off the list by virtue of already being proved terrible.With the exception of the celebration roast, which I fashioned into a chia pet with fresh herbs then roasted as per packet instructions, I cooked the ham alternatives from scratch and take full responsibility for their utter failure.Saturday night was spent pressing and marinating the tofu and wrestling with the seitan. Seitan is essentially a dense glutinous bread. Unlike with regular bread, the aim is to make it as tough and heavy as possible. To this end, the recipe recommended using a standing mixer (which I don’t have) and a tight foil wrap during baking, which it escaped.Despite being flavoured almost entirely by tomato paste and vegetable stock, it has a curiously penetrative scent: when I wake on Sunday my face smells like vegan ham. I wash it again. The smell remains.On Sunday evening, the tofu is baked for an hour, glazed, covered in far too many cloves and baked again for 30 minutes. The seitan-vam – glazed with a combination of tomato paste, maple syrup and yet more liquid smoke – also gets another 30 minutes in the oven.Like every game of make-believe, much hinges on the willing suspension of belief. If you are familiar with the look but not the taste of glazed ham, and you really want to believe this is an acceptable substitute for ham, then you could possibly make that claim. But it’s a bit like eating wax fruit and claiming it tastes like an apple.If the aim is to create something that looks slightly like a leg of ham, and definitely looks impressively complicated, then seitan is the winner.Both the vam and the tofu have produced a crackling-like crust. At this point, I am feeling smug. Dad is carefully angling them near the window and climbing on the bench to take photos. This has been a success.My smugness lasts as long as it takes for dad to take his first bite. The vegan ham, he says, is like “uncooked pizza dough”.The celebration roast is fine – it tastes like commercial turkey stuffing and is filled with enough salt to keep a family dehydrated for three days – and by universal agreement is the most palatable of the three.The tofu is flavourless apart from acrid spears sent down by the cloves. Mum says it’s “inoffensive”. Dad thinks it is worse than the seitan loaf but he has never been fond of tofu – he once said tofu was not his favourite food, which in our family is akin to Darryl Kerrigan saying he doesn’t like his wife’s rissoles. Everything is Dad’s favourite.He is fascinated by the seitan, which manages to taste raw despite being baked for 90 minutes. “The playdough one at least looks a bit like ham, doesn’t it?” he says. “I’m going to eat the bum end of it and see what that’s like.”The bum is no better.Mum ranks the seitan “a very poor 57th”, saying it has “an odd flavour and it’s texturally unpleasant”.That uncooked texture would possibly be resolved if I had any idea what I was doing, but the central problem remains. It is a substance produced by the starship Heart of Gold: almost, but not quite, entirely unlike ham. Failure is writ into the very concept: if you want to eat ham, then eat ham. No amount of manipulation will make plant matter come close.Nobody wants the leftovers. The dog already has digestive issues, so we decide not to risk it. My parents happily point out that vegan food is at least compostable, and then wonder if the vegan ham will be like the old doormat, which moved house four times in the compost bin before finally breaking down.I receive permission to make a vegan dish for family Christmas, but only if I don’t attempt to make any part of it in any way resemble meat."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e69242b2f7ca70c72a9320efec831578d9f4849d/520_363_2537_1522/master/2537.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c9e81a8efc3407e12b8d5d506489d32","title":"everton v arsenal womens super league live","story":"Reports from the ground that Mead is out on the pitch, on crutches - certainly a good sign if she’s not been taken to hospital for what looked a serious problem.

Liverpool Women 1-1 Chelsea Women at the moment. Meanwhile, here’s a live photo of this match, courtesy of Arsenal Women on Twitter:85 min: Van de Donk and Miedema link on the edge of the penalty area for the Gunners but it’s all a bit too tricky and Everton belt the ball clear. The problem with Arsenal is, they try and walk the ball in the net, as the old saying goes.

Can Everton pull off the impossible?A quality finish by Kelly - and a lifeline for Everton. The ball breaks suddenly to Kelly just inside the penalty area, after Williamson fails to clear, and she drills an accurate finish beyond Zinsberger and into the bottom corner. If Everton can find a way back into this match with two more goals, it would really be something. Kelly’s fifth of the season.This is just one of many social media messages expressing the hope that Beth Mead’s injury is not too serious.

But no-one is there to meet it, and Arsenal can clear their lines. In truth the visitors have been superior in every facet of their play - composed in defence and constantly dangerous in attack.68 min: Everton make a couple of changes: Boye-Hlorkah and Pike come on, Cain and Van Es go off. Can the fresh legs make a difference for the hosts?67 min: As it stands, Arsenal have scored 26 goals in their past four matches in all competitions. Talk about a potent strike force.64 min: Man City Women are also beating Brighton \u0026amp Hove Albion 3-0 in today’s other 12.30pm kick-off. Elsewhere, Liverpool v Chelsea and Reading v Tottenham are getting under way right now.60 min: Roord fires a shot over for Arsenal at one end, before Everton race down to the other end and Kaagman has a shot blocked. The game has opened up, and if it’s a 30-minute slug-fest from here on in, you have to fancy Arsenal to make the scoreline even more emphatic.Now, that IS game over. Korpela doesn’t deal with a low cross from the right, and Miedema is in acres of space at the far post, lurking, ready to tap in an easy finish. Everton are very much under siege again, and there is surely no way back from here. Arsenal will top the WSL table as they crack open their Christmas Prosecco in 10 days’ time. They are certainly playing some Champagne football.Kelly fouls the on-rushing Little on the right of the penalty area, and the visitors have a spot-kick, and a chance to make it 2-0. Having been fouled, Little steps up and strokes a supremely confident penalty low into the right-hand corner of the net. Game over?51 min: Roord does well to set up Van de Donk just inside the Everton penalty area - she cuts back on to her right foot, and cracks a low, goalbound shot to Korpela’s left. The Toffees goalkeeper does really well to get down and make a smart save.50 min: A smart piece of defending by Turner for Everton eases the pressure once more. The opening minutes of the first half have been relatively even, compared to the siege-state which Everton found themselves in before the break.48 min: Everton force a corner - their first of the match. It’s swung to the far post, where Finnigan meets the ball with a powerful header - but it flies harmlessly over the crossbar. 46 min: Arsenal start the second half as they ended the first, on the front foot. They attack down the right - but the ball squirts out for a goal-kick to Everton.Here we go then. Can Everton find an equaliser? Or will Arsenal make the points safe?In the men’s game, Everton host Manchester United at 2pm today. You can read Daniel Harris’s minute-by-minute build-up here: I will be back in a few minutes for the second half of Everton Women v Arsenal Women - see you soon.It is a class header by Gunners top-scorer Miedema that separates the teams at the break. Arsenal minds, however, may well be preoccupied at half-time by that very serious looking injury to Beth Mead, who was carried off on a stretcher about 10 minutes before the interval.However, if Arsenal can convert this into another victory - it would be their sixth on the bounce in the WSL - they will top the table at Christmas, regardless of how Chelsea fare in their 2pm kick-off against Liverpool.52 min: Miedema now races on to a pass down the left-hand channel and swings a hopeful cross into space on the other side of the penalty area. It comes to nothing - and the referee’s whistle blows for half-time.50 min: Arsenal centre-back Leah Williamson does well to head an Everton cross clear. The visitors have had far less defending to do, of the two teams, but Williamson has been impressive when called on so far.48 min: Everton are penned in by some strong Arsenal pressing. Goalkeeper Korpela manages to clear first-time from down in the left-hand corner. Still around four or five minutes of stoppage time to come in this first half.46 min: Roord and Miedema now try to link up on the edge of the Everton area, but they can’t quite get the ball down, and it’s cleared again by the hosts’ defence once again. They have had a heavy workload in this first half and will surely tire as the second half wears on ...44 min: A minimum of eight minutes of stoppage time coming up.43 min: Unsurprisingly, the momentum Arsenal had built before Mead’s injury has largely disappeared. Van de Donk now finds some space on the left, though, and she tries to roll a pass into space for to Miedema chase, but it’s overhit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7dfc45d1d5e6fdf59838d3a9753a10e450985aaa/4_253_2201_1321/master/2201.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9ba225a701ab911b0c2a302987327cc7","title":"manchester united v everton premier league live","story":"35 min Lindelof looks to pass out of defence but Davies intercepts well and then Shaw gives it away, the ball eventually going out to Iwobi on the right. His cross is a peach, but no one attacks the near post and Lindelof heads behind. 34 min Baines’ free-kick misses everyone, but Shaw’s defensive header is as you’d expect, lazy and aimless. Holgate picks up the loose ball, then slices a useless shot that just about makes it over the goallines. 32 min Bernard’s corner is hit towards Keane but Maguire gets in the way, then Martial sends the ball back to the taker. Eventually, Fred sees the danger away, but Everton come again and Lindelof knocks Richarlison over for no sensible reason. Free-kick Everton out on the left...31 min Everton have passed it a bit better these last five minutes, Calvert-Lewin starting to put himself about, and here’s Richarlison winning a corner off McTominay. 30 min “1999 saw me in a small Czech town teaching the local youth to speak better English,” says Brad Elliott. “Went to the local pub - the Red 7 in Breclav - for the night of the Champions League final, with about 10 of my students. When Bayern scored early, one of said students started to goad me, knowing my fervent allegiances. After about 70 minutes or so I’d had enough, so I threw a punch and a minor scuffle ensued - I had to be peeled off him by other members of his class.When Sheringham then Sunny-Boy (what it means in Norwegian apparently) won it for us I ended up kissing my erstwhile student-opponent and about four hours later was carried out of the bar singing the Solskjær song.”The teacher we all needed. 28 min “I’ve got that single on vinyl in the attic,” tweets @foolhandy. “It’s the reason why my little brother (age three at the time) has supported Everton all his life. He loved that song!”The United equivalent was the first recordtapeCD I owned. 27 min Rashford hammers a shot over the wall as Pickford lean right, then flings himself left to punch clear as the ball moves in the air. It was straight at him in a sense, but he had every reason to expect it to bend away. 25 min United looking to increase the25 min It takes a while, but Baines is now with us. 23 min Digne appears to be in some trouble - he’s clutching his groin, and Leighton Baines, also of the late-90s and frequently known as the six member of Menswear, is going to replace him. 22 min Fred swings the corner out and directly onto Calvert-Lewin’s bonce. He clears.22 min United’s attack is focusing mainly down their left, and after some slow passing Rashford injects a bit of pace, winning a corner off Iwobi. 20 min There’s a nice tempo to the game, though not excesses of quality. Richarlison is still limping. 19 min James moseys over to the left in a bid to make something happen, finding Rashford, who’s shot from distance clatters a defender. Meanwhile, Richarlison limps after hurting his leg in a challenge with Fr “Bites yer leg” Ed. 17 min Martial, who’s started livelily, runs at Keane and goes over. He wants a free-kick, but Keane got just enough on the ball. 15 min The Everton fans were singing this belter a few minutes ago.14 min Nice from United, Fred popping it through to Martial, to plays a wall-pass off Rashford before Coleman steps in to get in his road. Good defending. 13 min “While it’s possible it’s a tactical choice from big Dunc to go for ball-carriers in midfield,’ emails Kevin Pready, “I can’t help but think it might be more influenced by Tom Davies being the only fit central midfielder in the first team squad. Gomes, Gbamin, Delph, Sigurdsson and Schneiderlin all out injured or ill as far as I can see.”Yes, I didn’t realise Sigurdsson was ill. 11 min And there it is! McTominay puts James in a race with Digne he burns him up, and because Pickford doesn’t come, he meepmeeps into the box only to drive wide. He might’ve checked there, because the angle was against him and no defender was anywhere near him. Meanwhile, Digne and Coleman chastise Pickford for not coming out to clear. 10 min Lindelof drives a ball from right to left, seeking Rashford. But he’s running away from goal and can’t wrap his foot around the ball, wellying a shot into the near side-netting. But Everton are playing with a higher line than I expected, and it’s going to get them into trouble if they’re not careful.9 min “90s idiocy,” begins Dave Johnson. “My folks had a pub in Camden for many years. I went out on the wallop with a pocketful of cash, in the thousands (I hadn’t had a day off in two years), and had a moment of clarity a few days later. In Kiev. I still have the boarding passes and train ticket stubs from, among other places, Amsterdam, Berlin and Warsaw. Somewhere called Wroclaw? Keep meaning to go back to see how I spent a shedload of zlotys on a stew. Panicked when I saw the Rs were the wrong way round and I wasn’t just slumped outside the Monarch on Chalk Farm Road. Cab to station, flight home and a furious bollocking from me ma. I still have no idea how I got the visas to get in to Poland or Ukraine. But they’re there in my last passport. Ale is ace.”7 min Richarlison – who looks to me like he has all the raw materials to grow into a serious player – forages out on the right and knocks back to Holgate, who sweeps a shot directly into De Gea’s midriff. 6 min McTominay drives through midfield, pokes the ball away from Davies who’s already committed to the challenge, and down he goes. Davies – who i’m sure would’ve loved the 90s – is booked. 5 min “So many great things about that photo of Duncan Ferguson,” says Tommy Marlow, “not least the captain’s armband on the offending arm and the unsighted referee not two feet away. Who needs VAR. I also like the descriptions of the team formations as to their purpose, more of this.”Imagine the horror of burglarising a house, only to discover that it belongs to Big Dunc. 4 min Holgate has moved into midfield, though Everton lined up as a five to begin with. Oooh, clever clever!3 min United struggle to clear the resultant corner, then the second falls at the feet of Calvert-Lewin when Lingard fails to clear - he’s having a lovely birthday so far - but someone, Lindelof I think, blocks the shot. 2 min Now hear come Everton, Holgate pumping in a cross that De Gea has to flick over the top. He looks to have hurt himself stretching, but will be fine.1 min United nearly score in the first 20 seconds! Rashford beats Coleman in the air and Martial runs the channel - do not adjust your sets, you read that right – then finds Fred, who bursts into the box, beats one man, runs through another, and the ball squirts across to Lingard, who swivels to shoot just wide. 1 min Off we go!Here come the teams! Harrance Maguire captains United, and I’d expect that to continue – I’d not be surprised if he was signed partly for that reason. Personally, I’m unconvinced. If he actually is the leader he’s meant to be – Steve Bruce with a first touch – then he ought to have done more to protect the leads United habitually cede. “Happy to see bogeyman Sigurdsson on the bench,” emails Duncan Edwards. “Happy for Gary Naylor to keep that goal as his greatest memory of Everton v United and happy to predict that will remain the case after today. 4-2 United.”To save Gary the bother. Solskjaer tells Sky Everton pose a different challenge to City, and his young team are learning etcetera etcetera he expects Everton to play a centre-back in midfield.Ferguson confirms that Sidibe and Sigurdsson are ill, and the formation is a consequence of that – I think he might have done well in that aspect, because the 5-3-2 will make things harder for United. What Everton need to avoid – and prepare yourselves, for this is a biggie – is not to concede early. United’s confidence, though up, remains brittle, and if they fail to score in the first half-hour, they’ll remember that they’re meant to struggle in such circumstances and also that they lack midfield inspiration. On which point, Jesse Lingard has been really good lately, and the onus will be on him to open things up.Back to today, I imagine Ferguson has gone for ball-carriers in midfield because he wants to counter the counterers. Playing two strikers also means that the long ball is a decent option, and if Richarlison and Calvert-Lewin can hold it up, Bernard, Iwobi and the wing-backs will be in the game. Imagine this was your boss!I imagine United will look to outrun and outfight Everton in midfield – there’s not a lot of ballast in Bernard, Davies and Iwobi – then find space between centre-back and wing-back. The question is how effectively they can do that against a team sitting deep.Players you’ve never seen play well: Bernard. I’m surprised he’s playing today, and I’m unsure what it is he’s meant to be good at. Feel free to correct me. “Duncan knows what to do when the time comes,” tweets Gary Naylor. Looking again at the teams, I wonder if Axel Tuanzebe might’ve been a smart choice for United. Lindelof started the season poorly, and though he’s been better in recent weeks, he and Maguire are too similar for my tastes. Tuanzebe is as good as Lindelof on the ball, better under the high ball, and has the recovery pace to compensate for any errors. I’d guess that Ferguson sees the centre of United’s defence as a weak point to exploit. So, come on then: let’s have your tales of classic late-90s idiocy. I’ll start: when Hooch came out, we went to Kwik Save Kentish Town, bought a load, then went back to school for afternoon lessons. It went as well as you imagine. Ferguson, meanwhile, changes formation and personnel. Aware of what United can do when offered space, his 5-3-2 will aim to restrict that, at the same time as keeping an attacking threat via the deployment of two strikers. Out go Sidibe, Schneiderlin, Walcott and Sigurdsson in come Coleman, Mina, Davies and Bernard. So United are unchanged – replace Fred or Lingard with Pogba (stop laughing at the back) and this is Solskjaer’s first team. At some point, Greenwood is going to demand inclusion – personally, I’d have picked him over Martial for last weekend. But Martial was excellent in that game, so deservedly returns. Can he maintain that level of effort and performance? Manchester United (a 4-3-3 disguised as a 4-2-3-1): De Gea Wan-Bissaka, Lindelof, Maguire, Shaw McTominay, Fred, Lingard James, Martial, Rashford. Subs: Romero, Tuanzebe, Williams, Young, Pereira, Mata, Greenwood.Sometimes the cosmos is kind to us. Not often, but sometimes. And right now is one of those times, because frankly, who doesn’t wish we were back in the late 90s? Some of us who are dead were alive, many of us who are old were young, and all of us who are young were free of this revolting hell-hole of a planet. So slip on your v-neck and Vans, grab a Fuse and a bottle of Hooch, and come right in for Ole Gunnar Solskjær v Duncan Ferguson back up in the game! Strangely, these men are similar in an increasingly unusual way: they are uniformly loved. Petty grudge-bearing and fickle mind-changing are part of what makes football so joyous, but both Solskjær and Ferguson sit above that, a status earned through consistent excellence, unquestioned commitment and unimpeachable integrity – whether tripping RobSolskjær’s life has changed significantly in the last 10 days. Though much of what ailed him was not his fault and though it was clear to see how things were improving under him, had United lost to Spurs and Manchester City, the pressure might’ve told. Instead, he stayed calm, got his players back, and out-tacticked two bona fide greats of the game. The test today is for his team to maintain that level of performance against an opponent less inclined to facilitate it. All in all, we’re set for decent afternoon’s, er, Premiership. After that, I’ve not a clue, but in the meantime.

I wanted to leave two years ago but, as with many couples stuck in the rental cycle, I had neither the money to walk away from my deposit, nor somewhere else to go. The thought of sharing a cramped apartment with an extremely upset man also didn’t appeal. It was easier to keep the peace, plaster over the doubts and fight for our relationship.My boyfriend isn’t a bad man – one of the reasons I’ve stayed is because he and his family have been a huge support, especially in comparison with my family who are shakier than the branch of a tree and plagued with mental illness. I’m desperate for stability and to put down roots. This wouldn’t be achievable without another name on the mortgage.I don’t know what to do. I’m nearing 30 and have no inclination to marry him, which I know is an indicator to leave. He knows it’s bad, too. We argue at least three times a day, but he comes from a culture of “We’re together now, we’re together for always.” And it’s not a bad match. If I pick up the dice to roll a six, will I lose the four I’ve got?Mariella replies Four to six? You are right to say it’s a gamble. I was all set to come over and show him the door myself until you mentioned your dice roll. Maybe my expectations are uncommonly low – an inbox of other people’s problems will do that to you. Halfway to a full house seems a tolerable position to be in, while a full two-thirds is edging on honeymoon bliss in my book.Few marriages would rate as tolerably, which begs the question: what’s awry? Either you’ve given me a bad steer or you’re chasing down perfection, neither of which is helpful here. “I’ve fallen out of love with my boyfriend” isn’t particularly informative, but let’s start as you did, with your unhappy cohabitation.Living together in misery may be bearable – and don’t think I don’t appreciate the fiscal repercussions of flight – but it’s not sustainable. Despite the fact that one in two marriages now ends in orce, there remains a tendency to treat relationships without contract or children as in some way lesser. But what if we take the demise of your union as seriously as we would the untangling of a long-term liaison? My first step would be to identify the cause of your dissatisfaction, then seek help to find a resolution before you shut the door for good. I’m not sure whether, in adulthood, being “out of love” is reason enough for separation. After all, what does that mean when you’re a grown-up and not in the first flush of passion?That’s not to say you should stay together out of duty. As I’m sure you’re aware, there’s a big wide world out there full of alternative possibilities, some good, some bad and all different. Neither am I setting myself up as some stoic of the last century, girded for a life of struggle and disappointment come what may, and advising others to accept a similar fate. If your heart stops fluttering when you see the phone number on your screen, is that the end of love or the beginning of something potentially equally satisfying? The answer is subjective. I can’t judge the depth of your feelings for this man, or the level of his goodness, but there seem to be more glimmers of hope than reasons to flee.Maybe I’m being over magnanimous – the season of goodwill can have that effect – but I’d be tempted to take the sustainable course first. That means attempting to mend what you’ve got rather than just binning him and looking for a replacement. These days we’re all about limiting waste and investing long-term, intentions we would do equally well to apply to our relationships. The rush of adrenalin, the thrill of the chase and the searing heat of initial passion are like fossil fuels – they run out eventually. Based on what you say, and taking your unstable family into account, it’s possible you’ve already landed safely. Love has many dimensions and losing one aspect doesn’t leave you empty-handed.I appreciate the financial difficulties of setting forth alone and as someone who, until my 40s, was on that challenging path, I hope you’ll accept that I have form. Understanding that it’s a valid consideration is not the same as condoning the compromise if all you are focused on is climbing on to the first rung of the property ladder. I can assure you that losing a home you’ve bought together is as painful as staying coupled up simply to pay the bills.Only you can judge whether you’re settling for fear of the alternative, or failing to appreciate what you’ve got. Either way you need to summon up the courage of your convictions, and make a choice based on what your heart, having truly examined it, dictates.Finally, taking a more global viewpoint, compromising emotional wellbeing for a roof over your head was the fate forced on women for millennia. We do our predecessors a great disservice if today, with freedom of choice and equal opportunity for financial independence, we continue to behave as if we have neither.• Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.

It’s a comfortable collection of tea cups and computers, with books piled precariously next to the odd well-intentioned plant. It’s not unusual for famous people to come into the office, whether to be photographed or interviewed, but it is unusual for staff to bother looking up from their screens. I mean, I don’t want to boast, but I have taken the lift with models. Politicians stalk the corridors. There was a memorable afternoon when someone’s neighbour wanted to learn about sub-editing, and after many hours of her studiously practising InDesign behind us, we realised it was PJ Harvey. Celebrity guest editors have come and gone, sometimes shyly, sometimes with an entourage the size of Europe, but in my many years sitting in this chair I’ve never seen the air change the way it did when Stormzy visited.We picked him up from reception, 100ft tall in his black Ugg slippers, and his first request was to see the canteen (“I love school dinners!”) where, as he waited for his fish, chips, beans and chicken slice to be plated up, the room filled with people, all suddenly excited for lunch at quarter to 12. Somebody gasped as they passed him on the stairs and someone else stifled a scream. He brought his fish and chips up to the editor’s desk, where it quickly became clear we were going to have to keep the door closed to prevent strangers fainting.At first the onlookers were colleagues passing politely, doing a special walk that suggested they were on their way to the loo, but quickly all pretence was lost and people came dashing down from departments across the building. A small crowd gathered, and then a large one, ning ages from 20 to 70, in their eyes an awe.After a polite request to leave our editor to his work, choosing between covers, checking proofs, they stepped back from the room, to return a minute later steely-smiled. What is it about Stormzy in particular that these fans love? “He’s not just a person,” said one young woman, wielding her phone in case he walked past again, “He’s a movement.”With that in mind it was vaguely intimidating to re-enter the room and sit beside him as he discussed cover lines. He had forgotten how to write with a pen, he realised quickly – he hasn’t used one since he got his phone. Chuckling, he practised on a proof. “Hello,” he wrote carefully, “My name is Michael,” before ticking off pages. “This looks sick,” he grinned approvingly. “This is HARD.”Does this always happen I ask, as he strolls across the office later to meet the designer and choose font colours, and grown-up politics reporters squeal and swell in his wake. “A bit,” he grins, bashfully. “Is there a… quiet way out?” his PR asks and, once he’s signed off the magazine, we weave past the picture desk to a back door, where he can dash down to his car without smiling for any more selfies. When he leaves by the loading bay exit a fire alarm goes off, and it’s the most peaceful the office has been all day.

In fact, the hold-up at the UK premiere of Jennifer Walshe’s Time Time Time owed a little to technical glitches and a lot to the queue slowly filling up the warehouse-like underground space of Ambika P3 – numbers any promoter of contemporary opera would envy. But Time Time Time, a co-commission by the London Contemporary Music Festival and the Serpentine Gallery, is only really an opera in the sense that it’s a big, bold coming-together of elements it’s more a piece of musical performance art.The room is in darkness except for a huge video screen at either end, a stage, and four single spotlit musicians, one at each corner of the audience. Centre stage, resplendent in emerald-green sequins, is Walshe herself – composer, co-writer of the text with the philosopher Timothy Morton, and the main narrator and singer in a series of vignettes playing with big ideas. The music doesn’t lead the rest, although sometimes it is more than just accompaniment: in an episode conjuring a primeval forest, the honking, snorting trumpet and saxophone compete and converse with the soundtrack’s jungle creatures. Mostly, though, they and the violin and double bass players provide ambience, improvising within a framework while the focus is elsewhere.Walshe and MC Schmidt duel and duet in witty, wisecracking spoken musings, in accents floating from English RP to Walshe’s natural Irish to US valley speak. The video keeps returning to a beautiful imagined cross-section of the Earth in between, it riffs on ideas of time experienced differently – a factory “producing” time the wait for a pregnancy-test result dinosaurs as visualised in Victorian models or stop-frame B-movies. Songs from harpist Áine O’Dwyer offer moments of relative stillness.On the way in, we are all given a tiny fossilised ammonite.

Between Friday and Saturday, the charity has received almost £3,000 in donations – a number that a spokesperson has described as “significant and very welcome”.The UK’s largest food bank charity, the Trussell Trust, said it had been “overwhelmed” following a huge uplift in donations. While it could not yet give an exact figure, a spokesperson confirmed that hundreds of people have got in touch to set up a monthly donation or make a one-off payment.The boost in support comes as many across the country have expressed despair at the Conservatives, who have overseen nearly a decade of deep cuts to public services since they came to power in 2010, winning the election.Emma Revie, the chief executive of the Trussell Trust, said: “We’re overwhelmed by the wave of support we’ve seen. Thank you so much to everyone who has been donating – we’re incredibly grateful. We know we can reach a future where no one needs a food bank, but we can’t do it alone. We must work together – this can change.”Sandra Horley CBE, the chief executive of Refuge, said: “Now that the general election is behind us, we implore the incoming Conservative government to work on addressing violence against women and girls. The government needs to make this a priority and commit funds and resources to doing so.“Survivors have waited too long already. The domestic abuse bill, which was lost due to the snap election, needs to be quickly reinstated and strengthened to be a truly transformative piece of legislation.“We need an immediate commitment to new funds for refuges, which face closure up and down the country. No woman or child should be turned away when they seek help, survivors need to know that help and support is there for them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6de793d8431bdc6adab80ec0cdd982e4761478ec/0_140_4261_2556/master/4261.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2a6f49e565e1810687ad1e71918c3c3a","title":"tactical voting what went wrong general election 2019","story":"In the end, fears of a Corbyn government and disdain for Jo Swinson’s election campaign combined to defeat tactical voting. Over the past four weeks, the Observer has reported on constituency polls designed to assist voters wanting to oppose the Conservatives and stop Brexit. Last Sunday, we recommended candidates in 50 seats. Our results were not great. Non-Conservatives won only 13 of these seats of these, nine were SNP gains in Scotland. In England, our preferred candidates triumphed in only four seats: Putney and Portsmouth South (Labour) and Richmond Park and St Albans (Liberal Democrat).Why so few successes? It was not the fault of Deltapoll’s data. Almost everywhere, they identified the correct challenger. Most dramatically, they showed rightly that the Liberal Democrats were snapping at Dominic Raab’s heels, despite the foreign secretary’s apparently impregnable 23,000 majority.In a number of our 50 seats, the candidate we showed running third saw their vote squeezed. Examples were Labour in Wimbledon and the Cities of London and Westminster, and the Lib Dems in Putney and Hendon. In some places, isions in the tactical voting community helped the Conservatives.Three high-profile defectors to the Lib Dems suffered from local voters receiving conflicting, and sometimes changing, advice: Luciana Berger (in Finchley and Golders Green), Chuka Umunna (Cities of London and Westminster) and Sam Gyimah (Kensington).In Kensington, judgement was particularly tricky. We backed Gyimah when our survey showed him well-placed to win. A later survey by the same pollster showed Emma Dent Coad, who gained the seat for Labour in 2017, overtaking Gyimah. This trend proved to be more powerful than the contested tactical advice: Gyimah ended up third, and Dent Coad lost the seat narrowly.Deltapoll’s data showed what tactical voting was up against. Lib Dem supporters were reluctant to help Corbyn become prime minister. Likewise, Tory Remainers feared voting for a badly led Lib Dem party that might support Corbyn. These Tories preferred a Brexit Britain governed by Johnson to a stop-Brexit government led by Corbyn.The big lesson is that tactical voting needs not just a common enemy, but a broadly common vision, shared by the Labour and Lib Dem leaders. This was the case with Tony Blair and Paddy Ashdown in 1997 it was not with Corbyn and Swinson last week.In all this, one success deserves to be recognised. Seven of the 11 national eve-of election surveys, including Opinium, the Observer’s Britain-wide pollsters, predicted the support for every party to within two percentage points. One cannot reasonably ask for a better performance.Peter Kellner is a polling expert and former president of YouGov"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6cba75c944af766095b267684b5dce074c18df1f/182_277_2869_1721/master/2869.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19b377e8d46a3e285dd34b390f4c2f6a","title":"we won the argument but i regret we didnt convert that into a majority for change","story":"We must now ensure that the working class, in all its ersity, is the driving force within our partyWe are living in highly volatile times. Two-and-a-half years ago, in the first general election I contested as Labour leader, our party increased its share of the popular vote by 10 percentage points. On Thursday, on a desperately disappointing night, we fell back eight points.I have called for a period of reflection in the party, and there is no shortage of things to consider. I don’t believe these two contrasting election results can be understood in isolation.The last few years have seen a series of political upheavals: the Scottish independence campaign, Labour’s transformation, Brexit, the Labour electoral surge, and now Johnson’s “Get Brexit Done” victory. None of that is a coincidence.The political system is volatile because it is failing to generate stable support for the status quo following the financial crash of 2008. As Labour leader I’ve made a point of travelling to all parts of our country and listening to people, and I’ve been continually struck how far trust has broken down in politics.The gap between the richest and the rest has widened. Everyone can see that the economic and political system is not fair, does not deliver justice, and is stacked against the majority.That has provided an opening for a more radical and hopeful politics that insists it doesn’t have to be like this, and that another world is possible. But it has also fuelled cynicism among many people who know things aren’t working for them, but don’t believe that can change.I saw that most clearly in the former industrial areas of England and Wales where the wilful destruction of jobs and communities over 40 years has taken a heavy toll. It is no wonder that these areas provided the strongest backlash in the 2016 referendum and, regrettably for Labour, in the general election on Thursday.In towns where the steelworks have closed, politics as a whole wasn’t trusted, but Boris Johnson’s promise to “get Brexit done” – sold as a blow to the system – was. Sadly that slogan will soon be exposed for the falsehood it is, shattering trust even further.Despite our best efforts, and our attempts to make clear this would be a turning point for the whole direction of our country, the election became mainly about Brexit.A Conservative party prepared to exploit isions capitalised on the frustration created by its own failure to deliver on the referendum result – to the cost of a Labour party seeking to bring our country together to face the future.The polarisation in the country over Brexit made it more difficult for a party with strong electoral support on both sides. I believe we paid a price for being seen by some as trying to straddle that ide or re-run the referendum.We now need to listen to the voices of those in Stoke and Scunthorpe, Blyth and Bridgend, Grimsby and Glasgow, who didn’t support Labour. Our country has fundamentally changed since the financial crash and any political project that pretends otherwise is an indulgence.Progress does not come in a simple straight line. Even though we lost seats heavily on Thursday, I believe the manifesto of 2019 and the movement behind it will be seen as historically important – a real attempt at building a force powerful enough to transform society for the many, not the few. For the first time in decades, many people have had hope for a better future.That experience, shared by hundreds of thousands of people, cannot be erased. Our task as a movement, and a party that has more than doubled in size, is not over: it now has the urgent task of defending the communities that will come under sustained assault from Boris Johnson’s government and the toxic deal he wants with Donald Trump.And it must set about ensuring that sense of hope spreads and deepens. As socialists we seek to raise people’s expectations. People in our country deserve so much more – and they can have it, if we work together to achieve it.I am proud that on austerity, on corporate power, on inequality and on the climate emergency we have won the arguments and rewritten the terms of political debate. But I regret that we did not succeed in converting that into a parliamentary majority for change.There is no doubt that our policies are popular, from public ownership of rail and key utilities to a massive house-building programme and a pay rise for millions. The question is, how can we succeed in future where we didn’t this time?There is no quick fix to overcome the distrust of many voters. Patronising them will not win them over. Labour has to earn their trust. That means the patient work of listening and standing with communities, especially as the government steps up its assault. And it means ensuring that the working class, in all its ersity, is the driving force within our party.The media attacks on the Labour party for the last four and a half years were more ferocious than ever – and of course that has an impact on the outcome of elections. Anyone who stands up for real change will be met by the full force of media opposition.The party needs a more robust strategy to meet this billionaire-owned and influenced hostility head-on and, where possible, turn it to our advantage.We have suffered a heavy defeat, and I take my responsibility for it. Labour will soon have a new leader. But whoever that will be, our movement will continue to work for a more equal and just society, and a sustainable and peaceful world.I’ve spent my life campaigning for those goals, and will continue to do so. The politics of hope must prevail."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4bbd70692293f199ef101354c48277fc535d0b96/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=43bd9ad3fa4f625643a74168f4b80e84","title":"woman likely to lead labour jostling to succeed jeremy corbyn begins","story":"Six of the seven probable challengers are female, and all will be keen to connect with traditional party supportersThe battle to succeed Jeremy Corbyn and shape the future direction of the Labour party is under way as potential successors set out their leadership stalls for the first time, amid bitter recriminations after the party’s worst general election defeat since 1935.Two of the likely candidates in what will be a 12-week contest that is expected to begin in January – Jess Phillips and Lisa Nandy – break cover with articles in the Observer, expressing their anger and dismay at the party’s crushing defeat, and calling for a far-reaching post-mortem to ensure Labour reconnects with the millions of working people who rejected it.Seven MPs, six of them women – Phillips, Nandy, Emily Thornberry, Rebecca Long-Bailey, Angela Rayner and Yvette Cooper – are understood to be thinking of joining the contest, making it likely that Labour will for the first time elect a female leader. Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, is also likely to join the race.In the early hours of Friday, when the scale of Labour’s defeat was known, Corbyn announced that he would not lead Labour into another election but would stay to allow the party a period of “reflection” until a new leader was elected.While many MPs have attacked him for refusing to go sooner, and for his initial refusal to apologise personally for the crushing loss, others argue that the party should avoid a bitter blame game.In what appears to be a pitch for the top job, Phillips argues that the party must broaden its appeal so it can once again attract a coalition of support from both the working class and middle classes. But she goes out of her way to insist that she is not advocating a return to the approach of New Labour.“Some call me a Blairite because I’m evangelical about the difference Sure Start and tax credits made to my life. But I marched against Iraq, I didn’t even become an MP until eight years after he’d left parliament, so how does that fit?”She is severely critical of the way Corbyn and his supporters have seized control of the party machine and excluded those with different views. “The truth is there are corners of our party that have become too intolerant of challenge and debate,” she writes. “There is a clique who don’t care if our appeal has narrowed as long as they have control of the institutions and ideas of the party.“We’ve all got to discover the courage to ask the difficult questions about the future of our party and the future of the working class communities who need a Labour government.” Nandy also argues that the party has “lost touch with the day-to-day lived experience of many of the people we want to represent” and must reconnect with them by listening and becoming more “rooted in our communities”. Only that way could Labour understand the practical needs of working people and respond to them.Also writing in the Observer today, Corbyn says there is “no doubt” about the popularity of Labour’s policies. However, Nandy says that some of the manifesto made little sense. “Nationalising rail is a good, sound policy, but should we have staked so much of our campaign on that policy when so many of the towns we lost have no train station and rely on buses anyway? Should we really be rejecting nuclear power when it is one of the best sources of good jobs outside of London?”On Saturday senior Labour figures said that Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, was already being promoted by the Corbyn circle as his favoured successor.Sharp differences of view were expressed over whether Corbyn should continue as leader for the next few months or go sooner.But , also writing in this paper, Labour MPs Lucy Powell and Shabana Mahmood, who held their seats of Manchester Central and Birmingham Ladywood, urge the party not to indulge in a bitter blame game, and instead to work together to learn the lessons for the long term.“Our starting point for a Labour recovery can’t be to pick the things we like and blame the things that we don’t. Some want to say our defeat was all about Jeremy Corbyn, others that it was only Brexit. Both are wrong. It’s clear that our losses were about both and much, much more.“We must now undertake a real and meaningful review with everything on the table, and no no-go areas. It must start from a place of humility which acknowledges Labour got it wrong rather than the voters, with a process that involves the whole of our movement, and those who feel we’ve left them behind.”Angela Eagle, who retained the Merseyside seat of Wallasey, said there were many people at the top of the party, including senior officials and advisers, who needed to think seriously about whether it was credible for them to carry on after the election disaster. “There are a lot of people who need to reflect and consider their positions, not just the leadership in parliament.”Corbyn will face a difficult few days after parliament returns on Tuesday. He is expected to address a meeting of the parliamentary party that day, then taking part in prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, before accompanying Johnson on the traditional walk from Commons to Lords on Thursday for the Queen’s speech."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c19f7dee842d27fbf5010fd7da24b5fec167973d/0_0_1483_890/master/1483.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=926936f70ffefc85c09b69f45ce2237b","title":"blair old seat sedgefield rejected corbyn perceived unpatriotic","story":"It came as no surprise that Boris Johnson hot-footed it to Sedgefield on Saturday . The prime minister probably never had much doubt that he could eclipse Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party in this election, but to rewrite the electoral history of this particular place was perhaps beyond his imagining. He needed to see it for himself.Sedgefield had not only returned solid Labour majorities since 1935, it was also the symbolic home of the politician who, by the time of the next election, will be the only Labour election winner in half a century. Johnson wore an ironic red tie for the occasion, and came close to quoting some of Tony Blair’s most famous lines verbatim. “We are not the masters, we are the servants, and our job is to serve the people of this country,” he said. Even when he is making gestures of one-nation humility, he can’t help himself from trolling.He pulled a pint to prove he had also laid to rest images of that other recent Tory nemesis, Nigel Farage, and offered all the familiar half-truths about nurses and hospitals and investment. The audience believed him just as much now as they had when they had gone to the ballot box on Thursday.You can intellectualise the collapse of Labour’s vote in its north-east heartlands, but it is still a surreal spectacle up close. How had it happened? I had spent the previous evening at Fishburn Working Men’s Club, a mile down the road from Tony Blair’s old constituency home, asking that question. Downstairs, in the party room, there is a battle-worn miners’ banner in a glass case bearing the stern face of Keir Hardie it is brought out each year to head the Durham miners’ parade. On the walls of the main bar, there are paintings of the former Fishburn colliery which once employed nearly every family in this village and, in pride of place, above the red leather seating, a solemn tableau of the “pits closed by the Tories”, row upon row of lost mines, each with its symbolic badge of arms.Underneath this memorial, on Friday night, regulars at the club for 40 and 50 years explained to me, one after the other, how for the first time in their lives they had voted Conservative at this election.That collective shift of will in Sedgefield saw the most formidable of Labour majorities crumble to a defeat for Phil Wilson, “the heir to Blair”. Blair remains an honorary member at Fishburn I’m told (“though possibly lapsed”) he won a majority of 25,000 in 1997. The Labour vote this time around was only 15,000 in total. When the news had come through at 3.30am, midway through Corbyn’s statement of defeat, the Conservative campaign headquarters pumped Things Can Only Get Better through its loudspeakers.Wilson’s father was a miner in the Fishburn colliery. His own speech conceding defeat to Paul Howell, a retired accountant who also grew up in the constituency, could hardly have been more direct in apportioning blame.“If you are on the doorstep and one person mentions Brexit, but five people mention the leader of the Labour party for being the reason they are not going to vote for you, then things need to change. I believe that the leader of the Labour party should not be resigning today, he should have resigned a long time ago.”Any Momentum diehard who doubts the truth of that sentiment up here should come and talk to the Fishburn regulars. Arthur Hudspeth is playing the fruit machine in the social club. He recently celebrated his 91st birthday. He went down the pit at 14 in 1942 and worked in mines until his retirement at 65. The only two years he missed were for his national service: “first battalion of the Durhams” he tells me, looking me in the eye. He has voted Labour without fail in every election since Attlee’s victory in 1945, but not this time. He is ashamed to say he didn’t vote at all, but winces at the mention of Corbyn’s name and shakes his head. Why? “Rubbish. He’s not my kind of man. Not strong enough. He doesn’t understand us here.”To start to unpack what Hudspeth means, you need to look in the dominoes room of the Fishburn Club. The symbolic decoration here is provided by the plaques and banners not of mines but of local regiments. It is this strand of the collective memory to which Corbyn, as Labour leader, appears to have had nothing to say.Talking to regulars the same allegations surface again and again. That Corbyn consorted with the IRA, that he is soft on terrorists. That he has remained silent on prosecuting veterans over the Bloody Sunday killings. The leader’s shifting agnosticism on Brexit, in this context, is portrayed as yet another failure of patriotism, just as symbolic as his unforgivable reluctance to sing God save the Queen at a Battle of Britain remembrance service.Tom Blenkinsop, the former Middlesbrough MP who stood down in 2017 after organising against Corbyn, described exactly that sentiment to me on Friday, when anger at the catastrophic result for Labour was still keeping him from sleep. Blenkinsop, now an army reservist, had been campaigning with Wilson in Sedgefield for the previous couple of days and knew what was coming.“Brexit was obviously a factor, but the main issue again and again here was the leadership. It didn’t matter what the message was, they didn’t like the messenger.”Were people not persuaded at all by the pledges on the NHS, the promise of nationalisations?“You are talking about the north-east of England. It is not just based on a strong unionised workforce, but also the armed services. There is hardly a family around here who has not had a son or a brother or a father serve. A man like Corbyn, with his history, they could not vote for him.”Blenkinsop and Wilson were among those who believed that remaining in the EU could have been sold as a Labour issue and a patriotic one – by arguing that pooled sovereignty was enhanced sovereignty and that a strong economy was what made Britain great – but that argument was over before it began. Both men enthusiastically endorsed Alan Johnson’s scathing assessment of Corbyn and his “Momentum cult” as incapable of “leading the working class out of a paper bag”.In the absence of that leadership, other pseudo-patriotic voices have stepped in. Penny Pearson, 60, who helps to run the committee at Fishburn, tells me with some pride how the club hosted three events for a tweed-jacketed Nigel Farage and the Brexit party, down in the room with the Hardie banner. They catered for 100 each time and more came. Like many here Pearson would have voted for Farage, but went Conservative “just to make sure” that Corbyn’s Labour had no chance.Of all the people in the club the only one who admits voting Labour is the barman, Lewis White, who is working part-time here to help fund his way through a teacher-training course at Teesside. He is a lone fan of what is generally described as Corbyn’s “London” politics. White is 28 now and has been coming here for a decade. “It was always a Labour club it’s unheard of, what’s happened.” He looks around the bar, “Even the seats here are red,” he says. “Perhaps they will have to think about redecorating.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3c606bec625174150436b2233cab884032f45e1/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb28c0c048c8127b7bfba0e453a32eae","title":"britains new political landscape","story":"Politics professor Rob Ford crunched the numbers with a team of experts to produce the devastatingly accurate exit poll. Here, he details how the 10pm figures foretold a night of horror for LabourThe defeat this time was not glorious. Labour fell everywhere, but the party collapsed in its northern and Midlands heartlands where voters have returned Labour MPs for generations. The “red wall” collapsed, and Corbyn’s party was left to pick through the rubble of its worst defeat in more than 80 years.Last Thursday I worked at BBC HQ with the team headed by Professor John Curtice to produce the poll released at 10pm on the BBC and ITV that predicted the new political shape of Britain. The security was watertight – our phones were taken from us, and we had to be escorted to and from the toilets.The early declaration of Blyth Valley made clear why the exit poll was projecting the largest Conservative majority for more than 30 years. The Tories took this north-east mining seat for the first time since 1935 on a dramatic 10-point swing. Further shock defeats soon followed in Workington, Darlington and most dramatically in Leigh, the rock-solid north-west seat formerly held by Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham.Abstract voting statistics cannot capture the crushing emotional blow of this defeat. Seat after seat that had backed Labour in every vote since at least 1945 abandoned the party, many electing Conservative MPs for the first time ever. Rother Valley, Labour since 1918: gone. West Bromwich East, Tom Watson’s former fortress: gone. Stoke-on-Trent Central and Stoke-on-Trent North, both Labour since 1935: gone. In the former mining seat of Bolsover, the former miner Dennis Skinner was ejected after 49 years serving a seat that has returned Labour MPs for nearly twice as long. Then, at 3.30am, minutes after Corbyn delivered a defiant address from his Islington count, the returning officer in Sedgefield announced the first Tory victory in 88 years in Tony Blair’s old seat.This was total repudiation. Labour returned its smallest cohort of MPs since 1935, and the prospect of power looks more remote than at any time since the early 1980s. Yet even in 1983, the party was suffering just its second successive defeat, and even this could be blamed on a ided vote following the SDP split. In 2019, Labour faced a fourth, crushing defeat in a row to a Tory party that has governed for nearly a decade, yet grown its vote each time it faced the electorate.Labour was not the only party bitterly disappointed by last week’s results. The Liberal Democrats entered the campaign with high hopes of mobilising opposition to Brexit to secure an electoral breakthrough, returning the party to relevance after four post-coalition years in the wilderness. Party leader Jo Swinson even sought to present herself as a prime minister in waiting. It was not to be. The party that had sought a Remain realignment finished with fewer seats than before, as just three gains in strongly Remain areas were more than offset by four losses of seats won in 2017, including Swinson’s as she was defeated by the SNP in East Dunbartonshire. The party can at least take some consolation from the substantial increase in its vote share in the most middle-class and Remain areas of London and south England, which leave it well placed to benefit at future elections if the Conservatives’ growing alignment with nationalist and Eurosceptic voters alienates its traditional support base in suburbia.This was also a night of crushing disappointment for the many defectors and independents who sought to put principle before party. The Liberal Democrats fielded new recruits from both Labour (including Chuka Umunna and Luciana Berger) and the Conservatives (including Sarah Wollaston and Sam Gymiah). All were defeated. Dominic Grieve and David Gauke, expelled from the Conservatives for rebellions over Brexit, achieved large swings as independents but could not break traditional voter alignments in their safe Tory seats. The various former Labour and Conservative MPs who broke away at the start of the year to form Change UK, and mostly now stood as independents, fared even worse, while Chris Williamson lost his deposit standing as an independent after being expelled from the Labour party.. Local roots matter more than national arguments, with the strongest independent performances on the night both coming from homegrown independent candidates in Ashfield and Devon East.The two governing parties in Northern Ireland also had a very bad night, as Remain-supporting opposition parties surged in the region set to be hardest hit by Brexit. The DUP lost two seats, with its Westminster leader, Nigel Dodds, defeated by Sinn Féin in North Belfast. The SDLP took a seat each from Sinn Féin and the DUP on huge swings, while the cross-community Alliance party took North Down and ran the DUP very close in East Belfast. These results could herald major changes in the balance of power if, as expected, another election is called in the province next year to break the deadlock in the Northern Ireland assembly.The Conservatives were not the only governing party to advance. The SNP, which has ruled at Holyrood since 2007, secured its second Westminster landslide in four years. The SNP slumped in 2017, when its campaign for a second independence referendum turned unionist and Leave voters against it. Two years later, the imminence of a hard Brexit under Johnson has renewed the appeal of independence, and the SNP has 48 of Scotland’s 59 seats.The Scottish Conservatives gave up more than half of the seats gained in 2017, but the biggest loser was Scottish Labour, once again reduced to a single seat on its lowest ever share of the vote. The SNP’s triumph makes a new constitutional clash highly likely in the coming parliament, as a party determined to secure a mandate for independence faces a prime minister firmly opposed to a second Scottish referendum on the issue.The return of a large and loyal majority will transform the Brexit legislative process. The narrow votes and high drama of the past two years will be at an end. Johnson can go to Brussels safe in the knowledge that any deal he negotiates will pass smoothly through the Commons. Brexit will get done.The harder task comes after that. Johnson’s party may be united (at last) over Brexit, but the places it represents are now drawn from opposite sides of a deeply ided nation. The newly elected Conservative MPs represent some of the poorest parts of the country, joining party veterans who represent some of the wealthiest seats. The government will face a new pressure to spend and invest from the party’s new MPs, who will want to show that “getting Brexit done” delivers some tangible results for constituents in their marginal seats. But big spending runs very much against the ideological grain for the Conservative party, and the challenges such seats face after decades of stagnation and neglect cannot realistically be addressed in a single term of government. Voters who discover that Brexit brings little positive change to their lives may soon turn against a party they have long disliked and still distrust.The Conservatives’ future troubles are as nothing compared with the existential crisis facing Labour. The electorate has rejected Corbyn and Corbynism, but loyalists to the radical cause control the commanding heights of the party. Its future direction now lies in the hands of the huge membership Corbyn attracted, who will soon be asked to choose his successor.

Parliament returns on Tuesday and then the Queen’s speech will take place on Thursday, before the introduction of the Brexit bill by the end of the week."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b01227acf7a3b6d192d69a33346c07de3975815e/0_302_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d8ceca7b7489ce211cddb234b28a32c","title":"under jeremy corbyn a window opened now its slammed shut","story":"In the Jolly Gardeners pub in Putney, it was business as usual on Friday night. A gang of girlfriends competed for noise against a Christmas work do, while one table of friends dressed in Santa hats tucked into burgers. Amid the buzz, Joe, a 23-year-old barman, was despondent. “I joined the Labour party four years ago and obviously we got a result here,” he said, “but what does it tell you about the rest of the country?”“People keep asking where that energy goes now,” said Yasmin Lajoi, a 31-year-old music manager from Hackney. “But activism doesn’t just happen during election time, we can still fight austerity and volunteer at food banks and homeless shelters. We can still protect people and look out for each other. We will survive the next five years, but I’m worried for everyone who really needed this win.”Lajoi was among many first-time canvassers organised on WhatsApp who went to Putney, Kensington, Ruislip and Chingford to campaign for Labour. On election night she met a homeless man who said he wasn’t registered but would have voted Conservative if he could. “I am very rarely speechless, but I don’t know how to process that: you’re suffering, you’re homeless, you might not survive the next five years, but what – at least it won’t be a Polish coroner who does your autopsy?”Ethan Axelrod, a 24-year-old trainee solicitor who canvassed in Kensington, said he was “determined rather than hopeful” that his energy wouldn’t dissipate. “We need to do material things to alleviate the suffering of the worst-off in society – volunteer, give time and energy – and not think that because we’ve lost this battle that we have to give up on the issues.” Axelrod was worried most about the environment. “Comparing this to the 1980s and how awful things were then doesn’t take the climate into account, which is one massive difference. In five years, you can’t elect a Labour government and hope things will be OK again – it will be too late and the damage is irreparable.”Lajoi and Axelrod had both been inspired by Jeremy Corbyn before, but neither felt the leader should have fought this election. “We didn’t lose this election because the manifesto was too leftwing,” said Axelrod. “Corbyn is the reason a lot of people didn’t vote Labour.” Lajoi agreed. “I don’t buy into the culture of the magic grandpa, and Corbyn is too nuanced to be a politician leading a party. He doesn’t do soundbites and slogans he can’t capture the mood in a few pithy words.”Novara Media’s contributing editor Ash Sarkar, 27, disagreed. “Are you genuinely telling me that the performance would have been better if Liz Kendall had been Labour party leader?” she said. “Corbyn created a space for an anti-austerity movement that exists outside electoral politics and those people are still there. There are half a million people who feel there is space for them in this party.”The upset among young Labour voters was palpable – after all, in the 2017 election the spike in youth turnout changed political analysis, with age replacing class for the first time as the best predictor of voting intention. Yet despite a record number of 18- to 24-year-olds registering, turnout was lower this time.Maliha Reza, a 22-year-old master’s student, said she had been canvassing almost every evening. “I am fearful of what five more years of this looks like,” she said. “Corbyn’s willingness to listen to young people like me is what drew me to the party. The politics of hope was refreshing. Now I’m frightened for our future.”What did she think went wrong? “It’s difficult to pinpoint the result to one specific event, it’s something we need to analyse over the coming weeks. I do believe this election was riddled with heavy anti-immigrant sentiments and an overall resentment against minority groups by the Conservatives. But knowing the devastating impact this government will have on the most vulnerable in our society is what pushes young activists like us.”It’s a sentiment Joe shared, while pulling a pint. “The whole Tory campaign was fought on racist, nationalistic principles. We need a change to be able to fight that and Corbyn can’t connect.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d33a436ecd9e647542124f55d1023d39783594d/0_213_3431_2059/master/3431.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a8aca0f20674c3ba260e7139eb07f1c","title":"tiger woods leads usa to stunning comeback victory in presidents cup","story":"The USA have completed a historic Presidents Cup triumph over the Internationals at Royal Melbourne. Led by inspirational playing captain Tiger Woods, the US turned a 10-8 overnight deficit into cup glory after dominating Sunday’s singles session.Wins for Woods, Dustin Johnson, Patrick Cantlay, Xander Schauffele and the maligned Patrick Reed, two halved matches plus a guaranteed half point for Matt Kuchar were enough to secure the star-studded Americans a 16-14 victory.Kuchar, who had lost all four of his previous Presidents Cup singles encounters, clinched victory with a birdie on the 17th hole to go one up against Louis Oosthuizen.Oosthuizen had been three up at the turn before Kuchar produced a tenacious back-nine comeback as the US became the first team in the event’s 25-year history to win the cup after trailing into the final day.“It was an honour for me as a player and even more of an honour to be their captain,” Woods said. “It’s been one of the more amazing challenges but all the guys, they believed in one another. We relied on one another as a team and we did it together.“I trust all my 11 guys. I trust them implicitly I told them from the very get go. They went out there and got the points we needed. This cup wasn’t going to be given to us. We had to go earn it, and we did.”Woods sparked the US fightback when he downed the Internationals’ previously unbeaten spearhead Abraham Ancer three-and-two in the opening singles match. In doing so, the 15-times major champion became the most prolific winner in Presidents Cup history, surpassing countryman and career-long rival Phil Mickelson’s 26 victories in the matchplay competition.Johnson was never threatened in a four-and-three victory over Cup rookie Haotong Li that locked the scores up at 10-all. Defeat for Li earned the Chinese youngster a dubious place in the history books as the only International player not to contribute even half a point at the 2019 edition.After losing his previous three matches in a horror week, Reed gave the US the lead for the first time since Thursday morning with his four-and-two success against CT Pan. In a cruel blow for the Internationals, Hideki Matsuyama then blew a four-up lead to square with Tony Finau.Sungjae Im restored hope for the underdogs with a four-and-three win over US Open champion Gary Woodland that locked the scores up at 11.5 points apiece before Adam Hadwin scrambled to square his match with Bryson DeChambeau.But a three-and-two win for Cantlay over Joaquin Niemann, a two-and-one victory for Shauffele over Adam Scott (Internationals) and Webb Simpson’s two-and-one defeat of Byeong Hun An gave the Americans an insurmountable three-point buffer.Not even Cameron Smith’s stirring two-and-one comeback victory over the previously undefeated Justin Thomas could save the Internationals from another beating after Kuchar sealed the deal. Hometown star Marc Leishman tied Rickie Fowler in the last match.Finau credited 43-year-old Woods, the USA’s oldest player who completed one of sport’s greatest comebacks this year to win the Masters, for the Houdini act.“I was four down with eight to go and I basically told myself, ‘I can’t give up on my teammates, my guys, my captain’,” Finau said.“Tiger, the story of his resilience, coming back from what he has with injuries and everything that he’s been through, I think each of us, we just believe in each other because we know we could do what we did today, and we really believed that we could win the cup. We were kind of against the odds, but we are very inspired to play for Tiger, with Tiger, and it’s so satisfying to win this cup because of that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67184afba8b61c58a27e9dde6ff19bf1354832a8/0_349_5233_3139/master/5233.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=641e50a43303261a65d0a118cff77616","title":"what does it take to be a gold medal sprinter dina asher smith","story":"The attention after winning gold in Doha was amazing – but success really begins by staying focusedI love being the hunter. The one in pursuit. In training, I’ll latch on to the boys and chase them down. Even when I was younger, I tended to race girls who were older than me – at 17 I was racing 30-year-olds. It’s where I’m comfortable. But the hunter can go on to become the hunted. And this summer at the World Athletics Championships in Doha, Qatar, I won gold in the 200m. At 23, I became the first British woman to win a world championship sprinting title.I had no idea there was so much excitement back in the UK after my win. Growing up in Orpington, southeast London, and training for years with the Blackheath \u0026amp Bromley Harriers, I never once imagined the fuss that would come as a result of running fast. It’s a change I’ve had to mentally adjust to. The morning after the race, I was in the media tent and someone told me that I’d been mentioned in parliament and while that was, of course, lovely and exciting, I was so surprised. But I often have to separate myself from all the noise to keep focused on what’s most important to me.Track and field is a mental game. It’s about continuing to work and work when nobody’s watching. It can get repetitive and insular. You’re in your own little world, competing to be the person who can run the fastest in a straight line. My job is to take my body to a place where I think it can’t do any more and then keep going. To do that, I need to intimately know my strengths and weaknesses, and be willing to get better at the things I know I’m crap at. For me, I never used to be physically strong. I could run fast, but would wobble like a worm if I tried to do a push-up. In elite sport, even if you start to think you’re as good as you can be, you look for areas to improve.People get caught up in embarrassment or shame when they’re not good at something, but I just don’t have that in me. I do have a voice in my head that tells me if I’m not good at things, but it doesn’t make me feel negative about myself. I use it to identify where I can improve and then I just keep going to training every day.Leading into a major championship, I go into my own world for the four weeks beforehand. It’s something I’ve learned through sprinting. When you know everything’s riding on 11 seconds, whatever’s distracting you – whether it’s some boy not texting you back (not that that’s something I think about often!) or a friend being angry with you – you clear your mind of it until an appropriate time. As a race is about to start, all I’m thinking about is winning and the things I can control. Thoughts like, “Oh, that headwind is hard,” are legitimate, but if I can’t change it, worrying about it won’t help me. We have a saying, “Control the controllable.”I live for the moment just before a race in a big stadium. When we’re all standing on the line, I feel the pressure and I’m all over it. Even when I’m watching football, my favourite bit is the penalties. In those seconds, you get to see what people are made of. For spectators, sprinting is one of the most intense sports events because the margins are so small. For us competitors, there’s really nowhere to hide from the work you haven’t done. If you haven’t been eating right or if you’ve had a hole in your training, when the gun goes, it shows. And that benefits me because I work so hard.A lot of my confidence comes from my relationship with my parents. I’ve also inherited personality traits from both of them that help me in my career. My mum is excitable and when I’m on the track, I have her fire – wanting to go for everything. I always know when I finish a race that I can turn around and find her in the front row, jumping up and down. My dad is more reserved. He has a cool exterior and that’s useful for me when I need composure. I know to look for him a few rows behind my mum.Growing up, I was the only child in the house (I have a half-brother who didn’t live with us) and the three of us were tight knit. They saw that I enjoyed sport and I was fortunate that around their full-time jobs, they gave me opportunities to try whatever I was interested in. When I wanted to try golf, my dad bought me cut-down clubs and had me attempting to putt balls in the back garden. My mum used to play hockey with me outside the house. They took me to so many clubs and classes. I don’t live with them now, but we speak every day and I see them at least three times a week.I started training with my coach, John Blackie, in my mid-teens. We met when I was eight as he ran the kids’ academy at my running club. Along with my parents, the three of them always emphasised that they just wanted me to be happy. They never pushed me too early or for their own egos. And, as I’ve got older, I’ve realised that’s unique. When running became serious, I knew that if it all stopped being fun for me, I could stop doing it. They put Dina the person before Dina the runner.As my career’s progressed, making difficult decisions has helped me understand myself better. I broke my foot in February 2018, five months before the World Championships were due to take place in London. I knew that the rehab should take six to 12 months, but I also knew that I really wanted to run in front of a home crowd. I spoke to my team about doing the rehab in two to three months. I was risking causing career damage to my foot. But I knew my body healed quickly and my doctor told me that while it would be physically and emotionally hard, he thought I could do it. I meticulously calculated my decision and although the cons outweighed the pros, I felt adamant that with support and being careful, we could get it right. It paid off.Being as prepared as I can be is crucial as it keeps me calm and able to deliver in the moment. When I was studying history at uni I’d choose exams over coursework because I knew I could put the work in and perform under pressure. My degree also helped me keep what I’m doing in perspective. I was studying heavy things every day, like people facing prejudice because of their skin tone or sexuality, or women sacrificing their lives for others to have the right to vote. It made me realise how lucky I am that the thing that gets me most frustrated is somebody beating me on the track. While, yes, I make sacrifices – some easy, such as not drinking and going out, and some harder, like restricting the food that I eat – ultimately, what I do is entertainment.While I take what I do very seriously, if it doesn’t go well, I don’t take it personally. What really matters to me isn’t going to change. Yes, the public might be disappointed and the newspapers might have a pop, but my parents and friends are still going to love me, and my coach is still going to be there. That knowledge allows me to stay relaxed under pressure.Nobody goes into sport as a career for the fame, it’s too hard. Especially track. I do it because I love it and want to be the best. I never once thought I’d get on a train and be recognised by people and be asked to sign tickets. It’s lovely and I get to have a nice chat, but sometimes it can be overwhelming. So I make sure I take time for myself. I live on my own and for a day or two I’ll just do me. That means relaxing with facemasks and binge-watching Netflix. I’m currently watching Pose and RuPaul’s Drag Race (I’m so into drag culture), Greenleaf (a drama about family and deceit in an American super-church), and Bake Off. I keep thinking I’ll learn to meditate, but I haven’t got round to it.My coach and I work in two-year blocks and always have a strategy to focus on – but it’s the Olympics next year so I’m not about to detail that in public. Everyone’s asking me about Tokyo, but I’m more focused on today. My friends told me they’ve booked flights and I’m like: “Well, you know you’re going before I do, boy!” I’ve got a winter of training to get through. And then I have to start the season, see how it goes, and then actually make the Olympic team.It’s important for me to keep my hopes and dreams separate from other people’s. Mainly because they rarely align. People will project what they think my next step is, and I’m grateful everybody wants me to do well, but my next step has to be for me, not anyone else.

Naturally, this warning is pure catnip for the audience. For the show, based on Mick Jackson’s splendidly lugubrious book of the same name, springs from the time-honoured tradition of children’s stories fuelled by the morbid and the maudlin we are already eagerly anticipating the worst.It’s quite a task to adapt 10 separate stories into a single stage show, but Pita mostly manages very well, peeling them back to a few bare essentials, stitching them together with music-hall interludes – desperately upbeat melanges of pat-a-cakes, pratfalls, sand-dances and shimmies – clothing them in wilfully am-dram outfits, and looping the story of the boy who fell asleep through the evening like a melancholy refrain, each return marking the snoring passage of one more unwoken decade.Sometimes Pita’s pruning feels too severe (the boy who runs away into the woods is little more than a passing image) sometimes it preserves the shape of the story but not the psychological root that feeds it. The tale of schoolchildren and abducted aliens is suitably whimsical, but lacks the murkier undercurrents of Jackson’s original text.Yet when the elements come together, these variously surreal, twisted and of course sorry tales swell with unstated, perhaps even unspeakable meanings. The old man who rows a boat in his cellar, drifting into his own afterlife, six feet under the girl who digs up old bones, unwittingly mourning her grandfather the shipwrecked sailor who flails like a fish, foreshadowing his own gruesome fate at the hands of the fisherwomen who rescue him.Mixing mime, acting, song and dance, the piece makes considerable demands on its performers, who will doubtless grow into their roles as the run progresses. One figure who arrives fully formed is Frank Moon, a one-man band in the downstage corner who steers us through the evening with music ranging from restless klezmer to slow-footed dirge, from jangling keyboards to a woozily bowed saw, as querulous as the voice of a sensitive child."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1791438ae56baf00e3d43ef08745db41cb06d37/0_225_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6bf33318158352a03d7c966f1d8d1990","title":"rescuing run down churches friends of friendless churches england wales photo essay","story":"Sixty-odd years ago a Welsh MP along with TS Eliot and John Betjeman formed a group to save ‘ancient and beautiful’ churches from dereliction and demolition. Today, the Friends of Friendless churches keep the doors open to more than 50 of these treasuresThe Friends of Friendless Churches (FoFC) is a small charity that works to save places of worship across England and Wales, many of which face abandonment and ruin as a result of shrinking populations in rural areas.Founded in 1957 by Welsh journalist and former MP Ivor Bulmer-Thomas – a leading layman in the Church of England – the charity aims to preserve beautiful churches as public monuments that should be rightly recognised as “dispersed world heritage sites” and important components of our cultural legacy. The founding members included politician Roy Jenkins, artist John Piper, poet TS Eliot, and poet and conservation campaigner John Betjeman.According to Friends director Rachel Morley, through his vociferous campaigning Bulmer-Thomas “almost singlehandedly changed the fate of parish churches”. Having witnessed the demolition of St Peter the Less Church in Chichester in 1960, he vowed to prevent similar acts of cultural vandalism from occurring again. Bulmer-Thomas believed that “an ancient and beautiful church fulfils its primary function merely by existing. It is, in itself, and irrespective of the members using it, an act of worship. Their message is delivered – not for half hours on Sundays, but every hour of every day of every year, and not merely to those who enter, but to all who pass by.”Though Bulmer-Thomas was himself a devoted churchgoer, the mission of the Friends is not a religious one. Morley says that “we are an architectural conservation organisation”, and the aim of the Friends is to preserve beautiful places of worship as public monuments. The churches are, according to Morley, our “greatest architectural and cultural legacy … equivalent to the great cultural treasures of places such as Tuscany, Istanbul and Andalucía.”The Venerable Ambrose Mason, Archdeacon of Monmouth, says: “It is the local congregation that has the responsibility for looking after the buildings, their repair and maintenance, and if something really serious crops up – a congregation of perhaps elderly people say ‘we just can’t raise a quarter of a million pounds to repair the roof’,” so, in many cases, the decision has to be made to “walk away from the building”.This often results in churches being labelled as “unviable”, after which alternative uses for them are sought by church authorities. Morley says: “In the 1950s, many were demolished, whereas now there are better systems in place within the church commissioners and the diocese for finding an outcome.” However, this often means the buildings slip out of the “shared national heritage” into private ownership – converted into private dwellings or offices with little to no public access. Archdeacon Mason says the Friends “provide a vital role in helping to preserve the more significant local churches where the congregations have dropped to a point where they are not viable”.Morley says “These buildings are beautiful and important in and of themselves. We do not need to justify their continued existence by turning them into cafes or social security offices. The parish churches of England and Wales contain the most important art and architecture and they are vulnerable.” Many churches that are sold often appear cheap at point of purchase but due to the expense of conversion – few have electricity or water – fall into disrepair and are left locked and abandoned.The Friends has a membership of 2,000 and relies on a network of 200 volunteers around the country to keep their eyes on the buildings. Julia Pound happily describes herself as an “accidental church warden” after moving in to the property next door to Ayshford Chapel, which is cared for by the Friends. She describes her role as “sweeping it out once a week and making sure it looks loved”.In the case of St Mary the Virgin in Llanfair Kilgeddin, in Monmouthshire, the church has been cared for by a local man, Maurice Trumper, for over 25 years . The church was saved from demolition in the 1980s in what Friends chairman Roger Evans described as “a rallying point for the conservation movement” following a “tooth and nail” battle with the Church in Wales to save it. The church, an Arts and Crafts masterpiece with its original, fully restored sgrafitto paneling by George Heywood Sumner, is now the Friends’ “pride and joy”, according to Evans.Morley gives the example of the sgrafitto panels at Llanfair when describing the importance of the churches being viewed in the context of the landscapes around them. One extraordinary panel, O ye Mountains and Hills, features the landscape directly outside the church walls – the River Usk, Sugar Loaf Mountain and the tower of the nearby church of St Michael’s in Llanfihangel Gobion. Before the Friends intervention in the 1980s, the panels were scheduled to be pulled out and sent to a museum, while the rest of the building was demolished. Morley says: “The art and artwork in churches is worthy of being in any national museum. What is brilliant is that it is in context, and that could be in the middle of a field or sitting at the side of a road, and that is hugely important. Most of our churches are open 247 and we want the public to enjoy them and celebrate them because we are so lucky to have them.”The perseverance on behalf of the local communities surrounding the churches is demonstrated by the case of St Mary of the Angels in Brownshill, Gloucestershire, when in 2011 villagers purchased the church from the diocese and entrusted its care to the Friends in perpetuity. One of the great fears of the FoFC is that short-sighted decisions on behalf of church authorities looking to balance the books could seriously and irrevocably damage the nation’s greatest architectural legacy – removing centuries old buildings from existence or public access over the course of a single generation. Nearly half of the Grade I-listed buildings in England are churches, and around 30 are put up for sale or closed every year.The Friends receive no public funding in England and only modest support from the Church of Wales. Otherwise, they are entirely reliant on support from their members and donations from the general public. Though many churches petition the Friends for support, they don’t have the budget to rescue all those that are in need. In fact, the organisation has a long list of churches that are under threat or that in some cases have been closed and have stood locked and deteriorating for over 12 years. “There are more churches added to our list every quarter. Some have been on this list for well over a decade,” says Morley.The Friends stress that cared for and cherished should not mean fossilised, and instead they want offer their churches for public events such as concerts, knitting groups, seasonal lectures, art exhibitions, supper clubs and the occasional religious ceremony. They intend to carry on working tirelessly to preserve what Shakespeare described as our magnificent “sermons in stone” for generations to come."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f280366017263e7f239df425c147ede859e3ff7c/0_12_3307_1985/master/3307.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b94a809f1dd6e314bd3279e20d61ca98","title":"gavin stacey doctor who dracula your ultimate guide to christmas tv","story":"TV quizzes, sitcom specials and an audience with Kylie - plus Adam reunites with Joe for a festive podcast and 007 heads over to a Highlands pile by  Ellen E Jones,  Jack Seale,  Graeme Virtue and  Phil Harrison .

Christmas Day, 7.30am, 8pm, 4.20am, Sky Cinema PremiereFinding DoryAnother animated undersea search for a lost fish?

Christmas Day, 3.10pm, BBC OneThe OthersA distinctly chilly and unsettling horror story, this.

papers detail us dysfunction we did not know what we were doing","story":"A key theme of the trove of documents published this week was the lack of coherence in Washington’s approach to Afghanistan from the outsetIn the midst of Barack Obama’s much-vaunted military surge against the Taliban in Afghanistan in 2010, Hayam Mohammed, an elder from Panjwai near the Pakistani border confronted an officer from the US 101st Airborne who had come into his village.That surge, which like so many other initiatives in Afghanistan’s long war was celebrated as a huge success, today serves only as a grim reminder of the deception and failure revealed in the explosive Afghanistan papers published by the Washington Post this week.Like that secret history, the Afghanistan Papers’ accumulated oral history depicts a war mired in failure – in sharp contrast to the “misleading” story told to the US and British publics by officials in massaged figures and over-optimistic assessments.But even if that deception has been the main focus of reporting, the hundreds of interviews – with senior generals and Afghan governors, with ambassadors, aid officials and policy advisers – also tell another story: how successive presidents from Bush through Obama to Donald Trump, publicly rejected “nation-building” but created a violent, corrupt and dysfunctional state only barely propped up by US arms.They detail too how – like the Soviet Union before them – the US and its allies came so badly unstuck in Afghanistan through a combination of hubris and ignorance, and with a political leadership – both under Obama and Bush – more concerned with domestic politics than the impact of their decisions on Afghanistan.Reading at times like an extended exercise in blame, the interviews trace a widespread desire among participants to nail down an original sin for the failures in Afghanistan even to seek an exculpation for a conflict that has cost $1tn and the lives of tens of thousands over almost 20 years.From the shortcomings of the US military’s newly rewritten counter-insurgency doctrine – described by one interviewee as “colonial” in its conceit – to a tolerance of widespread corruption and “warlordism” blamed for fueling the resurgence of the Taliban, a key theme of many of those who spoke to Sigar was the lack of coherence in Washington’s approach to Afghanistan from the outset.From the very beginning, as Richard Haas – the former US government policy coordinator for Afghanistan – confided in his interview, there was little enthusiasm in George W Bush’s White House for the country once the Taliban was driven out in 2001.Other interviewee subjects, however, place the initial failure even further back: with the original decision to elide the Taliban with Osama bin Laden’s al-Qaida in the wake of the September 11 attacks.Among people like Jeffrey Eggers, a former US Navy Seal and staffer on the National Security Council in the George Bush and Obama administrations, this the key point.For Richard Boucher, assistant secretary of state for south and central Asian affairs between 2006 and 2009, the contradictions in the aims framed a mission that appeared founded on impossibility.“If we think our exit strategy is to either beat the Taliban – which can’t be done given the local, regional, and cross border circumstances – or to establish an Afghan government that is capable of delivering good government to its citizens using American tools and methods, then we do not have an exit strategy because both of those are impossible.”His summation, however, was even more scathing: “We did not know what we were doing.”The lack of vision at the war’s start, which left the US and its allies racing to catch up as US attention turned quickly to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, was only exacerbated by the decisions that would belatedly get made in response to the rapidly resurgent Taliban in the middle of the last decade.“Every nation was in charge of protecting an area larger than they had forces to do so with, and if you don’t have enough forces to protect what you’re trying to do, stabilization can’t be done.”“No inidual is to blame,” he added bleakly: “The system let everyone down.”But if there is one issue with the Afghanistan papers, however, it is that they represent the views of a selection of insiders who were at one time or another invested in the success of the war, often unable to step outside the sometimes arcane disagreements they were steeped in.Austin Wright, an academic who specialises in Afghanistan at the University of Chicago, and has made a study of the declassified military records of the war, offers an outsider’s perspective from his reading of the interviews.Wright notes that many in the media have picked up on the acknowledgment by the head of Sigar, John J Sopko, asserting the US public was “misled” consistently by official accounting of progress of the war. But he believes that focus misses the fact that many in leadership positions also misinterpreted their own data concerning the nature, intentions and capabilities of the Taliban at key points in the conflict in their desire to see signs of victory.Wright points to US military and Nato surveys that indicated that at key points, including after their initial defeat, the Taliban simply withdrew either to regroup or instill a false sense of progress, echoing the observation made by village elder Hayam Mohammed at the height of the 2010 surge.“The Taliban are strategic and patient,” says Wright. “They are also skillful at manipulating the information being seen in the field to maximise any political process.“What you see – during the Obama era handover of leadership to Afghan forces for example – is a significant reduction in violence across large areas where there are foreign forces. But what the survey data also showed was a continuing Taliban presence, not necessarily fighting but not going away.“Then, when you see the actual physical withdrawal of US troops, you see an increase in violence again. What that tells you is that they have been sitting it out to until the cost of re-intervention becomes too high.”The sense of overdue re-evaluation is not confined to just those interviewed by Sigar but shared by many who served in senior roles in Afghanistan.“I remember thinking at the time I was running around Helmand that we should be able to do this, whatever that thing was,” a former British diplomat who served in the region told the Observer.“But in retrospect, it was not realistic because while we were pissing into sand in Helmand you have to look at bigger picture.“And by the time people realised that the Taliban were coming back it was too late.”A very reasonable question was what would have happened if the international community had delivered the investment and committed the resources in 2003-04 that were delivered 2008-10.The diplomat responds to a point made by Gen Dan McNeill, the former US and Nato commander in Afghanistan, Dan McNeill, who in his interview with Sigar complained that even before his first deployment in 2002 he could not find anyone able to give him a definition of what “winning meant”.“If you can’t define ‘winnable’ how do you define if the war is lost. What is clear,” he added looking to the future, “is that there is going to be an ongoing low level of commitment for a long time to come in terms training and in terms of trying to prevent Afghanistan becoming a serious problem again.“You can argue that you are preventing Afghanistan being used as an operational base for the really bad guys, but then there are plenty of other options for them. In terms of what we were trying to achieve does that mean loss?” He thinks for a moment.“It probably does. Certainly we took a bloody nose.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c19b3670ee31ad61845983ba70dee905c08c3fcf/0_150_3264_1958/master/3264.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c8d4d2a9159a0d4d4212b75a79e12cc","title":"alaska newspaper skagway sale","story":"Larry Persily hopes to pass the Skagway News on to a committed journalist willing to live in a town of 1,000An Alaska newspaper publisher is ready to hand his operation to a new owner at an unbeatable price: $0.Larry Persily, a longtime journalist who runs the Skagway News in the state’s panhandle, is willing to give away the small-town paper to a multi-talented professional who can ensure it a bright future.Persily bought the Skagway News in April, after a friend, who founded it in 1978, talked him into it, he said. Under the previous owners, it had been struggling financially as staff came and went. Persily hoped to reverse its fortunes, but that was more difficult and costly than he had expected. Then came a turning point: the editor quit after a year.“I reached a conclusion,” Persily, 68, said. “The owner, the editor, the reporter, the publisher, the subscription-taker has got to be the same person, who is part of the community, lives there year-round.” He figured he couldn’t sell a money-losing operation for much, and anyway, “I don’t care about the money as much as I’d like it to survive.”Persily hopes to pass the reins to a committed journalist willing to live in Skagway, a town of 1,000. Ideally, it would be someone who has lived in Alaska and knows the state’s quirks. “It’s weird up here,” he said. “It’s weirder than Sarah Palin is weird.” Getting to the printer requires a 125-mile drive through snow and ice over a mountain pass. Businesses close in the winter and there’s just one grocery store. Persily describes it as, if not an isolated life, then a “self-motivated” one.The current staff is tiny: following the editor’s departure, it’s just Persily and an administrator who works three-quarter time. Persily’s ideal candidate also knows the ins and outs of working at a small-town paper. “You have to be cognizant of the fact that a lot of people get uncomfortable when you stick a microphone into their face,” he said. With a circulation of 550, don’t expect to be breaking stories of national importance do expect to be attending lots of local events.And given that the new boss will be reporting on neighbors, they may sometimes need to balance others’ personal needs with hard-nosed journalism. “You’ve got to learn how to be honest and credible, but also how to be understanding and accommodating of a small town.” Persily tells the story of a man caught driving under the influence: “He called and said look, I know I got busted … I know you put the names in the paper. But my grandma’s dying, they figure about a week – can you just hold off on it until she’s dead?”Persily agreed. “Is the Columbia Journalism Review gonna condemn me for holding three lines on a police blotter for a week? No,” he said. “You just have to be attuned to different lives and priorities and not play gotcha.”He calculates that the person, or couple, who takes over the paper can expect to pay themselves about $50,000. That’s enough, he says, to live reasonably comfortably in the town, which gets about a million visitors a year via cruise ship. More than half the paper’s revenue comes from a visitor’s guide, made to look like an old-fashioned newspaper.“They’ll be able to eat and clothe themselves and have cable TV,” Persily said. “Will they be able to afford a second home in Barbados? I don’t think so.”Even if that picturesque second home is out of reach, Skagway, part of the Klondike Gold Rush national historical park, offers beauty of its own.

It’s actually just how you say ‘house’ in Scotland,” she laughs, “it’s just a bit of fun.”Be that as it may, it’s a name that captures a lot about what makes Glasgow’s haven of gorgeous Nordic homeware such a unique delight to visit. Both in terms of its synergy of fine Scandi and Scottish design (“hus”, pronounced the same way as Hoos, happens to be the word for “house” in the three main Scandinavian languages), and also its welcoming sense of warmth and character. Never more so than in the run-up to Christmas, when Harvey and her staff embrace the rich northern European tradition of bringing cosy light and comfort to long, dark winter nights, with their twinkling decorations and friendly, personalised approach to helping customers pick just the right presents for family and friends.Home has been at the heart of 63-year-old Harvey’s entire working life, in different ways. For 30 years she lived in Suffolk, leading two charities that did revolutionary things in improving the lives, living circumstances and futures of vulnerable young people (she received an MBE for her services). A mixture of professional and personal circumstances led her back to her native Glasgow a few years ago, where she decided to take an entirely new career direction.“I’ve always had an interest in interiors and design, even though that’s not my background at all,” Harvey explains. “Scandinavian design has always been my sort of personal aesthetic, so when I was thinking: ‘OK, what brands do I want to do?’ they were the only ones for me.” She leased small premises on, at that time, a dilapidated stretch of Great Western Road, just off the west end of Glasgow’s central artery Byres Road, and with the support of her architect partner Bill, cleverly transformed the compact space into an immaculately laid out, bright and inviting oasis of select hard and soft furnishings, cool kitchen and tableware, lush green house plants, stylish rainwear, handmade fashion accessories and other assorted pretty things.Starting a new business in a new sector would be a daunting challenge for anyone, but Harvey took it in her stride. “I had to go to Copenhagen and be interviewed by some of the brands, because they’re very particular about what kind of shops they’re going in to,” Harvey reveals. She evidently impressed, because Hoos has become one of the few stockists in the UK for a host of hip makers such as Hay, Normann Copenhagen and Skagerak, to name just a few. “Most of my jewellery is by Glasgow School of Art graduates,” Harvey explains. “We also do textiles by Scottish makers. You’re not going to find these kinds of things in any other store either.”Business is going strong for Hoos, as it helps lead a local high street revival. Harvey is passionate about fostering a thriving community along Great Western Road, which has seen a host of great vintners, victuallers, boutiques, bookshops, bakers and cafes breathe new life into a historic strip of retail premises. She’s involved with Love Great Western Road, a Business Improvement District (BID) proposal encouraging local businesses to work collectively for a brighter, more prosperous commercial future. “It’s helped us to get to know one another,” Harvey says of BID. “We’ve become like a little family of shops – we look out for one another.”As well as local retailers pulling together to support each other, they all rely on their customers doing the same. By reminding people #WhereYouShopMatters, Visa is championing local, independent retailers to help restore richly deserved focus and footfall to our high streets. Not only because our high streets are at the heart of our communities, but also because great independent traders can offer unique and enriching retail experiences, where staff take a hands-on approach to helping you select special things for yourself and for the important people in your life. Shops like Hoos are working hard to not only redefine what it means to be a small, independent trader in the digital age, but also help revitalise our high streets for a new generation, and they deserve to be shouted about for it.“I’m really encouraged by Visa’s #WhereYouShopMatters initiative,” says Hoos’s Karen Harvey, “because it brings businesses like ours to people’s attention. Particularly among younger people, who I think are the ones who increasingly do most of their shopping online. If it brings Hoos to their attention for maybe the first time, obviously that’s fab. And then they’ll come to Great Western Road more often and see all the other fabulous shops too.”Here are some of Harvey’s top tips for great Christmas shopping experiences in her local area:Love and Squalor“A small shop just past Kelvinbridge. Rebecca is the owner and she sells clothes that she handmakes herself. So it’s like going back to how it used to be many years ago. She also buys in things such as wonderful socks and lovely Irish scarves, blankets and candles. It’s just a really nice experience going in there.”427 Great Western Road, Kelvinbridge, G4 9JACottonrake Bakery“A fabulous independent bakery, doing wonderful bread, cakes and bakes.

I don’t think it is credible we would reconvene after Easter,” he told Newstalk on Sunday.There are 34 sitting days, he said, between the return of the Dáil in January and Easter.“It is not tenable that the Dáil will continue on an indefinite week to week basis so there has to be certainty and clarity brought to the situation.”Mr Martin said there is “no point in going back on the 15th of January if you don’t have clarity and certainty about that session because you can’t live from week to week. There will be complete uncertainty”.He said if a date is not set, “tactics and manoeuvring will take place over substantive work”.“In the time that is left, it is a tidying up- period really if we are honest,” he said.Mr Martin said he wanted to ensure in the remaining time that an extension to the threshold for medical card eligibility for over-70s is agreed and that legislation on electoral transparency passes.He also said legislation to allow for medical open disclosure must also be passed.Speaking on RTÉ’s The Week in Politics, Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed described Mr Martin’s letter as “bizarre” and said Fianna Fáil can collapse the Government at any time.Speaking RTÉ News at One, Tánaiste Simon Coveney said Micheál Martin was “slow off the mark”.“Eighteen months ago the Taoiseach wrote to Micheál Martin requesting that they agree a date in May to provide stability. So Micheál Martin is a bit slow off the mark. I am not going to add to more speculation. The Taoiseach made it clear that he is happy to meet Micheál Martin at the end of the Dáil term to talk about these issues, that is effectively at the end of the week.”He said his focus was on trying to “steer Ireland to a safe ground in context of Brexit challenges” and said the next phase of Brexit talks will “dominate for at least another 12 months”.Speaking on Saturday, Mr Varadkar said he was focused on the job and not an election.“My preference has always been for a summer election but that may not be my call,” he said.“My focus is on my job, not on election planning.“The papers may be focused on elections, but I’m not."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4114663.1576255332!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"varadkar says bare bones trade deal may replace no deal brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLeo Varadkar  in Brussels on Friday. The Taoiseach said Boris Johnson had a ‘very strong personal mandate. . . It’s up to him to decide how he wants to use it.’ Photograph:  Kenzo TribouillardAFP via Getty ImagesTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has said a “bare bones” trade agreement between the EU and the UK may be possible late next year if a full trade agreement cannot be negotiated in time, as most EU leaders expect.EU leaders attending the summit in Brussels acknowledged that the UK would now leave the EU in January, but most do not believe a trade agreement can be agreed before the transition period ends next December – raising the prospect of another “cliff edge” in 12 months’ time.However, speaking to journalists after the conclusion of the summit, Mr Varadkar said it “may be possible to put together some kind of bare bones agreement to cover some aspects of it”.He said this would “not be ‘no deal’ in the sense that we used to talk about no deal” because of the guarantees in the withdrawal agreement.Earlier, Mr Varadkar warned against moves towards a united Ireland in the wake of Northern Ireland result, which saw unionist losses and gains for nationalists and the Alliance Party.Mr Varadkar said while the “tectonic plates” were shifting in the North, the focus should be reviving the powersharing institutions, rather than pushing for a united Ireland.PowersharingHe said there was now “no unionist majority, no nationalist majority and an ever-expanding centre ground”.He added: “The one thing that hasn’t changed for Northern Ireland is that the best future for Northern Ireland is one based on powersharing and one based on reconciliation, one based on bringing all communities together. And the next step in that has to be getting the Executive and Assembly up and running before January 13th.”On Brexit, Mr Varadkar said that he agreed with French president Emmanuel Macron who told the council meeting there should be “no quotas, no tariffs and no dumping” – referring to the need for the UK to uphold European standards of worker protection and product standards if it was to benefit from open access to the European market.“That’s the kind of space we’re in as the European Union,” Mr Varadkar said.Asked “which Boris will turn up” at talks, Mr Varadkar said he had met Mr Johnson on a few occasions and they had spoken a lot on the phone “but I certainly can’t read his mind, nor do I know his mind”. “But if I had to guess, I think he is somebody who is an economic and social liberal. And he’s somebody who is going to want to have a close relationship with the European Union, and will want us to have a trade deal as close and also a future relationship that goes beyond trade into an economic partnership, citizens rights and also a political partnership too. But that all remains to be seen.”He added that Mr Johnson had a “very strong personal mandate . . . It’s up to him to decide how he wants to use it.”‘Absolute caveat’Mr Varadkar said Ireland would be an advocate in Europe for the UK to have a close economic and political relationship with the EU – “but with the absolute caveat that it can never undermine the European Union”.“We’re in a different place and we’re in a more vulnerable place in a lot of ways, so we need to maintain our place at the centre of the European Union – but also we need to maintain a close relationship with our nearest neighbour. So that’s going to be a challenge, but I think it’s one we can navigate,” he said. Mr Varadkar said EU leaders in their private discussions had stressed the importance of maintaining unity among the EU member states behind chef negotiator Michel Barnier’s task force.The Taoiseach said that would be difficult because the interests of EU countries would erge in the trade talks. “So we need to stick together and we need to maintain solidarity and unity, and that’s what we intend to do.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4115936.1576420246!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"chinese broadcaster drops arsenal game over uighur remarks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA supporter of China’s Muslim Uighur minority holds a placard of Arsenal’s Turkish origin German midfielder Mesut Ozil past East Turkestan flags during a demonstration at Beyazid square in Istanbul on December 14, 2019. - Arsenal’s Mesut Ozil, a German footballer of Turkish origin, expressed on December 14, 2019 support for Uighurs in Xinjiang and criticised Muslim countries for their failure to speak up for them. (Photo by Ozan KOSE  AFP) China’s state broadcaster CCTV, the country’s main television distributor of English Premier League football, dropped plans to air a Sunday match between Arsenal and Manchester City after star midfielder Mesut Özil spoke out about Beijing’s treatment of Uighur Muslims.The incident makes Arsenal the latest victim of Beijing’s efforts to force western companies to follow its political agenda after the National Basketball Association faced a backlash in China when Houston Rockets executive Daryl Morey tweeted support for the Hong Kong protesters.Arsenal attempted to distance itself from the comments of its popular star on Saturday. In a statement posted on Weibo, a Twitter-like service, the Premier League football club said Özil’s remarks were his personal opinion. “As a football club, Arsenal has always followed the principle of not interfering in politics,” said the statement.Despite these comments, CCTV removed the match, which was due to air on Sunday at midnight from its broadcast schedule less than 48 hours after Mr Özil, a Turkish-German football player, posted the messages on Twitter and Instagram that blamed both China for its persecution of the Uighur ethnic group and Muslim countries for their silent response.“Korans are being burnt. Mosques are being shut down. Muslim schools are being banned. Religious scholars are being killed one by one,” said the Arsenal player in Turkish tweets. “Despite all this, Muslims stay quiet.”“What will be remembered years later would not be the torture by the tyrants but the silence of their Muslim brothers,” Mr Özil added.China has rounded up more than one million Muslims, mostly Uighurs, in reeducation camps in the northwestern region of Xinjiang, according to human rights groups, creating one of the largest ethnic persecutions in recent history. However, Muslim countries have been reluctant to criticise Beijing over its Xinjiang policies.China’s local press and social media has been flooded with criticism of the football star, while the Chinese Football Association told local media that it was “extremely angry and disappointed” to hear “a famous soccer player like Özil make such inappropriate remarks”.“What Ozil said has clearly hurt his Chinese fans and Chinese people in general,” said CFA. “It is unacceptable.”Chinese netizens have demanded Arsenal go further and make similar comments to those it made on Weibo on its Twitter and Instagram accounts.“It is hypocritical for Arsenal to respond only in China but not in its home country,” said a comment on Weibo.CCTV plans to replace Arsenal’s match with a taped game between Tottenham Hotspur and Wolverhampton Wanderers."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4115872.1576414555!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"cop25 climate talks end with key carbon markets decisions postponed for year","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tActivists from international climate action group Extinction Rebellion protest after dumping manure outside the UN Climate Change Conference COP25 in Madrid. Photograph: Oscar del PozoAFP The UN climate change talks in Spain are ending with COP25 negotiators postponing key decisions on reform of global carbon markets and on funding for countries most vulnerable to global warming.After two weeks of negotiations in Madrid, and a weekend of continuous talks, efforts to scale up ambition achieved some progress, but key issues have been pushed forward to COP26 in Glasgow next year.Delegates from almost 200 nations have passed declarations calling for greater ambition in cutting planet-heating greenhouse gases and in helping poor countries suffering the effects of climate disruption – while more than 120 countries committed to achieving “carbon neutrality” by 2050.But despite holding the longest ever climate talks ever in 25 years, they left one of the thorniest issues – Article 6 of the 2015 Paris Agreement – unresolved. Agreeing a rulebook with reform of carbon trading to end loopholes availed of by big emitting economies had topped the agenda.Environmental groups and activists have accused the world’s richer countries of showing little commitment to seriously tackling climate change, which they claimed resulted in a weak outcome.The closing plenary session is continuing.The Madrid talks were viewed as a test of governments’ collective will to heed the advice of scientists to cut greenhouse gas emissions more rapidly in order to prevent rising global temperatures from hitting irreversible tipping points. But the conference was expected to endorse only a modest declaration on the “urgent need” to close the gap between existing emissions pledges and the temperature goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement to tackle climate change. Many developing countries and campaigners had wanted to see much more explicit language spelling out the importance of countries submitting bolder pledges on emissions as the Paris process enters a crucial implementation phase next year. “These talks reflect how disconnected country leaders are from the urgency of the science and the demands of their citizens in the streets,” said Helen Mountford, vice president for climate and economics, at the World Resources Institute think-tank. “They need to wake up in 2020.” Brazil, China, Australia, Saudi Arabia and the United States had led resistance to bolder action, delegates said, as the summit - known as COP25 - began wrapping up. It had been due to finish at the two-week mark on Friday but has run on for two extra days - a long delay even by the standards of often torturous climate summits.Weak response Earlier at the talks, Chile triggered outrage after drafting a version of the text that campaigners complained was so weak it betrayed the spirit of the 2015 Paris Agreement. The process set out in that deal hinges on countries ratcheting up emissions cuts next year. The final draft did acknowledge the “significant gap” between existing pledges and the temperature goals adopted in 2015. Nevertheless, it was still seen as a weak response to the sense of urgency felt by communities around the world afflicted by floods, droughts, wildfires and cyclones that scientists say have become more intense as the Earth rapidly warms. “COP25 demonstrated the collective ambition fatigue of the world’s largest (greenhouse gas) emitters,” said Greenpeace East Asia policy advisor Li Shuo. The Madrid talks became mired in disputes over the rules that should govern international carbon trading, favoured by wealthier countries to reduce the cost of cutting emissions. Brazil and Australia were among the main holdouts, delegates said, and the summit seemed all but certain to defer big decisions on carbon markets for later. “As many others have expressed, we are disappointed that we once again failed to find agreement,” Felipe De Leon, a climate official speaking on behalf of Costa Rica. “We engaged actively, we delivered our homework, and yet we did not quite get there.” Smaller nations had also hoped to win guarantees of financial aid to cope with climate change. The Pacific island of Tuvalu accused the United States, which began withdrawing from the Paris process last month, of blocking progress. “There are millions of people all around the world who are already suffering from the impacts of climate change,” Ian Fry, Tuvalu’s representative, told delegates. “Denying this fact could be interpreted by some to be a crime against humanity.”–Additional reporting Reuters "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4113348.1576163003!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"how did finland s sanna marin become the world s youngest prime minister","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Finland’s new prime minister  Sanna Marin. “I want to build a society where every child can become anything and every person can live and grow in dignity.”   Photograph: Kimmo BrandtEPA The ascent of Finland’s Sanna Marin to become the world’s youngest prime minister may be a victory for youth and vigour, but what Finns really want from her is “sisu” – the Finnish word for the quiet, steely stoicism and courage that gets things done without a fuss. Marin’s appointment and the fact that her government is made up of 12 women, some younger than herself and among them four party leaders, and seven men attracted attention from around the world, but it came as no shock to the Finns. The Social Democrat may be young, but she is no political ingenue she cut her political teeth as chair of the Tampere city council, and YouTube clips of her steering sometimes heated council meetings played a large part in her rise to national prominence.She took over as de facto leader of the Social Democrats when her predecessor as prime minister, Antti Rinne, fell ill, and she performed well in the parliamentary elections in April as the party gained six seats and was the biggest in parliament. As a result, Marin was appointed minister for transport and communications before replacing Rinne when he was pushed out by their coalition partners. “I want to build a society where every child can become anything and every person can live and grow in dignity,” she said on Twitter as her appointment was confirmed. But in some ways Finland is already there. Marin is something of a poster child for the egalitarian Nordic model of social democracy. Raised by her mother and her female partner, she comes from what she calls a “rainbow family” and moved around a lot as a child.She worked in a bakery and as a cashier while taking advantage of Finland’s generous education system to get her degree in Administrative Science. She joined the youth wing of the Social Democratic party and stood for election in Tampere in 2008, but failed to get elected. Undeterred, she stood again in 2012 and was successful, rising to chair of the city council a year later at the age of 28. Despite her humble beginnings and relative lack of experience, she has now reached the pinnacle of Finnish politics.“This is the biggest political event in Finland in many years,” says Maria Bäck, lecturer in political science at the University of Helsinki. “I’m not that surprised that she has become prime minister – it’s probably down to this Nordic model of equality, both economically and socially, and It is a little bit special now. Apart from the prime minister being a young woman, we have several other young women at the top of politics.Difficult time“It’s also interesting for the Social Democrats, because their support is mostly among those who are older, so to have young women coming up as leaders in the Social Democrats and the Centre Party is quite special, it’s clear that these parties both need and demand change in their structures, to try in some way to take into account changes in society and attract younger voters,” she added.The 34-year-old Marin takes the reins in this country of 5.5 million at a difficult time. Labour disputes have led to some of the country’s biggest companies grinding to a halt as strikes break out. Then there is the constant battle to continue to deliver the high level of services expected by the people along with balancing the books in a nation that has struggled to recover since the global downturn in 2008. Part of the political instability in Finland can be put down to the arrival on the scene of the right-wing populist and Eurosceptic Finns Party as a force in the last decade, an event that has put the cat among the political pigeons both in government and opposition parties. The more traditional parties like the Social Democrats, the Centre and the Agrarian Party are essentially conflict-averse, and for years have put their differences aside to form coalitions for the common good. The Finns Party seemingly have no time for such niceties. “All of the traditional parties have lost support, some more, some less, to the Finns Party and they are struggling to win back their voters,” says Jenni Karimäki, a colleague of Maria Bäck in the political science department at the University of Helsinki. “This is especially hard to do as a government party since traditionally governing parties tend to lose support no matter who is in the opposition.”Recent opinion polls show that the Finns Party are now the most popular in the country. “This presents an ideological challenge – is it possible to co-operate with the Finns Party in the future? To make them take part in government responsibly seems like the only way to decrease their support, but is a coalition government with them really a possibility, especially ideologically?” says Karimäki.With the Finns Party continuing to ignore the previous tradition of consensus politics, the challenge for Marin and her cabinet is to return to the stable politics and “sisu” that has characterised previous Finnish governments. Attitudinal change“Now that we have a young, knowledgeable, ambitious and quite tough prime minster who is a woman, I hope she gets the room she needs to work, and that she doesn’t feel she needs to prove that she can handle it all the time, because all eyes are on her,” says Bäck. Marin has broken much new ground, but she is not the first female prime minster in Finnish history – Anneli Jäätteenmäki had a 68-day stint as premier in 2003 and Mari Kiviniemi enjoyed exactly a year in power from 2010 to 2011 – but the composition of her cabinet is something new. The question is how long it will last. “The Finnish parliament has now the highest number of female MPs ever, so I would like to think that that was a sign of an attitudinal change, and the composition of the Marin cabinet is a continuation of this trajectory,” says Karimäki. “Political representation has become more erse – however, time will tell whether this is a permanent state of affairs, or if we will see a backlash in the future.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4115883.1576403773!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"jeremy corbyn i take my responsibility for election defeat","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLabour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn leaves his home in Islington, north London. Photograph: PA British Labour Party Jeremy Corbyn has apologised to Labour supporters over the party’s catastrophic performance in the general election.In an open letter, the Labour leader acknowledged the party “came up short” in the poll on Thursday, adding: “I take my responsibility for it.”But despite Labour suffering its worst result since 1935 - with dozens of seats falling to the Tories - he said he was “proud” the party had offered a message of “hope” in the election.Mr Corbyn was widely criticised in the aftermath of the election for failing to apologise as Labour’s hitherto impregnable “red wall” of seats in the North, the Midlands and North Wales crumbled in the face of the Conservative onslaught.In his letter to the Sunday Mirror, he said: “I will make no bones about it. The result was a body blow for everyone who so desperately needs real change in our country.“I’m sorry that we came up short and I take my responsibility for it.”The Labour leader - who has said he will stand down in the early part of next year after taking the party through a “process of reflection” - said it was determined to regain the trust of traditional Labour voters who turned against it.“We will learn the lessons of this defeat, above all by listening to lifelong Labour voters who we’ve lost in working-class communities,” he said.“This party exists to represent them. We will earn their trust back.”Writing in The Observer, Mr Corbyn insisted the policies he set out were genuinely popular and had re-set the terms of the debate in the election.“I am proud that on austerity, on corporate power, on inequality and on the climate emergency we have won the arguments and rewritten the terms of political debate,” he said.“There is no doubt that our policies are popular, from public ownership of rail and key utilities to a massive house-building programme and a pay rise for millions. The question is how can we succeed in future where we didn’t this time?”The defeat plunged Labour into turmoil with some MPs and losing candidates turning on Mr Corbyn, saying his left-wing politics had cost them votes.Allies of the Labour leader however turned their fire on Remainers who pushed the party into backing a second EU referendum, saying they had alienated Leave voters in the Labour heartlands. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the party had been caught on the “horns of a dilemma” over Brexit, and dismissed claims they had picked the “wrong” leader.He said: “I didn’t back the wrong person because Jeremy was the right leader. We could have won in 2017. Things moved on. Brexit dominated everything.”He said Mr Corbyn was “one of the most principled, honest, sincere, committed, anti-racist politicians”, but he had been “demonised by a smear campaign against him”.Mr McDonnell, who confirmed he will also be standing down when Mr Corbyn goes, added: “I think we have to have a wider debate here about the role of social media and the media overall, and sometimes the nature of our politics.“I don’t want to live in a society where those sorts of lies and smears and character-assassination dominate our politics.

He was obliged to burn some paintings just to put something in the fireplace.Nature Morte be raffled off“I think he would have been very happy, I hope he would have been proud.”Olivier’s uncle Claude Picasso  called the Christmas project: “A way for our family to continue Picasso\u0027s own commitment to the poor.”The 1 Picasso for 100 Euros project is set to become an annual event, which inverts the soaring prices of the painter’s work, making them accessible, and wedded to charity.“I think it’s quite revolutionary,” organiser Peri Cochin said in the Picasso Museum in Paris, where the prize painting currently hangs.It is hoped British generosity could see it travel across the Channel.Philippe Leveque, managing director of Care France, believes people can stand in charitable solidarity with Picasso. Ms Cochin said:  “It’s in their genes: if they can do something nice, I’m sure they can do it.”She added on British tastes: “They bet on everything. Who’s going to win the football, everything.“Here you have the generosity, and the chance to win a  great piece from a great painter.”It is hoped that the 200,000 available raffle tickets will be sold to generate almost £20 million for Care, which with numeric neatness with help 200,000 people in Cameroon, Madagascar and Morocco.Philippe Leveque, managing director of Care France, believes people can stand in charitable comradeship with the great artist.This is a chain of solidarity with Picasso, he said. The draw for the competition will take place at Christie\u0027s in Paris on January 6.  Entrants for the draw can apply online.British tourist shot and killed in Buenos Aires robberyGeneral election 2019: Jeremy Corbyn calls on supporters to join Labour in bid to keep hard-Left in control - latest newsMore than 40 injured during anti-government protests in Beirut Strictly Come Dancing 2019: the Final - Oti deserves her own Glitterball for \u0026#39Best Dressed Dancer\u0026#39Strictly Come Dancing 2019 final - the body language: Kelvin and Oti looked like they were competing in the Hunger Games Faulty valve leaves thousands without water in Leighton BuzzardMichael Gove \u0026#39absolutely\u0026#39 rules out second independence referendum ahead of Nicola Sturgeon request this weekStrictly Come Dancing 2019, grand final live: high-scoring, tear-stained finale sees favourites Kelvin Fletcher and Oti Mabuse lift glitterball trophyComment: How Boris Johnson turned me from Communist to ConservativeFive Italians sentenced to jail for gang rape of British tourist in popular holiday resortComment: For the second time in four years a leadership drawn from the left of our party has led Labour to electoral devastationComment: Boris will not betray his promise to the Leave voters who lent him their support   Comment: This political realignment has been a long time comingPoland accused of blocking holocaust remembrance plaques More than 4,000 primates will have nowhere to go when pet ban is introduced, academic warns  Half of council-owned farms have shut down, campaigners say as they call for rest to be protectedBoris Johnson faces fresh opposition to HS2 from MPs who promised voters they would oppose the lineComment: The election was a triumph for the SNP, but let\u0026#39s not label it an independence upsurge yetComment: The media were shocked to see me win, but this had been on the cards for a long timeWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/12/13/10/apple-iphone-11-camera.jpg","title":"apple spectral edge iphone camera 2020","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Future devices could feature vastly improved photo technology thanks to ‘secret sauce’Apple has acquired UK-based photography startup Spectral Edge, whose technology could soon find its way into the cameras of new iPhones.Details of the buyout are yet to be revealed by either company, though filings at Companies House show that the Cupertino company now controls the Cambridge startup.The filings, first reported by\u0026nbspBloomberg, also revealed that Apple corporate lawyer Peter Denwood\u0026nbsphas been named director of the startup.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSpectral Edge’s website, as well as all of its social media accounts, have also been taken down.Neither Apple nor Spectral Edge responded to a request for comment.Created with Sketch.Gadget and tech news: In pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

There’s been other techniques to combine the two in the past but they don’t end up with pictures that are nice to look at.”Spectral Edge is the second acquisition of a UK startup\u0026nbspfor Apple this year, following the takeover of digital marketing startup DataTiger\u0026nbspin February.The technology giant will be hoping the latest buyout can offer a critical edge over competitors when it comes to camera performance, which has become one of the key differentiators between high-end smartphones in recent years.Apple is not expected to release a new iPhone until September 2020, meaning there is plenty of time to integrate Spectral Edge’s technology into its devices.\u0026nbspBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearIn a six-part blog published from letters he wrote in\u0026nbspprison, Ulbricht\u0026nbspapplied a form of market analysis known as Elliott Wave Theory to predict new all-time highs for bitcoin.The theory forecasts the highs and lows in financial market cycles by identifying extremes in investor psychology, which in the case of bitcoin appear to be far more tempormental compared to traditional markets due to the nacency of the cryptocurrency.The principle posits that price movements in speculative markets are driven by investor expectation, which when combined with mass psychology can force prices artificially higher through a positive feedback loop of buyer optimism.Looking at the previous price waves of bitcoin, Ulbricht puts the next big wave reaching between $93,000 and $109,000 before the 17 February, 2021. He notes that his speculation should be considered with appropriate scepticism.“We have a price target... of ~$100,000 some time in or near 2020,” he wrote. “However, there is no rule that market moves have to be proportional. This is just a patter we see unfolding that may or may not continue.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It predicts that this proportion could rise to between 12 and 20 per cent over the next decade as younger people join the workforce.The 29-page guide advises staff to cut out unnecessary gendered language and provides advice on how to ask someone which pronouns they prefer when describing\u0026nbspthemselves.It suggests providing all-gender facilities, promoting visible trans and non-binary role models and ensuring forms do not only include options for two genders.“It is much simpler to refer to someone as Hilary, than ‘she’ or ‘he’, and this can avoid worries over mis-gendering,” the guide states.Managers are advised to demonstrate their commitment to inclusion by personally taking action such as adding their pronouns to their email signatures.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I said that I identified as non-binary and told people that I was saying it for the first time and everyone applauded, which was heart-warming. Then nothing really happened, apart from a few people, who said ‘well done’. It was all very low-key and remains so.”In the foreword, Mr McKenna-Coles wrote that Lloyd’s has “room for further development” on trans and non-binary inclusion.“One of the secondary threads of our research was confusion and lack of knowledge on behalf of managers and colleagues over how to handle the situation, and, with the best intentions in the world, how to make it all ‘work right’ for all parties,” he wrote.City employers are taking note of the fact that increasing ersity and inclusion is good policy and good for business.Firms in the top quartile for ersity were 21 per cent more likely to have above-average profitability than those in the bottom quartile, a study by\u0026nbspMcKinsey\u0026nbspfound last year.Lloyds of London\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The pub chain owner and prominent Brexit supporter saw the value of his stake in the pub chain jump almost 10 per cent from £487m to £531m.Mr Martin had backed the Brexit Party, which failed to secure a single seat, but he will likely be pleased with the result in any case after a Tory landslide prompted Wetherspoon shares to rise from\u0026nbsp1,482p to 1,619p.Boris Johnson’s decisive win boosted the pound and sent shares in a number of UK companies soaring\u0026nbspon the hopes that uncertainty around Brexit will now fade away.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMr Martin has been one of the few business leaders to vocally back leaving the EU. He spent £94,856 on pro-Brexit beer mats and\u0026nbsphas regularly used the pub group’s magazine to promote the benefits of leaving.The company’s updates to the stock market have also been used as a platform to rail at EU rules and bureaucracy.Created with Sketch.General election 2019: How the night unfolded Show all 27Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.227 11.28pm - First result to be announcedLabour holds Newcastle Central, albeit with a reduced majority, in the first result to be announced in the 2019 General ElectionThe Conservatives gain Blyth Valley, in the North East, from Labour in the first big upset of the night.

Wetherspoon\u0026nbsphas doubled in value since then,\u0026nbspadding more than £250m\u0026nbspto Mr Martin’s personal wealth.Earlier this week, Wetherspoon\u0026nbspalso announced plans to invest more than £200m in pubs and hotels over the next four years, creating around 10,000 jobs.New pubs and hotels will be opened, and existing pubs across the UK and Republic of Ireland will be enlarged.Most of the investment will be channelled into developments in small and medium-sized towns, but will also include larger towns and cities.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Outside and Earthling, Bowie released Black Tie White Noise. Much like the music itself, the tantalising promise of white noise is there, but is weighed down by tame formalities. It’s also just not that funny.425 James Brown – Take a Look at Those CakesJames Brown was never one for subtlety, but this title takes it to another level. Such inappropriateness makes sense when lyrics about Stevie Wonder and Ray Charles looking out for “cakes” crop up on the album. The whole thing hasn’t aged all that well.Recorded in 1994 and postponed to a 2000 release by Cher’s record label, this title actually rings true. Far less cutting edge is its stylisation into a website domain, which comes off as an artist desperate to stay current.625 Mariah Carey – Me. I Am Mariah… The Elusive ChanteuseAn absolute abomination of an album title. I can’t even begin to imagine what the idea was behind this jumbled, baffling mess of pronouns and punctuation. Probably the worst offender on this whole list.725 50 Cent – Animal Ambition: An Untamed Desire to WinAnimal Ambition: An Untamed Desire to Win is just a convoluted, roundabout way of restating Get Rich Or Die Tryin’, a pretty apt summary of 50 Cent’s failed attempts to recapture his initial acclaim throughout his career.In context, this is great. A continuation of Ghostface Killah’s critically appraised Fishscale, the album is everything a Wu-Tang Clan fan could have wanted. But without that context, the title is just strange and confusing.Named after a fight between Guns N’ Roses members Steven Adler and Ian McKagan over “spaghetti”, their codename for drugs, Guns N’ Roses’ found this joke, one that should have stayed private, funny enough to dedicate an album title to.The simplicity of this statement is absolutely hilarious, both profound and not-thought-through at all. Is pain really love? All of it? What a beautiful insight.You can almost see it spray painted on a brick wall. Kelis succumbs to the mid-Noughties image of what’s trendy with this title after doing such a stellar job of transcending it with her music up to that point.1225 Led Zeppelin – In Through the Out DoorThey really should’ve just stuck to numbering their albums. In Through the Out Door, Led Zeppelin’s final album, actually offers a fairly profound statement on retirement with the title, but does it with one of the tamest, funniest brags going.Naming your album after Kanye West’s eponymous The College Dropout is setting yourself up for failure, let alone misspelling the college that you claim to have dropped out from. It feels like an insult to even compare the albums.1425 Limp Bizkit – Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavoured WaterPerhaps the album title that’s most prestigious for all the wrong reasons, Limp Bizkit truly set the bar for terribleness with this one. The fact that they’re in on the joke doesn’t make it any less childish.1525 Van Morrison – Back on TopUsing your album title as a preemptive comment on your current status rarely fares well. You’re either going to fall short or look a bit arrogant. Unfortunately for Van Morrison, both proved true.Even country pop icon Kacey Musgraves has her blind spots. Same Trailer Different Park is knowingly cheesy, though perhaps a little too much, and is also lacking some crucial punctuation. We can forgive her, though.It’s ironic that the album widely considered Nas’s weakest is the one that explicitly draws parallels to Michel de Nostradamus, an astrologer known for having visions of the future. I wonder if Nas foresaw this album bombing so hard.1825 The 1975 – I like it when you sleep, for you are so beautiful yet so unaware of itOverly long album titles are a goldmine for pretentiousness, but what makes this so much worse than, say, a Fiona Apple album, is the unnecessary use of lower-case and the vaguely intimidating message behind it. This straight-up creepy and bizarre album title from Ted Nugent turns out to be the most memorable thing about If You Can’t Lick ‘Em... Lick ‘Em, a run-of-the-mill hard rock effort from the Eighties.2025 Oasis – Standing on the Shoulder of GiantsHow such an obvious grammatical error made it into the title is still priceless. Noel Gallagher claims it was intentional, having drunkenly written it on a pack of cigarettes after seeing it on a £2 coin. If anything, that makes it even worse.2125 Prince – Rave In2 the Joy FantasticHonestly, we could have gone with any number of Prince’s later albums here: ART OFFICIAL AGE, PLECTRUMELECTRUM, 20Ten, LOtUSFLOW3R. Instead, we went for the legend’s very first questionable title, as well as his most inscrutable.2225 Public Enemy – How You Sell Soul to a Soulless People Who Sold Their Soul?Not to nitpick but I’m not sure this is actually a question, and “Soulless People who Sold Their Soul” is a redundant phrase. Public Enemy’s timeless wit and rousing command of language gets a bit lost here.Art rock titans Simple Minds come through with one of the least descriptive and comically simple titles out there with Big Music. Even with such low aspirations set up in the title, the album somehow still managed to fall short.It pains me to include Sonic Youth here, especially one of their greatest albums, but working out that “LOVE” spelt backwards looks a bit like “EVIL” is a little primary school. Clearly not for rapper Future, though, who would also name his album EVOL in 2016.Drowning in melodrama, The Weeknd’s 2018 album My Dear Melancholy, comes off as a desperate bid to be as profound as possible. Much like the title’s hanging comma, more is promised but never delivered. Humanz, a painfully obvious title geared towards unity, actually digs into why the album landed flat in the first place expanding past their animated origins and incorporating more “humans” into the formula, the original magic is spread too thin and lost. 225 The Beatles – With the BeatlesTitles with such a distinct lack of effort were commonplace in the Sixties, so this almost gets a pass – but is it too much to ask from the greatest band of all time to do a little better?Before launching into his more experimental mid-Nineties era with 1.

In a new article in\u0026nbspThe Sunday Times\u0026nbsptitled Lauren Laverne interview: is the Desert Island Discs host out of her depth?​\u0026nbspthe presenter said: “I think it’s part of the job. People are entitled to their opinions. Some of it was constructive, some of it wasn’t. The less constructive stuff is people more or less saying, ‘I don’t like you.’ That’s fair enough.“If you do my job, it doesn’t have to be a disaster if someone criticises you certainly it doesn’t wound me in a deep way. In my personal life, I’d just lost my dad. So, really, it puts things into perspective, right?”Laverne\u0027s\u0026nbspfather had died from kidney disease not long before she\u0026nbsptook the job.The radio host also spoke about the Twitter backlash in response to her being announced as Young’s replacement, as well as the support she received from her friends.“I didn’t want to say anything in front of the kids,” she said, “but I whispered to my husband, and he looked at his phone and was, like, ‘Oh my God.’ Well, very quickly it just became an outpouring of love. So that was wonderful. It was great.”The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It predicts that this proportion could rise to between 12 and 20 per cent over the next decade as younger people join the workforce.The 29-page guide advises staff to cut out unnecessary gendered language and provides advice on how to ask someone which pronouns they prefer when describing\u0026nbspthemselves.It suggests providing all-gender facilities, promoting visible trans and non-binary role models and ensuring forms do not only include options for two genders.“It is much simpler to refer to someone as Hilary, than ‘she’ or ‘he’, and this can avoid worries over mis-gendering,” the guide states.Managers are advised to demonstrate their commitment to inclusion by personally taking action such as adding their pronouns to their email signatures.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I said that I identified as non-binary and told people that I was saying it for the first time and everyone applauded, which was heart-warming. Then nothing really happened, apart from a few people, who said ‘well done’. It was all very low-key and remains so.”In the foreword, Mr McKenna-Coles wrote that Lloyd’s has “room for further development” on trans and non-binary inclusion.“One of the secondary threads of our research was confusion and lack of knowledge on behalf of managers and colleagues over how to handle the situation, and, with the best intentions in the world, how to make it all ‘work right’ for all parties,” he wrote.City employers are taking note of the fact that increasing ersity and inclusion is good policy and good for business.Firms in the top quartile for ersity were 21 per cent more likely to have above-average profitability than those in the bottom quartile, a study by\u0026nbspMcKinsey\u0026nbspfound last year.Lloyds of London\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The shifting energy is due to how no single performance is ever the same the one constant is the German composer’s joy in creating sound, and the spaces in between. (RO)“I have learnt, when things are beautiful, to just keep on,” confides Callahan on the most laconic and nuanced album of his career. Warm grains of flute and fiddle run through the rich country soul. Masterful, minimalist storytelling guides us through summers spent painting boats and long nights in hotel bars. (HB)Twelve years after Arctic Monkeys released a debut album that shook the British rock scene out of its doldrums, the Sheffield boy wonders came up with this: a concept album about a luxury lunar resort that surgically removed the blues influences on AM and replaced them with lounge jazz and absurdist lyrics. It upset fans who wanted more of the same, and yet, frontman Alex Turner’s musical and lyrical meanderings mark one of the boldest moves by any rock band in recent memory. (RO)Richard Dawson was once a heart-on-sleeve singer-songwriter, but by 2014, the Geordie’s outré folk had made him Britain’s leading avant-bard. On his breakthrough LP, malevolent instrumentals bookend a pair of 16-minute epics, bending from the ambitiously autobiographical title track to “The Vile Stuff”, a delirious tale of a boozy school trip gone awry. (JM)550 46) Julia Holter – Have You in My Wilderness (2015)Refreshing as summer rain, the avant-garde – and occasionally difficult – Californian artist’s fourth album sees melodies splashing merrily from her keyboard. Her pretty, literate vocals spin playful mysteries of faceless lovers in raincoats and strange women on remote shores. “It’s lucidity!” Holter teased. “So clear!” A ludic, lucid dream of a record. (HB)Sky Ferreira did it her way. After years of label disputes about image and musical direction, the Californian finally decided to put her own modelling money towards financing her debut record, 2013’s Night Time, My Time. And what a record it is: melding Eighties pop with alternative rock, it brims with a wild vivacity, as squelching synths come up against gnashing guitars, vulnerable lyrics and often distorted vocals. “Everything is Embarrassing”, produced by Dev Hynes, is one of the songs of the decade. (PS)Combining rumbustious soul-rock with swampy blues grit, this four-piece from Athens, Alabama, were one of the most exciting sounds of 2012 thanks to their humdinger of a debut album. Gutsy and unrefined, Boys \u0026amp Girls is indebted to a bygone era but somehow feels fresh. It’s underpinned by powerhouse frontwoman Brittany Howard’s astonishing voice – capable of both a piercing falsetto or a guttural roar. Barack Obama would subsequently invite the band to play at the White House. (PS)When the documentarians of the future make films about the UK in the 2010s, you can bet they’ll put Michael Ebenazer Kwadjo Omari Owuo Jr on the soundtrack. The charismatic grime MC is bursting with all the self-aware anger, humour, confusion, vulnerability and creativity of his generation in multicultural urban Britain. (HB)After a run of spellbinding singles, the Norse disco maverick released this synthesis of the frivolous and cinematic: an album so casually virtuosic it seemed to have dropped out of an alien supercomputer. From crate digger space-funk to dance floor ecstasy (and a Bryan Ferry feature), It’s Album Time is endlessly replayable: a perfectly formed confection that requires no sequel. (JM)There’s a kind of telepathy that develops when a band spends as much time together as Big Thief. The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)1150 40) Christine and the Queens – Chaleur Humaine (2014)On her electropop-laden debut – the UK release of which meanders between French and English – Heloise Letissier explores the lonelinesses and triumphs of being queer. On “Saint Claude”, she steals glimpses of a feminine boy being mocked on a Paris bus, too ashamed to step in. On “Tilted”, she is newly defiant. “I am actually good, can’t help it if we’re tilted.” (AP)Inspired by the “icy altitudes” of Joni Mitchell’s open-tuned confessionals, the dubstep producer took singer-songwriting into a compelling new landscape of minimalist clicks and autotuned emotion. He sang of “testing sounds For the deaf and the forest cold” and now describes his sparse, graceful debut as “a fractured diary” reflecting “a lack of something”. (HB)In 2016, the UK was in chaos. The EU referendum produced a shock result, David Cameron resigned as prime minister, and the arguing began, as a new harder-right politics emerged. The future felt bleak. In the midst of all this, Skepta – always wary of institutions – poured gasoline over the whole mess and lit a match. Konnichiwa is an album heavy with contempt for authority a sizzling brew of jungle, UK garage and dancehall into which he pours all of his anger, frustration, fear and suspicion. (RO)Where 2008’s For Emma, Forever Ago was an exercise in sparse, solipsistic introspection, Justin Vernon’s follow-up is the sound of a man setting himself free and fully embracing the depths of his imagination. Less hermetically sealed than his debut, it\u0027s exquisite in every way, with Vernon’s soulful falsetto woven into a gorgeous patchwork of jazz, folk, ambient and electronica. He would add more autotune to his voice on later albums here it’s just perfect. (PS)There’s a glorious elasticity of both sound and spirit to the Norwegian singer-songwriter’s seventh album. Gone is the feathery folk of her early releases as she flings open the doors to big timpani, hip hop rhythms and liquid Eighties bass lines. Lyrically, she celebrated the suffragettes and her own possibilities in the face of chronic illness. (HB)A solo album from The xx’s most elusive member was the subject of rumour for a good few years the reality was better than fans could have hoped for. In Colour is a lovingly crafted tribute to the rave a kaleidoscope of beats and pulsing synths that stitch together the many moods you can find on the dancefloor, from the ecstasy of a drop to the melancholy of knowing the night must, at some point, come to an end. (RO)1750 34) Mitski – Be the Cowboy (2018)Upon the release of Be the Cowboy, Mitski described how she had “f***ed with the form, almost in ways that make me uncomfortable” – hardly surprising for an artist whose songs pivot between lullaby-like calm and reckless, scuzzy urgency. Her fifth album sits to the left of just about every box you might try to put it in, those signature distorted guitars joined by bright, bold synths, organs and show-tune pianos. Lead single “Nobody”, with its almost aggressive vulnerability, is a masterpiece. (AP)Three albums in, Kacey Musgraves worried that falling in love with her husband would affect her music. “I was a little wary,” she told The Independent last year. “I was like, ‘Man, I wonder if I’m gonna be able to write.’” She needn’t have worried. With synths and Daft Punk guitar licks added into the mix, her fourth album, which she dubbed “cosmic country”, is rich and ambitious with a subtle, psychedelic gloss, winning the Grammy for Album of the Year. (AP)For three decades, Björk has weathered professional belittlement, abuse and tragedy, always reiterating herself in song, as if it were normal to absorb so much. On Vulnicura, recorded amid a scrappy breakup, the Icelandic virtuoso snapped. Monstrous ballads meet shattered beats and siren strings, a cyclone propelled by the wisdom of age. When the dust settles, she sounds reborn. (JM)A breathtakingly brave and graceful testament from the ultimate survivor of patriarchal rock. Romance and realism, love and fear are held in perfect tension as the 71-year-old conjures shimmering myths of ye olde England, then tells a friend: “I do understand why you want no more f***ing treatment.” (HB)2150 30) These New Puritans – Field of Reeds (2013)With 2010’s Hidden, These New Puritans fashioned dancehall and medieval heraldry into pop overtures. They re-emerged with something improbably subtle: a dreamscape shorn of excess pomp, beats and even consonants, with Jack Barnett’s voice remade as an instrument. Amid ineffable neoclassical, his shy croak elevates the record, the sound of a doomed romantic awash in the music of the heavens. (JM)Released before Trump’s election and the Brexit vote, there was a dark prescience to this gleefully disruptive blast of electronica. Anohni jettisoned the gorgeous chamber pop which had brought her critical acclaim to make a radical ecofeminist wake-up call about the horrors of the violent patriarchy, drone warfare and global warming. (HB)2350 28) Joanna Newsom – Have One on Me (2010)Newsom’s third album – an elaborate, six-sided odyssey whose musical palette blends harp, tambura and kaval with drums and electric guitars – heralded a noticeable change in her voice. The removal of vocal cord nodules had shaved the edges off its trill, and its new deeper, fuller sound suited an album as intricate and aching as this. “I found a little plot of land In the Garden of Eden,” she sings on one of its best tracks, “81”, seemingly poised on the edge of religious reverence. “It was dirt, and dirt is all the same.” (AP)“Why did you cut the flower that makes me a woman?” sings the Malian artist on “Boloko”, the first African song to address female genital mutilation. Immigration and forced adoption are also challenged on a culture-shifting debut that brings a rare sweetness to the protest genre. The sensual power of Diawara’s lullsome voice and her shimmering guitar patterns remain hypnotic. (HB)As “deconstructed club music” became a buzzword, electronic artists considered how to reassemble the pieces. One pitch for how that might sound – somehow futuristic yet familiar – came from Venezuelan producer Arca. The Björk and FKA twigs collaborator’s third album relaunched her zero-gravity sound world with a secret weapon: the bruised, disarmingly operatic voice of an angel in hell. (JM)On his 69th birthday, two days before his death, David Bowie released perhaps the most extreme album of his career. Blackstar is more alien than Ziggy as inscrutable as the deepest corners of the universe. He refuses to go quietly, whether making a joyous racket on “’Tis a Pity She Was a Whore” or adding eerie buzzes and whines to album closer “I Can’t Give Everything Away” where, faced with the nearness of his own death, Bowie engages in a final tussle with his own myth. (RO)Earlier this year, Adele announced that she had split from her husband Simon Konecki. While some sympathised, others rejoiced at the brilliant break-up album that was surely on the cards. “Bunch of f***ing savages,” she joked in response to those gleeful fans. “30 will be a drum ’n’ bass record to spite you.” Cruel though it was, there was a reason for the gleeful reaction – Adele sings of heartbreak like nobody else. And never better than on 21, a sad, soulful masterpiece which on these shores is the best-selling album of the century. (AP)The French electronic pioneers brought funk back for the summer of 2013 with an album drawing heavily on the sounds of the Seventies and Eighties. Pretty much everything you need to know is in the opening salvo “Give Life Back to Music” Daft Punk tend to pop up at times where other artists are grasping frantically for something new. Random Access Memories restarted the party with good old-fashioned craftmanship and Le Daft’s undiluted love for what they do. (RO)It is striking that Lana Del Rey – the greatest artist of her generation – creates art full of meaningful observations about men and women that are deeply unfashionable outside of an Esther Perel podcast. Del Rey desires to be desired she likes it when her man makes her feel like a child she wants to die. The longing for unconsciousness is still present in NFR (I’m the void, she sings on Mariners Apartment Complex) but her most playful record to date is as close to a celebration of her world-conquering status as you are ever likely to hear. (PS)Tiptoeing to the bleeding heart of Steven’s relationship with his schizophrenic, alcoholic mother, this is an album that faces difficult truths with hushed grace. The featherlight folk acquires a remarkable bioluminescence, as the artist finds hope in “signs and wonders, sea lion caves in the dark”. (HB)ANTI’s botched rollout – Rihanna was teasing the record for years before a leak prompted a hasty free release – seems strangely fitting for an album as joyfully scattershot and unrefined as this. Dark dancehall sounds flirt with hip hop and R\u0026ampB, as the Bajan singer embraces her roots and slyly rebels against the pop tropes du jour. (AP)Having released arguably the Noughties’ defining rock album in Funeral, the Montreal six-piece began this decade with a record bathed in nostalgia. Loosely inspired by frontman Win Butler and his brother Will’s childhood on the outskirts of Houston, The Suburbs has much in common with Bruce Springsteen’s Born in the USA, with its themes of familial responsibility and personal crises. The sound is expansive there are lyrical and musical motifs throughout. If 2007’s Neon Bible was a little portentous and po-faced, this album offers moments of levity in tracks such as the shimmering synth-pop masterpiece Sprawl II. Nothing they’ve done since has been as good.St Vincent, AKA Annie Clark, has a tagline for each of her albums. This one, her third, was “housewives on pills”, though that does little justice to a record that marries uncomfortable intimacy with a cool detachment, its obtuse stories of grief, loss and lust told through angular art-rock, frenzied guitar solos and bold melodies. (AP)When his 15-year-old son died in 2015, Cave thought public grieving would be “impossible”. But he found unexpected relief in sharing his feelings with his fans. This ambient double album plays like a warm cloud of solace: direct about the agony and inevitability of loss, in awe of the love that helps us survive it.  (HB)Red is the last album Swift released before it became impossible to discuss her work without mentioning the narrative around her as a person, not just an artist. Her turn of phrase – already impressive for an artist so young – improves immeasurably from opener “State of Grace” and leads the listener to the greatest song of her career to date: “All Too Well”. The analogies and references are less spelt out, too. Then there’s the song structure, the way these songs unfurl as she dissects – with scientific scrutiny – the most intimate details of a relationship, in order to find out where it all went wrong. Red shows Swift with a newfound confidence – and at times, weariness – that can only come with experience. (RO)Brilliantly confounding, Blond keeps the spotlight fixed firmly on its creator’s voice. Tracks are stripped of any unnecessary embellishment, anything that might distract from Ocean’s hypnotic musings on love, sex and death. “Every day counts like crazy,” he sings on “Skyline To” – few lyrics capture quite so well the suffocating feeling of being dragged through life at breakneck speed. Blond is far less cohesive than its predecessor, Channel Orange, but does that really matter? Life is messy and confusing Ocean makes all of it sound beautiful. (RO)A passing comment in a New Yorker profile about being “ready to die” forced Leonard Cohen to tell fans that reports of his imminent death had been hugely exaggerated. Yet the album he was promoting, You Want It Darker, is as powerful a last testament as any artist could hope to release Cohen’s weary utterances – “I’m ready, my Lord” – are delivered in that fathomless baritone, and his meditations on mortality are bleak, even for him. The fact that Cohen did in fact die just three weeks after its release makes those themes, although it didn’t seem possible at the time, even more poignant. (RO)3850 13) Solange – When I Get Home (2019)The decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)The spooky piano and PJ Harvey’s keening howls on the opening, title track of her eighth studio album are enough to signal this album isn’t a barrel of laughs. Yet her finely wrought arrangements – echoing guitars, beautiful melodies and samples that wrongfoot the listener with their cheerfulness – form a superb kind of juxtaposition with the album’s themes. Across 12 brisk tracks, she casts a despairing eye over everything from the conflict in Afghanistan to the mass casualties of the First World War she sings in a kind of pleading tone, all the while knowing that humans are doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past. (RO)West has always been a complicated, isive, frustrating sort of genius. Never is that more on display than on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, a maximalist, genre-crushing album that looks both outwards and inwards – self-aware even in its most crowing moments – it breaks apart the myth of the American Dream. “The system broken, the school is closed, the prison’s open,” he sings on “Power”, one of the best protest songs of the century. Later, he adds, “They say I was the abomination of Obama’s nation Well that’s a pretty bad way to start a conversation.” So far, West has yet to write anything half as sharp about Trump’s nation. (AP)Robyn’s magnum opus barely even charted when it was first released at the dawn of the decade. It’s almost a compilation album of the three great EPs she released in one year, Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt 3. But, nearly 10 years on, it is rightly one of the most influential pop albums of the 21st century. Every popstar tries (and mostly fails) to emulate the silky dance-and-cry beauty of songs such as “Dancing on My Own” and “Call Your Girlfriend”. (AP)4250 9) A Tribe Called Quest – We Got it From Here... Thank You 4 Your Service (2016)After an 18-year break – and within months of co-founder Phife Dawg’s death – there were mixed expectations for ATCQ’s return. It arrived in the hubbub of election week, but the group rode into the melee like angry gods on horseback, firing out thunderous rebukes. The hip-hop odyssey delivers America’s existential reckoning, one equally suited to street protests or a recuperative headphone voyage. (JM)When you experience your first heartbreak, you feel as though you’re the only person to have ever felt pain like it. On Melodrama, written when New Zealand musician Lorde was 19 and on the cusp of adulthood, she indulges her heartache, grief, and self-pity with both tenderness and reckless abandon. This is pop music at its most precise – every synth and drumbeat fired off like a bullet from a sniper – but at its most unbound, too, finding brutal, beautiful new ways to sing about the most saturated of subjects: breaking up. (AP)Kendrick has always been a superb storyteller, but the Pulitzer Prize-winning DAMN is his odyssey, an album where he presents evidence of his greatness via a series of challenges: tests of loyalty, will, faith and perseverance. It’s an epic punctuated by schizophrenic changes in pace and track structure all the while Kendrick raps as though he doesn’t need oxygen, and you realise his greatest battle has never been with his fans, or another rapper… he’s competing against himself. (RO)After hit album Voodoo, D’Angelo almost died by various means, including addiction and a car crash. Fifteen years on, its follow-up arrived suddenly one Christmas: a grungy, deathly reanimation of the sexy, Soulquarian R\u0026ampB he helped pioneer. Its #BlackLivesMatter-referencing lyrics reveal a man renewed yet still fluttering in the crosswinds of passion and vulnerability. (JM)When footage leaked of Solange Knowles hitting and kicking Jay Z in an elevator at the 2014 Met Gala, word was that the rapper had cheated on his wife, and was receiving the full force of her sister’s wrath. Two years later, Beyoncé seemed to confirm the affair as only she could: not with a statement, but with an astonishing concept album and accompanying 65-minute film. Dipping into genres as though they’re a dressing-up box, the singer traverses the whole spectrum of emotions as she grapples with the betrayal: “My lonely ear pressed against the walls of your world,” she sings on opener “Pray You Catch Me”. “Suck on my balls I’ve had enough,” she sings on “Sorry”. (AP)A few days before this album’s release, Frank Ocean released a Tumblr post where he spoke about how, aged 19, he fell in love with his friend, a boy. At the time, many interpreted the letter to mean Ocean was coming out as bisexual, when in fact he has never felt a need to put a label on his sexuality. Channel Orange’s ever-shifting nature – the lolloping bass and his meanderings between that exquisite falsetto and richer timbres – is a beautiful statement about the paradoxes we can find in our own identity. (RO)4850 3) Lana Del Rey – Born to Die (2012)It’s easy to forget that before Lana Del Rey came along – back when Billie Eilish was barely in double figures – lo-tempo sad-pop was not the chart-hogging phenomenon it is today. Born to Die, a minimalist masterpiece, languid and lachrymose, changed that. The month of its release, a shaky performance on SNL prompted naysayers to write the singer off as a flash-in-the-pan, but the album – full of beauty, gloom and strange subservience – had staying power. As did Del Rey.  (AP)4950 2) Solange – A Seat at the Table (2016)Solange’s third album is so meticulous, so modernist in its approach to space and structure, that early listens could feel like walking admiringly around an exhibition. Then the lights go out, and a distant scream draws you into the shadows. Anguish is the true pitch of this quiet masterpiece, yet it’s impossibly graceful: an R\u0026ampB battle cry of black art against white supremacy. (JM)By 2015, Kendrick Lamar was already a grandmaster stylist. But with To Pimp a Butterfly, the Compton rapper became a cultural institution, as if summoned by the decade’s converging flash points. There was the murmur of creeping fascism, the roar of a re-energised black rights movement, and its roots in racist police shootings broadcast and protested across an infernal social media landscape. Nils Frahm’s music feels most alive when you’re witnessing it in concert, so it makes sense that Spaces, a collection of field recordings made over two years, is his most immersive and dynamic. The shifting energy is due to how no single performance is ever the same the one constant is the German composer’s joy in creating sound, and the spaces in between. (RO)“I have learnt, when things are beautiful, to just keep on,” confides Callahan on the most laconic and nuanced album of his career.

(RO)Richard Dawson was once a heart-on-sleeve singer-songwriter, but by 2014, the Geordie’s outré folk had made him Britain’s leading avant-bard. On his breakthrough LP, malevolent instrumentals bookend a pair of 16-minute epics, bending from the ambitiously autobiographical title track to “The Vile Stuff”, a delirious tale of a boozy school trip gone awry.

The charismatic grime MC is bursting with all the self-aware anger, humour, confusion, vulnerability and creativity of his generation in multicultural urban Britain. (HB)After a run of spellbinding singles, the Norse disco maverick released this synthesis of the frivolous and cinematic: an album so casually virtuosic it seemed to have dropped out of an alien supercomputer.

(HB)A solo album from The xx’s most elusive member was the subject of rumour for a good few years the reality was better than fans could have hoped for. In Colour is a lovingly crafted tribute to the rave a kaleidoscope of beats and pulsing synths that stitch together the many moods you can find on the dancefloor, from the ecstasy of a drop to the melancholy of knowing the night must, at some point, come to an end. (RO)1750 34) Mitski – Be the Cowboy (2018)Upon the release of Be the Cowboy, Mitski described how she had “f***ed with the form, almost in ways that make me uncomfortable” – hardly surprising for an artist whose songs pivot between lullaby-like calm and reckless, scuzzy urgency. Her fifth album sits to the left of just about every box you might try to put it in, those signature distorted guitars joined by bright, bold synths, organs and show-tune pianos. Lead single “Nobody”, with its almost aggressive vulnerability, is a masterpiece. (AP)Three albums in, Kacey Musgraves worried that falling in love with her husband would affect her music. “I was a little wary,” she told The Independent last year. “I was like, ‘Man, I wonder if I’m gonna be able to write.’” She needn’t have worried. With synths and Daft Punk guitar licks added into the mix, her fourth album, which she dubbed “cosmic country”, is rich and ambitious with a subtle, psychedelic gloss, winning the Grammy for Album of the Year. (AP)For three decades, Björk has weathered professional belittlement, abuse and tragedy, always reiterating herself in song, as if it were normal to absorb so much. On Vulnicura, recorded amid a scrappy breakup, the Icelandic virtuoso snapped. Monstrous ballads meet shattered beats and siren strings, a cyclone propelled by the wisdom of age. When the dust settles, she sounds reborn. (JM)A breathtakingly brave and graceful testament from the ultimate survivor of patriarchal rock. Romance and realism, love and fear are held in perfect tension as the 71-year-old conjures shimmering myths of ye olde England, then tells a friend: “I do understand why you want no more f***ing treatment.” (HB)2150 30) These New Puritans – Field of Reeds (2013)With 2010’s Hidden, These New Puritans fashioned dancehall and medieval heraldry into pop overtures. They re-emerged with something improbably subtle: a dreamscape shorn of excess pomp, beats and even consonants, with Jack Barnett’s voice remade as an instrument. Amid ineffable neoclassical, his shy croak elevates the record, the sound of a doomed romantic awash in the music of the heavens. (JM)Released before Trump’s election and the Brexit vote, there was a dark prescience to this gleefully disruptive blast of electronica. Anohni jettisoned the gorgeous chamber pop which had brought her critical acclaim to make a radical ecofeminist wake-up call about the horrors of the violent patriarchy, drone warfare and global warming. (HB)2350 28) Joanna Newsom – Have One on Me (2010)Newsom’s third album – an elaborate, six-sided odyssey whose musical palette blends harp, tambura and kaval with drums and electric guitars – heralded a noticeable change in her voice. The removal of vocal cord nodules had shaved the edges off its trill, and its new deeper, fuller sound suited an album as intricate and aching as this. “I found a little plot of land In the Garden of Eden,” she sings on one of its best tracks, “81”, seemingly poised on the edge of religious reverence. “It was dirt, and dirt is all the same.” (AP)“Why did you cut the flower that makes me a woman?” sings the Malian artist on “Boloko”, the first African song to address female genital mutilation. Immigration and forced adoption are also challenged on a culture-shifting debut that brings a rare sweetness to the protest genre. The sensual power of Diawara’s lullsome voice and her shimmering guitar patterns remain hypnotic. (HB)As “deconstructed club music” became a buzzword, electronic artists considered how to reassemble the pieces. One pitch for how that might sound – somehow futuristic yet familiar – came from Venezuelan producer Arca. The Björk and FKA twigs collaborator’s third album relaunched her zero-gravity sound world with a secret weapon: the bruised, disarmingly operatic voice of an angel in hell. (JM)On his 69th birthday, two days before his death, David Bowie released perhaps the most extreme album of his career. Blackstar is more alien than Ziggy as inscrutable as the deepest corners of the universe. He refuses to go quietly, whether making a joyous racket on “’Tis a Pity She Was a Whore” or adding eerie buzzes and whines to album closer “I Can’t Give Everything Away” where, faced with the nearness of his own death, Bowie engages in a final tussle with his own myth. (RO)Earlier this year, Adele announced that she had split from her husband Simon Konecki. While some sympathised, others rejoiced at the brilliant break-up album that was surely on the cards. “Bunch of f***ing savages,” she joked in response to those gleeful fans. “30 will be a drum ’n’ bass record to spite you.” Cruel though it was, there was a reason for the gleeful reaction – Adele sings of heartbreak like nobody else. And never better than on 21, a sad, soulful masterpiece which on these shores is the best-selling album of the century. (AP)The French electronic pioneers brought funk back for the summer of 2013 with an album drawing heavily on the sounds of the Seventies and Eighties. Pretty much everything you need to know is in the opening salvo “Give Life Back to Music” Daft Punk tend to pop up at times where other artists are grasping frantically for something new. Random Access Memories restarted the party with good old-fashioned craftmanship and Le Daft’s undiluted love for what they do. (RO)It is striking that Lana Del Rey – the greatest artist of her generation – creates art full of meaningful observations about men and women that are deeply unfashionable outside of an Esther Perel podcast. Del Rey desires to be desired she likes it when her man makes her feel like a child she wants to die. The longing for unconsciousness is still present in NFR (I’m the void, she sings on Mariners Apartment Complex) but her most playful record to date is as close to a celebration of her world-conquering status as you are ever likely to hear. (PS)Tiptoeing to the bleeding heart of Steven’s relationship with his schizophrenic, alcoholic mother, this is an album that faces difficult truths with hushed grace. The featherlight folk acquires a remarkable bioluminescence, as the artist finds hope in “signs and wonders, sea lion caves in the dark”. (HB)ANTI’s botched rollout – Rihanna was teasing the record for years before a leak prompted a hasty free release – seems strangely fitting for an album as joyfully scattershot and unrefined as this. Dark dancehall sounds flirt with hip hop and R\u0026ampB, as the Bajan singer embraces her roots and slyly rebels against the pop tropes du jour. (AP)Having released arguably the Noughties’ defining rock album in Funeral, the Montreal six-piece began this decade with a record bathed in nostalgia. Loosely inspired by frontman Win Butler and his brother Will’s childhood on the outskirts of Houston, The Suburbs has much in common with Bruce Springsteen’s Born in the USA, with its themes of familial responsibility and personal crises. The sound is expansive there are lyrical and musical motifs throughout. If 2007’s Neon Bible was a little portentous and po-faced, this album offers moments of levity in tracks such as the shimmering synth-pop masterpiece Sprawl II. Nothing they’ve done since has been as good.St Vincent, AKA Annie Clark, has a tagline for each of her albums. This one, her third, was “housewives on pills”, though that does little justice to a record that marries uncomfortable intimacy with a cool detachment, its obtuse stories of grief, loss and lust told through angular art-rock, frenzied guitar solos and bold melodies. (AP)When his 15-year-old son died in 2015, Cave thought public grieving would be “impossible”. But he found unexpected relief in sharing his feelings with his fans. This ambient double album plays like a warm cloud of solace: direct about the agony and inevitability of loss, in awe of the love that helps us survive it.  (HB)Red is the last album Swift released before it became impossible to discuss her work without mentioning the narrative around her as a person, not just an artist. Her turn of phrase – already impressive for an artist so young – improves immeasurably from opener “State of Grace” and leads the listener to the greatest song of her career to date: “All Too Well”. The analogies and references are less spelt out, too. Then there’s the song structure, the way these songs unfurl as she dissects – with scientific scrutiny – the most intimate details of a relationship, in order to find out where it all went wrong. Red shows Swift with a newfound confidence – and at times, weariness – that can only come with experience. (RO)Brilliantly confounding, Blond keeps the spotlight fixed firmly on its creator’s voice. Tracks are stripped of any unnecessary embellishment, anything that might distract from Ocean’s hypnotic musings on love, sex and death. “Every day counts like crazy,” he sings on “Skyline To” – few lyrics capture quite so well the suffocating feeling of being dragged through life at breakneck speed. Blond is far less cohesive than its predecessor, Channel Orange, but does that really matter? Life is messy and confusing Ocean makes all of it sound beautiful. (RO)A passing comment in a New Yorker profile about being “ready to die” forced Leonard Cohen to tell fans that reports of his imminent death had been hugely exaggerated. Yet the album he was promoting, You Want It Darker, is as powerful a last testament as any artist could hope to release Cohen’s weary utterances – “I’m ready, my Lord” – are delivered in that fathomless baritone, and his meditations on mortality are bleak, even for him. The fact that Cohen did in fact die just three weeks after its release makes those themes, although it didn’t seem possible at the time, even more poignant. (RO)3850 13) Solange – When I Get Home (2019)The decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)The spooky piano and PJ Harvey’s keening howls on the opening, title track of her eighth studio album are enough to signal this album isn’t a barrel of laughs. Yet her finely wrought arrangements – echoing guitars, beautiful melodies and samples that wrongfoot the listener with their cheerfulness – form a superb kind of juxtaposition with the album’s themes. Across 12 brisk tracks, she casts a despairing eye over everything from the conflict in Afghanistan to the mass casualties of the First World War she sings in a kind of pleading tone, all the while knowing that humans are doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past. (RO)West has always been a complicated, isive, frustrating sort of genius. Never is that more on display than on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, a maximalist, genre-crushing album that looks both outwards and inwards – self-aware even in its most crowing moments – it breaks apart the myth of the American Dream. “The system broken, the school is closed, the prison’s open,” he sings on “Power”, one of the best protest songs of the century. Later, he adds, “They say I was the abomination of Obama’s nation Well that’s a pretty bad way to start a conversation.” So far, West has yet to write anything half as sharp about Trump’s nation. (AP)Robyn’s magnum opus barely even charted when it was first released at the dawn of the decade. It’s almost a compilation album of the three great EPs she released in one year, Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt 3. But, nearly 10 years on, it is rightly one of the most influential pop albums of the 21st century. Every popstar tries (and mostly fails) to emulate the silky dance-and-cry beauty of songs such as “Dancing on My Own” and “Call Your Girlfriend”. (AP)4250 9) A Tribe Called Quest – We Got it From Here... Thank You 4 Your Service (2016)After an 18-year break – and within months of co-founder Phife Dawg’s death – there were mixed expectations for ATCQ’s return. It arrived in the hubbub of election week, but the group rode into the melee like angry gods on horseback, firing out thunderous rebukes. The hip-hop odyssey delivers America’s existential reckoning, one equally suited to street protests or a recuperative headphone voyage. (JM)When you experience your first heartbreak, you feel as though you’re the only person to have ever felt pain like it. On Melodrama, written when New Zealand musician Lorde was 19 and on the cusp of adulthood, she indulges her heartache, grief, and self-pity with both tenderness and reckless abandon. This is pop music at its most precise – every synth and drumbeat fired off like a bullet from a sniper – but at its most unbound, too, finding brutal, beautiful new ways to sing about the most saturated of subjects: breaking up. (AP)Kendrick has always been a superb storyteller, but the Pulitzer Prize-winning DAMN is his odyssey, an album where he presents evidence of his greatness via a series of challenges: tests of loyalty, will, faith and perseverance. It’s an epic punctuated by schizophrenic changes in pace and track structure all the while Kendrick raps as though he doesn’t need oxygen, and you realise his greatest battle has never been with his fans, or another rapper… he’s competing against himself. (RO)After hit album Voodoo, D’Angelo almost died by various means, including addiction and a car crash. Fifteen years on, its follow-up arrived suddenly one Christmas: a grungy, deathly reanimation of the sexy, Soulquarian R\u0026ampB he helped pioneer. Its #BlackLivesMatter-referencing lyrics reveal a man renewed yet still fluttering in the crosswinds of passion and vulnerability. (JM)When footage leaked of Solange Knowles hitting and kicking Jay Z in an elevator at the 2014 Met Gala, word was that the rapper had cheated on his wife, and was receiving the full force of her sister’s wrath. Two years later, Beyoncé seemed to confirm the affair as only she could: not with a statement, but with an astonishing concept album and accompanying 65-minute film. Dipping into genres as though they’re a dressing-up box, the singer traverses the whole spectrum of emotions as she grapples with the betrayal: “My lonely ear pressed against the walls of your world,” she sings on opener “Pray You Catch Me”. “Suck on my balls I’ve had enough,” she sings on “Sorry”. (AP)A few days before this album’s release, Frank Ocean released a Tumblr post where he spoke about how, aged 19, he fell in love with his friend, a boy. At the time, many interpreted the letter to mean Ocean was coming out as bisexual, when in fact he has never felt a need to put a label on his sexuality. Channel Orange’s ever-shifting nature – the lolloping bass and his meanderings between that exquisite falsetto and richer timbres – is a beautiful statement about the paradoxes we can find in our own identity. (RO)4850 3) Lana Del Rey – Born to Die (2012)It’s easy to forget that before Lana Del Rey came along – back when Billie Eilish was barely in double figures – lo-tempo sad-pop was not the chart-hogging phenomenon it is today. Born to Die, a minimalist masterpiece, languid and lachrymose, changed that. The month of its release, a shaky performance on SNL prompted naysayers to write the singer off as a flash-in-the-pan, but the album – full of beauty, gloom and strange subservience – had staying power. As did Del Rey.  (AP)4950 2) Solange – A Seat at the Table (2016)Solange’s third album is so meticulous, so modernist in its approach to space and structure, that early listens could feel like walking admiringly around an exhibition. Then the lights go out, and a distant scream draws you into the shadows. Anguish is the true pitch of this quiet masterpiece, yet it’s impossibly graceful: an R\u0026ampB battle cry of black art against white supremacy. (JM)By 2015, Kendrick Lamar was already a grandmaster stylist. But with To Pimp a Butterfly, the Compton rapper became a cultural institution, as if summoned by the decade’s converging flash points. There was the murmur of creeping fascism, the roar of a re-energised black rights movement, and its roots in racist police shootings broadcast and protested across an infernal social media landscape. “It’s the classic, ‘You’re just a rapper,’” he told The Observer Magazine. “Using ‘I set trends dem man copy’... No one was talking about that. I wasn’t talking about music, I wasn’t talking about \u0027Shut Up\u0027 – I was talking about politics. So him saying that is like he said: ‘Oh, no, forget politics. This is what he does. He’s a rapper.’ It’s a weaponised tactic.“They do it to young people, they do it to black people, they do it to rappers, they do it to entertainers: ‘Just shut up and rap.’ Stay in your lane. It’s very telling of who these people are. As much as I’m a rapper, I’ve also done X, Y, Z. But they’re dismissing everything else. They just look at me and say: ‘No.’ They reduce us to whatever they need us to be and dismiss it.”Stormzy – who gained six A*s in his GCSEs –\u0026nbsp then explained he is not bothered by the insults of politicians because he knows he is “intelligent”.“So when they dismiss me it’s like, ‘You lot picked the wrong fucking rapper,’” he said.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I have never said this to anyone, nor anything like it, and I hope needless to say, it is not something I would ever think.Ms Flint, who served as MP for Don Valley for 22 years and was a minister under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, said that since 2010 Labour had paid too much attention to voices from London and the university cities and not enough to its heartland areas in the Midlands and the north.“I’m trying to stem my anger, but I’m emotional because I do believe that in the pursuit of Remain a number of people who have been ardent Remainers in our party- on our front bench people like Kier Starmer, people like Emily Thornberry, but many others like Hilary Benn, Yvette Cooper - they have contributed to sacrificing 59 seats … but ‘Don’t worry, we’ve got Putney and Canterbury’,” she said.“With all due respect to the Labour MPs for those constituencies I don’t believe that was worth it.”Asked if Jeremy Corbyn was taking enough personal responsibility for the party\u0027s defeat, she replied simply “no”..And on the question of who should take over as leader, she\u0026nbsp said: I don\u0027t think it should be anybody who has had a hand in our Brexit strategy over the last few years, and I don\u0027t think it can be Corbyn without a beard, I think that would be the wrong move as well.Islington South and Finsbury MP Ms Thornberry previously lost her post in Ed Miliband\u0027s shadow cabinet in 2014 after sending a tweet about a house draped in England flags with a white van parked outside which was widely criticised for snobbery.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The Trust has repeatedly criticised the five-week delay in first receiving benefits when people are moved onto the Universal Credit system in particular.When the Foodbank app was launched in 2014 it said 40 local foodbanks had signed up to take part, but it is not clear how many are using it today.The Foodbank app is not the only similar service available to local charities, and nor is it the only service which charges inidual foodbanks.Any foodbank which joins the Trussell Trust’s own network has to pay a joining fee of £1,500 and then £360 a year after that.The Trust says this helps towards the costs of delivering their services to foodbanks, including £1.3m-worth of funding in 2018.Ms Cates\u0026nbspand the Conservative Party did not respond to requests for comment.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The question is, how can we succeed in future where we didn’t this time?”He added: “Even though we lost seats heavily on Thursday, I believe the manifesto of 2019 and the movement behind it will be seen as historically important – a real attempt at building a force powerful enough to transform society for the many, not the few. For the first time in decades, many people have had hope for a better future.”In a video released on social media with the message “our time will come”, Mr Corbyn said that Labour had “created a new political mainstream” and put the blame for his defeat on Brexit and media hostility.Despite the popularity of its programme, “ultimately the isions in our country over Brexit were too great for us to overcome”, he said.In a signal that he wants his successor to continue with his agenda, Mr Corbyn wrote: “Labour will soon have a new leader. But whoever that will be, our movement will continue to work for a more equal and just society, and a sustainable and peaceful world.“I’ve spent my life campaigning for those goals, and will continue to do so.

For example people were saying things such as ‘Oh, he’s a racist or a terrorist’ – both things which are completely untrue but were pushed by the right-wing newspapers.”Mr Burgon\u0026nbspdenied that he was suggesting that voters who turned against Labour had been “duped” by the media, and said he was “truly sorry” for the election result.“It was a disastrous election result and for that we are truly sorry,” he said. “I think the biggest mistake the Labour Party made was perhaps underestimating the desire for people who had voted Leave to leave the European Union.”Labour’s former general secretary Iain McNicol\u0026nbspcalled on Mr Corbyn to resign immediately so a caretaker\u0026nbspleader can hold the Tories to account.Saying the opposition needs someone who can hold Boris Johnson’s “feet to the fire” over Brexit, Lord McNicol told Ridge: “I think Jeremy should stand down now and we should move to a caretaker leader.“Go to one of the grandees from before, so like Harriet Harman or Hilary Benn or Yvette Cooper, bring in someone who can actually put the pressure on Boris Johnson on the Conservatives while we go through the next leadership election.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

You can be proudly Scottish and proudly British together.“The best of this country - the NHS, the BBC - these are British institutions and therefore we should be proud of what we have achieved together and confirmed that the United Kingdom is a strong partnership that works for all.”Ms Sturgeon said:\u0026nbspThe risk for the Conservatives here - though I should be quite relaxed about it - is that the more they block the will of the Scottish people, the\u0026nbspmore contempt they show for Scottish democracy, the more they will increase support for Scottish independence.In a sense they are doing my job for me. The momentum and the mandate is on the side of those us who believe Scotland should be independent but it\u0027s also on the side of those who might not be decided on independence but agree with that principle that it\u0027s for the people of Scotland to make that decision.Ms Sturgeon said she gave this message to Mr Johnson in their phone call on Friday.I said this to him on Friday night on the telephone - If he thinks saying no is the end of the matter then he is going to find himself completely and utterly wrong.Asked when Ms Sturgeon would formally inform the prime minister of her desire to hold a referendum, Mr Blackford told Sophy Ridge on Sunday: This week.Mr Blackford declined to say which day the request would be submitted, telling Ridge: You\u0027ll see. We are not going to be annoucing it publicly today but it will be happening\u0026nbspthis week, but you\u0027ll see we will be making the case that that power should be transferred. That\u0027s democracy. We\u0027ve won the election. Boris Johnson can\u0027t ignore it.He\u0027s going to recognise that the SNP are speaking for the people of Scotland. We won this election, we\u0027ve 45 per cent of the vote, 80 per cent of the seats. This issue is not going to go away. We will win that right to have a referendum on Scottish independence. This will happen and he should accept the reality of that sooner rather than later.Meanwhile, Liberal Democrat interim leader Ed Davey\u0026nbspwas highly critical of Ms Sturgeon\u0027s exuberant on-screen celebration of the defeat of party leader Jo Swinson in East Dunbartonshire, when she was filmed punching the air in delight.She\u0027s not very dignified, is she? Davey\u0026nbsptold Ridge. I think that approach to politics - taking glee in someone else\u0027s defeat in the way she does, a very personal way - isn\u0027t appropriate for the first minister of Scotland.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Let’s see what happens to the Labour Party now.”If Labour does not learn the lessons from the rejection of Corbyn’s left-wing agenda by the electorate, Lib Dems will be ready to offer “that centre-left reformist party which people who believe in social justice and public service and internationalist politics can feel comfortable in joining”, he said.And he said that Johnson’s willingness to risk economic prosperity and the future of the UK for the sake of Brexit meant Lib Dems can hope to attract more of the traditional Tory voters who took them close to taking seats like Esher and Walton on Thursday.“Given what Johnson is about to inflict on our country, there are still lots of people in commerce, in business, in finance in the Tory heartlands who can’t believe the Tory Party is now anti-business, anti-free trade, anti-market,” he said. “A lot of them will want to look to us.”He dismissed Mr Johnson’s promise to pursue a “One Nation” agenda at the head of a majority Tory government.“I don’t believe anything our prime minister says,” said Sir Ed. “I wish that wasn’t the case. I have respected and felt able to believe prime ministers from other parties throughout my life, but I can’t believe anything this prime minister says.“He talks about One Nation, but he has a deal which puts a border down the Irish Sea and he is pursuing policies which alienate Scottish people. If it is one nation Toryism to put the Union of the United Kingdom under threat, then we are in trouble.“I want to keep the UK together, but Brexit puts this amazing country in peril, and that’s what I fear more than anything.”Sir Ed – energy secretary in the coalition government of 2010-15 – said that as 2020 becomes mired in arguments over future trade and security relations with Europe, voters will quickly come to realise that Mr Johnson’s central election promise to “get Brexit done” was hollow.“Getting Brexit done isn’t about the withdrawal agreement, it’s about all the many other things which are yet to be done,” he said. “I think he is not going to be able to deliver on his promise.“Brexit could still implode. The prime minister has made a whole load of promises that are inconsistent, incoherent and probably undeliverable.”Rejecting Mr Johnson’s attack on parliament for supposedly imposing “gridlock” on the Brexit process, he said: “It’s completely legitimate for a party like the Lib Dems to point out the complexities and contradictions involved.“We want to make the case that Brexit is still going to be bad for the country, even if he has got a mandate to proceed with it. Our job is to speak for the people who voted for us and for the 48 per cent who voted to remain in the EU. Fifty-two per cent plus of those who voted on Thursday voted for parties which didn’t want Johnson’s Brexit to happen.”Despite Thursday’s comprehensive dashing of Lib Dem dreams of significantly increasing their numbers on the Commons green benches – or even installing Ms Swinson in Downing Street – Sir Ed was bullish about the party’s future.“My job at the moment is to get the party into the position where it can do its constitutional job to take forward the policies it stood on, and to be the opposition to this right-wing nationalist government,” he said.\u0026nbsp“We have got a Labour Party falling apart, ided, with its leading figures attacking each other. The country needs an opposition to stand up to the government and hold it to account. That’s what we will do.”Sir Ed said he had not yet spoken to Ms Swinson about her plans, but would like to have her back in the political frontline “as soon as possible”.He declined to join the chorus of criticism aimed at the former leader for her decision, viewed as undemocratic by some voters, to commit the party to revoking Brexit if it won office, saying that while he has voiced his opinions of the conduct of the Lib Dem campaign privately to the federal board, it would be wrong for him to “second guess” its judgement.Instead, he pointed the finger of blame for the party’s underperformance at Jeremy Corbyn, arguing that Lib Dems had ended up as “collateral damage” of the electorate’s dislike and distrust of the Labour leader.Voters who might have supported the Lib Dem agenda were scared off by the thought that they might inadvertently put Corbyn into 10 Downing Street, he said.“We underestimated the depth of the opposition to Jeremy Corbyn,” said Sir Ed. “I don’t think it was down to Brexit. We got washed up in a wider rejection of Corbyn and Labour.“The progressive Remain forces that were non-Labour, non-Corbyn became collateral damage. We weren’t powerful enough to withstand the squeeze and the Corbyn collapse. I think it would be the wrong conclusion to take that suddenly everyone wants Brexit.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

A majority of children in Tanzania do not attend school due to informal fees or voluntary parental contributions required for enrolment. This includes among other things, the compulsory purchase of shoes. Foundations like TOMS have given 95 million pairs of shoes to people across 82 countries.Chacha, 12, was born and raised in a small village in northwestern Tanzania, where he lives with his mother and two siblings. He has never set foot in a classroom and is one of a reported 1.89 million out-of-school children in the country today. Chacha works seven days per week scavenging gold mining sites, digging up rocks containing gold-residue. To avoid being captured or shot by mining and government police for trespass, he works under the cover of darkness, 6pm to 6am. The rocks he finds, he sells to middle men, for approximately £1.50 per shift, who crush them to extract the gold. He explained: “I have no choice, I know the work is dangerous but I feel I have to help provide for my family. It makes me sad not being able to go to school.” The money Chacha earns he uses to purchase clothes for himself and his siblings, the remainder he gives to his mother to contribute to food costs. When he returns home from his 12-hour shift, he tends to the family cattle.Evaline, 11, was enrolled in grade three at Remagwe primary school, when at the age of eight, her father passed away suddenly. In 2018, she returned to school with the help of her teenage sister, who had told her about the EAA-GMT education programme. She lives with her mother, who is a farmer, and her four siblings in a grass thatch house with no mattress. Evaline helps her mother with farming and domestic work. The family survive on two meals per day, usually one meal of soft porridge and another of stiff porridge. She walks about 1.5 hours each way to school, something not uncommon to these children in the hardest to reach areas of northwestern Tanzania. Evaline dreams of becoming a nurse and understands she can achieve her dreams through education. Her role model is Maria, a nurse in the city of Mwanza who originates from her village. Evaline’s message to the world is that they should support all the children to receive education.Often shoes that adhere to a specific dress code are required for students to attend school. In addition to uniforms, books, transportation, other informal fees or the cost of shoes can be a roadblock to enrolment. TOMS Giving Shoes help to reduce families’ financial burden.Jonas, 12, was born in a village situated on the shores of Lake Victoria. He now lives with his father, a fisherman, and his step-mother a farmer. Jonas enrolled into an Educate A Child (EAC) and Graca Machel Trust (GMT) partnership in 2017. GMT conducted a survey reaching out to the community to help identify out-of-school children in the region. The survey identified more than 20,000. Jonas was one of those and set foot into a classroom for the first time at the age of 10. The mandatory age for school enrolment is seven, however his family’s lack of available funds meant he could not enrol into school. Also childhood illnesses, easily treated by relatively inexpensive medicines, meant he spent a huge part of his childhood unwell as his father could not afford treatment. When asked what it was like to take his first steps into a classroom, he replied: “It was incredibly exciting, and now it is even more exciting as there is a good chance I will go to secondary school.”Afya, 14, was enrolled into primary school through the EAC and GMT partnership in 2017, after being identified in the out-of-school children survey. Despite being enrolled in school, poverty still remains her greatest challenge. Her  refuses to contribute to the informal fees or voluntary parental contributions required to continue enrolment.Matteus, nine, in the office of the principal at Remagwe school, looks down while he nervously scratches at the torn and faded zebra-print fabric sofa. One of the pre-requisites for children attending school in Tanzania is that parents must contribute to scholastic materials like school uniform and shoes, of which he has neither. His parents, both farmers, are unable to earn more than £375 a year in wages. They are sustaining a family of five. Matteus was identified through the partnership as being from an incredibly poor background, which would prevent his enrolment. He wakes early to ensure all the farm chores are complete by 11am. When he returns from school at 6pm he collects the cattle from the pastures and then helps his mother in the house with any jobs. Matteus and his siblings have two meals a day of porridge and bananas. They cannot afford any protein in their diet.Elizabeth, now 16, was enrolled at school aged 13 with the partnership, which helps the hardest to reach children struggling with things like poverty, early marriage and female genital mutilation. At age six, her father passed away, followed by her mother when she was 12. She was placed under ship of her uncle, who was arranging her marriage, with her unaware. The incentive for parents looking to marry their daughters is to benefit from sizeable dowry payments, more often livestock or land. Elizabeth’s second uncle heard the news of the marriage arrangements and spoke to the new education programme. Elizabeth wanted to enjoy her right to education and her second uncle helped void the pending marriage arrangements. She explained how extremely grateful she is to the foundation that gave her the opportunity to enrol and avoid the marriage she never wanted.Mamoke, 10, has never been to school. Abandoned by her biological parents along with her eight siblings, she now lives with her grandmother in the village of Kuriyah. She grazes cattle six hours a day for her grandmother in return for her keep. She was registered for school but never enrolled. Her grandmother and  is unable to afford the voluntary parental contribution fees. Mamoke describes her household as poor, her grandmother unable to provide more than one meal per day for her. Mamoke added, “There are many days where we do not eat at all.” She dreams of becoming a teacher, if she was able to go to school, so she can help others in her current situation.Josephine, 14, is an orphan and now lives with her aunt. She lost her parents and youngest sister to Aids, however, her blood-work is clear and negative. She was enrolled into the joint education partnership in 2017. Living far from school, she is forced to travel 4km to get there. Poverty remains a constant worry for Josephine as her aunt will not contribute to the additional costs. When asked what it meant to her to have access to education she replied, “Being in school means I will face less hardship and have a less fragile future. I would much prefer to be in class than live at home with my aunt who tries to prevent my going to school. She often beats me. She wants me to get married.” She was identified by the partnership as being vulnerable and teachers would buy her exercise books to ensure she doesn’t go without. Despite being three years behind she is catching up extremely quickly and ranking in the top five students out of 168 pupils.A young girl nervously clasps her hands as she explained how she was beaten repeatedly and threatened with being married off at the age of 13. In remote rural parts of Tanzania, the average age of marriage is between 12-13, from which point they are invited to leave the family home and fend for themselves. This makes them extremely vulnerable.A young boy seated in a dark classroom. In 2001, Tanzania implemented the Primary Education Development Programme (PEDP) and eliminated public school fees to increase access to primary education. But the programme has faced many challenges.A young girl enrolled at Remagwe school in northwestern Tanzania. The school allows her to attend without uniform, which is a rarity. Uniform, shoes and scholastic materials are expected to be funded by parents under voluntary parental contributions, which are around £10 per year. The fees are an enormous barrier to enrolment, typically parents working as farmers will collectively earn no more than £375 a year in wages that must support and sustain a family.Maryam, 12, has been enrolled in primary school since 2014. She lives with her mother and six siblings, who have all become domestic servants in houses. Education up to the age of 16 is free in Tanzania, except for the parental voluntary contributions. Her mother, a farmer, only earns £380 per year and has been paying £69 towards “informal” school fees for her daughters. Maryam has ambitions of becoming a nurse. She wants to help women, explaining: “Women are very vulnerable in Tanzania, friends my age have been married or propositioned for early marriage”. And she added, “Young girls in primary transitioning to secondary schooling take risks walking to school of being kidnapped.”1518 A classroom blackboard used to provide lessons at Remagwe Primary SchoolToday challenges to establishing an effective and stable education system persist. Assistance from international donors and partnerships helps the Tanzanian government achieve universal primary education and refurbish classrooms to improve the learning experience for children.As challenging as it is to see past the barriers to providing a quality education for children, small changes such as repainting blackboards for teachers and students can have enormous and direct benefits.Alex, 13, explained: “I can no longer wash my clothes any more as they will fall apart”. He has no school uniform, unlike many schools in Tanzania, his school still allow him to attend class. His sandals are torn and one held together by a bit of wire twisted at the sole. Alex enrolled into the first grade of his school in 2017 at the beginning of the EACGraca Machel Trust partnership. He lost his father when he was very young to a simple case of diarrhoea. He now lives with his mother and five siblings. She supports the family by working the fields as a peasant farm hand. For him, poverty remains the greatest barrier to his education, having to walk four hours each way to school, meaning he is constantly tired at school. Challenging geographies is a major barrier to education in remote Africa.A typical classroom in rural Tanzania, often without any electricity. Classroom furniture is in need of repair and broken floors leave a surface of sand or mud. In 2001, Tanzania eliminated public school fees to increase access to primary education. This bold move by the government saw a rapid increase in enrolment overnight but abolishing school fees has left schools trying to deliver education on a shoestring budget. Tanzania has the desire to make the change to education but it needs help from the international community to continue the process.Today poverty remains one of the greatest barriers to enrolment in education and no better example of this can be illustrated than in rural and remote parts of Tanzania.

No better example of this can be illustrated than in rural and remote parts of Tanzania, where a 12-year-old boy, out of school, forced\u0026nbspinto a life of work, trapped in a dead-end cycle of danger and despair so he can provide for his family, provides perspective. He says: “I have no choice, I know the work is dangerous but I feel I have to help provide for my brothers and sisters. It makes me sad not being able to go to school.”Chacha works 12-hour shifts, seven days a week, under the cover of darkness to avoid detection, on one of the many small-scale gold mining sites in the northwest of the country. Illegally, he scavenges the mines for residue-bearing rock which he digs up and sells to middle-men who crush and extract the gold. Chacha’s cut of £1.50 a day is used to contribute to household bills. The work is exhausting and dangerous. Trespassers are shot on sight – even children.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesTanzania\u0026nbsphas strong laws governing child labour,\u0026nbspreinforced by the national action plan to eliminate the practice. The plan prohibits under-18s from engaging in hazardous work, including mining, but children are still lured into mines with the hope of changing their fortunes and those of their families.Chacha has never set foot in a classroom, perhaps he never will.

These collaborations place a strong emphasis on capacity building – boosting schools in all areas to help them run efficiently and sustainably – as well as community engagement and service support. The EAA-GMT partnership has successfully enrolled 23,479 out-of-school children\u0026nbspin\u0026nbspquality primary education over\u0026nbsptwo years in the Mara region – comprising the most challenging and hardest to reach districts of Tanzania.GMT brought in the Complementary Basic Education in Tanzania (COBET) accelerated learning programme, to give a second chance to over-age learners who had never been to school – and to those who had dropped out.In 2001, Tanzania implemented the Primary Education Development Programme\u0026nbspand eliminated public school fees\u0026nbspto increase access to primary education. But\u0026nbspmany challenges have arisen. Schooling is now mandatory for children aged seven to 15, and although enrolment has dramatically increased, Tanzania has not yet achieved universal primary education. A majority of children in Tanzania do not attend school due to informal fees or voluntary\u0026nbspparental contributions required for enrolment. This includes, among other things, the compulsory purchase of shoes.All children should be able to attend primary school regardless of whether their parents can or can’t afford to pay or see the value, perhaps never having received\u0026nbspan education themselves. At its core, if a child fails to gain the basic skills required to contribute as a functioning member of\u0026nbspsociety, the loss is vast, not just to the child or society but the nation as a whole. For those sceptical, education can ultimately reduce poverty for future generations. Studies show the cost of educating children is far outweighed by the cost of not educating them.Their schools lie in ruins – but is there hope for Mosul’s children?Women of Gaza: Empowered and resilientThe global challenge to ensure all children can go to schoolSheikha Moza bint Nasser, chair\u0026nbspand founder of EAA, has dedicated much of her life to ensuring the most marginalised children can go to school, when there was no duty or expectation for her to do so. At\u0026nbspUnesco’s headquarters in Paris last year, she said: “Statistics cannot catalogue the impact of\u0026nbspchildren’s broken dreams. So we must not allow ourselves to be ‘numbed’\u0026nbspby the numbers, and we cannot accept apathy as a response. Because history, as we know, will judge us, by both what we do, and what we choose not to do.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She wrote on Twitter. “That’s Swenglish: “att ställa någon mot väggen” (to put someone against the wall) means to hold someone accountable.Trump launches attack on Greta Thunberg over Person of the Year win“That’s what happens when you improvise speeches in a second language. But of course I apologise if anyone misunderstood this. I cannot enough express the fact that I - as well as the entire school strike movement- are against any possible form of violence.“It goes without saying but I say it anyway”.It comes as the activist looks to head home for a break from campaigning after travelling the world by boat and rail.Greta, who refuses to fly, arrived in Turin by train from Madrid after attending the UN climate summit in the Spanish capital. Those talks were originally intended to take place in Chile, only to be relocated following the outbreak of protests in Santiago.The teenager spent much of the autumn campaigning in the US, memorably haranguing heads of state at the UN headquarters in September for their complacency and inaction over the environmental crisis.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He made sure lines of communication were kept open and regularly hopped on his motorbike and visited his grandparents and other members of his extended family.I suspect that being caught up in this nightmare, which has seen them appear on network TV both here and in the US, as well as an utterly surreal meeting with Donald Trump at the White House, has made it almost impossible for Harry’s parents to grieve properly for their son.They are still in shock, dazed and barely sleeping, and it is only their resolve to achieve justice for their son that is driving them on. Harry’s death made global headlines.Sadly, the spotlight shts all too quickly, and the world forgets about such tragedies and moves on. But Charlotte, Tim and Niall, and everyone who knew and loved Harry, lives with the pain every single minute of every single day.Charlotte told me that Niall, always the quieter and less out-going twin, is finding it extremely hard to come to terms with the death of his brother.He cannot bear to talk about what happened and is haunted because he doesn’t know exactly how Harry died.Tim has spoken about seeing his son’s poor shattered bloody body at the crash scene and how he tried to reassure him that all would be well, but his boy died shortly afterwards.Frankly, I don’t know how Anne Sacoolas can live with herself.If she had only stayed to help the police piece together what had happened, she would have had the chance to express her sorrow, and more than likely been given a suspended sentence.That would at least have given Harry’s family some peace of mind.Instead, Charlotte and Tim are trying to get US officials to listen to them and hoping Donald Trump will make good on his promise of getting something done.If the President thought he could steamroller this “ordinary” British couple during that encounter, he was soon put right.They turned down his clumsy attempt at setting up a meeting with Sacoolas, who was waiting in a White House side room. They didn’t want to be bounced into a Trump photo opportunity, and they also said they rejected an offer of compensation.Charlotte and Tim are also ready to file a civil lawsuit against Sacoolas in the state of Virginia, in an attempt to have her hand herself in to UK authorities.I spoke to them about how the family would face Christmas, and they simply shook their heads in sorrow. Fighting tears, Charlotte told me it was going to be horrendous, especially as Harry loved this time of year so much.I can’t get out of my head the image of them at home, surrounded by sadness, while neighbours in houses around them are making merry.Charlotte said it was made worse by the fact that Sacoolas will be able to celebrate Christmas with her children.It seems the Sacoolas family and the authorities are hoping thatthey stall long enough Charlotte and Tim are just going to go away.I can assure them that they will never give up.I sincerely hope this courageous couple, who are going through the torments of hell, somehow manage to shame officials here and in the US into doing what’s right.Sacoolas should be sent back to the UK to explain herself, apologise and face her punishment.New PM Boris Johnson has a bloody long to-do list, but justice for Harry must be one of his priorities.WILL he fall at the final hurdle Saturday night or will Anton du Beke go all the way and win his first ever Strictly Glitterball after  years of trying.If I was ever to do the showthen you can bet your le it would be poor old Anton who would have to shove me around the dancefloor like an overstuffed wardrobe.He tends to get the plucky no-hopers of a certain age, but this year was given a real contender in the shape of firecracker Emma Barton, from EastEnders.It’s too close to call with the other two finalists, Karim Zeroual and Amy Dowden, and Kelvin Fletcher and Oti Mabuse at the top of their game, but no one would begrudge Anton his moment of glory.JENNIFER Lopez celebrated her Screen Actors Guild Award nomination with an online message to her fans – while on a treadmill in the gym.Being J-Lo, her make-up was flawless, she was wearing a gorgeous tracksuit and she completed the look with fabulous hoop earrings.Despite working out, she wasn’t even glowing, never mind perspiring.What a contrast to the rest of us.I’m a sweaty, red-faced mess after my exercise class and look as though I’ve been dragged through every hedge in the land not just backwards, but forwards too.J-Lo has been nominated for a SAG for her role as Ramona in Hustlers, and during the message she even got a little teary, but of course without the red nose and puffy eyes of us mere mortals.She makes the world a more beautul place.She’s the powerhouse behind the insane Kardashian phenomenon and expert at making very little talent go a bloody long way. Now we are told that the scariest stepmother since Cinderella’s has decided to buy her long-suffering family, including her -year-old mum, Botox vouchers for Christmas.Obviously there’s a money-making opportunity here, as Kris has signed up to promote a Botox company offering  gt tokens as seasonal presents.And I suppose eventhey are insulted or unhappy about her gt, they won’t be able to show those emotions on their newly frozen faces.So Kris wins again.I’M deeply concerned and extremely angry about the current mumps epidemic among hundreds of university students.Since this summer, more than , cases of this dangerous and infectious disease have been reported. If untreated it can lead to deafness, meningitis, and can reduce male fertility.It’s a direct result of parents refusing to let their kids be given the MMR jab when the recent crop of sufferers were babies at the turn of the century.Scare stories about MMR being linked with autism led to parents opting out of immunisation and now we are reaping the whirlwind.Health officials have urged anyone who hasn’t had the jab to do so immediately and have warned of a “public health time bomb”.There’s also been a surge in the cases of measles, a disease that can kill.It is outrageous that we are fortunate enough to have the science to eradicate these diseases completely, and save millions of lives in the process, but through misinformation, stubbornness and, even in a few cases sheer laziness, measles and mumps are being allowed to flourish once more.We need to get a grip and protect our babies, children and young people from harm that is easily preventable.WELL done to Great British Bake Off runner-up Steph Blackwell for being so refreshingly honest about her struggles with ious eating disorders.The -year-old, who was a joy to watch on the show, wants to help other people struggling with anorexia, bulimia and depression and to reassure them that things can get better.When she was , and in the grip of the illness, she would never have imagined one day she would be enjoying baking in front of the nation.Steph is proof that debilitating and often le-threatening eating disorders can be brought under control with understanding and the right kind of help.More power to her.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is now vital, economically and politically, the Tories pump money into those regions and transform them.The gap between them and London has been too wide too long.And our re-elected PM was dead right to make that his priority in his first speech at No since winning his thumping majority.We must “unite and level up”, he said. Exactly.Remainers may take a while to “unite”, to “heal”. But the levelling-up can start now, by spending on infrastructure, including big transport improvements.That, admittedly, takes years. In the short-term, low-tax zones and other tax breaks can revive High Streets and lure job-creating firms out of big cities and into regions which need the boost.More money for public services is key too. The NHS, social care and crime are priorities across the country. So are many more affordable homes.Visible improvements can be made rapidly, such as with a new determination to end rough sleeping, as the Blair Government almost did.For years The Sun backed the Tories as they cut spending to fix the chaos Labour left in .That work is largely done — and, let’s face it, public patience for penny-pinching is at an end.We will trust a Tory Chancellor infinitely more than a Marxist one to spend prudently without bankrupting us.Equally exciting is the power Boris now has both to reinvent the civil service to deliver on national priorities and to reshape our politics.The Tories have a golden chance to rebrand and recast themselves as the party of working people, of Sun readers — and end the lefties’ tired mantra that they serve only the rich.It is also time to fix the anti-Tory bias in our election system.It is incredible their big win came even despite constituency boundaries favouring Labour. These must be redrawn.Two years ago we said Britain needed a strong Tory majority to improve lives and take big decisions to reform public services. It has finally come true.We heartily congratulate the many new Tory MPs. Chiefly, though, we congratulate three men.One is Isaac Levido, the party’s talented and driven Aussie elections guru.The other two, Dominic Cummings and Boris himself, have genuinely made history twice, against staggering odds.They took on the Remainer establishment and won the Brexit vote in . Now they have crushed the Remainers’ long refusal to deliver on it.In one momentous instant, as the exit poll dropped at pm on Thursday, these men ended three and a half years of ­political purgatory and paralysis.All the trickery and plots of duplicitous Remainer MPs and their rogue Speaker Bercow to reverse the referendum came to nothing.All the expensive legal cases, the collusion with EU officials, the long PR campaign of hatred towards Leavers and Boris . . . all were for nothing.In that one moment Boris won his mandate, Brexit was secured and the “People’s Vote” charade destroyed.Corbynism — which had terried millions, not least Britain’s Jews — was instantly over too and the nation liberated from the shadow of hard-left extremism.Then one Brexit-blocking MP after another was dumped by voters.Cummings’s and Boris’s achievements cannot be overstated. They are victories on a dferent scale even from Tony Blair’s against an exhausted Tory Party.As for what remains of Blair’s party we say this: It is staggering to see Corbyn cling on, plainly hoping to stitch up the leadership for some hard-left successor.That will just guarantee ­perpetual irrelevance.He, McDonnell, Seumas Milne, their Momentum social justice warriors and their repugnant media foghorns must be driven out NOW.With a few honourable exceptions, Labour’s “moderate” MPs and voters have shown a repugnant lack of spine by failing to do so already.Indeed the hypocrisy of politicians like Jess Phillips and Stella Creasy has never been plainer, begging Britain to hand power to Corbyn and his anti-Semitic, terrorist-supporting mob, then denouncing them the instant they lost.These unprincipled charlatans backed a Marxist manesto, only to turn on it once voters recoiled. Shame on them. It may be too late anyway. Labour looks irredeemably in the grip of hard-left cranks. Do Phillips and Wes Streeting really need five more years of this  We look forward to a bloodletting like this once-great party has never seen.“Change is coming”, Corbynistas used to say, with no little menace.It sure is.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Labour has completely lost touch with the working man and woman in the North.If it had just been about leaving Europe, those Labour supporters who switched could have voted for the Brexit Party or the Lib Dems.Instead, Workington Men — and Women — chose to take a massive gamble on Boris.Whether you like him or not, there is no doubt he gets things done. Corbyn never would.Boris may not deliver on everything, but as long as he has a bloody good go — and I think he will — he will continue to get my support.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Wrong.There are simply not that many avocado-munching Marxists in the country, comrade.Labour has spent years calling the .million people who voted to leave the European Union stupid, ­racist, pig-ignorant peasants.This is just in — calling people stupid is not a vote-winner.And now, this sorry excuse for a Labour Party has been given the apocalyptic kicking it so richly deserved.Under the extremist stewardship of Jeremy Corbyn, John McDonnell and the brain-dead thugs of Momentum, Labour happily abandoned the working class. And now the working class has abandoned Labour. My guess — for ever.The North is blue. The Red Wall has fallen. Great Grimsby. Scunthorpe. Even Bolsover — home of Dennis Skinner, the erstwhile “Beast of Bolsover” — is Tory today.And Stoke-on-Trent, Wolverhampton North East and Sedgefield — Tony Blair’s safe Labour seat for so many years — are sending Conservative MPs to Westminster.The great mystery is how Labour ever deluded itself that this country could embrace a party leader who has licked the grimy toenails of Hamas, Hezbollah, the IRA and indeed, it seems, any Brit-hating terrorist that would cheerfully do a jig on all our graves.This country will never elect a leader who openly despises the nation he seeks to represent. Why would we Labour — this jaw-droppingly out-of-touch Labour Party, this North London protest group masquerading as a serious political party — forgot why it was founded more than a century ago.And no, it wasn’t to represent a bunch of privately educated revolutionaries in Islington. It was to stand up for the working man and woman.Labour spat on the very people it was meant to represent. And now watch Labour choking on its own spit.Brexit — and the endless sneering at Brexit, and the thwarting of Brexit, and the endless attempts to abort Brexit — was just the start of Labour’s spectacular fall.Corbyn’s Labour never understood the working class.Hear this, comrade — the working class do not want handouts. They are not victims. They can’t be bought with glass beads, shiny trinkets and promises of free broadband.And they do not think they should apologise for being British and for loving this country and its history.All across our nation, working-class communities decided that the Conservatives were the true party of the working class.And let’s be honest, those Labour-voting heartlands have always had plenty of reasons to NOT vote Tory.Although Boris’s spectacular victory is being compared to Mrs Thatcher’s glory years, Maggie was always heartily despised in the regions where they built ships and mined for coal and did jobs where you got your hands dirty.For when these hard-working communities were tossed on the scrapheap of changing times, there seemed scant sympathy or understanding in Maggie Thatcher’s Conservative Party about the human cost of deindustrialisation.Analysis by the Financial Times shows that the more low-paid, low-skilled workers living in a constituency, the better the Tories did.Think about it — the Tories are the party fighting for struggling families now.And their victory is so complete that the leaders of the two opposition parties, Jo Swinson and Jeremy Corbyn, have either resigned or are about to resign.These men and women in those post-industrial communities saw their families suffer dreadfully when the old industries died.They were never going to vote for Jeremy Corbyn and his Communist clowns.But getting them to actually break the habit of a letime and vote Tory signals an historic change in our politics.After this week, the old tribal party loyalties have gone for ever.It no longer matters a damn how your parents and your grandparents voted.Boris Johnson has been swept to power by millions who never voted Tory in their lives. Now he has to keep them.And he has to show he is a Prime Minister who understands that there is a country beyond the M.Brexit is just the start.The Prime Minister’s in-tray is piled high with the housing crisis, rising crime and communities across our nation that feel totally forgotten by Westminster. Brexit should have been done and dusted years ago.And the only reason it is not is because the establishment cynically thwarted the result of the  EU referendum.But all the yakking about revoking Article , and a second referendum, and arcane Parliamentary procedures, and cobblers about a “People’s Vote” is suddenly in the past.If Remainers want us to be members of the EU then they must now be prepared to campaign for decades.The Brexit debate is over and Boris Johnson has a mandate to reshape our country as a global nation that is open to trade with the world.Frankly, Boris’s election campaign was uninspired.Boris beat Corbyn the way that boxer Anthony Joshua beat roly-poly Andy Ruiz Jr in Saudi Arabi — safety first, nothing fancy, just stay on the end of your jab and, above all, WIN. Because the consequences of losing were just too bloody awful to contemplate.Butthe campaign was uninspiring, Boris remains an inspirational politician.People like him. He gives them optimism and hope. He puts a smile on faces.His enemies paint him as a racist, right-wing bigot but the man is exactly the opposite.Boris is a tolerant, big-hearted, one-nation Tory with a razor-sharp mind and an endlessly generous spirit.The newspaper article that is always cited as evidence of his racism — the one where he compared women in full-body burkas to a letter box — was actually advocating their right to dress any way they choose, no matter how ridiculous it looks.There is no hatred in Boris Johnson. There is no poison. And God knows there has been a poisonous atmosphere in our politics for years.I live in an inner-city, safe Labour seat, and usually there would be the leaflets of three or four parties represented in the windows of our neighbourhood.But there were no leaflets in windows at this election. Because there is too much hatred abroad, too much toxic ision, too many idiots willing to stick a brick through the window of someone who dares to disagree with them.Whatever our beliefs, the great hope now must be that we can start coming together as a country, and begin to heal, and start building some kind of national unity.A Tory Prime Minister elected by the working class seems a good place to start.My parents — a Labour-voting mum and a Liberal-voting dad — despised the Tories as the party of the rich, the privileged, the out-of-touch toffs.That sentiment has been shared by millions of ­working-class men and women since the end of World War Two. Until now.From the Black Country to Blyth Valley, we are all Tories now.It is ironic that it took an Old Etonian Oxford graduateto make the Tories the natural party of the working class.And now Prime Minister Johnson and his new Tories must prove they are worthy of all those working-class votes.And let us hope that the Labour Party can find its soul again.Let us hope that this formerly great party of compassion, social justice and equality can kick out all the bigots, middle-class Reds, IRA groupies, friends of Hamas and Hezbollah and the anti-Semites who would rather wave the Palestinian flag than the Union Jack.But it is likely that ­Labour has already been dumped in the recycling bin of history.Because this doesn’t feel like a defeat for the Labour Party. It feels more like a death.It is hard to see how Labour can crawl out from under this landslide.These last years have not really been about party politics. They have been about the will of the people coming into direct conflict with the will of the establishment.The combined forces of the House of Commons and House of Lords, the BBC and Channel , the Supreme Court and expensive lawyers, RADA revolutionaries like Hugh Grant, Steve Coogan and Emma Thompson, all placed themselves above people.All of the political paralysis, and the national humiliation of never getting Brexit done, and the endless frustration of seeing democracy being cheated stems from an arrogant establishment that refused to accept the largest vote for anything in our history.What a shameful, anti-democratic place this country would bethey had won. But they lost. Now let us move forward at last.Millions of working-class men and women just placed their faith in a decent, ­brilliant, chubby-cheeked, shaggy-haired, dog-loving toff to deliver a better tomorrow for ALL of our people.As unlikely as it seems, you are a working-class hero now, Boris.Andyou make your supporters proud to be working-class Tories, then you, Carrie and your dog Dilyn will be in No for the next ten years. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But there was a moment when I knew we’d absolutely had it.The BBC’s Nick Robinson was questioning Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell. “The Conservative message, ‘Get Brexit Done’, is very clear. What’s yours ”There was an audible gulp from Mr McDonnell, a pause, followed by patter so inconsequential that I now can’t recall it word for word. And that’s the point. If you are asking people to lend you the most precious thing they have in a democracy — their vote — you have to be able to say why.On Brexit, was Labour’s leader Jeremy Corbyn in favour of leaving the EU with his “sensible deal”, or of staying in it  He didn’t seem to know — orhe did he was keeping it from the electorate.There has not been a more abject failure of leadership by the head of any British political party since the war.Mr Corbyn, Mr McDonnell and their puppet-master, Len McCluskey, now blame not themselves but Brexit for Labour’s night of shame. But our Brexit dficulties were largely brought about by Mr Corbyn. They started with the  EU referendum.For most of that campaign, he was invisible. Only reluctantly was he persuaded to say something. When he did, it was without enthusiasm.There’s a reason for Mr Corbyn’s indecision on Brexit. The Jeremy Corbyn I knew in  years in the Commons was the man who voted against every EU treaty change — and left the strong impression he couldn’t stand the institution. But scared to fight for it, he put his party into the worst position, of having no position at all.But Brexit was just a symptom of Labour’s problems. Their cause was Mr Corbyn, what he stood for. He and those who have propped him up can body-swerve as much as they want.They have to face up to this unpalatable truth. Mr Corbyn was convincedthat the more left-wing Labour’s manesto, the more votes we would get.He didn’t disappoint. It was even more left-wing that our last effort like that — Labour’s  manesto, tagged “the longest suicide note in history”.I back far greater public spending than are the Conservatives. It’s one reason why I have been in Labour for  years.I want a fairer society, with greater equality, better opportunities and no discrimination. But you have to take people with you on this journey, and remember that it’s their money that will be paying for it.Mr McDonnell and Mr Corbyn forgot this. They tried to promise everything at once, in a single incontinent splurge. The result was inevitable. The party fell flat on its face.Last was the terrible scourge of anti-Semitism Mr Corbyn allowed to gain hold in the party until it was too late. We were indelibly stained.After Labour’s  election defeat, Neil Kinnock did the honourable thing and announced he was going.He didn’t hang around in a transparent attempt to organise the election of a successor, which is what it appears Mr Corbyn is doing — asmore of the same toxic mixture is going to work. It can’t.I love the Labour Party and all the decent things it stands for, and has done for our society. We can have a future, but onlywe break with the dismal Corbyn agenda and have a leader and organisation that can take us on that long journey.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Left can’t possibly admit their entire project was wrong so they must dump the fiasco on to Corbyn himself.The joke is, like the good Marxist he is, Jeremy will probably just quietly accept it for the sake of the collectivethat means his hard-Left dream lives on.McCluskey yesterday blasted the incontinent mess that led to the election loss.Since the defeat, Corbyns right hand man John McDonnell said he would quit as Shadow Chancellor.Meanwhile, Boris Johnson vowed he would help give Britain back its mojo so the country could stand tall.The Prime Minister secured a sweeping -seat majority on Thursday - meaning the UK is now on track to leave the EU in less than two months.And on Saturday, Mr Johnson promised to deliver his slogan to get Brexit done - and also pledged better infrastructure, better education and fantastic modern technology.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Mr Epstein groomed her for his use as a sexual object, then lured her to his ranch in New Mexico, where he subjected her to a vicious, prolonged sexual assault.We write now to seek your co-operation to bring out the truth about his predatory behaviour. You are no doubt aware by now that Mr Epstein was a skilled manipulator and abuser of minor girls. A central element of that predatory behaviour was to present himself as having connections to the world’s most powerful people.After Mr Epstein sexually assaulted Jane Doe  in New Mexico, his representative contacted her again to attempt to lure her to Mr Epstein’s private island. In trying to persuade her, Mr Epstein’s representative conveyed to Jane Doe  that Mr Epstein was close to you, that you would be among the guests and that she would have an opportunity to meet you. Your prestige and reputation were directly touted in his attempts to engage in further harm.We urge you now to actively participate in providing sworn testimony to the FBI, and voluntarily to submit to a sworn deposition in Jane Doe ’s lawsuit.“Epstein’s description of the women sleeping around him on the floor made her immediately think of slaves.”While on the flight, the financier also name-dropped former President Bill Clinton and asked the girl how old she was, the documents say.The lawsuit said: “Jane Doe  found her interactions with Epstein on the plane strange.But she recognised one of the other girls on the plane as a model who had been on a magazine cover that month.“Jane Doe  remembers finding that reassuring, and thinking: ‘If she’s here, it must be ok’.The palace declined to comment on the Sunday Times report but Andrew denied any knowledge of, or involvement with, Epsteins alleged abuse during an interview with the BBC.A Palace spokesman said the Duke unequivocally regrets his ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein and deeply sympathises with those affected who want some form of closure.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He also said he would take my responsibility for the heavy defeat which was the partyaposs worst seat tally since . Today Mr Corbyn, who has said heaposll resign after a leadership election early next year, issued an updated video that said I take full responsibility for the result but slammed gutter media attacks and added: Our time will come. But Labour MP Margaret Hodge, a long-term critic, branded it denial while colleague Harriet Harman said: This shows no willingness to understand why Labour suffered this catastrophic defeat. Jeremy Corbyn should resign. MP Darren Jones added: “We failed our party, our people and our country. I want to talk about the future and we’d better get to it quickly.”He went on: “We can’t just say we’ll tax more and pay for more stuff. We need to stimulate growth in profits and pay. We need to invest to transform and reduce the cost of public service delivery.” Writing in the Observer, Mr Corbyn insisted: “I am proud that on austerity, on corporate power, on inequality and on the climate emergency we have won the arguments and rewritten the terms of political debate. There is no doubt that our policies are popular, from public ownership of rail and key utilities to a massive house-building programme and a pay rise for millions. The question is how can we succeed in future where we didn’t this time ” One furious Labour figure told the Mirror the piece was possibly the worst-judged thing written on the leaderaposs behalf. And long-time backbench critic Wes Streeting tweeted: “‘We won the argument’ is the most insulting response to the worst election result since  that any of us could imagine. Go. Now. Every Tory policy over the next five years has been enabled by Corbynism.”  MP Karen Buck added: We didn’t win the election. Which means we didn’t actually win the argument. I think we had it mostly right on these issues but that’s not enoughwe can’t take people with us and put policy into practice. It came as a Labour source flat denied a claim, reported by the Sunday Times, that Mr Corbyn said oh well when the results rolled in on Friday morning. He didnapost say that, the source said. Today Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell took the blame for the stunning defeat, claiming: “It’s on me. Let’s take it on the chin. I own this disaster.” Apologising to Labour MPs who lost their seats, he said: If anyone’s to blame it is me. Full stop. However he added I do blame the media which did a number on Jeremy for four years solid, every day, leaving him “demonised in a way no other politician on this scale has been done before.”  Mr McDonnell denied trying to fix the party in his image for the coming leadership election but added Iaposm not going to be going away - saying heaposd work on issues including climate change. Unite union general secretary Len McCluskey also told BBC Radio  Live: Iaposm saying that we need to reflect. But the policies of a socialist alternative, a radical alternative are popular. We need to make certain that we continue. All of Labouraposs policies were extremely popular. The problem is that, yes, when they were put together, there was a question of credulity. Could Labour really deliver all of this  And as regards Jeremy, thereaposs no doubt that it became an issue on the doorstep, because, of course, for the last four years, every single day, he has been attacked massively in a way that no politicians have by the media. He added: If I have to say this a thousand times,. I will, do. Brexit was the reason for this defeat.  Jeremy Corbyn loyalists have mounted a campaign since Friday to ensure Labouraposs radical left-wing manesto policies are not jettisoned by a future leader. A senior figure handed internal polling to the Mirror showing members of the public backed hiking income tax on the rich, ramping up infrastructure and nationalising railways, energy and water. The YouGov poll of , people for Labour, dated November -, claimed % thought it was acceptable to spend more on infrastructure with % saying unacceptable. Dear Sunday Mirror readers, I will make no bones about it. The election result on Thursday was a body blow for everyone who so desperately needs real change in our country. To every single person who voted for the Labour Party – everyone who shared the hope that Britain could be a fairer country that works for the many, not the few – I say thank you, from the bottom of my heart. And to the Sunday Mirror and its readers, your support has been such a source of strength. I wanted to unite the country that I love but I’m sorry that we came up short and I take my responsibility for it. I remain proud of the campaign we fought. I’m proud that no matter how low our opponents went, we refused to join them in the gutter. And I’m proud that our message was one of hope, rather than fear. Millions of people saw in our manesto a better future for themselves and their communities. Our policies to protect the NHS, end austerity, invest in every part of our country and tackle inequality, were popular with voters who saw through a ferocious smear and fear campaign against us. But despite our best efforts, this election was ultimately about Brexit. The Tory campaign, amplied by most of the media, managed to persuade many that only Boris Johnson could “get Brexit done.” That will soon be exposed for the hood it is, but in this election it overpowered our attempt to reach across the ide and bring our country together We will learn the lessons of this defeat, above all by listening to those lelong Labour voters who we’ve lost in working class communities. This party exists to represent them. We will earn their trust back. Make no mistake: Labour is the greatest force for progressive change this country has ever known, and although this wasn’t our moment, our time will come again under new leadership. We will never give up on the commitment and determination to build a fairer and more decent society."},{"url":null,"title":"emily thornberry accused calling voters","story":"NewsEmily Thornberry denies utter lie that she called voters stupid over BrexitCaroline Flint claimed Emily Thornberry told a Labour candidate \"I’m glad my constituents aren’t as stupid as yours\" - but the Shadow Foreign Secretary blasted the allegation as a \"total and utter lie\" and is understood to be consulting lawyersShareCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video former-mp-caroline-flint-blasts-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news politics emily-thornberry-accused-calling-voters-\"\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Caroline Flint, who lost Don Valley by , votes on an almost % swing to the Tories, lashed out at the Shadow Foreign Secretary for alleged comments during the campaign. Ms Flint claimed Ms Thornberry would not have any credibilityshe ran for leadership, telling Sky News: She said to one of my colleagues, ‘I’m glad my constituents aren’t as stupid as yours’. I’m sorry, it’s not acceptable. But Ms Thornberry vehemently denied the claim today - after her former colleague made it to thousands of live TV viewers while wearing a green Christmas jumper - and was understood to be consulting lawyers. Ms Thornberry said in a statement: “This is a total and utter lie. I have never said this to anyone, nor anything like it, and I hope needless to say, it is not something I would ever think. She later added on Twitter: I once told Michael Fallon: ‘You can’t just go round making things up.’ Whatever our dferences, let’s not sink into that gutter. Ms Flint, a Tony Blair loyalist and MP since  who served on the front bench under him, Gordon Brown and Ed Miliband, has a long history of clashes with Jeremy Corbynaposs leadership. She was one of  Labour MPs who voted through the first stage of Boris Johnsonaposs Brexit deal in October. Her claims had echoes of an incident which forced Ms Thornberry to resign from Ed Milibandaposs shadow cabinet in . The Islington South and Finsbury MP was accused of snobbery after tweeting a photo of a house in Strood, Kent, bedecked with England flags with the caption: Image from Rochester. Ms Flint today said she was emotional and trying to stem my anger as she accused Jeremy Corbyn of not taking enough personal responsibility for Labouraposs fall to  seats - its worst election defeat since . Wrexham, Labour since , fell to the Tories as did Leigh after being in Labouraposs hands since , former mining community Blyth Valley, Labour since , and Tony Blairaposs old seat Sedgefield. Left-winger Laura Pidcock, tipped as a rising star, lost her North West Durham seat and Shadow Environment Secretary Sue Hayman lost Workington, home to the supposed aposWorkington manapos who would decide the election.  Ms Flint told Sky Newsapos Sophy Ridge on Sunday: This has been brewing for some time. And I think in many respects our party, the balance in terms of the voices that are heard has gone too much towards the metropolitan cities and university towns and away from these core areas. In the pursuit of Remain, a number of people who have been ardent Remainers in our party on our front bench, people like Keir Starmer and Emily Thornberry, but many others - Hilary Benn, Yvette Cooper - they have contributed to sacricing  seats. But aposdonapost worry weaposve got Putney and weaposve got Canterbury.apos With all due respect to the Labour MPs for those constituencies, I donapost believe that was worth it.

Outspoken Corbyn critic Jess Phillips also broke cover today with an article saying a New Labour approach would be delusional but the party must be brave to reconnect with working-class voters. It means Labour could finally choose its first female leader in a race expected to kick off after Christmas and finish before Easter.Apart from Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer most of the leading possible contenders are female, including Shadow Education Secretary Angela Rayner and Corbyn alliesapos choice Rebecca Long-Bailey.Ms Nandy said Labour must regain its status as a coalition for both Lewisham and Leigh and bring Labour home to those who voted Tory. She also said she may vote for Boris Johnsonaposs Brexit deal this week -he allows scrutiny on a customs union at its committee stage in January.She told BBCaposs Andrew Marr Show: The reason I’m thinking about it is because we’ve just had the most shattering defeat where you really felt in towns like mine that the earth was quaking. And we’ve watched the entire Labour base just crumble beneath our feet. The winner will rest heavily on who Labouraposs ,-strong, left-leaning membership, which more than doubled since Jeremy Corbyn ran for leader, swing behind.  Labour centrists are already urging those who share their values to sign up to membership of the party to get a vote. That means the freeze date - the cut-off for how long-standing members have to be to get a vote - could be crucial. In , Labouraposs ruling NEC tried to block anyone whoaposd joined more recently than in  months from voting. But the decision was overturned by Court of Appeal, something the new NEC - now dominated by the left - will have to consider. Some left-wing figures are already circling around Rebecca Long-Bailey, with Shadow Justice Secretary Richard Burgon privately putting himself forward as a candidate for deputy.  A source played down talk of a joint ticket but said: Richard wants to see Rebecca as the next Labour leader. That could see the Shadow Business Secretary running against her flatmate Angela Rayner for the top job. One party figure said: The real question is whether Angela and Beccyaposs friendship is strong enough to withhold the external pressure. A Corbyn loyalist described Ms Long-Bailey as the leftaposs only hope - but admitted they werenapost over-enthusiastic about Mr Burgon. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey could be a brilliant leader before praising shadow cabinet ministers Angela Rayner, Richard Burgon and Dawn Butler.  Another Labour source predicted the race will be a very crowded field, at least at first. Ms Nandy, who has campaigned for left-behind towns, today called for Labouraposs headquarters to move out of London in order to reconnect the party with voters outside of the capital. We should move our party conferences back to towns as well as cities, she added.She claimed it was undoubtedly true that Jeremy Corbyn is to blame for the devastating defeat after Labour won  seats in the general election , its worst showing since ."},{"url":null,"title":"suspicious pleased reaction woman after","story":"NewsSuspicious pleased reaction of woman after her husbands disappearanceMargaret Otto was in an unhappy marriage.

He ran Ink Addiction tattoo shop in Tasmania, but health issues meant he couldn’t work as much as he wanted to, so cash was tight. Despite borrowing money to inject into the business, the debt was spiralling out of control. It was also causing problems at home with his we Margaret Otto, now . They’d been together  years and had weathered plenty of storms. Dwayne, also , had a past with addiction, and although he’d stopped taking harder drugs, he still smoked cannabis, but they’d stood by each other and now Dwayne was all about family.  By , he was busy restoring a rocking horse for his grandson’s upcoming birthday. Inking had also brought him his best mate, Bradley Purkiss, now . Bradley had come into his studio for a tattoo in  and they’d quickly become friends. They had lots of things in common like motorbikes and tinkering in their sheds. They were such good friends that Bradley lent Dwayne , AUD . Half was to go towards renovating the tattoo shop, the rest was to do up Dwayne and Margaret’s Risdon Vale home. Dwayne was paying back the money – but not in the conventional way.There were motorbikes exchanged and even favours – Dwayne had promised to paint the kitchen in Bradley’s Elderslie home. In , Bradley had helped Margaret and Dwayne with their home renovations, too. That was when Margaret and Bradley are said to have begun a brief affair. Later Bradley would say it was all in Margaret’s head, but the pair are believed to have had a short-lived relationship. When it ended, Dwayne remained friends with Bradley – clueless of the betrayal. Bradley was a part of the family and Margaret confided in him over her frustrations.  She claimed her husband was a bully, and that their money problems were dragging them down. On May , , Bradley invited Dwayne to come and look at some Harley Davidson motorbikes. Dwayne agreed and headed to Bradley’s shed in rural southeast Tasmania. The next day was Dwayne’s grandson’s birthday party. But when Margaret turned up to celebrate with the family, there was no sign of Dwayne. It was highly unusual and he didn’t appear that night. Bradley told friends and family the pair had had a disagreement. He said Dwayne had then stormed off from his place and driven away. So, where was he  Bradley thought he might have fled from his debts. Rather than be worried, Margaret seemed pleased her husband had gone. She said Dwayne was back on the harder drugs and that he had likely gone to the mainland to avoid a bad deal he’d made. Talking to one of her husband’s family members on the phone, she said that now he was gone, she was debt-free as the tattoo shop and the house were in Dwayne’s name so she could walk away from around , AUDof outstanding bills. ‘He won’t be coming back,’ Margaret said confidently. Police were suspicious. Bradley was the last one to see Dwayne before he disappeared, so they tried to follow his last movements. They found blood on the wall of Bradley’s shed, and brain matter on the floor. They then discovered a shallow grave out in the bush at nearby Levendale. Below the soil was Dwayne’s body. He’d been shot twice at close range – in the back and in the head. Police determined he’d been left in the padlocked shed overnight before being driven to the makesht grave. All fingers pointed to Bradley – but why would he kill his best friend  And why was Margaret not surprised when she was told her husband had been found dead  When interviewed by police, Margaret confessed she’d had an affair with Bradley and that at one point, they had talked about starting a new le together. But she said it was long over. Instead, she’d confided in Bradley about her domineering husband and their money problems. Margaret said Bradley had been frustrated, too – always loaning his mate money. She broke down and said Bradley was only supposed to frighten Dwayne and he must have gone too far. That he’d come to her house the night of Dwayne’s murder and told her she was ‘free’ and showed her an empty shotgun shell. Bradley denied it all and said he was being set up. He said Margaret had tried it on with him several times, but he’d turned her down. He said she had been the one to arrange the motorbike viewing that day, and three men had turned up, but Dwayne had driven off ‘like an idiot’ after they’d exchanged words. Police didn’t believe either of them. They charged Margaret and Bradley with murder. They were accused of plotting together to kill Dwayne – because Margaret had wanted out of her marriage, and Bradley was sick of his friend and was happy to help. Bradley had pulled the trigger and Margaret might not have been there, but she’d played her part in the planning. Both pleaded not guilty. At the trial this year, Bradley continued to deny his affair with Margaret.  ‘She was just my friend’s we,’ he said on the stand. There were sexually explicit images that Margaret had sent from her home to Bradley’s home, but he said they weren’t part of a relationship. He also denied knowing Margaret was unhappy, so that couldn’t have been a motive. ‘I didn’t know how Doc [Dwayne] was treating Marg,’ he said. ‘It’s none of my concern how he treated his family.’ He said he would have told his friendhis we wanted him dead. The prosecution called the murder a ‘cold, calculated execution’, and a ‘chilling betrayal of a friend and a husband’. They said that Bradley’s story kept changing, and the motive was simply that they felt used by Dwayne – they hadn’t killed to be together. It was revealed that Bradley had visited Margaret at work on the morning of May , , eight hours before the killing, and likely told her what he was planning. ‘During that time Mr Purkiss could have changed his mind and Ms Otto could have intervened to save her husband’s le,’ the court heard.  The trial lasted five weeks, but in the end, Margaret and Bradley were both found guilty. Dwayne’s loved ones were shocked Margaret had conspired against her husband – they’d considered her as part of the family. ‘My son was no saint or no angel but he was my son and I loved him very much,’ Dwayne’s dad, Glen Davies, told the court. At the sentencing in October, Chief Justice Alan Blow described the murder as an ‘outrageous killing’. ‘The murder involved betrayal. Betrayal by Ms Otto of her husband, and by Mr Purkiss of a close friend,’ he said."},{"url":null,"title":"britains most married man calls","story":"NewsBritains most married man calls off wedding number nine to woman hes never metDad-of-eight Ron Sheppard, , from Somerton, Somerset, proposed to nurse Rose Hans, , last month after a year-long romance despite having never met herShareCommentsByJonathan Coles:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsBritains most married man Ron Sheppard has called off plans for his ninth wedding \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

The Executive Development Chef now works at Farmison  Co and has shared his simple secrets and warned of the common errors.... . Remove the sausage from the chiller  minutes before cooking This helps the sausage to cook evenly and prevents the skin from splitting when it is confronted with heat, Jeff told the Daily Star. . Pop your bangers in the pan Use a heavy based non-stick frying pan, place on a low to medium heat. . Add a teaspoon of duck or goose fat to the pan Then swirl around until the base is fully coated then tip away any excess fat.  .

Jeff recommends  to  minutes for a traditional thick sausage. . Rest the bangers before serving Once cooked, the sausage will be firm to touch, with an internal temperature of °C. The secret now is to let the sausages rest for a few minutes, just like you would a steak allowing the meat to relax, giving you a tender, juicy sausage. Changing your cooking methods can be tricky, especiallyyou think your way of making sausages is best. Mistakes people make when cooking sausages  .

The -year-old told Chronicle Live: I have a -month-old son and I canapost put him on the floor in case he picks the fungus up and eats it. Lisa claims the problems started shortly after the family moved into the home in Westerhope, Newcastle, in August. Have you been affected by this story or have a similar issue to share  Email webnews@mirror  I noticed black patches around September and since then it has just got worse and worse, she claimed. They sent inspectors out and they confirmed damp. A plasterer came but he said aposIaposve only been given a couple of hours for this job, thereaposs no way I could do it - Iaposd need daysapos. The home is so bad that Lisa has resorted to using duct tape to hold down the wallpaper to stop son Hunter from touching the damp. She said: My son was two months premature and has problems with his chest anyway, but heaposs had issues since we moved in.  I had cancer a few years ago so my immune system is already poor to start with, but it is affecting us all.

And after months of struggling to resolve the situation, Lisa contacted her local councillor George Pattison for help.  The Labour councillor visited the property himself and said he was left horried. It is inhabitable - it is disgraceful, he added. He emailed senior figures at the charity, pleading for them to make the familyaposs plight a priority. According to the former Lord Mayor, Your Homes Newcastle acted quickly on his request. However, the familyaposs hope of moving were quickly dashed when the organisation instead deemed the problems could be fixed.  It is a complete bombsite and it would need a complete refurbishment, added the councillor. Your Homes Newcastle has since told  ChronicleLive  it will support Lisashe wants to look for another property. “We apologise to Ms Marsay for any distress caused and continue to work closely with her to recty the situation, said Ian Gallagher, assistant director of Operational Property Services.

Beth Durkin, , was diagnosed with lung and bone cancer, which rocked her close-knit family. She is now facing her prospect that this Christmas could be her last, Wales Online reports. Beth, from Cardf, has two daughters, Olivia and five-year-old Rhiannon, with husband Marc. While expecting her daughter Olivia, the mother-of-two was told at her -week scan in July  that her baby had Truncus Arteriosus. This meant Olivia was missing a heart valve and was going to need major heart surgery. The baby was then diagnosed with DiGeorge Syndrome, a condition without cure present from birth that can cause a range of lelong problems, including heart defects and learning dficulties. Even though she was offered the option to terminate the pregnancy, Beth did not want to. “I decided to continue with the pregnancy,” she said. Youaposve got to try havenapost you, she said. I mean, look at her now. Both Beth and Rhiannon were subsequently tested and found they also carried the gene.  Olivia was born on November , .  After a few hours, she was taken to intensive care and when she was just  days old she underwent major -hour heart surgery to repair a missing heart valve at Bristol Hospital. Olivia, whose heart stopped twice, was so ill that surgeons left her chest cavity open for a full week afterwards in case she had another cardiac arrest. They didn’t expect her to live,” Beth said. The mum remained next to her daughter as she went into seizures lasting up to two hours at a time. Her husband Marc stayed at the familyaposs home with Rhiannon and kept working.  As she got better, at the end of January  Olivia was finally allowed back home. After that, Beth, who kept looking after her baby, started feeling pain in her hip bone but she initially put it down to being a muscular thing. However, as the pain got worse, she went to the GP several times and following a MRI scan, doctors discovered her pain was actually something a lot worse. On September , in a consultant’s room in Llandough Hospital, Beth was told she had secondary bone cancer. The primary cancer was in her lungs.  “It hasn’t sunk in yet, Beth said. I don’t think I have accepted it. I dread the day it does sink in to be honest.” “I’m still trying to process it,” she said. “The kids keep me going. I don’t know what to say - I still feel new to all this. I try to keep le as normal as I can, but Iaposm not sleeping my mind just wonapost shut down. Olivia will need another heart operation before her second birthday as well as another op to replace her valve as she grows.  “It would be easierI knew Olivia was safe and going to be OK,” she added. “I would be more OK with it then. But I brought her into this world and I want to be the one to make sure she is OK. “I feel bad that I brought her into this world. I should see it through, that’s the least that I should do as a mum,” she said. Beth met Marc on a night out in Cardf and the couple married in June  and had Rhiannon in .  The family have planned a trip to Disneyland Paris in the new year. “I might not get a chance to go again,” said Beth. I might not be here next Christmas. Bethaposs mum Shirley Wiseman, , told her: Youaposre doing all the right things and weaposre looking for the next treatment. We have to hope. With two gruelling rounds of chemotherapy already done, and another cycle before Christmas, Bethaposs mum and sister Sian Wiseman just want to help. Sian said: I try and get into her headspace. I try and imagine what it must be like.  “We’re just hoping and hoping there’s a breakthrough somewhere,” said Shirley. “We are devastated. I just feel useless. Most people dealing with this are in their s or s. They get to go home after treatment and relax, but Beth is only  - she has a husband and two kids.” So far Beth has been receiving chemotherapy and immunotherapy through the NHS. The family are trying to raise money to fund additional private treatment that could allow more targeted treatment for Beth and give her a better chance of survival.

Her daughter Anna had to be delivered by caesarean section four weeks early so doctors could treat the new mother. The baby was soon brought to the neonatal intensive care unit as she began struggling to breathe. Mrs Beaton and forklt driver husband Michael, , had been trying for a family for more than two years before she finally fell pregnant after a cycle of IVF treatment. She said: “I was so angry with the world because it had given me Anna and now I didn’t knowshe was going to be ok or,she was,I was going to be ok to see her grow upI’d get to see her first birthday and be the mum I always wanted to be. “It was absolutely terrying.

She said doctors always put it down to anxiety and asthma. Just two weeks after giving birth a specialist warned her that the tumour they had found in her lung was potentially cancerous. However further tests confirmed she had an extremely rare disorder of the lymph nodes called unicentric Castleman disease. Affecting just one in around , people, it causes an overgrowth of cells in the lymphatic system, which helps rid the body of toxins, and is similar to lymphoma, a cancer of the lymph nodes.  Mrs Beaton has already endured more than  rounds of chemotherapy in a bid to shrink the tumour. Surgeons attempted to remove it four weeks after she gave birth but, due to its location, they were only able to cut away a small portion of it.Mrs Beaton said: “It is so rare, the doctor who found the tumour said in his  years experience he had never heard of it. And every doctor I see has to Google it.“I’ve been getting chemotherapy for a year and prior to February it had been shrinking slowly. But between February and October it hadn’t shrunk at all. But it hasn’t grown, so that is positive.  “The chemotherapy is chipping away at it. But I was told because of the way the cells work, it is harder to treat than cancer because it is so unpredictable. It is a long, slow process. I keep having to remind myself that there is no quick fix. “But I can’t wait until I’m finished so I can get back to being normal and do all the things I want to with Anna.” While Anna was fighting for le in hospital, there were moments where Danielle feared her dream of being a mother would be snatched away from her. “I remember walking out of the neonatal unit and into the bathroom and falling into a heap on the floor crying because I thought I was going to lose her, she said.  “I’d go through all hours of the night at sit with her - I didn’t want to be apart from her. “Now it is such a privilege to be her mother but we wouldn’t have Anna nowit hadn’t been for the quick actions of the neonatal staff in Aberdeen. “My biggest concern was always Anna, but it was tough because I had to face the fear of what was happening to me as well.” She was  weeks pregnant when she began struggling to breathe while at work as a customer service assistant. She said: “I had signs for a long time but, as Anna was growing, the breathlessness got worse. I was told I possibly had a blood clot in my lung which is quite common during pregnancy. So they did an X-ray and they came back and said, ‘there’s no clot but we have found a very large mass’.” Mrs Beaton was then given steroid injections to help boost Anna’s lung development, as plans were made to deliver the baby four weeks early.  But within moments of her arrival it became clear her tiny lungs were still underdeveloped. Mrs Beaton said: “We didn’t expect any problems with Anna, but when she was born she was really unwell. “I got a glimpse of her face and got to hold her little fingers but then they had to take her away.” The baby was then moved to the neonatal intensive care unit on a le-support machine. “It was quite a shock,” Danielle said. “Anna was quite a big girl and had been fighting against all the equipment so they had to sedate her and she was not able to move a muscle in her body.

Russell Hollins, , is now starting a two-year jail term for harassing Sally Eggington. He was convicted of stalking his ex-we and another ex-girlfriend in , in  and again in , Birmingham Live reports. Hollins, formerly from Rugby in Warwickshire, has also breached restraining orders banning him from contacting victims on seven occasions. The -year-old was head at Treliske Prep School in Truro and at Wolverhampton’s independent Royal Junior School. He was also deputy head at Coventry’s King Henry VIII School and headmaster of Chapter House Prep School at Queen Ethelburga’s Collegiate, Little Ouseburn, Yorkshire. His latest victim, Ms Eggington, has dubbed Hollins as a “manipulative, intellectually arrogant misogynist” after enduring nine months of torment. He is accused of subjecting the woman to a flood of messages, using dferent names and numbers when she attempted to block him on social media or by text. He also tried to get her sacked from her teaching job at a Warwickshire school. When he could no longer reach her, Hollins started targeting Ms Eggingtonaposs family, despite being arrested and served with a non-molestation order. On one occasion, the man, who used his diagnosis of prostate cancer as emotional blackmail, travelled to Ms Edgington’s bungalow where he uprooted pot plants and threw rubbish on the drive. In his panic to flee the scene, he almost ran over a neighbour trying to photograph the evidence. In one of the messages he sent, Hollins offered Ms Edgington £,she would have him back. Other texts simply included threats and insults. At Exeter Crown Court, Hollins, formerly of Rugby, but now living in Topham, Devon, where he cared for his -year-old mother, admitted stalking and breaching a non-molestation order. He was also handed an indefinite retraining order, banning any contact with Ms Edgington, her employers or family, and prohibiting him from going to a large area of Warwickshire around Bulkington, Bedworth and Coventry. Judge David Evans told the pensioner: ”You were prohibited by a court order from any further contact but for week after week, and month after month, you defied that order. “She hoped the order would change your ways. You were sometimes pleading for her to resume contact but you were also abusing her, insulting her and belittling her in messages. With one exception, she did not reply.You used your ongoing ill-health as a tool to manipulate her emotions in your favour. You made derogatory assertions about her to others and  allegations.  “You contacted her employers with the obvious intention of losing her her job. You have caused her very great distress and damaged her le. The stalking was clear evidence of some sort of inflated self-regard. You had a sense of entitlement and an expectation of subservience from her. The messages were cruel. “She was the third woman who you have harassed over the past decade. This was a sustained course of quite deliberate behaviour.” Ms Edgington, who has received counselling following her ordeal, says she is still scared every time the phone rings. Her nightmare began in June  and police were called three times. The head teacher continued pursuing his prey despite a non-molestation order being imposed in September  and did not stop until he was arrested in May this year. Ed Bailey, representing Hollins, said his client is thoroughly ashamed of his actions. ”It is a complete embarrassment for him, with a distinguished background as an ex headmaster, to be in the dock in a crown court,” Mr Bailey said. “It is a source of profound humiliation in terms of what he has achieved in his le. “He became utterly besotted with Ms Edgington from the moment he met her. His infatuation led to his blinkered behaviour. He could not let her go and was drawn into this abusive correspondence with her and her children.He accepts it was utterly unforgivable to threaten them in the way he did, knowing those threats would get back to her.” "},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather forecast up 5cm","story":"NewsUK weather forecast: Up to two inches of snow to blast Britain - will it hit your area The Met Office issued a yellow weather warning for ice until am on Sunday morning and has predicted snow will hit some parts of the country including up to cm in Northern IrelandShareCommentsByToby Meyjes:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video weather-forecast-icy-warnings-across-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news uk-weather-forecast-up-cm-\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

A lot of the success comes down to your set-up, and you should ensure you hold your end of the cracker lower than the other personaposs, so it is tilting downwards towards you.  To prevent the cracker tearing, you should also use a firm, two-handed grip, as reported by the.When it comes time for the action to begin, apply a slow, steady pull rather than a hard yank, which would compromise your section of the cracker.

The Litvinov family and their cat Zack moved into the House under the Dome in the Kangalassy industrial park in the suburbs of Yakutsk - where they will stay until the summer. The creators of the project decided to cover a one-storey building with a steel dome replete with frost-resistant PVC plastic sheeting. According to project coordinator Pavel Vasiliev, the researchers’ aim is to obtain data on the efficiency of heat consumption, the stability of the structure in severe climactic conditions. At the same time, the scientists will also monitor the physical state of the participants during the experiment. It is assumed that the temperature inside the dome will be  degrees below zero, and roughly  degrees below zero outside, so that the construction will save fuel for heating and protect the house from winds and snow.

The custom-built property comes equipped with a fully working spa, air conditioning, and even a slide. The house is home to just three important family members - a bull dog, a husky and a shiba. The three pooches live in the lap of luxury all at the expense of their doting owner.

Wu Dongbo, one of the neighbours, said: I think the owner is creative. The doghouse is equipped with air conditioning because the dogs may feel cold in winter.

Everybody in this league would want to add quality to their squad.“Looking at the bench on Saturday at Arbroath, we are a bit short. If we get a couple of injuries then you are short but you are always looking to improve anyway.“I’ve said before, I don’t want to go back to chopping and changing  players or whatever every window. That has happened for a number of windows at this club and that has to stop.“That’s why we were so busy in the summer so we don’t have to keep doing that. It has taken a bit of time to get everything right since then.“We are looking where we are short and what we can add but it has to be quality not just to add numbers to bulk up the squad for the second half of the season.”Next up for the Dark Blues is a home clash with one of the form sides in the ision at the moment, Dunfermline.Since Dundee have taken just one point from their last , Stevie Crawford’s Pars have racked up three wins on the spin.“It shows you what can happen,” added James. “We’ve kind of switched.

The big thing is they’re creating the chances for him and he’s putting them away.“I believe we’ve got strikers who are every bit as good as anybody in the league – and they will score plenty of goals with the right service.Arbroath - Dundee: Dark Blues# winless run extends to four thanks to Bobby Linn#s curler\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp arbroath---dundee-dark-blues-winless-run-extends-to-four-thanks-to-bobby-linns-curler embed # secrettQXpZpu\" data-secret\"tQXpZpu\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"“With the strikers we’ve got in our team, we have to play to their strengths.

When you are full of confidence you try things you wouldn’t do when it’s low.“The only way it is going to come back is by picking up results and grafting in training.“Hopefully, we can turn things soon.”Dundee head back to Dens Park aiming to rebuild their relationship with the home faithful after some very disappointing displays.However, Byrne says the Pars are a perfect example of how quickly things can turn around after three straight wins has seen Stevie Crawford’s side shoot up the ision.Byrne said: “We’ve got to win the fans round but we have to do it for ourselves as well.“It’s down to us to get results. We know it hasn’t been good enough as a team and inidually, so we need to get results. Only those will get fans back onside.”He added: “You could see when we got our three wins in a row it pushed us right up the table and you can see that now with Dunfermline.“I think they were down in mid-table and now they are up in third. One result can change a lot in this league and we need that.“Dunfermline will come here confident after a few good results but we are at home and we need to use that advantage.“We had a decent home record up until the last few. We need to get wins here and make this a hard place to come.”Byrne began his career with Dunfermline in the old First Division before moving on to Livingston after three years.There are still one or two old faces around the club he remembers but the midfielder insists his only focus is on his own, and the team’s, performance.“It’s a club I know really well and they gave me a chance to play in the first team,” he added.“I have a lot of good memories there but it was a long time ago now. I want to concentrate on doing well for Dundee, though.“I know myself I’ve not been good enough. I’ve had some good games but I’ve not played well consistently enough week to week.“When we got those three wins in October I was starting to feel good. Inidually, I know I can be a lot better.“I’m not going to say I’m going to do this and that. I can only work as hard as possible and I’m sure it will come together again and I can get back to how I was playing last season and enjoying things again.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/03/5c9395086ee127.15107893-846x564.jpg ","title":"mcmullan returns for arbroath clash","story":"Dundee United are set to welcome Paul McMullan back to the fold for tomorrow’s trip to Arbroath.The winger sat out Tuesday night’s - win at Morton with a groin strain picked up in the previous match against Alloa.However, the -year-old is expected to be fit for the Gayfield clash as United aim to pick up their eighth win in a row and stretch their -point lead at the top of the Championship.Terrors boss Robbie Neilson said: “He’ll be fine, he did a bit of training yesterday and we’re hopeful he’ll do full training today.“He had a problem in the game against Alloa but managed to get through the match.“We hoped it would settle down because it’s something he had a month or two ago as well.“He’ll be ready for tomorrow.”Robbie also gave an update on Peter Pawlettand Cammy Smithwith the former set to miss out once again.He added: “Peter’s going to be another couple of weeks.

She spent most of her time alone in her bedroom.One day she randomly bought an embroidery kit online and became hooked on having a task and “creating something beautul”, improving her feeling of self-worth in the process.Inspired, she was suddenly eager to take part in crafting sessions to learn more but could only manage a few steps outside the door.Nicola said: “Everyone was out living their lives and to me an achievement would be only napping once a day, instead of three times.“When I first started going out again it was terrying. I felt so shaky and unsure of everything.“I’d been in the house so long that one of our downstairs neighbours who moved in four years earlier didn’t even know I lived there.“I knew from research it was important not to push myself into things too fast, so I stopped at the end of the path.“Turning around to go back inside was a huge relief and getting back into our flat was like being wrapped in a big safety blanket but I soon became aware of how confined I was inside.” vw, px\"  Nicola slowly began to attend crafting workshops with her parents also in attendance, the first of which was a puppet making class ran by How It Felt.The social enterprise uses puppet-making and drama sessions to encourage people to talk about mental health issues, which Nicola says played a huge part in her recovery journey.From there she got the confidence to join other crafting groups and started an online distance learning course with the Embroiderer’s Guild to ease back into studying.Nicola says she still often feels unwell but the intensity has reduced to such an extent that she hopes to one day study at Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design."},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK streaming subscription service BritBoxwill launch later this yearat pound. a month, the BBC and ITV have said."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"sweet-smell-success-stunning-star-sophia-loren","story":"ON A rainy day in Glasgow, Sophia Loren gazes wistfully across the city, as starry-eyed shoppers gathered below in the hope of catching a glimpse of their idol."},{"url":null,"title":"2020-edition-glasgow-times-past-calendar---need-know","story":"ITS the bestselling calendar that each year showcases some great images from our huge photo archive."},{"url":null,"title":"rich-man-poor-man-life-expectancy-gap","story":"Men in the poorest areas of Glasgow are expected to die  years earlier than in the most affluent areas of Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"pre-payment-changes-scottish-gas-accounts","story":"Scottish Gas customers are being warned about changes to pre-payment accounts coming in the new year."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgows-st-mungo-miracles-know-history-books","story":"THE trouble with the Dark Ages is that they are very aptly named.

I want to make them proud and perhaps one day they will follow suit.”Since her first fundraising event, she’s gone on to hold four ladies’ nights, and three dinner dances.She’s also signed up to take on her third Kiltwalk next year, as well as the Highland Fling Bridge Swing in February.It’s hoped that in , this total will be brought up to £,.Lauren said: “I was on maternity leave so I just thought to myself that I’m going to do more, so I organised a mini photoshoot event for kids and a bigger dinner dance.“I’ve kind of started to lose count of what I’ve done.“I don’t really use the charity myself, but I wanted to support it because it runs in my family, and they’ve helped my family before.“They help with dficult things and do visits at home.“They do a lot for everyone affected by Huntington’s Disease, and they do a lot of research.“For the first time, I think a lot of people are a lot more hopeful, and have more courage.”Lauren was also presented with a fundraising volunteer of the year award from Scottish Huntington’s Association at its th anniversary family conference.Presenting the award to Lauren, Sarah Winckless MBE, patron of the charity, said: “Lauren puts so much effort into organising charity events for Scottish Huntington’s Association.“She has raised an amazing £, – and is increasing awareness among people who had never heard of Huntington’s disease before they met Lauren.“She has a busy lestyle with two young girls to bring up, yet Lauren still manages to organise amazing events including a ladies’ night, a dinner dance, afternoon teas and an evening with a medium.“Full of energy and great ideas, Lauren is a real inspiration who makes her family, and Scottish Huntington’s Association, proud.”Lauren added: “It was quite emotional.”For more information on Lauren’s upcoming events, and to book tickets, visit www.facebook lbeventsaberdeen"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor november 1 2019","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,It is time for Remembrance again and many people will be wearing a red poppy in support of the allied servicemen and women who suffered during the last century.White poppies have been on sale since  to support and remember all victims of all wars, be they civilian or military and regardless of race or gender.

Argyll and Bute Council will receive a total of £. million to fund their services in - which, taken alongside the council tax increase they have decided to implement, will give the council an additional £. million this year compared to last – a rise of . per cent.They will also receive their fair share of the extra funding that has already been announced during the current financial year including £ million for teacher’s pay and £. million for increased teacher’s pension contributions.The council could do a number of things to improve its own prospects.You and your administration could work hard to influence the COSLA formula which does not favour rural authorities with falling populations. The Scottish Government Cabinet Secretary for Finance has confirmed to us that he is always willing to consider suggestions, through COSLA, from inidual local authorities.You and your administration could be more imaginative in streamlining central management and devolving delivery and local decision-making closer to local people.You and your administration could maximise income whilst remembering that local businesses are the leblood of recovery. The recent massive hike in inspection charges for food products is an example of the wrong decision being likely to damage the economy rather than enhance it.You and your administration could maximise your assets by working with communities. The council has been slow to undertake any signicant asset transfer which could lead to useful and productive partnerships.You and your administration could be more responsive to, and careful with, communities. The waste of money and time on things like the abortive Traffic Regulating Order for Mull and Iona indicates where you are not using resource wisely and storing up dficulties for the future.You and your administration could ensure that any cuts do not fall on essential services needed for future success. The proposed reduction in educational support staff is an example of where a choice is being made that will not only be counterproductive in terms of our collective future and wellbeing, but will also lose the council local sympathy and support.And you and your administration could prepare to use the already agreed additional £ million for the rural growth deal – coming jointly from the Scottish and UK Governments # to make a long term dference in your performance by instituting a step change in the local economy.As your local constituency parliamentarians we are committed to ensuring the maximum resource comes from central government to Argyll and Bute.We are always happy to work alongside, and in support of, the council and we would be keen to meet to help you develop a detailed plan for the future of the area we are all elected to serve. But we must all be straight with local people and explain that responsibility for the dficulties that the council is experiencing do not all lie at the door of the Scottish Government, and therefore nor do all the possible solutions.Michael Russell MSP and Brendan O’Hara MP"},{"url":null,"title":"negotiating the modern world","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhy is it so hard to negotiate the modern world That is the question asked by Dame Helen Mirren in the Radio Times.

COSLA has made a very clear request of the Scottish Government in terms of funding for local councils next year – three per cent plus inflation. The choices facing the council would be substantially dferentthis was delivered and of course it’s the Scottish Cabinet, including our MSP, who actually make the decisions.The fact is that over the past  years, the council has had to make savings of over £million. That means real hardship for many local people – many jobs lost, many services withdrawn. That is the sad reality.Like all councillors I#m sure, I would be happy to work with the local MP and MSP to make the case for more funding for Argyll and Bute.Councillor Aileen Morton, Argyll and Bute Council leaderSir,Regarding council leader Aileen Morton’s comments in the edition of the Advertiser dated October  # why should the public tolerate more cuts to their services year on yearthey are consistently paying their council tax and other taxes This seems unfair and should be challenged. Surely council leader Morton should be saying to the Scottish Government that the funding provided is not enough and we can’t make any more cuts.Instead of a reduced budget, the council should be asking for an increased budget to operate services when you consider all the cutbacks to their budget over the past few years.Perhapsthe situation was made clear to the Scottish Government by local councils that annual cuts to local authority services cannot be sustained, this situation will stop.It is unfair on council staff too, with threats of cutbacks having a negative effect on their own jobs through no fault of their own. Adding more work to an employee already struggling with their workload causes more stress which is not good for staff or their employer.Instead of accepting a reduced budget, please therefore can the budget be challenged and not accepted Peter Laing, LochgilpheadSir,Being non-funded, Mojo Festival of Original Music relies on my own initial outlay and the kindly volunteering of the team to help achieve at least a small bonus for all the hard working and talented acts who put on a really good night at the event.This year, even though we had more expenses, we had an even bigger attendance which meant we made roughly the same profit as last yearto share out, giving the bands £ each. Also the bands sold tickets along with their merchandise to give an extra £ approx to the cause. We had a total of  people in attendancewhich is our best ever turnout.The best part though was how much everyone enjoyed what was a night of some of the best original music Argyll has to offer # and you can#t put a price on that. Well done to all who were there and supported the whole event.Dan and crew, Mojo organisersSir,Among the many concerns caused by you-know-what is the very real fear that hospitals and high street pharmacies will run out of vital medical supplies which would normally arrive from factories in Malta, Hungary and Poland.So why are generic medicines not made in Lochgilphead, in Campbeltown and in Rothesay  After all, calcium supplement tablets are made in Galashiels by a Japanese brewery company.Glasgow Health Board built a brand new wee factory on the Western Infirmary Glasgow University campus  years to manufacture some but not all of their requirements. Not only did this save a great deal of money but the board  also earned considerable extra income by selling their products to other health boards, including Dumbarton and Argyll.All in all, the costs of building and equipping the Hillhead factory proved to be a very sound investment indeed.Duncan I Macdougall, TarbertSir,I write following last week#s open letter by SNP politicians Mike Russell and Brendan O#Hara in which they attempted to evade responsibility for the budget problems facing Argyll and Bute Council.These comments display extraordinary hypocrisy, revealing how out-of-touch these SNP politicians are with the realities of the challenges facing Argyll and Bute Council.The financial pressures on this council are a direct consequence of the repeated unfair financial settlements imposed on the council by the SNP government over the last  years.Brendan O#Hara should get on the phone to Nicola Sturgeon and demand a fair deal for Argyll and Bute instead of blaming everyone .Donald Cameron MSP, Highlands and Islands"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters human impact on climate change then and now","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowHuman activity from the industrial revolution onwards is causing global warming which,not halted, will have catastrophic consequences.Now scientists suggest that human activity several centuries earlier also caused climate change*.

Those of us familiar with it know full well to treat it with respect and to be particularly careful when coming away from Cairnbaan towards Lochgilphead.Like Rev Mackenzie, I am aware of a number of accidents there over the last  months. I would estimate at least five,not more. This is a hugely disproportionate amount compared with other junctions on this road. That fact alone should ring alarm bells with the roads authority.This, however, is not the be-all-and-end-all. I have personally witnessed more near misses at the junction than I would care to mention. The problem comes particularly, but not exclusively, during the height of the tourist season with drivers who are not familiar with the area.Rev Mackenzie quite rightly points out there is a deceptive vista that appears to make the road look like a long straight one and despite the presence of warning signs, for some reason, these are ignored.I thought it rather a trite response from Argyll and Bute Council, which is effectively saying the junction meets all legal requirements sign wise and motorists need to be more aware. It is effectively shrugging its shoulders about the reality of the situation and refusing to take the constant presence of risk seriously.It really does need someone to come up with a genuine solution that will eliminate these risks as far as humanly possible and hopefully curtail the number of incidents that will inevitably occur in futurenothing positive is done.Peter J Garrett, Ardrishaig.Sir,We are now into gloomier weather conditions and on occasions a low sun casts long shadows on our roads.I have advice for cyclists who venture on to the highways wearing black hats, black jackets, black trousers, black shoes, carrying black bags and riding their black bikes.Wear clothes that enhance your visibility, please.Earlier this year, in such conditions, I passed such a cyclist on my way into Oban.

The games were well contested, and the Argyll boys could have won both games. Two lapses of concentration against Lomond let them in for easy tries and only two points separated the teams in the Shawlands game at the end, when SAS had been in the lead for large parts of the match.The whole team thought it was important to finish the group with a good home win.The boys set out their stall early at MacRae Park when a contested ruck ended with a good turnover from SAS number seven McLean and a great pass out to winger Gritten from number eight McColl-Smith, who then released MacKay. The full back ran  yards to score under the posts and then convert his own try.SAS were next on the score sheet when Captain Donald Self went over the whitewash. MacKay converted and SAS were  –  up.Some good play from both teams was making for a great game, enjoyed by a large home crowd. Pupils were given the chance to watch the game and they made their voices heard and, spurred on by the crowd, Euan MacArthur was next on the score sheet and once again MacKay converted the try.The first half finished - to the home team.The second half started with Boclair coming back at SAS and, after some good running, they pulled a try back.SAS found themselves under sustained pressure and soon Boclair had a second try. Only one try was converted, and the score was -. Another try, this one converted, for Boclair and the pressure was really on.South Argyll thought they had secured the game when Ellis went over and grounded the ball only to realise he had gone over the dead ball line.

Nos.  and  # and his third Ballade. The second Polonaise was particularly impressive with its menacing opening figure and Vitaly#s judicious use of the sustaining pedal lent great clarity to all three pieces and indeed to all his recital.After the intermission came Beethoven#s Sonata Op.  No. . By this time Beethoven had developed his own inidual persona and the three contrasting movements of this work were beautully executed, particularly the Adagio with its slow melody and stuttering accompaniment and the contrasting fluidity of the final Allegretto.Next we heard Bela Bartok#s Suite Op. . This was typical Bartok from beginning to end, spikey, angular and generally very speedy and played with incredible precision. When I said to Vitaly that it sounded fiendishly dficult he retorted: # It#s actually quite easy I learned it in three days.#While not normal fare for our audience this, hopefully, was an interestingFirebird is probably Stravinsky#s best known work apart from, maybe, his #Rite of Spring#, and both were originally written as ballet scores. However, due to their popularity, over time these and other works of his have been transcribed by ious people for all sorts of instrumental combinations, and the Agosti transcription of Firebird for piano solo that Vitaly played as his finale is probably the most well known. It makes huge demands on the soloist as Agosti endeavoured to encapsulate Stravinsky#s rich orchestration into a work for only two hands it only works in the correct hands and Vitaly#s were just such hands.This was an electrying rendition and not just for the sheer virtuosity as there were gorgeous quiet sections as well. The thunderous applause at the end said it all.Virtuosity is a given nowadays and over the years we have heard some fine pianists at Ardrishaig, but it was Vitaly#s musical integrity and attention to detail which was a cut above and truly inspirational. This was indeed a recital to remember.The concert, in Ardrishaig Public Hall, was staged by Mid Argyll Arts Association in association with Argyll and Bute Concert tours."},{"url":null,"title":"no need for stress shop local in festive lochgilphead","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowNow there is need to rush out on your lunch break, or even break your neck heading into town before the Big Day # Lochgilphead retailers are opening late, so you can relax while getting your Christmas shopping finished.A #shop local# initiative is being promoted around town, encouraging shoppers to support local businesses by purchasing their Christmas gts and festive feasts locally.On Thursday December  many of Lochgilphead#s shops will be open late, including The Square Peg Marmalade Deli Danny#s Ironmongers Fyne Tackle Argyll Book Centre Breagha R  S Stovecraft Love Dove Studio The Sweetie Jar West Coast Home Fyne Living Bluestone Argyll Pharmacy Mary#s Meals Argyll Gt Company The Archway D  D Wool and Crafts and The Mail Box, including the post office, will also be offering the usual postal servicesyou have any gts still to send off.Rumour has it that some shops will also be offering festive nibbles and drinks, plus promotional offers and discounts."},{"url":null,"title":"argyll and bute goes to the westminster polls","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowPolling stations were busy from the time they opened at am for the first December general election since .Polling stations will close at pm across the UK, after which Argyll and Bute ballot boxes will be transported by road, sea and air to the constituency count at Lochgilphead Joint Campus.As one of the largest and most geographically dispersed constituencies in the country # including  inhabited islands # the time between the first voting papers arriving and the last will be considerable.When all the ballot boxes have arrived and counting is complete, the results will be veried before being formally announced, with the result expected around am on Friday December ."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 5 the nineteenth hole","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWelcome to Episode Season  Finale # Join presenters Stephen Day, George Graham and Keith McIntyre for more golfing chat about Bob and other golfing fun # with additional material from David McPhee, Bruce McNab, Neil Armour, and Charles Spreadburry.This week they discuss more golfing terminology, look at some stats and even answer a listener#s question.You can listen and or download all Episodes of The BOBcast below"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column december 13 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsNever mind the general election, with its deep isions and rancour, let alone the circumstances which brought it about.

particularly bathers going through the motions and winning the No-Belle Prize - the capers and costumes were crazy, and the fun-filled score was sensational.But the true highlights of this adorable show were the tearjerkers and the heart-breaking performances of Aimee Richardson, as Belle, and Sam Johnston, as Prince Danton.The Right Angle Theatre Company has uncovered a couple of crackers with these two.Their dueted version of Calum Scotts Youre the Reason was breathtaking.Johnston had already made an impact with his remarkably good take on Im On My Way, and Richardson had shone throughout the early scenes, but once together it was veneration rather than laughter that resounded around the Volunteer Hall.Steve Hartley-Oliver didnt help either with his accomplished performance as the tormented Beast.And, while slightly more limited in his vocal range than the two leads, his performance of Lewis Capaldis Someone You Loved had most reaching for the tissues.But Beauty and the Beast is much, much more than a weep-fest.Tracy Borthwick and Emma Wilson were a hoot as Belles sisters, Whitney and Britney.From their fainting fits at the sight of Gustave to their obsession with treatments, laughs were never far away.And the dynamic duo of Stuart Mitchell and Amanda Blacklock as the Brawest beauticians in Galae, Marcell and Monique, had the hall in uproar for much of the night.Clad in Olivia Newtown-John-esque Lets Get Physical clobber from the s, Blacklock and Mitchell stole many a scene.And their accents - Mitchells pure Galae and Blacklocks Essex - worked a treat.Craig Douglass De Niro-sounding Gustave also had his fair share of one-liners in his attempts to deflect the unwanted attentions of Whitney and Britney.And both Julie Smith, as Madame Le Fou, and Scott Robertson, as Alphonse, were a delight with their over-the-top performances.A panto, though, isnt a panto without a dame.The Right Angle Theatre Company appears to have a natural - Jodie Millar as Madame Fi was yet again a sensation.From wild wigs and fervently festive costumes to hilariously adapted versions of Ghostbusters and Chansom Damour, Millar made the stage his own.And he was ably supported by Billy Rooney as Fis son, Jacques.Having tumbled straight from the set of childrens show Rainbow, Rooney has a natural ability for slapstick.Rachel Falconer provided the good side of panto from the sidelines as the fairy Flora, while hitting back with her own couplets was Amy Welsh as the sinister Belladonna.,params: .pushWelsh, with her scarlet dress and green-lighting, was remarkably good as the villain.All good shows, though, rely on the music and Calders song choice was spot-on.From the Boo Radleys and Abba to Elton John and Queen, Beauty and the Beast was a foot-tapping, sing-alonging great night out.While the hits rolled, traditional favourites werent forgotten.The wonderful cast of children were delightful with their environmentally aware Country Gardens and Ugly Bugs Ball, and they made sure Coulter wasnt forgotten with a lovely version of Ally Bally Bee.Stuart Mitchell and Julie Smith should take an additional bow for the choreography.And the dancers and chorus were in fine form throughout the show with every big number being turned into a visual treat.As has become the custom with the Right Angle Theatre Companys annual panto, the loudest cheers of the night were saved for the Braw Lad and Lass as well as Santa Claus.While the mood wasnt always merry, Beauty and the Beast provided the opportunity for this talented company to showcase what they can do - and oh, how they took it.CastFlora - Rachel FalconerBelladonna - Amy WelshBelle - Aimee RichardsonWhitney - Tracy BorthwickBritney - Emma WilsonMarcel - Stuart MitchellMonique - Amanda BlacklockGustave -

He mentioned that the firm was #hoping to get the whole building#.Samples of Davaar Seafoods produce were sent to consumers in Chicago and Paris and opinions passed on the quality of the samples were favourable.The scallop processing method employed is a simple one. The shellfish are dipped into hot water, and the shells open. The insides of the creatures are removed and scraped clean. Then the meat is thoroughly washed.Shellfish factories are operating successfully in Tarbert and Port Ellen.Harmony Hour guests of R.A.F. on thThe th of November,  will long be remembered by the members of Campbeltown Harmony Hour Club who were guests at an excellent fireworks display at R.A.F.

Burnley Campbell, and others also extended a cordial welcome, the men being cheered as they marched with the colours to headquarters.The cadre was entertained at a civic luncheon in McColl#s Hotel in the afternoon.Those present said they were delighted to welcome home the local battalion. Throughout the war they had watched with pride the heroic work performed by the battalion, and they would remember with gratitude the sacrices that had been made.Maclachlan of Maclachlan mentioned that the total casualties of the  th Argylls during the war were  officers and  other ranks.The honours of the regiment received were one V.C., two D.S.O.#s, many M.C.#s and M.M.#s, and other lesser honours.Major Lockie, who commanded the cadre, acknowledged the cordial welcome they had received.A day of remembranceThe King#s desire that the first anniversary of the Armistice should be observed by a two minutes silence in reverent remembrance of the glorious dead was fulfilled all over the country on Tuesday.In London wreaths were laid on the Cenotaph in Whitehall. These included one from the King and Queen, one from President Poincaré and one from the Prime Minister.The scenes in the streets of Glasgow were full of solemnity, when all traffic stopped and the crowds stood in reverent silence as the clocks stuck eleven. Work ceased in the Clyde shipyards and on the shipping in the river.In Campbeltown the signal was given by the sounding of three long syren blasts from H.M.S. Thames, and the fallen were honoured by the uncovering of heads.Of course in a comparatively quiet country town the tribute lacked the impressiveness that characterised it in busy cities.In the Grammar School the scholars assembled in the large room at .a.m., when the rector gave a short address on the meaning of the celebration, read the King#s message, and explained shortly the aims of the League of Nations Union.A hymn as then sung, the two minutes# silence observed, and after the National Anthem had been sung, the pupils were dismissed for the day.In Dalintober School the period of silence was similarly observed and the scholars were afterwards dismissed."},{"url":null,"title":"leader november 15 2019","story":"Remembrance is one of the main topics in this week#s Courier.We increasingly rely on our youngsters to keep the memory of the First and Second World Wars alive as those who experienced them first-hand # and second-hand # fade away.Renowned First World War poet Wilfred Owen, who was himself killed in action in , wrote of #the old lie# # #Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori#, which translates from Latin as #It is sweet and proper to die for one#s country#.Remembrance should not be about glorying war, but remembering the horric atrocities which are committed in its name so that in future they may be avoided.The four young people who took part in the service at Glenbarr War Memorial are direct descendants of men from the area who fell in battle.

Social care, mental health and primary care services are all crying out for more support, and better resourcing them would take the pressure off the accident and emergency service.The SNP government have failed to meet the AE target time every month for over two years. They need to take swt action to properly prepare AE departments before winter sets in. A good place to start would be publishing the integrated workforce plan that staff were told would be out last year. Another broken SNP promise.Yours,Alan Reid, Liberal Democrat candidate for Argyll  Bute.Connected nationSir,Before I address Alan Reid’s comments on superfast broadband , it ought to be remembered that this is the same ex Liberal Democrat MP who propped up the Tories and imposed years of toxic austerity measures on Scotland, shrinking the UK economy by £ billion, imposing Dickensian social policies # like the Bedroom Tax # on the poorest in society, and voluntarily choosing to make Tory cuts possible.The Liberal Democrats are deeply stained by austerity and they will remain, rightly, untrusted as the Tories little helpers.Mr Reid berates the SNP government for alleged failure to deliver superfast broadband. Yet, inspite of the unique dficulties in delivering superfast broadband in rural Scotland, which BT described as the ‘most signicant geographic challenge in the UK, and arguably Europe’, the latest Ofcom ‘Connected Nations’  report shows that Scotland outperforms the UK as a whole when it comes to new broadband deployment.There remains work to be done and the Scottish government is committed to delivering the best possible value and completing the roll out by  .Mr Reid is right to say that contracts have not been finalised yet, but with telecommunications and broadband reserved to Westminster, the changes in contracts imposed by UK ministers mean that bidders require additional time to recalibrate their bids.It is up to Mr Reid to carp from the sidelines, but readers can be confident that this SNP Scottish government will deliver a future proof network that will make Scotland one of the best connected places in Europe.Yours,Ron Wilson,Secretary Kintyre SNP.Coffee thanksSir,This year our World’s Biggest Coffee Morning fundraiser entered its th year.In community centres, schools and workplaces, thousands of coffee mornings were held across Scotland to raise money and help us support people affected by cancer.I would like to offer a huge and heartfelt thanks to every single one of your readers who held or attended a coffee morning – your energy and generosity never ceases to amaze us.Whether it’s specialist cancer nurses, support workers or benefit advisors, we can only offer the support that people with cancer need thanks to the tireless fundraising efforts of our supporters.The number of people who need our help is growing, and we want to offer support to everyone who needs it.

But she asked why the young woman was so determined to climb the stairs, even though she was clearly very ill and finding it dficult.This led to me mentioning who Anne Frank was and that people visit the attic because itrsquos the place where she hid.ldquoWhy was she hiding  was the inevitable question, just as bedtime arrived.I was suddenly presented with a dilemma, not so much that bedtime was now delayed, but how to explain to a six-year-old the depth of evil and hatred that was the reason for Anne Frank having to hide in an attic with her family. And then whether to explain what happened to her after she was discovered.I knew that I couldnrsquot just ignore her question. So we searched for images of Anne Frank, which meant she became a real person for my daughter.Skye studied her and said she looked nice and kind, and asked again why she was hiding.I explained that people who didnrsquot even know her hated her just because she was a bit dferent to them. I couldnrsquot explain the horrors of genocide and concentration camps, but she understood that Anne Frank and her family must have been really scared to hide in an attic.ldquoWhat happened to her  asked Skye as she dressed for bed.This was not a bedtime story I wanted to tell. Indeed, for a child so young, it was not a story I wanted to tell at all. She knows there are bad people and staying safe is important, but we feel the need to protect our children from the evil and hatred that is sadly so deep-seated.But it is at this young age that the seeds of intolerance and hatred can be plantedthey are not encouraged and helped to feel empathy to others, including those who are dferent in fact, especially those who are dferent.So I told her a lsquochild-friendlyrsquo version of Anne Frankrsquos story,there can be such a thing. I gave no details of the horror of the Holocaust but we imagined how she must have missed her family when they were split up, and how sad it was that she died not long before the war ended.She wanted to look at Anne Frankrsquos photo again and say goodnight to her.ldquoThank goodness that could never happen to us here, could it dad ldquoNo, that is not going to happen, and we have to make sure it doesnrsquot happen to anyone  either, I reassured her.I felt quite emotional as I went downstairs with my kids sleeping safely in their cosy beds. I thought of the families in Syria who cannot keep their children safe from hatred and violence. I knew that such horrors could happen anywhere, at any time yes, even here yes, maybe even to us or our neighbours or friends. In fact, hatred of dference is indeed amongst us.A friend of mine was on a bus heading from East Lothian into Edinburgh last week and witnessed a horrible racist verbal assault on a Polish family. The horric murders in London are also part of the same hatred of dference ndash a man so full of hatred for people who think dferently that he randomly killed two amazing young people.Hatred is a virus that can infect any society and any inidual in it. History has taught us that fanning its flames can be an easy way for politicians to win power. But like real fire, once itrsquos released it can spread and destroy uncontrollably.People say fight fire with fire, but here the comparison ends, for we cannot fight hatred with hatred. Hatred only spawns more of it.And so I searched for words of that remarkable young woman Anne Frank, who left her diary behind, unknowing that it would be her gt to the world. Words I could share with my daughter, from one young thinking child to another. Despite writing at a time of unimaginable fear and horror, in her diary she has left us a timeless message of hope that comes from her rejection of hate:ldquoItrsquos dficult in times like these ideals, dreams and cherished hopes rise within us, only to be crushed by grim reality. Itrsquos a wonder I havenrsquot abandoned all my ideals, they seem so absurd and impractical. Yet I cling to them because I still believe, in spite of everything, that people are truly good at heart.It is our responsibility to live up to that inspiring message from a young woman who was a victim of the hate she rejected utterly to show our children, our family and friends, our colleagues and those we meet on a bus, that love, tolerance, empathy and respect of dference is the counter to hate.And we should expect no less from all our politicians."},{"url":null,"title":"bid-replace-old-boxing-gym-housing","story":"REM Associates have lodged planning applications seeking to replace the th century former Tranent Methodist Church building on Bridge Street with four two-bedroom flats.They submitted the applications on behalf of businessman and premises owner Alex Brown, who founded Bronx Boxing Gym, which was based at the old church, a decade ago.In recent years, Mr Brown had no involvement in the running of the boxing club but still let its boxers use the building.However, costly repairs were needed to make the former church safe, which led to the boxing club vacating the premises.Earlier this year, the club moved to the newly established Fit-in Fitness Gym on High Street, Musselburgh.A planning application has been submitted for the former church building and the east wall which faces the car park on Coal Neuk to be demolished.Drawings included within a second planning application show designs for erecting four two-bedroom flats with a basement car park with space for four cars."},{"url":null,"title":"familys-spectacular-christmas-lights-display","story":"The Woods family open their very own Santarsquos grotto and decorate their home each year to raise money for Mission Christmas and Cash for Kids.This year, there are more than , lights at their family home and in their garden.Dad Stevie Woods said the family ldquojust love Christmas and hope the stream of visitors theyrsquore expecting will leave donations for charity, either cash or a toy.They raised pound on their opening night.The lights were switched on for visitors on Sunday at pm and will be on from .pm to pm daily until Christmas.The grotto is open for visitors, who can enjoy the Disney characters painted on the inside and the Christmas films playing.There is also a Santa Sleigh where children can get their photograph taken, and this year there will be the addition of a Santa train, which Stevie made himself out of whisky barrels.He said: ldquoLast year we raised about pound so wersquore hoping to beat that.

the proposals are put to the public.And angry business owners are also planning to place banners outside the townrsquos General Election polling station at the Aubigny Centre today .In recent weeks, East Lothian Council has repeatedly changed plans for a public consultation on a controversial proposal for a new car park east of the town centre. One business owner accused the local authority of trying to ide and confuse people so they did not attend.It comes after the council:Haddington Business Community Partnership had asked the council to postpone the public consultation until the start of the new year because it believes the local authority has breached Scottish Government guidelines stating that consultation exercises should not be launched during local or national election periods.A spokesperson for the council has denied this is the case and insisted it is a normal part of pre-consultation process.Community councillor Pat Lemmon said the decisions of the council were disappointing.She said: ldquoIt does not encourage feelings of trust for everyone working together. The ground rules change by the day.And she said the councilrsquos handling of the proposals had caused major distrust among residents, particularly when it came to the independently produced Haddington Vision document officials use to support their case.She said: ldquoThe Haddington Vision strongly said any changes had to be looked at by all the stakeholders, by everyone concerned, to avoid any ill feeling, to make everyone feel they had been consulted as part of proposed plans.ldquoThe statement made that East Lothian Council hopes to be in a position to implement a decision by March  indicates to me that there appears to be a race on to secure funding for the transportation hub.ldquoIf this is the case, is this the right decision given the strong views for and against any proposed hub in the town and the proposed town centre plans currently being discussed by the steering group ldquoTo have such a meeting so close to Christmas, and the stakeholder consultation at a time when many people are working, seems to me to be a bad decision.ldquoI am very disappointed that such a decision has been made.A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council previously confirmed that the drop-in event would run -pm, with a public notice in the Courier of November  confirming that was the case.The event was to give local residents and businesses ldquothe opportunity to discover more about the proposals for a transport hub in Haddington.She said: ldquoThey will also be able to see the progress and history of the project to date, including the consideration of  dferent sites across the town.ldquoComments can be recorded as part of this consultation which will help inform the future development of the proposal and will be followed by another consultation in the New Year.However, the public section of the event has been reduced to just  minutes.When asked why the format of the event had been changed, the spokeswoman said: ldquoDue to a combination of level of interest and availability of staff, a stakeholders meeting will be held at pm and invitees include local business owners, schools, community council, sports clubs, transport companies and accessibility and active travel interests. [The] public event will start at pm.Other sites considered for the car park and dropped for ldquoious reasons include the field between West Road, Park Lane, Pencaitland Road and Letham Drive, and the site of the former Haddington Nursery School Annexe, off Meadowpark, which has also been earmarked for a housing development.The plans for Whittingehame Drive, which were drawn up following a series of closed door meetings, came under fire from a number of Haddington residents.Concerns ranged from the loss of green space on the site, which is beside the townrsquos skate park and G sports pitches, to the potential for accidents with youngsters playing next to the car park.The transport hub, which would include a car park with somewhere between  and  spaces, could also include ldquobus connections, bike hire opportunities and new pathways.According to East Lothian Council, the facility,approved, has ldquothe potential to free up parking spaces in the town for short-stay use, making it easier for people to access local businesses, essential services and tourist attractions.However, business owners were among those raising concerns about the proposals.George James, who runs the East Lothian TV and Video Repair Centre on High Street, felt that the last-minute changes were an attempt by the council to ide people.He said: ldquoIt is clearly isive and an effort to stop people attending the public consultations.ldquoWe are a local business and have been told we cannot attend the stakeholdersrsquo meeting as we are not considered stakeholders.ldquoWe are encouraging as many people as possible to join a protest at the Town House on Monday evening we are determined to ensure they do not get away with this approach, which appears shambolic.Karla Green from the shop is handing out leaflets advising people about the public meeting but the times have changed so much even her leaflets are now out of date.She said: ldquoThey still have pm on them so we have to tell everyone that the time has changed ndash again.Project consultants WYG will be in attendance on Monday and will have a number of display boards showing the extent of proposals.Council transport officers will also be in the Town House and people will have the opportunity to ask questions.A council spokesperson said: ldquoThe public lsquodrop-inrsquo part is now -.pm and it has been extended due to securing availability of key members of the project team being available to answer public questions.ldquoInvitations to the stakeholdersrsquo meeting are for two representatives from a range of organisations involved in business transport in Haddington and confirmed invitees include Haddington Business Community Partnership, Haddington Community Development Trust, East Coast Buses, Prentice Coaches, Lothian Buses."},{"url":null,"title":"pair-travel-10k-wheelchairs-help-day-centre","story":"Megan Roland from Gford and Joanne Rye from Ormiston both completed the k journey from Ormiston to Tranent and back with help from their support workers.Through sponsorship they raised pound for Ormistonrsquos Primrose Day Centre.Megan, , and Joanne, , have support needs and have required the use of wheelchairs all their lives.They duo had assistance on the trek from their support workers Catherine Mitchell and Jackie Hoy.Joanne told the Courier: ldquoIt was exciting because Jackie, Megan and Cath did it with me and my niece and sister came along too.ldquoWe did it for Alzheimerrsquos as my mum has it and I wanted to do it for the Primrose Day Centre as she goes there.ldquoIt was a very successful and very fun sponsored walk.Megan and Joanne used to live together until Megan moved out to a house of her own.They have been on holidays together, including one memorable trip to Blackpool."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/10531390.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"gerry-cinnamon-announces-second-glasgow-hydro-gig-popular-demand","story":"The Castlemilk singer recently told how he is to play the SSE Hydro on December  following his insane TRNSMT set.This morning the venue confirmed a second leg of his Glasgow show the next night for December .EXTRA DATE ANNOUNCED FOR @GerryCinnamon!!

This weekrsquos win is the latest tier of the tower.But it isall constructed on a muddled,mongrelmandate.True, the SNP and Scottish Greens won a majority of Holyrood seats in .But their MSPs were elected on very dferent manestos when it came to independence.In the wake of the No vote just  months previously, both parties felt obliged to tiptoe round the issue.To avoid being accused of ignoring the publicrsquos will, they resorted to tortured formulations that have undermined the notion of a clear mandate ever since.In the  Scottish election, the SNP had been clear and upfront.ldquoWe will give Scots the opportunity to decide our nationrsquos future in an independence referendum, said the manesto on which they won an absolute majority, triggering the referendum of .But in , that straightforward pitch was rewritten and made contingent on other events.The manesto position became a statement that Holyrood ldquoshould have the right to hold another referendumthere is clear and sustained evidence that independence has become the preferred option of a majority of the Scottish people - orthere is a signicant and material change in the circumstances that prevailed in , such as Scotland being taken out of the EU against our will.Despite Ms Sturgeonrsquos subsequent elevation of it, at the time this was essentially a box-ticking exercise. Like most of the country, the SNP did not believe Brexit would happen. It famously spent less money campaigning to stay in the EU than it did on a byelection in Glenrothes.However, as the main party of independence, it had to refer to a referendum somehow.So it arrived at a baroque, Brexit-related form of words that held out the possibility of independence, albeit in what it then considered highly improbable circumstances.The SNP then went backwards in . Although its constituency vote share rose .%, their regional share fell .%, and they fell from  MSPs to , losing their overall majority.A rum sort of basis for a mandate.Meanwhile, the Scottish Greens went off on their own tangent.Their  manesto had touted ldquoa multi-option referendum with choices including the status quo, a stronger Scottish Parliament with powers defined through a participative process, and full independence based on a written constitution.But by September , the Greens said the timing of Indyref, should no longer be the plaything of politicians.Instead it ldquoshould be determined by public appetitehellip For example, a call for a referendum signed by up to m people on the electoral register.Thus their  manesto said: ldquoIf a new referendum is to happen, it should come about by the will of the people, and not be driven by calculations of party political advantage. In such a referendum the Scottish Greens will campaign for independence.But there was never a petition.All of which gives Boris Johnson enough room to contest the validity of Ms Sturgeonrsquos mandate, at least until the  election comes round.

in a declaration thatrsquos enough to make you want to pour a very stf drink ndash a dram, preferably ndash our national drink has been declared as anything but.According to the makers of a new film that explores the cultural impact of whisky from its origins to modern times, whiskyrsquos Scottish roots would appear to be ever so slightly Irish.Asthat wasnrsquot enough to make whisky drinkers choke on their finest malt, therersquos even a very strong hint that our best-loved export might just have a slice of English DNA too.According to Glasgow-based whisky expert Dave Broom, who explores whiskyrsquos heritage in the film The Amber Light, and its producer Adam Park, there is ldquostrong evidence to suggest whisky may have been first developed in Ireland and brought to Islay, to be drunk at the seat of the High Kings.There, under the distilling expertise of one particular Irish family, the spirit is thought to have evolved into a tipple bearing at least a passing similarity to todayrsquos whisky.According to Mr Park, research carried out for the film suggests the Beaton family ndash Irish physicians who developed a vast international knowledge of botanical remedies ndash probably hold the key to the earliest forms of what would become the first Scotch whisky.ldquoThe Beatons were pretty amazing people, they travelled the world translating medical scripts and building their knowledge, he said.ldquoThey came to service of the High Kings and became experts in distilling spirit and added to it the plants and flowers that grew around them.The Beatons, whose family name appears as MacMeic-bethad and MacBeth, are thought to have arrived on Islay in the th century at the time of the marriage between Aine OrsquoCathain and Angus Og MacDonald, Lord Of The Isles.While there is no clear documentation to conclusively link the family to the origins of whisky, there are said to be clear signs their skills were almost certainly involved.Mr Park added: ldquoIt gets murky and therersquos not an accepted history of how whisky came about, but the best guess is the Beatons came to Islay when it was the seat of the High Kings who ruled huge parts of Scotland and Ireland.However, research for the film led to another twist: the English were probably already creating their own form of a dram at about the same time.Speaking to the , Mr Broom said: ldquoIf you look at the north of Ireland and across to Islay, thatrsquos the cradle of distillationhellip but the first record I found is in Chaucerrsquos Canterbury Tales.The Beaton family became hereditary physicians to the Scottish crown, serving Robert The Bruce and every subsequent Scottish king, while also providing medical knowledge to clan chiefs from the Western Isles to the Lowlands.They were known to make use of medicinal plants and traditional therapies at a time when others relied on superstition and myths as often ill-fated cures for illnesses and injuries.As word spread of their comforting drink, whisky stills spread across Scotland.Scotch whisky was first recorded on the Exchequer Rolls in  when a friar called John Cor, distiller at Lindores Abbey in Newburgh, Fe, and servant to the court of James IV, was noted to have made ldquoaqua vitae, VIII bolls of malt.While the Beatonrsquos fellow countrymen pursued distilling their own Irish whiskey, Mr Park says Scotsrsquo ingenious methods of circumventing taxes and American prohibition laws ndash when Scotch was allowed as a ldquomedicinal product ndash helped embed whisky as the premium spirit.Later, shrewd marketing practices with their focus on Highland history and heritage, saw whisky overwhelm its Irish and American cousins and lay foundations for todayrsquos pound. billion export market.The film, which is currently touring cinemas across the country, also explores how whisky has become embedded in Scottish culture yet is constantly evolving to attract new generations of drinkers.That, he adds, includes cocktails and mixers that shatter whiskyrsquos traditional ldquogentleman in tweeds image ndash such as Lagavulin mixed with Coke, dubbed a Smokey Cokey.ldquoLike any commercial enterprise, whisky needs to attract new customers, says Mr Park. ldquoThe image of the stuffy old man in a leather armchair in the library having an undiluted single malt is still there, but itrsquos also not there.A spokesman for the Scotch Whisky Association said: ldquoThe earliest known record of Scotch Whisky production dates from the Exchequer Rolls of , but it is likely the lsquoAqua Vitaersquo was being produced long before this date.ldquoIt is likely early development of distillation in Scotland and Ireland took place in parallel, ultimately leading to two distinct global industries.Details of screenings of The Amber Light can be found at: www.amberlightfilm"},{"url":null,"title":"general-election-2019-turnout-won-snp","story":"At that point, with the polls positive

Canvassers reported the Tory vote was holding up and suddenly just two or three gains on top of the  seats won in  became the projection.Strategists discounted taking Jo Swinsonrsquos Dunbartonshire East seat, for instance, reckoning decapitating the LibDems, while enjoyable, was an ask too far.The BBCrsquos exit poll with its prediction of  seats was therefore met with extreme scepticism.The FMrsquos aide sent a one-word text to those asking about it: ldquob****cks.

Now a born-again Leaver, Mr Carlaw represents the equivalent seat at Holyrood.A similar swing to the SNP in  would overturn his ,-vote majority, sending him back to the West of Scotland list. The one possible upside for the Scottish Tories is the election may lead to an injection of new blood at Holyrood, as defeated MPs look to Edinburgh for a new berth, clearing out some of the dead timber.Butthe results were bad for the Tories and their campaign against Indyref, they were truly atrocious for Scottish Labour. Despite its precarious hold on the electoral map ndash four of the seven seats it was defending had majorities below , ndash the party was predicting it wouldnine MPs just hours before the polls closed.It was over-confidence based on positive canvas s. In Glasgow North East, Paul Sweeney publicly predicted he would increase his -vote majority on the back of glowing canvas data.After the massive YouGov poll on Tuesday predicting a Tory landslide, the partyrsquos digital chief Aidan Kerr tweeted: ldquoGlasgow North East is not going to the SNP. Andthe pollsters think this, then God knows what  they have got wrong.Mr Sweeney lost to the SNPrsquos Anne McLaughlin by , votes. It was a profound failure of the party machine that points to deep, systemic problems. The party reckoned it was making a comeback in its old heartlands of Glasgow and North Lanarkshire.But when the results came in, Labour lost vote share in every Glasgow seat and in all its North Lanarkshire targets as well. In fact, Labour lost a bigger slice of its vote share in Scotland than anywhere  in the UK, down . points to a wretched .%, thanks to the loss of , votes.Its sole MP north of the Border is Ian Murray in Edinburgh South, who did not hesitate to blame Mr Corbyn for the partyrsquos desperate decline. Mr Leonard has now lost two elections in a year.Last night he vowed to lead his party into the  election as well. His opponents will be chuffed.The LibDems, despite losing Ms Swinson, were the steadiest party of the night. It gained North East Fe to stay on four MPs, increasing its share of the vote by . points.The upshot of it all is Ms Sturgeon will ramp up demands for Indyref. Mr Johnson called her last night to get his refusal in early. Because whatrsquos in it for him  If he granted a Section  order, despite his ldquoguarantee not do so, it would cause turmoil in his party.He also knows referendums bring down leaders. Ask David Cameron, Theresa May and Alex Salmond. Mr Johnson has no appetite to bring his premiership to an early end by granting and then losing Indyref.Perhaps most compelling for a politician who seems to care for little but himself, defeat would mean going down in the history books as the last Prime Minister of the UK, the man who made himself Minister for the Union then oversaw its break-up. It is not a legacy he would savour."},{"url":null,"title":"general-election-lib-dems-popular-think","story":"The party, which has been criticised as having suffered a spectacular blow at the election, managed to appeal to voters who were not willing to vote for the SNP as they did not want independence.This statistic, according to experts, could provide vital clues on how the party, and others, can campaign their way to success for the Holyrood elections in .It also shows that constitutional issues, rather than inidual personalities or policies, did still play a part in this general election.Dr Malcolm Harvey, of the University of Aberdeen, said: \"The EU question did have some salience in several seats this time around.\"You see that in the rise of the vote share for the Liberal Democrats.

Was that a man thing to do  Are most of the viewers women A panic alarm goes off in my brain. Have I said something hellip sexist  Am I about to embark on some hellip mansplaining  I trust not. Let me explain: Irsquove never considered myself much of a man. Indeed, when folk say to me, as they do pretty much daily, ldquoWhen you are reincarnated, what do you want to come back as , I always say: ldquoI think this time Irsquod like to come back as a man.No, my mission this week is to examine the effect of Outlander on Scottish culture, despite knowing little about the latter and almost nothing about the former.What I do know is I used to ken some females who were in an Outlander fan club, based on the books and before the TV series came out. And a nicer, smarter bunch of lassies you could never hope to meet.Getting more excuses in before I begin my exegesis, I should say also that, occasionally, one detects a feeling that in abjuring items of popular culture one is being aloof. Not so. Irsquove just never had much luck with tellies. The last one broke down, and the current one only gets BT Sport down the internet line. I donrsquot have an aerial for the normal stuff, and the bank wonrsquot give me a mortgage to have one installed.So, all that out of the way, you ask: ldquoWhat prompts you to bring your excellent forensic skills to the television series Outlander  Irsquom glad you asked that. The answer is that the University of Glasgow is to host a major conference on the series next year, with tip-top academics hollering about its history, customs, politics, culture, claes and music.Willy Maley, a professor at the uni, claimed outrageously: ldquoThe globally successfully Outlander series has triggered more interest in Scotland and its history than any other cultural artefact in recent years hellipI said ldquooutrageously purely for dramatic effect, as Prof Willy is indeed correct. The Outlander phenomenon is out of control, sweeping the world and bringing hordes of, er, non-male gender types to this country in the hope of fiddling with the Cairngorms of rugged, kilted men who stravaig hither and yon with their eyes ever fixed on the misty horizon.I always fear they will be disappointed by the grimy weather, grey-harled cooncil hooses, standard-issue troosers and also, well, by the men.The last great screen classic to attract worldwide attention to Wee Scotia was Braveheart, the true story of warriors in woad who fought and died for a devolution settlement based on a federalist structure.Like Outlander, it was said to be romantic, but you couldnrsquot take away the hard facts of the spectacular scenery . All in all, these popular productions are flavoured with peerie soupccedilons of our history and culture, prompting folk to take an interest and perhaps even visit, giving us in the process large sums of money for basically just standinrsquo aboot.As for Outlander itself, which my researchers say involves time travel, pirates and Cherokee Indians, Irsquom afraid its charms will continue to elude me, though I accept that it must be a fine piece of work.Perhaps someone of the female gender or preference could womansplain it to me.First-class selfishnessTHE recent General Election gave rise to discussion of two issues about which I care passionately: letterboxes and house numbers.Although few people were brave enough to deliver leaflets this time, what with the risk of being killed by liberals, those activists that did venture forth complained about dastardly letterboxes with springs and brushes that could take your pinkie off.As a sometime postie, they had my sympathy, and I was intrigued to see solutions proffered such as using spatulas, with other folk arguing for American-style letterboxes ootside the hoose.The discussion widened to the lack of hoose numbers on properties, something that provides a perfect metaphor for the thoughtlessness that dominates society in these discombobulating times.Why wouldnrsquot you want to help your postie or other purveyors of deliverance  As always with the Earthlings, only an appeal to their selfishness might help them mend their ways:you donrsquot have a house number then your Amazon parcels wonrsquot be delivered.It could be even worse. Ambulance drivers joined the debate, saying they often struggled to locate addresses. There:you donrsquot have your house name or number prominently displayed you might die. And itrsquoll serve you right.Water awakeningHOW enterprising to find someone marketing water to add to the water of le. You wonder why no one thought of it before.As everybody knows, yoursquore supposed to add a wee splash of water to your whisky. Itrsquos counter-intuitive and doesnrsquot make sense. Why add common or kitchen tap water to something thatrsquos been nurtured and matured for years But itrsquos true: it works. I already knew this when I was with a colleague relaxing in a whisky loversrsquo bar after a job. My mate rejected the water, whereupon mine host said he was a loon and to prove it, got out a wee, nose-wide glass into which he poured a dram. He got us each to snf it. Then he added a tiny drop of water and ndash wow! ndash an aromatic explosion followed. Tasted better tae.The makers of Larkfire water say it comes from Lewisian gneiss rock which is ldquometamorphic. Thatrsquos the word I was looking for.

He loves snow too. He likes the isolation of being in the mountains and doing his own thing so when we go walking, I just let him go off ahead.\"He loves pampering, he knows basically hes a bit of a celebrity so when he meets people now he almost expects to get a wee treat or something.

Jacob Rees-Mogg, almost omnipresent in the previous weeks, is banished to the outer dark after he says that the Grenfell Tower victims \"lacked common sense\" by staying in the burning building and he jolly well wouldnt haveit was him.

National identity gives them that.But the problem with nationalism is that tends to be exclusive. Scotland and England are expressing identity in dferent and contradictory ways ndash the former in a spirit of pro-European internationalism the latter in a more inward-looking, nativist anti-Europeanism. These are irreconcilable opposites.Nicola Sturgeon has often said that she would like to drop the word ldquonational from the SNPrsquos name. She clearly feels uncomfortable with the politics of nationalism, despite having been an SNP supporter all her le. And she has good reason to be wary, given the behaviour of some European nationalist parties.Her task now will be to contain the fervour of her triumphant party and constructively channel their hatred of English conservatism. It wonrsquot be easy. Boris Johnson has provoked the Scots by ruling out any referendum for at least five years. Scotland is about to be dragged kicking and screaming out of Europe.Sturgeon is a cautious politician, unlike her predecessor Alex Salmond, and will not tolerate civil disobedience or unconstitutional behaviour.But like it or not, she has a fight on her hands. A national reckoning is coming."},{"url":null,"title":"david-pratt-uk-election-others-saw","story":"It has ranged from the casually curious to the colourful and concerned. Irsquom speaking of global reaction to the news of Boris Johnsonrsquos election win these past few days.As the world woke up to a new political landscape across the UK, international press and political responses have proved a telling barometer as to how others see Britainrsquos place in the world and where it might be heading.There were, as might be expected, the usual polite formal messages and notes of congratulation from world leaders to the UKrsquos newly elected prime minister.From German Chancellor Angela Merkel to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu among others, the usual expressions of ldquocloser ties and ldquopartnerships were readily forthcoming.But lurking behind these diplomatic courtesies and protocols lie other more signicant clues telling of everything from eager anticipation do downright apprehension. Then there were those of course who simply called it as they saw it.ldquoDespite a dizzying pile of lies, gaffes, insults to blacks, gays, Muslims, workers scattered in his old articles, Boris Johnson has again sprung up, observed one Italian journalist in the countryrsquos daily La Repubblica, under a front page headline \"Europa bye-bye\".As European reactions went, such a negative take was far from unique. Europe after all had a particular interest in the outcome of this election in which the Brexit issue hung like some political Sword of Damocles over the whole affair.Harking back to the story of a pre-War UK newspaper headline that is said to have stated, \"Fog In Channel: Continent Cut Off\", the Swedish daily Dagens Nyheter observed that the outcome of the UK election has once again led to fog descending on the Channel, given the still uncertain implications of the next steps in the Brexit process.While acknowledging Johnsonrsquos win and the apparent breakthrough in the Brexit log jam likely to come with it, many global newspapers and politicians were equally quick to recognise that the saga of Britainrsquos place and relationship with its European neighbours is far from over.ldquoItrsquos no secret that personally I wanted the UK to #remain in the #EU, wrote Norbert Rottgen, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the German parliament and a member of the Christian Democratic Union party.ldquoBut the British people have decided  we have to accept their choice: With Johnsonrsquos victory #Brexit has become inevitable. Our goal now has to be to keep relations with the UK as close as possible, Rottgen added in his tweet.Others were less convinced that Johnsonrsquos win would mean business could be conducted as expected. The Spanish daily El Mundo was at pains to point out that the election result ldquowill not decrease the tensions triggered by former Prime Minister David Cameron.ldquoInstead, it has opened new ides between generations, between cities and rural areas, between nationalists and globalists, between pro-Europeans and populists, between people showing solidarity and xenophobic groups, the paper insisted.El Mundo went on to say that despite the absolute majority he has achieved, Johnson would never win a popularity contest in the United Kingdom.ldquoHis success can be attributed ndash beyond those who truly support him ndash to his blunt message: Get Brexit Done ... Only [Jeremy] Corbyn could lose a popularity contest against Boris Johnson, the daily went on.Some Spanish newspapers focused on other issues they saw as vital emerging from the election result, with El Pais concluding that, ldquothe UK is heading for a constitutional clash in Scotland, where the crushing victory of the SNP, which won  of  seats in the region, will further propel the surge for independence.Elsewhere, in its assessment of the election result, El Pais added: ldquoThe nationalist awakening is understandable, because Scotland is opposed to Brexit, and most of its citizens feel that the south is forcing them to abandon the EU against their will.Scotland and the question of another independence referendum not surprisingly resonates among many within Spainrsquos political and press community given the countryrsquos current preoccupation with the Catalonia secessionist issue.This was evidently the case with Spanish lawyer and journalist Joaquim Torra i Pla, known as Quim Torra, who is also a member of the parliament of Catalonia and current president of the Catalan Regional Government.He took the opportunity in the wake of the UK election result to congratulate the Scottish National Partyleader Nicola Sturgeon after she said the Scottish government must be allowed to hold another independence referendum.ldquoCongratulations to the friends of @theSNP and First Minister @NicolaSturgeon for this magnicent result that demonstrates the democratic will for independence and the European commitment of the Scottish people, Torra tweeted.Elsewhere in the Spanish-speaking world the Scottish dimension of the UK election also preoccupied many observers.In far-off Argentina, a country that has just elected a left-wing government under President Alberto Fernandez with support amongst younger voters, the left-wing newspaper Pagina  described Scotland as a ldquocomplex problem for Boris Johnson and drew parallels with the Catalan secessionist issue.ldquoThe problem he has is that the Tories lost seven of the  seats they held in Scotland. The United Kingdom is split in two: nationalist in Scotland, conservative in England. Given that scenario, there is a constitutional crisis ahead, an editorial observed, adding that, ldquoapart from the obvious dferences, the spectre of Catalujnya hovers over this struggle.If the Spanish-speaking world seemed concerned with the Scottish independence issue the French media, who have been following the UK election campaign closely, didnrsquot take long to draw its own conclusions.Indeed as early as last month a front-page headline in the popular tabloid Le Parisien read: ldquoBoris Johnson: the liar weakening Europe.Pulling no punches, the paper called the UK prime minister ldquoEuropersquos bogeyman, a politician for whom ldquopretty much everything is either an empty promise, economical with the truth or a downright lie.Likewise Francersquos Le Monde shared a contempt for Johnsonrsquos election slogan while conceding that it had politically paid off for the Tory leader.ldquoWe like it or we hate it, with its  look, its contempt for details and especially for its slogan lsquoGet Brexit donersquo ndash simplistic and repeated ad nauseam throughout the campaign of the UK general election. For all that, Boris Johnson has masterfully managed his bet, concluded the French daily known for its opinion and analysis pieces.Not everyone of course takes such a negative view of Johnsonrsquos victory. Some Conservative and nationalist leaders in parts of Europe are keen to court the UK prime minister as they see Brexit looming.In Hungary, the right-wing populist Fidesz party of the prime minister, Viktor Orban, was notably quick to congratulate Johnson, with Katalin Novak, the minister for the family, youth and international affairs, tweeting: ldquoConservatives have to become stronger in Europe.Some might argue that Hungaryrsquos brand of conservatism is the last thing the UK needs right now, given that Orban has all but dismantled democracy and virtually turned the country into a one-party state again.Elsewhere in Central and Eastern Europe there was similarmore muted recognition of Johnsonrsquos win with Polandrsquos Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki acknowledging what he saw as a ldquofundamental change in the UKrsquos electorate.Meanwhile, as befitting the opaqueness that often characterises the Kremlinrsquos diplomatic response these days, spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia was not sure whether the Tory win would bring ldquogood relations with Russia, which have been strained in recent years. ldquoI donrsquot know to what extent such expectations are appropriate, said the Kremlin spokesman.By and large ndash apart from a ringing endorsement of Johnson and Brexit by Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the head of the Russian nationalist LDPR party ndash the UK election doesnrsquot appear to have been much on the mind of those in Moscow lately, who have pressing political challenges of their own to contend with right now.Peskovrsquos remarks, however, highlight another crucial question the election result has thrown up regarding the international stage, the future of UK foreign policy.As Thomas Raines, Head of the Europe Programme at Chatham House, pointed out last week, ldquoforeign policy may not matter that much to most voters, but these elections matter for foreign policy.On the website of the Royal Institute of International Affairs, he highlighted how the election result will be very influential in shaping Britainrsquos position on the world stage and its approach to international issues. Writing just before the election, Raines contrasted the Labour and Conservative approaches on foreign policy.ldquoOn the one hand, Labour wants to reset and re-orientate Britainrsquos international role based on human rights and international law. It promises a new internationalism and to end what it glibly calls the bomb first, talk later approach, alongside a human rights-driven trade policy, he outlined.By contrast the Conservative manesto, Raines says, ldquoasserts their pride in Britainrsquos historical role in the world, followed by a broad set of largely rhetorical commitments to bolster alliances and expand influence.He points also to an ambitious free trade agenda with the Tories in power and a more economic and commercially driven foreign policy. And therein of course lies the question of relations with the United States, where the administration of president Donald Trump was predictably quick to react positively to Johnsonrsquos victory.ldquoBritain and the United States will now be free to strike a massive new Trade Deal after BREXIT, Trump characteristically tweeted in the early hours of Friday morning.ldquoThis deal has the potential to be far bigger and more lucrative than any deal that could be made with the EU. Celebrate Boris! wrote the US President.Some American commentators agreed, seeing Johnsonrsquos election win as an opportunity for the US and UK to move closer economically. Moreover, according to Newsweek magazine, the result in Britain may also lt Trumps spirit ahead of the  election after Johnsonrsquos ldquounashamedly populistic campaign.That said, many of these same commentators from across the pond recognised too that a strong Conservative majority paradoxically increases the chances of a softer Brexit, which could mean Westminster choosing Brussels over Washington despite Trumps overtures to Johnson.Letrsquos not forget that leaked UK government document produced by the Labour Party during the election campaign that detailed the talks between British and American trade negotiators on reaching a post-Brexit deal.If the details in that document are correct, the US trade representative made clear thatthe UK committed to the EU customs union and single market then a US-UK free trade agreement would be ldquoa non-starter.For now it remains to been seen just what shape relations between the White House and Downing Street will take. It goes without saying, of course, that both Trump and Johnson have much in common, as it seems does their relationship with sections of their respective electorates.Perhaps no overseas commentator summed this up better in the wake of the election than the renowned New York Times columnist and former foreign editor, Roger Cohen.ldquoIn the depressed provinces of institutionalised precariousness, workers embraced an old Etonian mouthing about unleashed British potential. Not a million miles from blue-collar heartland Democrats migrating to Trump the millionaire and America First demagogy, wrote Cohen on FridayldquoThatrsquos the story of Brexit, a national tragedy. Thatrsquos the story of Johnson, the man of no convictions. Thatrsquos the story of Trump, who makes puppets of people through manipulation of outrage and disregard for truth, continued Cohen.ldquoThatrsquos the story of our times. Johnson gets and fits those times better than most. Hersquos a natural.Hersquos right of course, and such astute observations are proof yet again that sometimes it really is invaluable to see ourselves as others see us."},{"url":null,"title":"house-commons-look-proportional-representation","story":"New research by the Electoral Reform Society reveals thatthe UK had used the type of voting system used for the European Parliament elections, there would have been a hung parliament ndash with a possibility Labour could have formed a government with the support of others.Campaigners are continuing to push for voting changes saying that proportional representation is a far more democratic method of electing a government, and helps avoid concerns which surfaced during the long-running Brexit debates that Parliament does not represent the people.Boris Johnson when he moved back to No.  announced he was fronting a \"Peoples Parliament\".:Johnson canrsquot lsquobludgeonrsquo Scotland into his world viewBut the new research reveals that under the dHondt list PR system, the Tories, rather than sweeping to power with a landslide  seats, would be the biggest party with , but that would have been  short of the numbers need to form a majority government.And the SNP would lose out with % of the UK vote, with their seats cut from  to .Critics of the current First Past The Postmethod of electing MPs, say that the latest election continues to underline how it produces \"unrepresentative\" government.In a hung parliament, the incumbent PM stays in office ndash and lives in Downing Street ndash until it is decided who will attempt to form a new government.The Cabinet Manual says that an incumbent government ldquois expected to resignit becomes clear that it is unlikely to be able to command that confidence [of the House of Commons] and there is a clear alternative.That could have allowed Labour to argue that Mr Johnson should quit before a certain datethere is clearly an ldquoanti-Tory majority in the Commons that would inevitably reject his Queenrsquos Speech.Jeremy Corbyn would then have been first in line to have the chance to form a government which would put its Queenrsquos Speech to the Commons to seehe could win the support of a majority of MPs.:Analysis: why Labour lost the electionUnder proportional representation, the Labour Party would have won  seats,  more than our current First Past The Post systemAnd the Liberal Democrats would gain.

Unlike FPTP it cuts out \"wasted\" votes, meaning people were more likely to feel they could support any party at the ballot box and not just those parties who have a chance of winning in a particular seat.The ERS have launched an online petition in support of bringing in a proportional representation system of voting."},{"url":null,"title":"analysis-labour-lost-election","story":"The scattergun of Labourrsquos election policies, while generally approved ofdoubted on their fiscal provenance, proved ineffectual against the stark and simple Tory message of ldquoGet Brexit Done.Labour, it seemed, had learned nothing and forgotten everything. But it was the preication and the switching of positions on Brexit to try to suit all which did it.In June , immediately after the vote to leave the EU, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn had pledged: ldquoWe must respect that result and Article  has to be invoked now so that we negotiate an exit from the EU.But then the party swithered and dithered for the best part of three years before coming out with a hopeless, morphed fudge that a Labour government would renegotiate with the EU and put that to the British people.In , in Bill Clintonrsquos successful US presidential campaign, the Democratic strategist James Carville coined the slogan for party workers to keep them focused on the main message: ldquoThe economy, stupid.This is a lesson Labour ignored, while for the Tories their main strategist Isaac Levido came up with the winning one, ldquoGet Brexit done. The -year-old Australian was serenaded by Tory party workers as the TV exit poll predicted a landslide, singing, in a rip-off of Corbynrsquos chorus, ldquoOh Isaac Levido.If we believe the final polls ndash and this time, unlike in , they were accurate ndash then % of Leave voters voted Conservative, a nine-point increase on the previous election, while for Labour there was no good news on either Remain or Leave voters ndash the former were at % support, down five points, and at just %, some nine points down, among Leave voters.This was reflected in Thursdayrsquos vote. The Tory share of the vote rose by six points in seats where more than % had voted Leave, whereas Labourrsquos fell by  points in the most pro-Leave seats.Labourrsquos result, with  seats, is their worst in the post-war period, and somewhat redeems Michael Footrsquos  debacle ndash the manesto then called the so-called longest suicide note in history ndash of  seats. In , the Economist wrote that to find a typical Labour seat one had to look at impoverished inner cites and broken-down towns, but it is just those places, still largely in the same state of disrepair, which have flocked to the Tories in this one. Today that typical Labour bastion would be fervently pro-European, highly-educated mainly in the prosperous south of England in a university town or city.The working class,there still is such a group, has deserted Labour for the Tories in England and the SNP in Scotland. This meltdown has been decades in the cooking. Labour grew from social institutions, most of them centred around the workplace. However, the traditional heavy industries have gone ndash shipbuilding, mining, steel ndash and with them Labourism, the shop stewards, the unions, local organisations. Just about every institution which fostered working-class solidarity has been bulldozed like the Red Wall. In its place have come zero-hours contracts, austerity, child poverty, factories replaced by call centres, fancy memorials put up over holes in the ground where men used to go to work.There was meant to be a transformation of the old into a new, skills-based economy ndash thatrsquos what Labourrsquos Tony Blair government promised. Tell that to the voters of Blyth Valley, which has been Labour since the seat was created in , and was the first shock Tory victory of .Corbyn became the accidental Labour leader ndash he only got on the parliamentary party vote because several of his colleagues lent their votes, not wanting to see him humiliated in the ballot. It was the membership which supported him overwhelmingly, not once but twice.It became a blatant coup attempt, triggered by the sacking of shadow foreign secretary Hilary Benn who told Corbyn that he had lost confidence in his leadership. This triggered a mass exodus from the shadow cabinet but, unlike Boris Johnsonrsquos dealing with rebels, the whip was not withdrawn from them and they continued to seethe and plot against him.But the one issue to dog Corbyn was the accusation of institutional anti-Semitism in the party. Margaret Hodge went further and accused him of being a racist and anti-Semite, which baffled anyone who knew him or had followed his parliamentary career.An inquiry set up by Corbyn and chaired by Shami Chakrabarti concluded that the party was not overrun by racists, but the report was widely criticised for its softly-softly approach and the issue continued to run right through to the election, with the Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis resuscitating it almost on the eve of poll.The right-wing press also carried out a relentless vilication of Corbyn, from anti-Semitism to accusing him of having terrorist sympathies and being a security threat, to being an anti-royalist and republican because he said he watched the Queenrsquos Christmas message in the morning, when it is actually in the afternoon. Corbynrsquos predecessor, Ed Miliband, had been mocked over his eating of a bacon sandwich, his brother David, and rival for the party leadership, had been pilloried for the way he held a banana, but the war on Corbyn was relentless and unprecedented.One of the lessons Labour should have learned, apart from the right way to grasp fruit, the most prescient one, was to look beyond the Red Wall and Hadrianrsquos Wall to Scotland, and how the formerly hegemonic party had collapsed in the country.Arrogance in power, failing to respond to the needs of its base communities, had provoked the backlash, and a switch not to the Tories, but to the Scottish National Party and around independence rather than Brexit.Labourrsquos shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, conceded that in some of the partyrsquos banker seats, ldquoa long history of maybe  years of neglect had seen them fall. In , the SNP held two seats in Scotland. Now they have , the majority, overwhelmingly, in what were once considered safe Labour seats.The revival may have started in the Highlands but it spread quickly to the central belt and urban areas, to the poor and deprived who were once Labourrsquos backbone.Now, just one MP remains, Ian Murray in Edinburgh South, a relatively prosperous constituency. Murray has been an outspoken opponent of Corbyn and described his leader as ldquotoxic on the doorsteps, a view that was widely held in the seats in England the party lost.This was, like it or not, a vote about nationalism. In Northern Ireland there was a nationalist majority, as there was in Scotland, and in England ndash despite the overall vote apparently splitting % to % for Remain parties ndash in the ones that counted, the marginals, the former Red Wall, it was overwhelmingly the case.Labourrsquos failure was to ignore the evidence on the ground, to confront English nationalism, and by attempting to appease its parliamentary Remainers, betraying the verdict of the electorate and its core support.Corbynrsquos failures were manold. He may have been unfairly pilloried but he lacked clear and decisive leadership, epitomised by saying he would remain neutral in a forthcoming ballot on Brexit, leaving the rest of the country to mock him over what wasnrsquot just unlikely, but a vanished possibility."},{"url":null,"title":"tories-must-drop-indyref-obsession-2021-elections","story":"That was the advice from a senior Scots academic, who said that the Conservatives campaign in Scotland focused on blocking a second independence referendum while failing to appeal to other voters on any other meaningful issues.Others have predicted a \"bleak\" outcome for both Labour and the LibDems unless they take \"drastic\" action to change their appearance and appeal to the electorate.Following the chaos of the latest General Election, political parties will already be analysing how the results can help inform their campaign going into the Holyrood poll in  months time, with lessons to be learned on all sides.Experts say that while Labour debates how to reinvigorate their support, the LibDems work out where they went wrong and the SNP decide how to push through a second referendum or hide any governmental failings, the Tories must rethink their campaign entirely.Dr Malcolm Harvey a lecturer in Politics and International Relations at the University of Aberdeen, said: \"The Conservatives massively played the lsquono to indyrefrsquo card in Scotland.\"Im based in Aberdeenshire, and largely in the north-east of Scotland independence was a big issue. They held most of their seats up here.\"You would drive past fields with big signs showing the Tory candidate, with no to Indyref.

By the time  comes around the SNP will have been in government for  years, and they donrsquot have a good record of government, largely speaking, in this time but none of the other parties really look like an alternative government.\"Labour got an absolute shellacking in the General Election this time, the Conservatives at Holyrood ... If you had their Westminster MPs, they would look more like a potential government than some of the ones who are now in Holyrood right now. Can they now move up to that level \"If the SNP can get to  seats, I think that would put more pressure on the constitutional question. All Boris Johnson has to say is lsquoNo, yoursquore not having a referendumrsquo.\"Some people from the SNP are talking about legal options but I donrsquot know what those legal options are. It is quite clear that the constitution is a reserved issue, and is at the behest of the UK Government.\"We had a referendum in  because of an agreement, because David Cameron was pretty sure he would win. There is no guarantee this time, and it would seem like a huge risk to take.\"Harvey said that during the first few terms of the Scottish Parliament, constituencies tended to vote the same way in the Holyrood and Westminster elections, but when the SNP won a majority in , everything changed.He said: \"The thing they traded on between  and  was lsquolook at our record in governmentrsquo and they got a majority in  on the back of that. They canrsquot do that now because their record in government doesnrsquot stack up all that well.\"If you fast forward to , when the SNP won  of  seats in Westminster, that has its routes in  but also a direct result of the independence referendum.\"In some ways this election now is even more impressive. Yes, the SNP did not get as many seats and they are  per cent down on the share of their votes than , but its more impressive because they have been in government for longer.\"They have a record to defend and a record,yoursquore being honest about it, that doesnrsquot look particularly good.\"Research has suggested that in Scotland, the Scottish government tend to get the credit for something good happening irrespective of whether the Scottish parliament had the npower over it or not. If it was something good Westminster had done, the Scottish government got the credit. If there was blamed to be assigned, eventhe Scottish parliament had the power over this, Westminster still got the blame for it. That has largely held through  years of devolution.\"The SNP massively benefit from that because it plays in to their sort of grievance politics. That is part of their selling point, that Westminster is the bogey man, Scotland is disadvantaged, lsquoWe are trying to do all these good things and they are holding us backrsquo.\"Rob Johns, politics professor at the University of Essex, said the Scottish parliament elections have apparently fallen in line with the UK elections in terms of becoming a two-party race, exaggerated by the support for and against independence.He explained: \"The really interesting feature for Scottish politics is the two party-fication of it.\"For the longest period there were three,not fouryou count the LibDems, signicant players, we would always put four parties on the graph.\"But increasingly it looks asthere is a move towards a standard two-party system, a bit like in England, but the SNP is now the Labour party, but a much more successful version of it.\"Johns added that the proportional representation in Scotland, compared with the first-past-the-post system in the UK elections, has not played a role in lessening the move towards a two-party contest.He said: \"Somebody could say in the Scottish elections it will be dferent due to proportional representation, there isnrsquot a pressure for tactical voting. It seems to me that this two-party tendency we have now is psychological, itrsquos not just tactical or to do with the electoral system.\"People are just becoming polarised on the independence issue, obviously, and I think it is going to be a bleak night in May  for both Labour and the LibDems unless they can do something pretty drastic.

However, forecasts will be reviewed daily over the next few days as we approach polling day.The council’s Roads and Landscape Services manager Derek Murray said: “Should we be in a period of severe weather on the day of the election one of key tasks for the Roads, Landscape and Waste Service will be to ensure that the electorate can access all the polling stations on roads that are as safe as reasonably possible throughout polling day.“The service has placed additional resources on stand-by on December - to ensure that the maximum available staff, plant and equipment can respond where necessary.”The location of each polling station has been carefully considered and road and footway treatments routes in the vicinity have been adjusted to suit as necessary.Car parks at or near polling stations will also be treated where possible and bagged salt has been provided to every polling station for use around access doors and paths.The council’s list of farmers and contractors are also being contacted so that the council is in the best possible position to respond to severe weather.Meanwhile, normal operating hours for the council’s gritting crews between .am and pm may be extended to ensure polling stations can be accessed safely between am and pm and in order that ballot boxes can be safely delivered to the count in Aberdeen after the polls close.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"If you have fancied trying indoor rock climbing why not Gie it a Go \"  \"Gie it a Go\" this Christmas viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"finish line for ultramarathon man","story":"An Insch man has completed his epic #Running Home # adventure of running  ultramarathons throughout this year.Dr Mark Calder has covered , miles, tracing pilgrim routes across Scotland and Northern England.His tremendous effort is to raise money for a project run by Embrace the Middle East, which supports refugees tohome and rebuild their lives in war-torn Iraq.

It means less energy and less space is needed to treat a higher quantity of waste water, reducing the operating costs of the site. It also removes the need to chemically treat the effluent, increasing the protection of the rivers Don and Urie, and provides the capacity to support the local community as it continues to grow and flourish. The project was delivered by Scottish Water alliance partner ESD and included building new sewer pipework, improving the resilience of the site to flooding and upgrading existing equipment. Ms Gougeon said: “While treating waste water isn’t something people probably like to think about too often, it is something that is absolutely vital to protect not only our health and sanitation, but also the environment. “Developing new, more efficient ways of treating waste water through the deployment of new technology, is hugely important as Scotland takes decisive steps towards tackling the climate emergency we are facing around the world.” Chief Executive of Scottish Water Douglas Millican said: “We are always looking for ways to innovate and protect the environment both locally and globally, so it is very exciting to see this new state-of-the-art treatment works officially opened here in Inverurie – the first of its kind in Scotland. “Not only does it mean we can continue to treat waste water effectively and protect the environment for years to come, it also underlines our commitment to pursue new ways to lower our energy requirements, towards reaching our ambitious goal of achieving net zero emissions by .” Most construction work on site was completed in the Spring and the new treatment process has since been closely monitored during commissioning and beyond.While most of the work took place within the established Scottish Water site, installation of new pipework beneath the railway line involved a closure to Keithhall Road which was completed ahead of schedule in April .data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"A group of Logie Durno Primary School pupils taking part in the Wee Sleep Out\"  Wee Sleep Out at Logie Durno School viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"ESD Chief Operating Officer Wendy Cooper said: “We are very proud of what has been achieved at Inverurie, successfully delivering a cutting edge new wastewater treatment technology in Scotland for the first time. “Success in this project has involved close collaboration between Scottish Water, ESD, Royal HaskoningDHV and our wider supply chain.

Indeed, Ministers have stopped even referring to the deadline,” Mr McArthur said.“It is all the more important, therefore, that priority is given to connecting those communities who have been waiting longest for any sort of service. Good quality, affordable broadband is increasingly critical in accessing services, allowing businesses to compete and enable people to go about their daily lives.#The Orkney MSP added: #Mr Matheson seems happy that Orkney continues to languish signicantly behind the level of coverage achieved nationally. As an MSP representing a central belt constituency, perhaps Mr Matheson believes this is just the ‘price you pay’ for living in an island or rural area.“Whatever the reason, it is unacceptable, the Scottish Government needs to re-commit to prioritising future broadband investment in Orkney and other communities who continue to lag behind when it comes to coverage.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

They may have argued that, actually,you looked at it a certain way, Labour#s defeat in the  general election was a victory but, this time around, they concede that Jeremy Corbyn#s party lost.How could they spin otherwise  Labour was not just beaten by the Conservativeson Thursday, it was thrashed, it was humiliated. The party may take years to recover,recover it can.This evisceration at the hands of the voting public was not, say Corbynistas, the fault of the leader. Of course it wasn’t. Rather he was the victim of, iously, a hostile media, the issue of Brexit, and the Labour moderateswho refused to recognise his brilliance.But no number of pitul excuses can explain away the devastating truth that the vast majority of voters looked at Corbyn and thought the idea of him being prime minister was, at best, laughable and at worst horrying.Friday saw Corbyn cultists – shadow cabinet members and activists masquerading as journalists – doing the rounds of TV and radio studios to explain why the leader was blameless. It was an older Labour hand, however, who got to the nub of the party’s problem during a television appearance a few hours after polls closed.Former home secretary Alan Johnson was on ITV’s all night election show when he let rip at Jon Lansman, founder of the pro-Corbyn activist group Momentum.Corbyn was a disaster on the doorsteps, said Johnson, and everybody knew he couldn’t lead the working class out of a wet paper bag.Lansman sat silently throughout Johnson’s magisterial denunciation of the Corbyn cult. It was time for Momentum – “this party within a party” – to get out of Labour. Lansman and his fellow travellers should go back to their student politics, to their little left wing. People like Lansman and his pals, seethed Johnson , would never admit as much but they had messed up completely and others were going to pay the price.By the time Johnson finished, Lansman had – at least – the good grace to look utterly broken.This moment perfectly encapsulated the problem at the heart of the Labour Party.Labour’s raison d’être is the protection and furthering of the interests of the worker yet it is now controlled by men and women who have no idea about the reality of working-class existence.Corbyn, Lansman, the party’s communications director Seumas Milne, and any number of the party outriders who peddle newspaper columns about revolution are the privately educated sons and daughters of privilege. They have a distorted – and deeply condescending view – of the working class as perpetual victims, like characters from a Ken Loach movie.The actual working class – aspirational, often more socially conservative that Corbynista cultists would find comfortable – doesn’t live in the world of the Momentum imagination.It is, of course, true that there exists an underclass of people, left behind and struggling to survive. Government policies of recent years have their victims and those people need defenders, they need a politics that works for them, offering not just hope but tangible solutions. But for such a politics to succeed, it must be part of a broader strategy, something inclusive that takes into account the needs not just of the family struggling on benefits but of those whose, perfectly reasonable, wish is to have a second car in the driveway of their new-build semi.The Corbynista, with his romantic notions of the noble poor, sees politics as a war against a brutal elite rather than as a process by which the worker might advance.Jeremy Corbyn should have apologised and stepped down immediately when Labour’s defeat was confirmed in the early hours of Friday morning. Instead, he merely said that he would not lead his party into another election. There would, Corbyn added, be a period of reflection, led by him.This, you might think, doesn’t amount to much of a recognition of Labour’s defeat. But, then, the far left sect that now controls the party doesn’t concern itself with such trling matters as the winning and losing of elections. For Corbyn and his cultists, the victory that matters has already been achieved. They have stamped their authority on the Labour Party and that will do nicely.If the voting public cannot see the merits of a Corbyn government, then they and not the party are at fault. The response to defeat in an election must be the continuation of the programme. Eventually, the people will see sense.There has been a furious reaction from Labour moderates to the Corbyn fiasco, with sensible people calling for him to go and to take with him the sectarian ideologues who have all but destroyed Labour as a serious party, leaving it a safe place for crank conspiracists and anti-semites. Those who imagine Labour might easily be dragged back to the centre ground are kidding themselves. The party machine is controlled by Corbynistas – the aforementioned Jon Lansman, for example, is a member of the powerful National Executive Committee – while the membership remains loyal to the leader who has let them down so badly.Corbyn-supporting MSPs now maintain the line that Labour was defeated by Brexit, asthis somehow exonerates Corbyn. But evenit is so that Brexit was the key, defining issue of this election, we are surely entitled to judge Corbyn over his handling of it. Politicians don’t, I’m afraid, get a bye when it comes to tricky issues.Corbyn will go, sooner or later, but his departure won’t end Labour’s problems. His legacy is a party controlled by middle-class fantasists and cranks whose commitment to a revolution on behalf of a working class that rejects their politics is absolute.Plans for the socialist uprising will continue in the dining kitchens of townhouse conversions from Hyndland to Hampstead.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"general election why snp and tories should seek a compromise leader comment","story":"The Conservatives and SNP seem set for a fight over Scottish independence that would be in no one#s interest # including their own.It’s not often a general election produces two big ‘winners’ – that’s not really supposed to happen.But this general election saw Boris Johnson lead the Conservatives to their biggest win since  in the heady days of Margaret Thatcher. Meanwhile in Scotland, the SNP’s result was arguably even more remarkable with the party securing  out of  seats. Not quite , but still that means  per cent of Scotland’s MPs are Nationalists.However, their result was achieved on the basis of  per cent of the vote in Scotland and the Tories won . across the UK, so both these ‘majorities’ are actually based on ‘minorities’ and a product of the first-past-the-post system.Amid their understandably triumphant celebrations, Johnson and Nicola Sturgeon now appear to be on a political collision course over a second independence referendum, a bitter and isive constitutional clash of epic proportions.: Jackson Carlaw promises Scottish unionists: We can still stop indyref: Nicola Sturgeon: Indyref is ‘democratic right of the Scottish people’However, they could attempt to take a dferent course, one of humility and respect for the dferent viewpoints of these two political tribes.As he ed to  Downing Street, Boris Johnson said the UK “deserves a break from wrangling, a break from politics”, adding: “I urge everyone to find closure and to let the healing begin.”And he is right about the need for healing. The UK is still ided along Leave Remain lines while, for all Johnson and fellow unionists might wish it to be so, the large number of people who support Scottish independence are unlikely to simply give up. And there are other signicant ides in the UK – between left and right, with newly enthused activists on both sides of the spectrum young and old urban and rural areas north and south – that are problems for our society.Rule by London diktatThe key questions are whether Johnson is serious about trying to heal the country or whether this is rhetoric in preparation for the looming fight with the SNP andSturgeon actually has an interest in joining in such a process, rather than stoking ision as part of efforts to secure independence.ButScotland does ever leave the UK, it is most assuredly in its interests to maintain good relations with its nearest and dearest neighbour, just as it is in the UK’s interests to maintain good relations with the EU. Indeed, this would almost certainly be vital to making a success of an independent Scotland. So it would be a mistake for the SNP to dismiss Johnson’s victory and his pledge to stop a second referendum. Political promises should be hard to break, particularly for a Prime Minister with a reputation for being, perhaps, too ‘economical with the actualité’.And, likewise, it would be a mistake for Johnson to add to the sense of nationalist grievance by acting in a high-handed way that could be portrayed as rule by London diktat.They may not like it, in fact, they may absolutely hate it, but they might be better advised to seek some form of compromise, to find an acceptable middle ground.Quite what that would be is hard to say. But it could be more powers for Scotland or perhaps an agreement to allow a second indyrefthe SNP wins the next Holyrood election. Some commentators believe it would be politically untenable to deny a second voteSturgeon wins in that is the case, it might make more sense for Johnson to allow it and focus on ensuring an SNP defeat, rather than rail against it, only to later concede.Smart politics is not always about being tough. There are powerful forces that could easily push them into an increasingly bitter conflict but, surely, in the long run, that would be in no one’s interest.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"gary rhodes a pioneer who inspired so many young cooks tributes pour in for tv chef","story":"Described as a pioneer who \"inpsired many young cooks\" and the man who \"almost single handedly put British food on the world stage\", Rhodes was one of the best known ambassadors for British cuisine and inspired a generation of Brits to enjoy cooking. window.twttr The top chef, who received five Michelin stars during his career, he is best known for his work on MasterChef, Ready Steady Cook and Hells Kitchen.

She followed Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn#s position, stating she would like to see a new Brexit deal negotiated with the EU and put to the British people in a referendum, with no Brexit the other option.Jenner Fairbairn, the Conservative candidate, said her priority was to #uphold democracy# and to see Brexit through #as soon as possible#.The SNP#s Robert Leslie said that Orkney and Shetland had not voted for Brexit yet #we could suffer most# from the country leaving the EU. He added he would like to remain in the EU and help reform it from within as part of an independent Scotland.The Brexit Party#s Robert Smith did not attend, but his stance of a #clean-break Brexit# with a free trade deal with the EU was announced to the room.Unsurprisingly, Brexit proved the hottest topic of the evening with several questions based around that subject.Ms Fairbairn, the Conservative candidate, surprised most in attendance by repeatedly going against party policy # firstly by saying she supported the actions of Gina Miller, who took the Conservative government to court over Brexit, because she was #upholding democracy# and secondly by saying that the government#s #settled status# scheme for EU citizens needed a #total overhaul#.So it would seem the only candidate willing to represent the more than nine and a half thousand brexit voters in Orkney and Shetland is working fisherman Robert Smith of the Brexit party. It would seem Boris promise that all tories elected in this election would back his brexit plan was a bit of the mark. Or maybe it shows that his brexit plan is not brexit at alltheir candidate For the isles is willing to back it.Good to see that the Brexit Party is not drawn into this level of debate. I am sure Robert Smith was absent because he was busy getting Brexit Done. Too right that a clean-break Brexit is what we need. Like was said before, a free trade deal will be the #easiest in human history#. Wise words from Liam Fox, and still yet to be disproved by the #facts#.Robert Leslie, SNP, is obviously unaware ofthe impact of independence. The EU has stated repeatedly that , wewill be automatically out of the EU on Independence Day # with #No Deal#.#When part of the territory of a Member State ceases to be a part of that State, e.g. because that territory becomes an independent state, the treaties will no longer apply #Westminster will no longer fund our #notional budget deficit#. It will become real. Nicola Sturgeon#s Scottish Growth Commission proposed a multi-year plan to reduce it to EU-acceptable levels. We must also have our own, independent central bank and therefore, our own currency. That will take nine yearsand will require tens of billions in foreign reserves.If Britain #remains# there would be a #hard UK border# with EU tarfs . Negotiations will be with Brussels, not Westminster.It will take at least  years, with austerity,to rejoin.And  when we do we shall join the euro and pass control of our economy trade and fishing agriculture to the EU.SNP EU Brexit policy is nonsense.

It will even take place within the SNP itself, once the phoney pre-independence “party of national unity” approach falls apart.During these debates, the left will highlight support for Corbyn’s radical policies as evidence that these are still relevant and can still win votes.Meanwhile, the right will highlight the lack of support for Labour as evidence that strong unions and public ownership are no longer winning policies and should be abandoned forever.If you can’t use your vote to get your candidate elected tomorrow, at lease use it to make a statement.The ideas behind Labour’s bold policies need to be kept alive.They will be as relevant in an independent Scotland as they will anywhere .Absolutely.Absolutely not, Johan. I am old enough to remember the Winter of Discontent. Comrade Corbyn, Comrade Scargill. First Secretary Sturgeon! Reach for the rusty tin, self-castration before I would vote Socialist or Nationalist.I am almost old enough to remember the s also. I went missing from hom when I wis about , because I was busy helping a couple of older folk collect fire wood in the absence of coal during the Tories  day week I think.We are not going back to the s, with what we know now we can run things much better under Corbyn.The absence of coal was due to Socialist and le long Soviet supporterMick McGahey#s miners strike. Hardly down to the Tories. Just the Unions holding the country to ransom. Thank God the Maggie neutered that bunch.It#s almost like you are saying Shetland needs a vocal and united local Labour Party willing to take a stand on environmental and equality issues and prepared to ensure people#s concerns are properly considered.Will the local branch make a start to rebuilding by considering whether it isn#t time to call an end to Sullom Voe Yes, it would be goodmembers stopped voting for other partiesIt#s almost like you are trying to change the subject. Which of the parties that plan to close Sullom Voe did you vote for It’s important that unions be strong but not omnipotent, as in the s when many major industries were still nationalised. We meed balance.Combining the two is all very fine for those who, like me, benefited from working in the public sector however it leads to a two-tier workforce, with those in the private sector footing the bill, in taxes or high product prices, for the privileged ones in the public sector. That also hits private sector pay as employers must maintain viability with their increased costs.Having said that, re-nationalisation of electricity would be hilariously apt because government would become directly accountable totaxpayers and or bill-payers for the soaring costs of energy arising from “decarbonisation”, associated with the lunacy of unilateral “declarations of climate emergency” and policies like Labour’s “net zero ”.The IPCC does not call for that and condemns unilateral action as being unhelpful in achieving international agreement.I voted for Blair when sanity prevailed,now Corbyn takes us all back, well he is trying to, but the result empowers Boris!!! So now we have a Boris   Sturgeon catfight. Interesting times ahead, perhaps an Independent Shetland is the way forward, history repeating.Agreed Johan, and Labour has had my vote this time, but when there is a chance of turffing out an austerity backing LibDem# The main thing is people are being offered a chance to take back control of the vital services they depend on that should never have been privatised in the first place.New management systems will mean these can in future serve the people rather than serving corporate greed.Whether we get there this election or not, Corbin#s bold ideas have reignited the debate and energised thousands more activists than the Tories have active members. Hope remains for a fairer society in which the economy works for the good of the people as well as the environment they depend on.The LibDems on the other hand remain forever compromised between the freedom of business to exploit people and the freedom of people not to be exploited.

Trees decorated or sponsored by local people, churches, organisations and businesses will delight , while musicians and singers will play live Christmas music on the hour. Take a seat, close your eyes, pray and invite God to bring you into not ‘that Christmassy feeling’ but the deep joy that comes from knowing Him through Jesus Christ.There will be a number of points where guets can interact with the trees – for instance add to the decorations of a tree with your own words of joy and thanksgiving, post prayer requests for personal needs and other situations around the world at the Prayer Tree, and use the Blue Christmas ‘remembering’ tree to remember those whose presence we miss due to distance or death.

It can, however, offer a “true reflection” of an person’s own experiences, Jake Mac Siacais says ahead of his autobiography launch. From the perspective of those who know him, as an Irish language activist and lelong republican, his story is undoubtedly a fascinating one, and it is one that is laid bare in honest detail in his new book, Ón Taobh Istigh.Written in Irish, the autobiography starts as most stories do – at the beginning. Born onto a wooden bath board, Jake’s translated introduction describes his own beginning as neither “the most auspicious” nor “the worst”. It was, by his account, a relatively unremarkable day, although the events that have marked his le have been anything but.Our recent conflict and, of course, the republican struggle had a profound impact on Jake from an early age. Having joined the Fianna aged just , he had, by the time he was , resigned himself to either prison or death. For him, the latter came first. Arrested, questioned, and waterboarded by the RUC, he was eventually imprisoned at -years-old and would spend the best part of a decade in ‘the Crum’ and Long Kesh – eventually being moved to the H-Blocks in . During his part in the blanket protest, he became a friend and close confidant of Bobby Sands, who would die on hunger-strike in . As well as offering an honest and heartfelt insight into one of the most tragic periods our recent history, Ón Taobh Istigh is a discerning look at the social and political events that have shaped our post-conflict society.Speaking to the Andersonstown News, Jake told how he wrote the book as a means of dealing with his own personal struggle with depression.“I had suffered severe depression from  to  and I had worked through that with counselling,” he explained. “Then in , February, the counsellor said to me that one of the things that some people find useful is to write things down. So I just started to write my le story and somebody suggested that it would make a great book, so that’s what I did.”He continued: “It meant that I was examining my le in detail, going through everything that I’ve been through and literally just pouring it out on pages. “I decided that in the book I would be as honest and as forthright as I could, but that I would do it in a way which didn’t inidually insult or attack people. I deal with the politics of things, but not with iniduals.“I’ve dealt in detail with all of the major periods the struggle, the peace process – all of that.”He added: “I’m sure that historical figures will recognise themselves in the book, but the book is written with the clear intention of laying out how I remember things, and not straying into making judgements of any iniduals.”Ón Taobh Istigh is a forthright and genuine attempt by Jake to tell his story. While he admits that memory is often subjective, it is a “true reflection” of his own experiences.“I say in the introduction of the book that memory is never a trustworthy tool, or a very forensic tool,” he said.“It’s dficult to trust anyone ’s recall, and even more dficult when it comes to your own because memory is inclined to remember those things which it is favourable to remember, and to forget those things that are painful or dficult. Therefore, before you read this book bear in mind that it’s a true reflection of what I experienced, but others may take a dferent view.”Ón Taobh Istigh will be launched at Cultúrlann McAdam Ó Fiaich on Saturday at pm."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"meabha puts irish women in the frame","story":"AN intricate painting is proving to be much more than meets the eye in its celebration of Irish women and their place in the world.Entitled Mná hÉireann Women of Ireland, the painting was created by West Belfast artist Meabha Magerr. The striking piece was commissioned by go-to Andersonstown physiotherapist Dan Turley, taking pride of place in his home.Meabha, originally from Inishmore Crescent, now based across the water, told the Andersonstown News that her interest and talent in art flourished ever since “I could hold a crayon”.“In our household, thankfully, you were allowed to be who and what you were. I passed my -Plus and wanted to go to the school around the corner and that was St Genevieve’s. I had always had a love of painting and came from an artistic, creative family.”Friends since they were teenagers, Dan commissioned Meabha, who has displayed her work at the annual Féile an Phobail artists showcase in St Mary’s University College, to create Mná hÉireann.“My biggest problem was finding the right face, the central figure in this case of the piece, to signy le force and strength. I had painted a portrait of Clannad’s Moya Brennan before and I just kept coming back to her face, especially with her being a Celtic woman, a setter of pace. I did change it slightly, the hair, the colour of the eyes, I wanted to convey the feel of her, not necessarily a repeat portrait,” she said.She continued: “I’ve known Dan since I was , we have a lot of banter. He’s a Michelangelo man and just to annoy him I painted the ‘Da Vinci rose’ in it,” she laughed. “There are forget-me-nots in the painting and fuschias, deora Dé God’s tears, as I’d imagine he’d cry to see the persecution women have and continue to face at the injustices in the world.“Dan was very clear that he wanted only positives in the piece, no negatives.”Contained in Mná hÉireann are leaves of ious sizes withnames on them of women from throughout history in delicate gold lettering, and not immediately obvious.“I spent time researching and wanted to go beyond the obvious,” explained Meabha. “Countess Markievicz is there, my great aunt Nano Mullan is on it who fought alongside Countess Markievicz, Sonia O’Sullivan is there. The names are quite hard to read and that was deliberate, as throughout history women haven’t always been seen. They’ve had to come through back doors, pretend to be less than they were.”The prolic artist said the painting and the names contained in it have proved quite the talking point.“James Barry is on it. A woman who wanted to join the Irish army as a military surgeon and disguised herself as a man to do.”James Barry became a pioneering surgeon who carried out the first successful Caesarean delivery.Meabha spoke of how “not all the contributions, the names are immediately obvious”.“Sinéad Burke is there, Sinéad who is three-and-a-half foot tall, a Dublin-based teacher, PhD student and activist. When I first read about her, I nearly skimmed past the article, which was about the fashion industry. I love style but have no interest in fashion. I soon realised the article wasn’t about fashion in that sense, it was about inclusion – a much bigger topic and much more far reaching in many areas of le.“There are olives painted in the portrait, in dferent stages of development which are symbolizing peace. Some are ripe, some aren’t, the meaning behind this is that this is an ongoing stage, peace is a circle of work that will never end, we are always going to have to work hard for it.“I’m glad that the painting is proving to be such a talking point in Dan’s house. It’s as much about learning in that you pick a name and find out more, there is meaning behind each chosen colour, flower and there are emeralds, in this particular case placed in the Celtic crown to represent the four green fields.“The ring formation of the wreath signies everlasting protection. I didn’t want to follow the trend of portraying a warrior queen, that has been well covered by many fabulous artists. I wanted to make this piece more personal.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"tourism numbers soar in west belfast","story":"A new report has shown that West Belfast welcomed record number of tourists this year.Figures recorded for  thus far have shown at least  million visitor trips in this part of the city.Research commissioned by West Belfast tourism body Fáilte Feirste Thiar shows a dramatic increase in people visiting our local attractions, which have helped generate millions for the city’s economy.

We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

Back in  he represented the area as mayor, later becoming its MLA.Twelve years later he is now the constituencys MP - a triumph for Alliance which few political pundits would have been comfortable betting their money on until yesterday, with most predicting the seat was there for the DUPs taking.Dr Farrys Westminster win is no mean feat - voters held his successor, the independent unionist Lady Sylvia Hermon, in huge affection. Like Lady Hermon, he is a firm Remainer, and during his campaign he was keen to stress their shared Brexit position.A Queens University graduate in Politics with a PhD in International Relations, Dr Farry is only the second Alliance politician to be elected to Westminster in its history.A fitting development, perhaps, given the Newtownards man is arguably Alliances second most high-profile name, behind leader Naomi Long.During his tenure in the Executive, he served as minister for employment and learning, and gained widespread praise for capping tuition fees in September . Following the  Assembly elections, he took up positions on the Stormont Committee for the Economy and Business Committee, positions he held until the collapse of power-sharing in .His political work has also garnered global attention: in  he was appointed an International Peace Scholar by the US Institute of Peace. The -year-old has always been a passionate advocate of Alliances cross-community ethos, but he himself has been caught in the crossfire of Northern Irelands green and orange politics.In , after fellow party members on Belfast City Council voted in favour of restricting the flying of the Union flag at City Hall to specic days throughout the year, his own constituency office in Bangor was the target of an attempted arson attack. But with Alliances gains in this latest election, Dr Farry will be hoping it indicates potential for growing the middle ground in local politics. *Stephen Farry was not available for an interview yesterday.Stephen FarryAllianceNorth DownWon by: , votesBrexit: Remain"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38783754.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/nIreland1302.jpg","title":"jon tonge there is much to lament for the big parties but its clear alliances time has now come","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It said DUP , Sinn Fein , Alliance , SDLP  and UUP .Close, but not quite the cigar and while I did not do a GB forecast, the scale of the Corbyn catastrophe far exceeded that expected even by those of us long cynical concerning his capabilities.Understandably, the widely trumpeted headline is that unionist MPs will provide only a minority of Northern Irelands Westminster representatives, for the first time ever.The DUP came perilously close to being wiped out in Belfast amid a three-pronged attack from Sinn Fein, the SDLP and Alliance.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.Sign InNew to Belfasttelegraph  window.gigyaIntegration  window.gigyaIntegration  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand.push gigyaIntegrationLoginScreenSet gigyaIntegrationRegisterScreenSetBut as late as Thursday morning, the DUP was still very hopeful of holding North Belfast. I saw some of the bets that had been struck.Arlene Foster was neither wrong nor sectarian in blaming the grievous blow of losing Nigel Dodds on changing demographics.Lamenting a pan-nationalist pact will not wash, though, given the pressure placed upon Steve Aikens UUP to step aside in North Belfast.Even without a pact, Claire Hanna would almost certainly have won South Belfast for the SDLP.The  high water mark was always going to be dficult to defend. It is also worth remembering that DUP vote shares have risen more often in elections under Fosters stewardship than they have fallen.The DUP remains Northern Irelands largest party. data-dfpadtargetingThe DUPs Alex Easton is consoled by his we DeniseThat said, previous successes owed something to UUP weakness and Thursdays Belfast and North Down failures, along with several reduced majorities where, increase the pressure upon her leadership.Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, who saw his own constituency turn into a semi-marginal, is the obvious Westminster replacement leader for Dodds. His remit might ultimately be extended.Meanwhile, Alliances time has come.The partys voted soared by nearly %, to add to the % European election increase and % in the council contests.It is Alliances best year. This surge is causing problems for the UUP, searching for niche pro-Union distinctiveness, but Alliances extra vote is also coming from those who do not identy as unionist or nationalist. And that is a big and expanding reservoir in which Alliance can fish. What of Sinn Fein  It got the scalp it wanted with the Dodds decapitation and ended the election with the same number of MPs as it started.Yet overall performance was mediocre at best and occasionally poor.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood handed out a thrashing in Foyle probably beyond his own expectations, let alone anyone s. This in a city where Sinn Fein had staged its ard fheis, launched its manesto and brought in hundreds of volunteers in the last month. Sinn Feins % fall in vote share - even allowing for its non-participation in some constituencies - is part of a broader pattern of generally indferent recent election performances.While a Boris Brexit will now assist the party in establishing economic structures of unication and in effect special status for The North, it seems inconceivable that the Conservative Government will permit a border poll. There is no obvious short-or medium-term route to constitutional unity. The Prime Ministers immediate preoccupation will be somehow attempting to quell the burning independence fires in Scotland.While the success of the SDLP in Foyle will reawaken criticisms of Sinn Feins abstention from Westminster, it is unclear why.The grim truth for even the participatory victorious local MPs is that they will carry precious little clout at Westminster.They might enjoy the sights but not the politics.If the PM could discard the DUP so brutally when it held the balance of power, why would he listen to the pleas of  MPs who offer zero threat to his -seat majority So abstention may remain a non-issue within Sinn Fein. Evenit could be proved beyond doubt that abstention was harming Sinn Feins electoral fortunes, the party leadership would be wary of touching the issue.A two-thirds majority of members would be needed for change and risks a split. And anyone who thinks a split in the republican movement does not have its problems has slept through the last century.If locally elected politicians want power, they will need to restore Stormont.That is a possible outcome of Thursdays results.Sinn Fein would have a power base. The DUP might take the view that an Irish Language Act, in broader form, is the bitter pill that needs swallowing to avoid the grim vista of power being confined to local councils for at least half a generation.But such DUP willingness would be conditional upon them being still the largest party and providing the first minister after the next set of elections to the phantom Assembly, presumably in spring.Ready for yet more hot contests then Jon Tonge is Professor of Politics at the University of Liverpool and Principal Investigator of the ESRC  Northern Ireland election study"},{"url":null,"title":"taoiseach leo varadkar gets ready for a snap election and pledges to work with ni politicians","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

the “urgent need” to cut greenhouse gases in line with the goals of the landmark  Paris climate change accord.That fell far short of promising to enhance countries’ pledges to cut greenhouse gases

Our Department was also delighted when Science student Suzanne Ramage ed from the Worldskills Show in Birmingham with a Bronze medal. “We’ve also enjoyed hosting our successful Digital Cities event for the second time.“Today’s showcasing event, with contributions from STCI and our Business Support Unit , aims to promote innovation, entrepreneurship and knowledge transfer through dissemination of project activities undertaken by staff and students, supporting businesses and collaborating with a range of stakeholders.”The event concluded with a  discussion including Technology and Innovation Manager at NWRC’s Business Support Centre Fergal Tuffy, Bronagh Fikri, International Projects Manager at NWRC, and Danny Laverty, Head of Science, Technology and the Creative Industries at NWRC. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

During these colder months it’s more crucial than ever that people check in with their older family, friends and neighbours, and those who are isolated in our community.“Please consider their wellbeing and ensure they have a working smoke alarm. Check their home for Christmas fire hazards, such as candles, Christmas tree lights, portable heaters, and overloaded sockets, and make sure they are being used safely, in order to ‘STOP’ fire in their home. Please refer them to us for free Home Fire Safety Checknecessary.“Also,you hear a neighbour’s smoke alarm going off, don’t ignore it- go and check. If there’s a fire, oryou can’t be sure, ring  and ask for NIFRS.“We want you to enjoy yourself over the coming weeks by following our fire safety advice and ensuring you’re prepared for winter. By looking after your own safety, and the safety of those around you, you are not only helping to protect you and your loved ones from a range of fire and other emergencies, but you are also helping us as a Fire  Rescue Service.

In the first instance, we urge all players to read in detail the full report from the GAA’s Fixtures Review Taskforce. Key principles agreed by the GPA and CPA are based upon the fundamental understanding that inter-county players are also club players and that this connection is the basis of the GAA. These are:  The club is the primary basic unit of the GAA from which everything springs. Therefore, this must be recognised in the status which club games are given. googletag.cmd.push  The inter-county game is the GAA’s biggest promotional and developmental tool. It is also the GAA’s primary revenue generator. This must be fully recognised in restructuring our national games calendar. Furthermore, both organisations are in agreement that, following the recent publication of the Fixtures Calendar Review Taskforce report, and prior to the next phase in that process which includes a series of regional seminars in which all key stakeholders will be provided with the opportunity to provide further views and feedback, there are a number of key points centred around time and governance that we mutually support and wish to highlight. googletag.cmd.push These are:  The Club Window in April May should be ened to a -week period to allow the fairest opportunity for the window to be successfully utilised.  The demands placed upon inter-county players in both club and inter-county windows will need to be governed to ensure the games training load is not detrimental to the players’ welfare.  The Club Window post the All-Ireland football final needs to be a minimum of  weeks before provincial club championships begin.  Club Windows will only work fairly for all,inter county competitions start their championships on the same dates.  There needs to be stronger adherence to provisions regarding the availability of inter-county players to clubs as referenced within GPA Squad Charters.  Bar club teams involved in provincial championships November should be used exclusively as an off season for inter-county players.  There needs to be strong governance and guidelines introduced to ensure club fixtures schedules are appropriately set out and adhered to throughout the year. “One of our core pillars is to protect the welfare of our members, statedPaul Flynn, GPA CEO. It is therefore vital that fixtures are properly governed to ensure the fundamental link between club and inter-county players is fully recognised and strengthened within the fixtures calendar. “This year we put a motion before GAA Congress to provide for a GPA representative to sit on the Central Competitions Control Committee to input on fixtures involving inter-county hurling and football competitions only, in a bid to improve the situation for our members.” “We will work towards this with the CPA, while prioritising the welfare of our members, keeping in focus the amount of games they are expected to play and amount of training they are expected to undertake.” Micheacuteal Briody, Chairman of the CPA, admitted that both the GPA and CPA have agreed the the current fixtures calendar isnt the best fit for both sets of players. “The CPA have advocated for a radical structural change to the fixtures calendar since our formation in , Briody commented. It is important now that the options for change put forward from the Task Force are disseminated to clubs immediately so that the debate can begin nationwide on what level of change is acceptable.” “We will work to ensurethis communication does happen effectively and it is criticalthat all clubs become aware of the options that are being presented and then vote for change that will alleviate the current unsatisfactory schedule.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

There are also a lot of people who have moved to universal credit and are still waiting for money and low-income families.“They have that choice of between having food or toys for their kids and nobody wants to see their kids go without.”There is a misconception that it is only the unemployed who visit food banks but Mr McMenamin said that zero hour contracts, minimum wage jobs and even a sudden change in circumstances means that nobody is insusceptible.“If you look at a family who are working, paying full rent or mortgage, plus childcare and they have an unexpected bill such as the car breaking down, that can take away any surplus money they may have had because they need that car for work.“Therefore, they’re left with a very dficult choice.”Vouchers are handed out on a daily basis by referral agencies across the town, such as Dove House, Hillcrest Hub, Caw and Nelson Drive and others throughout the city.Food Bank workers will sit down with people to find outthere are any underlying issues for which they need support.“It’s no good us just handing out food,” he explained. “We need to find out what the issue is so we can refer them on to a debt adviser, a benefit adviser, or it could be counselling or a GP they need an appointment with.”Mr McMenamin started out with Foyle Foodbank as a delivery driver and there are thirty volunteers based at its Apex owned premises in Springtown Industrial Estate. “We rely on them, we couldn’t operate without our volunteers.”“We’d be lost without the support of the public, our all stock comes from the public and local businesses, the food bank gets no funding whatsoever.“Christmas is an amazing time for us, we get so many donations which help to set us up for the rest of the year. The people in this town are just amazing.” googletag.cmd.push ‘Protect people’  Collection points are at Tescos and Sainsburys on the Strand Road, businesses also collect, there are appeals on Facebook and food can also be donated directly to the Food Bank. The links between welfare changes, food bank use and destitution are contested by dferent political parties. Trussell Trust. which runs two-thirds of the UK’s food banks include Foyle Foodbank, said it distributed a record number of food parcels between April and September this year, including , that went to children. It was a % increase on the same period last year, representing the steepest rise the charity has witnessed since its network of food banks was fully established.The Trust has called on politicians of all parties to pledge to protect people from hunger. It is demanding an end to the five-week wait for universal credit payments, a commitment to ensure benefit payments cover the basic costs of living, and investment in emergency support for people in crisis.Reflecting that view, Foyle Foodbank believes that local politicians need toto Stormont so that local issues can be addressed. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

There are also a lot of people who have moved to universal credit and are still waiting for money and low-income families.“They have that choice of between having food or toys for their kids and nobody wants to see their kids go without.”There is a misconception that it is only the unemployed who visit food banks but Mr McMenamin said that zero hour contracts, minimum wage jobs and even a sudden change in circumstances means that nobody is insusceptible.“If you look at a family who are working, paying full rent or mortgage, plus childcare and they have an unexpected bill such as the car breaking down, that can take away any surplus money they may have had because they need that car for work.“Therefore, they’re left with a very dficult choice.”Vouchers are handed out on a daily basis by referral agencies across the town, such as Dove House, Hillcrest Hub, Caw and Nelson Drive and others throughout the city.Food Bank workers will sit down with people to find outthere are any underlying issues for which they need support.“It’s no good us just handing out food,” he explained. “We need to find out what the issue is so we can refer them on to a debt adviser, a benefit adviser, or it could be counselling or a GP they need an appointment with.”Mr McMenamin started out with Foyle Foodbank as a delivery driver and there are thirty volunteers based at its Apex owned premises in Springtown Industrial Estate. “We rely on them, we couldn’t operate without our volunteers.”“We’d be lost without the support of the public, our all stock comes from the public and local businesses, the food bank gets no funding whatsoever.“Christmas is an amazing time for us, we get so many donations which help to set us up for the rest of the year. The people in this town are just amazing.” googletag.cmd.push ‘Protect people’  Collection points are at Tescos and Sainsburys on the Strand Road, businesses also collect, there are appeals on Facebook and food can also be donated directly to the Food Bank. The links between welfare changes, food bank use and destitution are contested by dferent political parties. Trussell Trust. which runs two-thirds of the UK’s food banks include Foyle Foodbank, said it distributed a record number of food parcels between April and September this year, including , that went to children. It was a % increase on the same period last year, representing the steepest rise the charity has witnessed since its network of food banks was fully established.The Trust has called on politicians of all parties to pledge to protect people from hunger. It is demanding an end to the five-week wait for universal credit payments, a commitment to ensure benefit payments cover the basic costs of living, and investment in emergency support for people in crisis.Reflecting that view, Foyle Foodbank believes that local politicians need toto Stormont so that local issues can be addressed. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I knew him from gigs and as a customer of Cool Discs when I worked there. More than that though I felt I knew him more through other people’s recollections of him and to deliver the eulogy I give you me and Mickey’s friends.Joe Brown said: “Derry sadly lost a man you don’t meet every day. There was nothing lying beneath, no agendas, no jagged edges. “A rock solid partner to Breige and an inspirational man of music, art and literature. I saw his band Idol Threat with The Undertones a number of times and became friends with him in the early s, going to gigs. “People were drawn to him and the inspirational effect he had on them. I heard so many bands for the first time through his record collection. I’ll always remember Mickey as a man who embraced le and had an incredible gt of bringing people together, loved a party and kept me from going sane Derry feels like a dferent place without him, every now and then nature conjures up someone very unique and special, who so many had barrels of affection for and who’ll be sadly missed by us all”.Mickey Rooney said: “His flat was always open to the outsiders, his heart was open to all no matter what creed or colour and his mind was always open to whatever experiences came his way”.Raymond Gorman said: “There was definitely no one like him, it took real guts to dress as a punk back in the day, it was a very violent time, Mickey was fearless and hated bullies. The last time I spoke to him he was enthusing about his latest music pourchases and gigs he’d been to. I think he’d be annoyed with everyone being too sad about his passing, remember him with the smile he put on your face when you met him”.Louise McIntyre said: “I first knew Mickey as a teenager growing up in the Brandywell, he was in my older brother’s class in school, I never actually got to talk to him back then as he was a quiet sort. “My earliest memory is looking across at Mickey’s backyard flat roof extension roof and seeing him lying up there with a small radio to his ear listening to his music, even then I knew he was dferent   cool. Several years later we crossed paths again and became a true friend he was doing best man at our wedding. He always remembered birthdays and special occasions. “Mickey stood head and shoulders above everyone  in more ways than one. He was an inspiration and a Derry legend. I somehow hope that he knew this, and that Derry will be an emptier place without him. Thanks for the memories Mickey xx”.Liz Brown said: “One of lasting memories Ill carry of Mickey was his genuine love and kindness towards his friends and loved ones. Like gravity, Mickey had an unseen force that pulled people together and kept their feet on the ground”.Paul McCartney paid a touching tribute in the Journal the day of Mickey’s funeral. “As the s began, you’d usually touch base with Mickey in the town centre on a Saturday. He had a band called The Idol Threats and soon the band I played in, Graffiti, ended up regularly supporting them. I don’t think I saw a local group as musically adventurous until That Petrol Emotion came along. It was a million miles apart from The Undertones and The Moondogs and Mickey was crucial to this process. He wasn’t just the drummer - he was the lyricist also. Just as the music was very involving and mysterious, so, too, were the words and song titles - ‘Lonely Beach Now, ‘Postcard from Abroad’ and the legendary ‘Little Green Men on The Moon.Mickey was a kind and generous guy, but also grateful and reciprocal for everything he received. He remembered everyone’s birthday and was always there with a card or gt. He constantly exuded a spirit of fun and that amazing sense of humour of his was just non-stop and incredible - you simply didn’t know what would come next.“Politics  He didn’t do them, and they did not happen in the many get-togethers in his legendary Abercorn Place flat. I think I can genuinely describe him as an “Enemy of Sectarianism”. When Mickey was cruelly affected by ill health in recent years, this sense of civility never eroded. So lucky are many of us for having this wonderful and inspirational human being around for many years”. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The cause was not something in the water and the school did not travel back in time to the s. Staff supported a “Movember” campaign to raise money for a very worthwhile cause which was very well supported and raised pound.!Brian Injury Mattersis a local charity and was founded in . It aims to help and support children, young people and adults who have an acquired Brian Injury to live as full a le as possible and to aid the process of rehabilitation. The charity relies very heavily on support from the public and Community Engagement Officer, Treasa Rice made the trip to Dungiven to receive a cheque from the school this week.Mary Uiacute Dhuibhne who works at the Gaelcholaacuteiste had high praise for the charity. Mary’s son Peadar Pio acquired a brain injury following an accident when playing two years ago and BIM provided much needed support for Peadar Pio and his family. Peadar Pio, who is currently in Rang  in Gaelscoil Neachtain, is now making excellent progress in his recovery, he is back playing footballand is looking very much forward to joining the Gaelcholaacuteiste team next year when he transfers to the school in September.Although the end of November witnessed the end of the fund raising, some members of the staff appear to have grown attached to their new look and have decided not to shave just yet - to the consternation of their co-workers! It might be the case that another campaign may be called for to encourage a clean shaven appearance among staff in the future!In another fundraising event for the same charity, a screening of Miracle on th Street will take place at An Coire, Maghera on Sunday, December .

He succeeds Rt Rev Ken Good who retired from episcopal ministry in May.The stormy December weather did not deter scores of people from the Diocese of Derry and Raphoe, or from the parish where Bishop Forster had been Rector, from travelling to Armagh for the ordination, and the church was filled for the occasion.The congregation heard the preacher, Revd Canon Maurice Elliott – who has known the new bishop since their first day at Theological College – describe Rt Rev Forster as a larger than le personality with an infectious sense of humour. “He will bring an immense range of gts and abilities to this new role,” Canon Elliott said. “He is a man of deep conviction, yet he tempers this with an instinctive capacity to care.”Canon Elliott said from the moment, just over  years ago, that he and Bishop Forster arrived “literally together” into Braemor Park, to begin theological training, they had struck up what had become a lelong friendship. It was a singular honour, he said, to have been invited by the Archbishop to preach on this momentous occasion of Bishop Forster’s consecration.Their long friendship did not prevent the preacher from sharing one story – at the Bishop-elect’s expense – from the rugby pitch at Trinity College during their first year of training together in . “In the rather vain pursuit of fitness,” he said, “the Bishop-elect and I decided we would attend Monday evening rugby training and we were perhaps only five minutes into a warm-up when the coach told us to get into pairs. So, the two of us joined forces. The instruction then followed that we were each to piggyback our partner the width of the pitch and back which I, having opted to be number one, duly did. Then, as the coach shouted for a swt role reversal, I can honestly say I’ve never seen anyone move so fast in the direction of the changing room as he shouted back over his shoulder in my general direction, ‘Come on, we’re going.’ And to be fair, we never went back.“So,” Canon Elliott said, “maybe on that occasion, Andrew didn’t quite demonstrate himself willing to carry a heavy burden but, in so many other ways, the Bishop-elect has proved himself more than able to bear signicant responsibility: first through the years of his curacy at Willowfield then as a chaplain at Queen’s as Incumbent of Drumclfe and most recently as a much, much loved Rector of Drumglass.”The preacher said he had never heard anyone express anything other than deep appreciation of every facet of the Bishop-elect’s ministry. “As a teacher, as a pastor, as an evangelist, as a leader, as an Archdeacon, through his involvement in the structures of the General Synod and the Representative Body, Andrew has shown himself to be diligent, capable, faithful, popular and loving. And in all of this he has been wonderfully supported by Heather, by Hannah, Patrick, Megan, by his wider family, and, not least, also by his late parents Victor and Joan. And Andrew, we all recognise how deeply proud they would have been to have witnessed this moment.”“Bishop-elect Andrew James Forster,” the preacher said, addressing his friend directly, “on this day our deepest prayer for you is that you will stay close to the Lord who was willing to suffer on your behalf. We ask that you may remain focused on the message of the Cross and the empty tomb and that as you are able to do that you will prove yourself not only faithful but resilient and strong. Thirty years ago, you didn’t feel minded to run across a rugby pitch with me on your back but, as you learn increasingly to lean on the Lord’s word for strength and on the Lord’s spirit for stamina, our confidence is that you will run well the marathon of episcopal ministry and that in due course you will finish that race. You cannot do it in your own strength, so even now choose again to undertake it only in the name, and for the sake of, the one who laid down his le for you, and who alone is able to sustain you.”The Archbishop of Armagh, Most Revd Dr Richard Clarke, was assisted during the Consecration by the Bishop of Meath and Kildare, Most Revd Patricia Storey and the Bishop of Tuam, Killala and Achonry, Right Revd Patrick Rooke. The three were joined for the laying on of hands by the other Church of Ireland serving and retired bishops present, including Lord Eames – a former Bishop of Derry and Raphoe. Next, the newly ordained bishop was vested with his episcopal habit, before being presented to the congregation by the Archbishop, with the words, “Brothers and sisters in Christ, I present to you Andrew, Bishop in the Church of God.” Bishop Forster was then acclaimed with warm and loud applause.Among the many dignitaries from other Churches at the Consecration were the President of the Methodist Church in Ireland, Rev Sam McGuffin the President of the Irish Council of Churches, Rev Brian Anderson , the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Armagh, Archbishop Eamon Martin and the Moderator of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, Dr William Henry. North West Church leaders present included the Bishop of Derry, Dr Donal McKeown the Bishop of Raphoe, Most Rev Alan McGuckian and the Methodist Superintendent, Rev Richard Johnston. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He succeeds Rt Rev Ken Good who retired from episcopal ministry in May.The stormy December weather did not deter scores of people from the Diocese of Derry and Raphoe, or from the parish where Bishop Forster had been Rector, from travelling to Armagh for the ordination, and the church was filled for the occasion.The congregation heard the preacher, Revd Canon Maurice Elliott – who has known the new bishop since their first day at Theological College – describe Rt Rev Forster as a larger than le personality with an infectious sense of humour. “He will bring an immense range of gts and abilities to this new role,” Canon Elliott said. “He is a man of deep conviction, yet he tempers this with an instinctive capacity to care.”Canon Elliott said from the moment, just over  years ago, that he and Bishop Forster arrived “literally together” into Braemor Park, to begin theological training, they had struck up what had become a lelong friendship. It was a singular honour, he said, to have been invited by the Archbishop to preach on this momentous occasion of Bishop Forster’s consecration.Their long friendship did not prevent the preacher from sharing one story – at the Bishop-elect’s expense – from the rugby pitch at Trinity College during their first year of training together in . “In the rather vain pursuit of fitness,” he said, “the Bishop-elect and I decided we would attend Monday evening rugby training and we were perhaps only five minutes into a warm-up when the coach told us to get into pairs. So, the two of us joined forces. The instruction then followed that we were each to piggyback our partner the width of the pitch and back which I, having opted to be number one, duly did. Then, as the coach shouted for a swt role reversal, I can honestly say I’ve never seen anyone move so fast in the direction of the changing room as he shouted back over his shoulder in my general direction, ‘Come on, we’re going.’ And to be fair, we never went back.“So,” Canon Elliott said, “maybe on that occasion, Andrew didn’t quite demonstrate himself willing to carry a heavy burden but, in so many other ways, the Bishop-elect has proved himself more than able to bear signicant responsibility: first through the years of his curacy at Willowfield then as a chaplain at Queen’s as Incumbent of Drumclfe and most recently as a much, much loved Rector of Drumglass.”The preacher said he had never heard anyone express anything other than deep appreciation of every facet of the Bishop-elect’s ministry. “As a teacher, as a pastor, as an evangelist, as a leader, as an Archdeacon, through his involvement in the structures of the General Synod and the Representative Body, Andrew has shown himself to be diligent, capable, faithful, popular and loving. And in all of this he has been wonderfully supported by Heather, by Hannah, Patrick, Megan, by his wider family, and, not least, also by his late parents Victor and Joan. And Andrew, we all recognise how deeply proud they would have been to have witnessed this moment.”“Bishop-elect Andrew James Forster,” the preacher said, addressing his friend directly, “on this day our deepest prayer for you is that you will stay close to the Lord who was willing to suffer on your behalf. We ask that you may remain focused on the message of the Cross and the empty tomb and that as you are able to do that you will prove yourself not only faithful but resilient and strong. Thirty years ago, you didn’t feel minded to run across a rugby pitch with me on your back but, as you learn increasingly to lean on the Lord’s word for strength and on the Lord’s spirit for stamina, our confidence is that you will run well the marathon of episcopal ministry and that in due course you will finish that race. You cannot do it in your own strength, so even now choose again to undertake it only in the name, and for the sake of, the one who laid down his le for you, and who alone is able to sustain you.”The Archbishop of Armagh, Most Revd Dr Richard Clarke, was assisted during the Consecration by the Bishop of Meath and Kildare, Most Revd Patricia Storey and the Bishop of Tuam, Killala and Achonry, Right Revd Patrick Rooke. The three were joined for the laying on of hands by the other Church of Ireland serving and retired bishops present, including Lord Eames – a former Bishop of Derry and Raphoe. Next, the newly ordained bishop was vested with his episcopal habit, before being presented to the congregation by the Archbishop, with the words, “Brothers and sisters in Christ, I present to you Andrew, Bishop in the Church of God.” Bishop Forster was then acclaimed with warm and loud applause.Among the many dignitaries from other Churches at the Consecration were the President of the Methodist Church in Ireland, Rev Sam McGuffin the President of the Irish Council of Churches, Rev Brian Anderson , the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Armagh, Archbishop Eamon Martin and the Moderator of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, Dr William Henry. North West Church leaders present included the Bishop of Derry, Dr Donal McKeown the Bishop of Raphoe, Most Rev Alan McGuckian and the Methodist Superintendent, Rev Richard Johnston. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Council have supported calls to amend the Common Travel Agreementbetween Ireland and Britain.Lilian SeenoI-Barr said the passing of motions at both council meetings last week was most welcome and much appreciated by many migrants here as the Agreement as it currently operated discriminated, she claimed, against non-European people living on the island of Ireland. Speaking yesterday Mrs Seenoi Barr explained why the amendment was necessary: As someone who came from a non-EU country I experienced many of the restrictions the CTA imposed on me. For example, despite the fact I lived in Culmore I could not, quite literally, go half a mile down the road to Muff to buy a pint of milk. If I crossed the Border I was committing a crime. And this was despite the fact I was living in the North legally.She went on: The Common Travel Agreement was first agreed about a  years ago, in very dferent circumstances. I dont think it was envisaged back then that people from Africa or wherever would be living here. But thats how it is now. EU citizens can move freely between the North and the South, butyou are not an EU citizen you cant.I know of a nurse from South African living in Letterkenny who was detained for three days because she went to visit relatives in Scotland using Belfast airport. A Syrian boy in Belfast with a le-threatening heart condition needed emergency treatment that was only available in Dublin. Civil servants literally worked around the clock to sort out the red tape to ensure he could get that treatment. A young student in Derry couldnt go on a school trip to Dublin because she needed a visa. Every day we hear more and more about the impact of these kind of petty restrictions.Thanking everyone involved she said she wanted to acknowledge the support of all councillors from the ious parties who supported the motions calling for amendment to the CTA submitted by Councillor Martin Reilly in Derry and in Donegal by the chairman of Donegal Co. Council, Councillor Nicholas Crossan, who has also confirmed that Donegal Council has send a letter to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the issue.The North West Migrants Forum has been to the forefront in leading the campaign for the amendment and Director Seenoi Barr said she had had a number of meetings with councillors and other interested parties in recent weeks seeking their support to ensure that this was seen as a cross Border campaign. She has also been in constant touch with the British Council to get their backing.Mrs Seenoi Barr concluded: The CTA needs to be amended because it is no longer fit for purpose. Times have changed. If we are serious about inclusion and belonging then we must stand up for people across all sections of the community who are being discriminated against or being treated unfairly. Our objective is to ensure that all who live legally on the island of Ireland have the same rights as privileges as each other. I have spoken to many elected representatives, on both sides of the Border and in Britain, and as we have clearly seen in recent days there is real support for getting it changed. And we here at the North West Migrants Forum will be leading from the front in the campaign to ensure that it is. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

An economist is also helping compile the document.City deals are packages of funding and decision making powers which allow councils to boost the economy through the development of large projects in their respective areas.The deals are designed to allow councils to take charge and responsibility of decisions that affect their area, do what they think is best to help businesses grow, create economic growth and decide how public money should be spent.Newry, Mourne and Down is one of five local authorities paired with Belfast City Council, universities and theprivate sector who have

the councilrsquos Enterprise, Tourism and Regeneration Committee, politicians were told that officials have been working on the detailed outline business case since last May, with a consultancy team helping prepare the document.Council officials say that when work on the business case is completed next spring, it will provide a detailed analysis and assessment of the projectrsquos strategic fit within the City Deal.In addition, the document will also outline detailed project costs, the benefits, risks and funding requirements.Politicians were told this week that the documentrsquos analysis will recommend a particular procurement route in order to deliver the scheme.It has also been confirmed that the ongoing development of the business case involves planning considerations and the development of exemplar design and output specications, prior to any formal procurement exercise being undertaken.Politicians were informed on Monday night that the outline business case will provide detail on the technical expertise in terms of the design, construction and maintenance of similar international attractions and also provide detailed analysis of commercial operations of a visitor attraction of this scale.It is understood that council officials are working alongside Tourism NI to secure financial backing for other aspects of the tourism investment and support to move the projects through a series of key stages, including the preparation of business cases and planning approval.Other aspects of the Mournes Gateway scheme include an elevated tree top walk in Tollymore Forest Park, a new visitor centre and bird hide at the Murlough Nature Reserve and a new bridge constructed under the main Kilkeel Road at the Bloody Bridge on the outskirts of the town.Consultants appointed by the local authority to look at developing the resortrsquos visitor infrastructure have also come up with proposals for the Islands Park, with upgrades planned for existing car parks, alongside new public toilet provision.There are also proposals to reduce the the tree line in Donard Forest on the slopes of the Mournes, with a so-called green travel network which would allow visitors to hire bicycles and electric bikes to make their way round ious attractions is also suggested.The ious proposals form the core of the so-called Mourne Mountains Gateway Study and have

Someone came forward and this was welcomed by elderly people who would not be forced to travel outside the town to access services.Cllr Walker says it is vital that Ballynahinch retains its dedicated postal office and appealed to someone the townrsquos business community to consider taking over the service.ldquoBallynahinch is Down Districtrsquos third largest town and it would be a body blowthe planned temporary closure became permanent, he said.ldquoThe bottom lines appears to be thatno one comes forward to offer to run the service it will close and that will impact on people across the community.ldquoThe role of local post offices has changed considerably over recent years, with many transferring to large supermarkets which ensured that they were open for much longer, including weekends.ldquoMany elderly people prefer to conduct their business at post offices, not banks. That is one of the many reasons why this vitally important service is not lost to Ballynahinch. A number of local post offices, which provide a much broader range of services including banking facilities, are now housed in retail premises.Cllr Walker added: ldquoIt is my hope that one of the major retailers in Ballynahinch will come forward to ensure that the service is not lost to the town. While the post offices are important to our major towns, many are also at the heart of rural communities across the district.

And while there is a signicant financial benefit for securing geopark status, council officials insist the benefits are not just economic.They have previously argued that geoparks have a ldquosignicant role to play in empowering local communities and giving them the opportunities to develop cohesive partnerships with the common goal of promoting the arearsquos signicant geological and other heritage.There are currently  geoparks found in  countries across the world, all of which have been developed using a bottom-up approach with local communities playing a signicant role in this process.Currently, there are three designated geoparks in Ireland. In addition to the Marble Arch Caves in Fermanagh, they include The Burren and Clfs of Moher in Co Clare and the Copper Coast geopark in Co Waterford.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokeswoman confirmed on Monday afternoon that the local authorityrsquos bid for geopark was formally submitted last month..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th December 2019 Publication.jpg","title":"Book delves into the history around Strangford  ","story":"INVERBRENA Local History Group has launched the latest edition of its annual magazine mdash just in time for Christmas.Memories From Inverbrena: Strangford  features a selection of memories, stories, histories and photographs of people and places within the Strangford area, preserved for future generations.The magazine includes an article by Michael McConville in which he chronicles the history of the the local parish drama club during the s and s, including a selection of photographs of local amateur actors and actresses who participated in some of the popular well received productions.In his second article in this yearrsquos publication, Michael remembers happy days potato picking, recalling how everyone worked together as a team, both boys and girls, and all getting the same pay at the end of the day.Melanie Hamill puts pen to paper to provide an invaluable record of her splendid conversion of Strangford Presbyterian Church, earning it the prestigious  Heritage Angel award for Best Rescue of a Historic Building Or Place for projects under pound million.

These included the non-replacement of clerical staff who resign and y delays in the supply of equipment necessary for class use.Mr Ellis also slammed a proposal to impose a charge for school transport and labelled it as ldquoclearly unfair.He stressed that he was not taking the negative attitude that all cuts are bad.

He was very young and had been badly neglected. He had been kept in a confined space or a very small pen. Sony was very loving. All he wanted was to be loved and he thrived on attention.ldquoHe was a huge dog but very dirty. When we gave him a bath his coat came up lovely and white. We got him started with his first round of vaccinations and our followers stood by us financially.Monica works closely with Corran Kennels, on the Tobercorran Road outside Downpatrick, who come to her for helpthey need a puppy or dog re-homed, and Animal Connexions, based at Nutts Corner outside Belfast.Monica said: ldquoRecently a litter of  kittens were about to be euthanised and we managed to be able to find homes for all of them within a short period of time.Monica added that she has her own account with the two branches of Castle Vets in Downpatrick and Castlewellan and pays for any necessary medical attention abandoned pets may need out of her own pocket.ldquoMembers of the public are so good. When we put up an appeal on the page that an animal requires surgery or medicine they phone the vets and give money and it comes off the bill.ldquoI am so grateful to everyone. It can be tough going and running something like this takes a big chunk out of your le, but our team of volunteers are thankfully very enthusiastic.ldquoAnyone can follow the page. Just ask to join the group through the socialmedia network and followers will be able to keep up-to-date with what we are doing.Lana King, from Burrenreagh, is a volunteer with the not-for-profit organisation.She said: ldquoWhile the main aim of the page back in  originally was to reunite owners with their pets, there are times when nobody comes looking for a little lost one and thatrsquos when Monica goes beyond the call of duty and ensures they have a second chance with a new family.ldquoShe gets to know the potential owner, carries out a home check and follows it up. There is nothing she loves more than to hear how the pets she has helped to re-home or re-habilitate are doing.Lana added: ldquoMonica really is the back bone of Lost Found Pets South Down and has gained the admiration and respect from anyone who comes into contact with her.ldquoNothing is ever too much bother for her.ldquoShe has devoted her le to animals and makes sure every pet that comes to her receives the very best of care.ldquoEven though Monica suffers with a debilitating disease called lupus, she just gets up every morning and gets on with it.ldquoHer sharp wit, sense of humour and contagious laugh lts the spirits of people who are going through the heartbreak of having their pet go missing and reassures them because they know Monica will do everything she can to reunite them with their beloved pet.Lana added: ldquoMonica helps those pets who have found themselves either lost, abandoned, abused or simply not having a loving home to call their own..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th December 2019 Health.jpg","title":"Health workers take  industrial strike action  ","story":"HEALTH workers in Downpatrick took strike action last Friday ahead of a series of protests calling for pay parity and adequate nursing numbers.Nurses were working to rule yesterday and today at the Downshire and Downe Hospitals while a joint strike planned between their union, the Royal College of Nursing , and Unison, will be held next Wednesday.Hospital and outlying district services will be impacted as the strike will run from am until pm mdash unless a deal is done before that.Unison and the RCN are demanding equal pay for its members in line with UK counterparts and for increased nurse recruitment to protect patients in a failing health service.Domestics, porters, catering staff, administrative staff, dental nurses from all wards and departments in the Downe and Downshire Hospitals and outlying facilities will join nurses who have voted to strike for the first time in their -year history.Public support was high for health workers, including nurses from the Down Outpatients Department, who took part in Fridayrsquos strike.Hundreds of Unison members joined the picket in the morning and afternoon at Downshire Hospitalrsquos entrance with local drivers sounding support as they passed.The impact of the action closed the Outpatients department at the Downe Hospital, along with the Ulster Hospital, Lagan Valley, Ards and Bangor Hospitals.The Community Dental Service was impacted with the cancellation of the Ballynahinch clinic and two clinics at Downe Hospital on Friday afternoon.The impact was widespread for patients as day case surgery, ENT and gynaecology at Lagan Valley Hospital was cancelled along with the closure of the Medical Day Case Unit, Dermatology Laser Unit, Cath Lab and Ambulatory Hubs at the Ulster Hospital.The South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust said that that all affected patients had been contacted and would be rescheduled for appointments at a future date.Staff from the Downshire Hospital were strengthened by colleagues from the nearby Downe, who joined the picket.Unison members who work in the transport and domiciliary care went out on strike from am- noon while the rest of the workers came out from pm-pm.South Down MP Chris Hazzard and SDLP election candidate Michael Savage showed their support as did SDLP MLA Colin McGrath and Downpatrick councillors Oonagh Hanlon and John Trainor.Unison branch secretary Marian Ritchie called on all the elected representatives present to give members more than a show of support.She told cheering strikers: ldquoWe want every politician here now to give a commitment to say, as iniduals and as a group, that every single one of the the health service staff will get a pay rise and pay parity.The call was met with shouts of ldquoGet back to work by the strikers.Ms Ritchie also told her colleagues: ldquoThe Permanent Secretary says that he has the money but not the authority and the only ones that have the authority are the politicians.

McIlhone won the ball off a Ballynagross defender and without even looking up let one fly from  yards out.Goalkeeper Ross Preece was stranded in no manrsquos land and his despairing outstretched attempt to tip the ball over the crossbar failed as the ball nestled in the back of the net.Two minutes later, man of the match Ross Armstrong made it -. He chased a lost cause of a ball into the box where Marron and Preece were favourites to win the race, but Armstrongrsquos sheer desire helped to get him to the ball first and he was able to dink it into an empty net.With  minutes gone Armstrong pounced again to make it - after McIlhone had carved out the opening.Killough continued to bombard Ballynagross with everything and anything, but Ballynagross bravely weathered the storm and gradually started to create chances of their own.With  minutes gone they patiently worked an opening for Ryan McKinney, but he was denied a goal when the impressive Sean Og Burns got back to hack the ball off the line.That was as good as it got for Ballynagross as Killough made it - three minutes later. Gareth George picked the ball up from a Ben McLaughlin throw and immediately set off on one of his trademark, penetrating runs.George had only one thing on his mind after leaving three players for dead and his unerring finish into the bottom corner had Preece clutching at thin air.Six minutes later it was - when Armstrong headed a free back across the box and McIlhone had all the time in the world to send Killough into delirium.With  minutes gone a delightful cross from Adam George was met perfectly by Armstrong and the big striker powered an unstoppable header to the net to make it -.Some of Killoughrsquos play in the first half was breathtaking and few teams could have lived with them and as the players trooped off at half-time, everyone feared for Ballynagross.However, the break gave Campbell the chance to reorganise his troops and the were a dferent proposition in the second half.Marron pulled one back from the spot after Sean Og Burns took down Philip Doran in the box, but despite creating several other chances, that was it for Ballynagross.Eoin Rooney and Conor McCarron had shots well saved by Killough lsquokeeper Eddie Hinc, while Liam Graham headed over at the other end and Preece saved from Gareth George.Killough were a pale shadow of the side that lit up Binnian Park in the first  minutes, but they can be forgiven for taking their foot off the pedal after taking a - lead.Ballynagross can only reflect on what might have been, had they been able to field at full strength, but football can be a cruel game as they found out on Friday night.Killough: Eddie Hinc, Matthew Burns, Ben McLaughlin, Colm Stranney, Sean Og Burns, Matt McKiernan, Gareth George, Adam George, Tony McIlhone, Ross Armstrong, Riain Burns: Subs: Liam Graham, Seamas Tumelty, Ryan McIlhone, Robbie Hagan, Ruairi Sharvin.Ballynagross: Ross Preece, Deaglan Craig, Tom McNeill, Aaron Beattie, Conor Marron, Conor McCarron, Karl Johnston, Mark Magill, Daniel Taggart, Declan Dowie, Ryan McKinney.

Over the past year, the level of recycled waste has increased by %.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran hopes the work to provide mains power to the new Flying Horse Road facility is completed as soon as possible.ldquoI do not know why there is no mains power but it is a little embarrassing that the CCTV cameras at a poundm centre cannot be operated and we have had to hire in a private security firm, he said.ldquoThis represents an additional cost to already hard-pressed ratepayers and I hope that we are talking about days, not weeks, for the mains power to be supplied. It is an issue council officers need to be on top of.Cllr Curran said that many people were keen to see the new centre opened, given that its predecessor at nearby Cloonagh Road was struggling to cope with the huge demand being placed upon it.He continued: ldquoIt is great to have such a modern recycling facility on our doorstep to meet the needs of people who are clearly recycling their waste in increasing numbers. The new centre is being well used and the council deserves credit for this major investment but, in my opinion, the mains power issue should have been sorted before it opened for business.Cllr Curran said that given the increased emphasis on recycling, the council is behind innovative plans to allow groups and charities across the district to reuse ious items dumped at household recycling centres in Downpatrick, Castlewellan and Ballynahinch.He added: ldquoA number of groups have expressed an interest in taking part and I have no doubt that this scheme will be a success with ious items destined for the scrapheap given a new lease of le.A council spokeswoman confirmed that the recycling centre was operating without mains power.ldquoIt has taken longer than anticipated to connect the mains power supply at the new site, said the spokeswoman.ldquoAs a temporary measure, a generator and security firm are being used to cover requirements. Newry, Mourne and Down Council is working to have the mains power installed as soon as possible.The Recorder asked the local authority how much it is paying the security firm to police the new civic amenity site outside its normal operating hours but was not provided with an answer..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th December 2019 Leitrim.jpg","title":"Sr Bartholomew’s centenary celebrations  ","story":"THE family of a Leitrim nun, who has lived in Africa for  years, flew thousands of miles to help her celebrate her  birthday.Sr Mary Bartholomew was joined by five nieces, including Dympna Kelly and Eileen Ramsey from her home village, who arrived in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, to mark her milestone birthday last week.Another niece, Mary McAleenan, from Slievnaboley, near Leitrim, who wasnrsquot able to make the journey, says her aunt had been on an adventure since she left home in  on board the Warwick Castle to care for ldquothe poorest of the poor amid the soaring heat of South Africa.Sr Bartholmew, was born Philomena Cunningham on December , , and enjoyed growing up with her four sisters and three brothers on what is now known as Kilnhill Road in Leitrim.She and her older sister, Mary Bernadette, who also became a nun, were among the first girls to play camogie in Leitrim before an official team had even been set up by the local Fontenoys GAA club.She was educated at Sacred Heart Grammar School in Newry and with her heart set on a religious vocation she entered the Assumption Convent in Ballynahinch just as World War II began.Her niece, Mary, said that being a nun in those days brought honour to a family and having two daughters as nuns set the Cunninghams apart within their small rural village.ldquoThere were nine other postulants accompanying Sr Bartholomew on the long voyage across to Africa. Her ship was the last passenger ship to sail to the continent for many years, as most ships were then commissioned for the war effort, Mary explained.The young nun swapped the green fields and rain of home for the blistering heat and bustle of Grahamstown in the Eastern Cape, which must have been quite an experience.She completed her religious formation and academic teacher training before taking her vows in . Over the following decades she taught in several schools. Eventually, on retiring, she was assigned a new mission, opening a clinic and a pre-school within an encampment that catered for over , refugees fleeing the horrors of the Mozambique war.In Sr Bartholomewrsquos own words of this period in her le, recorded in a book written over  years ago, Drumgooland ndash A Parish Divided, she recalls: ldquoWith missionary zeal we did our utmost over the following years to render whatever assistance we could to the many thousands of refugees, I taught including adults.ldquoThese poor people had a minimum of education and were eager to learn English. After class we would sit around and read the bible in Shangaan, the local language, and gave help when it was needed.Niece Mary takes up the story again. She added: ldquoNuns donrsquot retire and while Sr Bartholomew found the intense heat too much after several years, she made for the cooler environment of an office and spent time in general admin.Sr Bartholomew would often make the trip back home to Leitrim after Vatican II came to pass when the rigours and discipline of a pious le became more relaxed in the s. However, she was always looked forward to going back to Port Elizabeth.Her last trip home was some years ago when her older sister, Eileen, was seriously ill.ldquoShe had managed to hold her hand and chat briefly before she passed away, Mary recalled. She stayed until Eileenrsquos months mind,and left shortly after.

Alliances Stephen Farry, pictured with party leader Naomi Long, stunned the DUP by taking North DownIn past elections unionist parties – and most recently the DUP – have talked up the constitutional threat for their own advantage. No longer.Now the future of the United Kingdom is imperilled from myriad directions – and some of those are entirely beyond Northern Irish unionists’ control..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button The decisive national outcome of the general election leaves the DUP with no leverage at Westminster. As a consequence, it now faces a rapid move towards an Irish Sea trade border.Having backed Brexit as something which would improve things, the DUP now finds that for which it dreamt and campaigned threatening to unravel the Union itself.Brexit itself and the DUP’s support not only for leaving the EU, but for a harder form of Brexit, was a key factor in the de facto nationalist and Green Party pacts in North Belfast and South Belfast which cost it two seats.The loss in North Belfast of Nigel Dodds, the party’s Westminster leader and one of unionism’s elder statesmen, is devastating.On Thursday night as it became clear that his seat was in jeopardy, one DUP member sent me a message saying: “We could lose anyone but him.”Few people across the DUP’s disparate and frequently warring factions would disagree with that sentiment.Not only is he a strategic asset to the DUP and a respected figure at Westminster in a way that some of his DUP colleagues are not, but his defeat speaks to a profound psychological problem for unionism.This seat, once held by the father of Ulster Unionism, Edward Carson, has never been held by a nationalist before – still less by a republican.As such, Mr Dodds’ defeat represents an old certainty which now is slipping away from unionism.Joint committee of Irish Parliament engages in nationalist groupthink over the de Souza citizenship case Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"And as the latest in a line of once impregnable unionist seats which have been lost by unionism, the result is evocative of a wider sense that not only control of Northern Ireland – but potentially Northern Ireland itself – is slipping away.There is no inevitability that a united Ireland is coming. Just four years ago, prior to Brexit and the collapse of Stormont, polls pointed to Northern Ireland being more constitutionally secure than at any point since its creation in .And even in this election, where unionism has suffered a grievous blow, Sinn Fein’s vote has fallen further than that of the DUP.The rise of the Alliance Party, astonishingly in this election the third largest party, is no guarantee of support for Irish unity.But it is a clear rejection of what has seemed like an archaic form of unionism whose biggest idea often seems to be to circle the wagons with an electoral pact when seats come under pressure.Yesterday the man who is seen by some DUP members as the great hope of unionism said something which appeared to misunderstand the core problem.Asked on Good Morning Ulster about the psychological damage of the result for unionism, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson referred to “the splintering of the unionist vote, for example, in places like North Down” and said that unionists wanted unity.It is a measure of how far unionism has fallen that a sentence like that can be uttered without drawing gasps.North Down is one of the safest unionist seats in Northern Ireland. Less than a decade ago, unionists won % of the votes there.If a unionist pact is required to stop it being lost, that is a pitul reflection on the state of the DUP and UUP.The logic of suggesting a pact in North Down is that there is almost no winnable seat which the UUP should contest without a pact.But while that would suit the DUP’s short-term interests – and perhaps even those of the UUPit gained a seat as a result – the evidence suggests that pacts are one of the reasons that Alliance is surging.Facing a developing fire, a move towards widespread unionist unity could act as an accelerant.Unlike nationalism, where Sinn Fein has – despite its major victory in North Belfast – had a poor election but has seen votes largely slip from it to the SDLP, this election has confirmed the complete dominance of the DUP within unionism.With that dominance comes responsibility when unionism falters.Will Arlene Foster accept that she is either accountable or responsible for any of this crisis  Or will she blame everyone but herself History suggests the latter, despite the fact that DUP members privately say that many voters expressed their unhappiness at Mrs Foster during canvassing.For a party renowned for its bare-toothed ruthlessness, the DUP has been remarkably understanding of the failures on Mrs Foster’s watch.There was an abortive putsch after she led unionism to the first loss of its Stormont majority in the history of Northern Ireland.Those who quietly muttered about challenging her then but chose not to do so must now wonderthey could have helped prevent this catastrophe for unionism.Unionism now lacks a strong leader at the point where it needs one most.Loyalists – including paramilitaries – poured into political activism their efforts at rejecting Boris Johnson’s Irish Sea border. Now that strategy has failed, where do they go Some, based on the recent meeting in Portadown from which my colleague Ben Lowry reported, will be arguing for street protests,not outright violence.Even setting aside moral considerations, past loyalist violence has been strategically disastrous and the street disorder during the flag protests actually boosted Alliance’s vote.Unionism stands weary at another crossroads. But unlike the choice between Terence O’Neill’s moderation and the full-throated unionism of Paisleyism  years ago, this time the possibility of a vote for Irish unity is more real than many then could conceive.And this time there is a sense of unionism lacking a single leader with the ability and ideological purpose to even lead unionist opinion – let alone those now deserting unionism.try catch  TrendingNI snow now due to arrive earlier than originally thought -

It boasts a unique approach to teaching vocational skills, as well as academic and sports facilities.In particular, one alleyway on the school site had seen sheds transformed into small businesses, which the pupils ran - earning qualications and gathering valuable work experience, with staff and students hoping to open it up to the public soon.ldquoItrsquos a bit like Diagon Alley, isnrsquot it  said Ms Wood. Here the school hosts its own bike repair shop, in the form of Spokes, a cafe, its own radio station - The Voice - and plans for a zero-waste food shop are well under way.Robin Hackett, head of KS, showed me around some of the buildings.ldquoThe cafe opened to our students around July time, and was fully operational and officially in September, for the new academic year, he said.ldquoIt opened at the same time as our radio station, with money generously donated from the Postcode Community Trust.ldquoNext on the agenda is our plan to open a fully zero-waste food shop. Wersquove been having talks with other similar shops around Cardf and here in Penarth, like Foxyrsquos, about how to do it.ldquoThe idea is that, because wersquore a residential school, it will give our pupils a place to shop for things like cereal, fruit, biscuits and so on without plastic wrappers or other waste.ldquoOur initial, short-term plan is to reduce our own, internal impact on the environment, butwe can get it up and running to the extent we want, we may as well open it to the local community. Imagine - popping over to the school, grab a tea or a coffee, do your food shop and get your bike serviced, all by our pupils.The pupils I spoke to were enthusiastic about opening their school to the community, and plenty of them had applied for shts in the shop and cafe.One proudly told me he had secured shts in the cafe, and while we peered through the window into the future site of the zero-waste shop, he made sure I noticed the poster for the Lego club. He was the president of it.ldquoWersquore hoping to open the shop in January, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore just waiting on the builders now.ldquoA lot of kids here struggle in academic settings, so this is all building good skills for the future. Our philosophy is, one percent change at a time adds up to a lot.We moved across the alleyway to the schoolrsquos music room.It was well-stocked with plenty of high-tech equipment, from first-class ampliers to cutting-edge keyboards. Excitingly, the school also has a state-of-the-art soundbooth on the way from Germany.ldquoWersquore looking to rent it out to local bands and others as a rehearsal and recording space, once wersquove built it up to the second floor, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore investing in better equipment, and wersquoll be holding radio production workshops with the local primaries, like Victoria Road.The school doesnrsquot just offer vocational opportunities, either.ldquoRecently a lot of pupils went to Belgium, to Ypres, said principal Matthew Burns. ldquoThe best part is they cycled most of the way there!ldquoOver five days, they would cycle a huge distance, and then ride a coach or the Eurostar partway. That way, they got all the way to Ypres, to hear the Last Post and lay a wreath.ldquoWe also put a lot of emphasis on sport, with a state of the art Astroturf we rent out to the community, and a great football team - we recently attended a tournament at Heronsbridge and only narrowly lost to the overall winners.ldquoOutside of that, our KS group are putting together a foodbox raiser for Christmas for those in need, and wersquove just had our drama and music department invited to put on a production for the Senedd.With IT suites, science labs and gymnasiums, this barely scratched the surface of what the school had to offer. Itrsquos no surprise the school has been so successful, with such close attention from its staff. As a school focussing on children with learning dficulties, the pupil number is kept low, with around  pupils attending at any one time. The largest class has eight pupils, with most having fewer.ldquoWe have around  day pupils and  at the moment in residential, staying in one of our four homes on and off the site, said Ms Wood. ldquoFor those children, we offer a  week-a-year provision.ldquoThe houses are lovely - we really want it to feel like their own home, their own bedroom, with their belongings.ldquoIt forms part of our relational approach - how we talk to our children and how we talk to each other. If we have a new pupil arrive here, the first thing to focus on is building a positive relationship with them.ldquoThe conversations are all about recognising whatrsquos going on and supporting them, in their own time.Judging by the smiles on the faces of staff and students alike, itrsquos an approach to be emulated the world over. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This is not unique to Wales but an issue across the UK.Itrsquos important we act to ensure that our health service is sustainable in the long term.Recent figures show excellent progress has been made again this year.I increased the number of GP training places from  to  this year.However we actually filled  places.This is an increase of  per cent on last year and is great news for us locally.In order to ensure that we can recruit the medical workforce our health service needs now and in the future we also need to look outside Wales. That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief.

That can only mean one thing – the dreaded hangover.We’ve all been there, right  That last round of tequila shots sounded like a mighty fine idea, but now it’s the morning after the night before and you are paying for it – with interest.Your head is pounding, your stomach is queasy, and it feels like something small and furry crawled into your mouth overnight and died there.Granted, the damage has well and truly been done – but what can you do about it now  How do you cure that hangover  Heck, can you even cure a hangover Well, that depends on who you ask. There’s a host of weird and wonderful hangover cure claims floating around, but the old saying ‘horses for courses’ applies here. That is to say, what works for one person may not do a thing for another.At the risk of stating the obvious, the best way to avoid a hangover is to drink less alcohol. Or none at all.It’s also a very good idea to eat a decent meal before heading out, and alternating between an alcoholic beverage and a hydrating glass of water can lessen the effects of a hangover.Assuming, though, that all that sage advice went out of the window last night, here’s six hangover cures to try.A hearty bowl of soupOkay, so this is only a good ideayou can still stand straight, but Austrians swear by this method.When you’ve had a skinful of booze, grab a big bowl of goulash soup before heading to bed.It will prevent the alcohol soaking further into your bloodstream, and is always a better idea than that kebab you were craving at am.Eat a protein breakfastDr Andrew Irvine, who published How To Cure A Hangover, suggests a simple breakfast.“Protein, in the form of eggs, will help your hypoglycaemia , as will porridge,” he says. “The headache should ease once the blood sugar level has been corrected, then take some soluble paracetamol.”BeroccaThe Aussies, it’s fair to say, seem know a thing or two about drinking.After one too many tinnies, simply drop a tablet of this over-the-counter, nutrient-packed tablet in a glass of water.Works bestyou do the same before drinking. It may not completely cure your hangover, but it’s a refreshing pick-me-up that’s packed with vitamins.ParacetamolDissolve a soluble paracetamol tablet in a glass of water and not only will it go a long way towards curing that throbbing headache, but it will provide rehydration, which is all important. Unlike Ibuprofen it won’t irritate the stomach.Be warned, though: too much paracetamol is toxic to the liver – and it has probably taken enough of a pounding as it is. and cure your hangover\" data-s-urlclick\" news -ways-try-and-cure-your-hangover-\" data-s-el\"in article - bottom\" aria-label\"Share by email\" data-param-subject\" ways toand cure your hangover\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-fixed i-amphtml-layout-size-defined\" style\"width:pxheight:px\" i-amphtml-layout\"fixed\"\" and cure your hangover\" data-s-urlclick\" news -ways-try-and-cure-your-hangover-\" data-s-el\"in article - bottom\" aria-label\"Share to Facebook\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-fixed i-amphtml-layout-size-defined\" style\"width:pxheight:px\" i-amphtml-layout\"fixed\" and cure your hangover\" data-s-urlclick\" news -ways-try-and-cure-your-hangover-\" data-s-el\"in article - bottom\" aria-label\"Share to Twitter\" data-param-text\" ways toand cure your hangover\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-fixed i-amphtml-layout-size-defined\" style\"width:pxheight:px\" i-amphtml-layout\"fixed\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful linksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bMVAic sc-bAeIUo dEhRfb\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":null,"title":"these are foods you shouldnt feed your dog christmas ","story":"Donaldson wants Stormont You could be owed a Cold Weather Payment thanks to the dip in temperatures - how to checkyou’re eligibleNewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSportFootballOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleCarsHomes and GardensNewsPeopleThe ethanol in alcohol can hit an animals bloodstream faster than humans.

Ulster Business sat down for a chat with chief executive Kevin Kingston and his new deputy CEOs “The three of us make a very good team,” Danske Bank chief executive Kevin Kingston says, warmly, over an early morning coffee at Panama Cafe, close to its Belfast headquarters.The bank boss was speaking of the appointment of his colleagues, Vicky Davies and Stephen Matchett, to the role of joint deputy chief executives .It’s a bold move, and Danske is the only bank in Northern Ireland which boasts the senior roles. The pair have already helped shape the burgeoning performance of Danske Bank in their respective roles over the last few years, and will continue to do so alongside their new additional responsibilities.“We are the biggest bank in Northern Ireland and we play a crucial role in fuelling the economy in Northern Ireland – at a time of increased economic and political uncertainty it seems like the right thing to do, to be investing in our management structures,” Kevin tells Ulster Business.“We want to make sure that whatever the opportunities and challenges that NI and the bank may face in the next year or so, that we have the capacity to do what we need to do to continue to support our customers.”It’s been another busy year for Danske Bank. It posted an operating profit of £.m in the first six months of , up % year-on-year.“Vicky and Stephen have been instrumental in the progress we have made over the last few years. Vicky in terms of her strategic insight and support to me in terms of our organisational development, and Stephen in terms of his commercial and financial insights,” Kevin says.“The three of us make a very good team. We play to each other’s strengths. A lot of the progress we have made in the last few years is down to, in no small part, these two people sitting beside me.”Vicky is managing director of strategy and corporate development within the bank, while Stephen has been Danske’s chief financial officer for the last five years.For Kevin, the two new deputy chief executive roles comes at a key time of increased uncertainty around Brexit, and the future economic landscape – so creating the front-facing positions will help develop and grow engagement with customers and a large range of stakeholders.“We will continue to support Northern Ireland, as we have done for the last  years – it’s a role we must fulfil, especially in the event that the economy is more challenging in the months ahead.”Kevin says the bank is putting a renewed and sharp focus on helping and supporting customers in the event of a dficult economic environment, post-Brexit.And aside from the business metrics, Danske Bank was also named as Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community. That’s something which Kevin and his team place considerable pride and value in.“The thing I’m most proud of is the work we have done to be named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community,” Kevin says.“We want the bank to be a force for good in the community. We are serious about that and we have four strategic pillars around our customers, stakeholders, society and our colleagues.” For Kevin, it’s about getting behind initiatives and “creating a legacy”. PROFILE: VICKY DAVIES Vicky Davies has settled in to her deputy chief executive role quickly – representing Danske Bank at the single largest delegation of Northern Ireland businesses to take their message to the heart of Westminster this summer.“The new deputy chief executive roles are a sign of the commitment the bank has to Northern Ireland,” Vicky says. “It’s a reflection of that and an outwards statement of intent to our customers and competitors. It’s also an opportunity for Stephen and I to expand our remits and our contribution to the bank.”A Cambridge University graduate, Vicky joined Danske Bank from Ulster Bank in  as Head of Business Development, before progressing to become managing director of strategy and corporate development. In  she became the bank’s first ever female executive board member.“My current core role is to devise and guide the strategy of the bank, plotting the course of its development over not just the next year, but the next five years and beyond” she said.With the new role that will also include spending more time with customers, industry bodies, and putting a face to the name amongst key stakeholders, as well as a sharpened internal focus – for example getting closer to the risk management aspects of the bank.Vicky and her fellow deputy chief executive Stephen Matchett have already been undertaking important executive roles, but the new posts will bring their roles and responsibilities to the fore.For years Vicky has been heavily involved in the burgeoning digital end of the bank, being close to the introduction of a number of mobile s and channels. On this, she says, “In the digital space, this year we have seen more than four million digital logons from customers each month and a % increase in digital transactions year-on-year.”Then there’s the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub on the ground floor of Danske HQ – a modern incubator and hub which in the space of little over a year now boasts around  members.“We wanted to help these businesses and also benefit from having their entrepreneurial spirit to rub off on our own colleagues,” she says. Vicky personally mentors some of these companies, hands on.She also chairs numerous committees within the bank and has a strong interest in its equality, ersity and inclusion agenda – having formed Danske’s Gender Diversity Network in .Vicky lives in Holywood with husband Bill and four young sons. On Brexit, she’s optimistic, given the strength of the bank’s position heading into the UK’s exit from the EU. “We hope there will be a good outcome. We are leading our competitors on a number of metrics, and that gives us a great springboard going forward.” PROFILE: STEPHEN MATCHETT Danske Bank’s other new deputy chief executive, Stephen Matchett, has held his core role as chief financial officerfor the last five years, and is a familiar face to journalists when it comes to discussing the minutiae of its results each year.“Danske Bank’s role in society is key, and we have an integral role in the economy here. The new leadership positions will see Vicky and I become more present and visible when it comes to customers, stakeholders and partners across the community” he says.A former Bank of Ireland executive, who began his career working for professional services giants PwC and Deloitte, at Danske Bank Stephen oversees a finance unit that also includes the treasury, economics, data intelligence and legal departments.Like Vicky, Stephen is also involved in leading in the Bank’s equality, ersity and inclusion agenda, and he is the senior management sponsor of ‘Enable’ – the Danske Disability Network.“My core role as CFO is traditionally slightly in the background – the changes now bring a public aspect to that, both within the wider Danske Bank Group and Northern Ireland.”It’s been a busy year for Stephen, and the rest of the bank, including being named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community.The Bank has also placed a renewed focus on its environmental impact and climate change. It’s already removed plastic cups, bottles and other packaging from its buildings, and is opting for more renewable and recyclable alternatives throughout its ious operations.Stephen, who lives in Belfast with his we Carrie and two young sons, is also a member of the CBI’s UK Financial Services Council.The Financial Services Council is made up of senior representatives from a erse range of financial services organisations and insurers, including Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Santander, Aviva, MasterCard Europe and RSA Insurance Group.Looking at Danske Bank’s most recent financials, Stephen says while it remains an uncertain economic climate, Danske Bank is continuing to grow, year-on-year.And on Brexit, he says the Bank is preparing and planning by looking through two lenses – a focus on controlling costs, while also seeking out growth opportunities.“We want to maintain where we are at through this period of uncertainty and prepare ourselves for when the clouds clear – that’s the ambition.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/con211.jpg","title":"connaire mcgreevy brewing a burgeoning m business","story":"Posted on Monday December  by Ulster Business In the last  years Co Down man Connaire McGreevy has built his facilities management business CTS Projects into a £m firm, started a brewery, bought a bar and chaired a football club. He speaks to John Mulgrew about further growth, holding back on GB expansion due to Brexit, and why staying in the EU is the best deal we have “It’s good for the environment, businesses and people,” Connaire McGreevy tells me.He’s speaking of course about EU membership, and he’s one of Northern Ireland’s business leaders not concerned with remaining partisan on the matter, as we head into a Christmas General Election and sit with a deal on the table which would likely lead to increased costs and bureaucracy between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Connaire founded CTS Projects back in , and has developed it into a erse facilities management business, recently expanding further into the Republic – giving him reach from Donegal to Waterford, and “everything in between”.“We are an all-island facilities management company with signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland,” he told Ulster Business.“It has had signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland. We made moves after the Brexit referendum – we needed to ersy with a subsidiary.“There has been signicant growth in the Republic of Ireland, with % year-on-year. In business, it’s easy to grow from a base of nothing so we will see that normalise.”CTS began le refurbishing rundown properties, such as old social housing stock, to get them prepared to accept new tenants. That then grew and developed to include a focus on renewable heating, such as biomass boilers and solar  – focusing on energy efficiency. Around % of its work is with public sector clients, and the remainder with private companies.Those private sector clients include private office schemes in Belfast, looking after all of the main facilities management. CTS has grown into a -strong full-time workforce, with around  additional full-time sub-contractors also working for the business. And it’s on track to hit £m turnover this year.But CTS, like many other firms, has actively held back investing in new operations in GB, until there is a clear Brexit outcome.“Unfortunately we have noticed NI business opportunities have started to stagnate or decline,” he said. “A lack of an Assembly is having an impact on public sector– core maintenance, as opposed to new infrastructure development,” he says. “With private, there has been a downturn.”But he says since the summer “people seem to have found a new sense of confidence”. He says some of those who were holding back post-referendum appear to have now pushed forward with some investment.Speaking about which areas the company has grown in to, he said it has developed further into a more erse building management business.“We also expanded into fire and security in  – areas such as fire extinguishers, alarms and . We have found that energy efficiency and the environmentalis coming to the fore.” That includes areas such as battery energy storage and solar  for homes.“We have a lot of public sector clients in housing, education and healthcare. We have had local government in the past, and are actively targeting that area with new innovation.”Connaire’s own interest in decent beer drew out his entrepreneurship five years ago when he set up Mourne Mountains Brewery in Warrenpoint. On a separate note, he’s also the current chairman of Warrenpoint Town FC.“ was a passion turned into a business,” he says. “It’s exciting stuff, in terms of creating beer and marking five years. It’s still in its infancy and has been impacted by a mushroom of craft breweries.“I am still optimistic in the market, but I don’t see it growing as fast anymore. Looking at the market across the island, some may close their doors. The scale might not be there, and there are lots of larger breweries and imported beers – the consumer has so much choice. People know what they are looking for.”An opportunity also came knocking recently which saw Connaire taking on a bar in Warrenpoint, the Ye Old Ship Inn, which he says has a very personal connection.Connaire’s sister Ciara, who worked with him in CTS Projects and was a former gaelic footballer, passed away suddenly in . Connaire says she had worked in bars over the years, and the idea of taking one on was a conversation which they had.“There is vertical integration with the bar, as it’s an outlet there for us, with pop-up bars with the brewery.”But he, like many others in the brewing and distilling industry, says Northern Ireland’s licensing laws “are in the dark ages”. The main concern is that beer producers cannot sell their products to the public during a tour of the brewery, and require a drinks licence to do so.“We have a number of tourists who arrive at the doors, asking about tours and beer… it’s embarrassing for Northern Ireland. We don’t have the legislation in place. I am passionate about tourism in the area, and we have tourism projects in the mix.”With Brexit, Connaire believes the current deal from Prime Minister Boris Johnson would create a ergence down the Irish Sea, making all-island business a more attractive and palatable affair for companies here.“It’s an administrative border – paperwork, time and a cost to business,” he says. “Our plans would be going into GB to set up new company, with a small acquisition and some back office administration support. “All-island, under the deal it looks like we can have easy access, which is welcome. It’s so connected and any ergence is going to have an impact.”He said that could have an impact on foreign direct investmentas companies from outside the UK and Ireland. And Connaire says there is still no clarity of what a potential deal with the EU could look like on the outside.“It’s a waypoint in that journey and we have to be very cautious,” he said. “I personally feel we get the best deal possible being in the EU. Looking across the world, there are now trading blocs everywhere.“At this stage, in business circles, a lot of people are holding back investment to see what the trading environment is like. It’s the most uncertain period in my business journey.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20191106_8525_web.jpg","title":"leading from the front kpmgs johnny hanna","story":"Posted on Wednesday December  by Ulster Business Fresh from a three month sabbatical travelling with his family, KPMG’s new partner in charge, Johnny Hanna, sits down with Ulster Business to discuss growing an already-strong local professional services firm with global reach, developing the next generation and what’s needed to set Northern Ireland apart on the world stage Johnny Hanna’s new role as partner in charge at KPMG in Northern Ireland sees him take the helm of an organisation already in a strong position, but also one which is very much in growth mode.And with more than  years under his belt working across KPMG, he’s now been tasked with taking the next leap forward – building on its strong client base, tackling the new business landscape which lies around the corner, and growing the next generation of top talent.While a global firm, KPMG works with a host of Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes – having le-long relationships with indigenous success stories such as First Derivatives and Norbrook – while also working with global businesses with connections to the UK and Ireland.TALENTKPMG now boasts a Belfast workforce of nearly  staff. But as the intake of top new graduates and experienced hires grows, that number looks set to expand and develop further still. Johnny’s confident that the company will continue to grow at its offices at the Soloist building in Belfast city centre. He points to the benefits for KPMG staff of signicant collaboration and shared working opportunities with Dublin as part a successful all-island business now employing over  people. The firm’s Corporate Finance team, for example, led by Russell Smyth are the go-to advisors in the renewables sector when it comes to fundraising for new assets north and south.“It’s an exciting time for the firm,” Johnny says. “We have done a lot in the last few years, working with many new clients, investing in our new office and increasing our graduate numbers. In addition there has been a record number of promotions. I’ve been working closely with our previous partner in charge John Hansen on all of that as well as continuing to grow and drive our large tax team, an area of expertise which we’ve always been renowned for.“My focus will be about maintaining this momentum and ensuring we continue to offer the expertise and solutions which our clients need, which will drive our growth. That means being alive to changing trading conditions, increased regulation and a business environment increasingly uncertain, disruptive and complex”.A law graduate from Queen’s University Belfast, Johnny’s also a fellow of Chartered Accountants Ireland, and a Chartered Tax Adviser– starting his career in Dublin with the former Arthur Andersen, which was later merged with KPMG.The Newry man became a partner with KPMG in  and has been head of tax in Northern Ireland since . The tax practice boasts around  tax professionals, most of which are dual qualied in tax and accountancy. “It’s a key dferentiator for us,” he says.“And while tax and audit represent the more traditional strands of business, KPMG has invested signicantly in new skills, specialisms and services arising from technological advances such as articical intelligence and cyber-security.”Johnny takes over his role at a time when Northern Ireland, along with the rest of the UK and Ireland, is undergoing arguably its biggest business and economic sht in a generation.“Brexit is just one part of it. We have been working closely with companies to prepare for Brexit, whether there is a ‘no deal’ or some sort of deal here.“We have had a lot of engagement with business groups and other stakeholders over the last three years to highlight our concerns and those of our clients. Wherever we end up on Brexit will definitely dictate the future trading conditions. Our role will be to help clients navigate their way around any new barriers they could face, as well as examining the potential opportunities which may arise from the UK’s exit from the EU.” ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Attracting foreign direct investmentis something which cannot be ignored here, and a dferentiator for Northern Ireland could help bolster that – whether it’s a deal which moulds Northern Ireland as a unique business destination in the UK and Ireland, finally introducing a lower devolved rate of corporation tax or ideally a package of measures.“Not long after I took over the head of Tax role in  we co-hosted a breakfast in our KPMG New York office with ious international businesses. At that time there was a lot of talk around the reduced corporation tax rate. There was a lot of positivity and enthusiasm in the room that morning around the opportunity for Northern Ireland, and I’m looking forward to getting back to those types of discussions.“Northern Ireland requires a range of tools to help drive economic success in the post-Brexit era. It’s investment in infrastructure and skills, initiatives on export-led growth, delivering a .% tax rate and some sort of devolution of income tax powers – we need step change initiatives which can really turbocharge the private sector.”COMMUNITYGetting the right talent is also key for KPMG, building and developing a workforce which is increasingly erse, as well as giving back to the community. That includes a range of initiatives, including the recent launch of a skills-based scheme which has seen KPMG staff volunteering to help children, from a wide iety of backgrounds, with their literacy and numeracy skills.“Our graduates want to do more than get their qualications and service clients. They want to know that what they are doing has a broader purpose and objective. They want to know about our commitment to the local community and on environmental issues and be proud to work for KPMG”.  “We are ambitious to keep growing the practice and have a fantastic pool of talent in Belfast at all levels to help us realise those ambitions.“Ensuring we maintain the right culture within the firm for our people to reach their full potential and achieve their career aspirations is incredibly important. I was delighted we were able to add to our already strong team with the recent addition of four new partners in Ashleen Feeney, Paddy Doherty, Neil O’Hare and Dominic Mudge within our Deal Advisory, Tax and Audit teams.  “My role is to ensure that when I hand over to the next partner in charge, we are in an even stronger position than we are today. That’s the challenge and the goal but given the strong team and our market position, I know that I will relish the opportunity”.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
