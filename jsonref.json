From next week, people will be advised to exercise their own judgment on the use of masks in schools, shops and on public transport. The use of masks will only be required in healthcare settings. The decision follows a recommendation from the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet).  Social distancing measures will also be lifted on schools and childcare settings, bringing an end to pods and staggered breaks, while testing and tracing will be scaled back.On Monday the government announced its “living with Covid” strategy, including a phasing-out of free access to rapid lateral flow tests, reduced access to the more accurate PCR tests for most of those with symptoms, an end to legal requirements to self-isolate and an end to financial support for those on low incomes needing to self-isolate. Announcing the changes, which will come into force on Thursday, Boris Johnson said the time to “compel” people was over. Now “people will be asked to exercise personal responsibility” to look after each other, he said. Supporters of relaxing the measures have often appealed to inidual responsibility – whether that’s to voluntarily self-isolate if positive, or to assess our own appetite for risk and behave accordingly. But this misses the point: there is a limit to what the inidual can do with a highly infectious disease. Many might choose to isolate if positive, but that relies on knowing you are positive in the first place, on being able to resist pressure from employers to go in to work, and on being able to afford to stay home (both financially and practically). All three aspects will become much more difficult from now on, and will necessarily put others at risk. The recommendation adopted today by EU governments means people from outside the bloc will be able to enter if they have been vaccinated with shots not approved in the EU. The EU has so far authorised vaccines produced by PfizerBioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca (when produced in Europe), Johnson \u0026amp Johnson and Novavax.  In addition to these shots, the WHO has also approved the vaccines produced by Chinese makers Sinopharm and Sinovac and by Indian company Bharat Biotech. It has also authorised the AstraZeneca vaccine made in India by the Serum Institute. The taoiseach, Micheal Martin, tánaiste, Leo Varadkar, and Green party leader, Eamon Ryan, agreed to lift the remaining restrictions at a cabinet meeting this morning. From next week, people will be advised to exercise their own judgment on the use of masks in schools, shops and on public transport. The use of masks will only be required in healthcare settings. The decision follows a recommendation from the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet).  Social distancing measures will also be lifted on schools and childcare settings, bringing an end to pods and staggered breaks, while testing and tracing will be scaled back.The tests will be spread out over a number of data with residents also having to take multiple rapid antigen tests every day at home in between, she said.  The city’s leader confirmed that officials in mainland China were now coordinating the response to the territory’s worst outbreak as she admitted that local authorities had failed to stamp out the current surge. The head of Beijing’s Liaison Office, Xi Baolong, was coordinating the mainland’s response from the border city of Shenzhen, she added. Schools, gyms, bars and beauty salons will remain closed into late April, while flights from nine countries, including the UK and US, will remain banned. A message on the government testing portal states:  The number of free tests available each day will be capped to “manage demand” as the government scales back free testing for people in England. People could previously order a new pack of tests every 24 hours, but now they are available only every three days. It comes after Boris Johnson said free mass testing would end from 1 April and be limited to the most vulnerable, as part of his government’s “living with Covid” plan.  The public has been encouraged not to stockpile test packs but since the changes were announced the system has been overwhelmed with people trying to order tests. The UK Health Security Agency said that test availability was refreshed regularly so people were encouraged to revisit the site every few hours as more would become available.Charities warned last week that many of the city’s 370,000 foreign domestic workers – the vast majority women from the Philippines and Indonesia – were being “abandoned” in the current wave sweeping the city, with some forced to sleep rough or being denied treatment after testing positive. In Hong Kong, foreign domestic workers must live with their employers, cannot swap jobs easily, and are entitled to one day off a week. The Philippine consul-general Raly Tejada said today that the mission had helped 31 Filipinos who sought its help for hospitalisation or access to isolation rooms, adding that 61 in all had tested positive. It is also looking into cases of Filipinos whose employment contracts were allegedly terminated after they tested positive.  Speaking at an online news conference, Tejada said: Until now, it had been unclear whether a person could get infected by both variants. However, a study led by researchers at the Statens Serum Institut (SSI), has found that people infected with BA.1 can get infected with BA.2 shortly afterwards, but that it is a rare occurrence. We start with the news that the Queen has cancelled her planned engagements for Tuesday as she is still experiencing mild cold-like symptoms from Covid-19, Buckingham Palace has said. The palace confirmed on Sunday that the monarch, 95, had tested positive for coronavirus and was planning to continue carrying out “light duties” at Windsor Castle. It is understood further engagements over the coming week, including her weekly conversation with the prime minister, will be decided upon nearer the time. The announcement came after the Queen’s eldest son, Prince Charles, 73, tested positive on 10 February, two days after the pair had met each other. His wife, the Duchess of Cornwall, tested positive just days later. A number of people have also tested positive at Windsor Castle, it is understood.That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, for today.

However,close contact are no longer required to restrict movement or self-isolate unless they have symptoms from Monday.Mr Varadkar said Cabinet agreed to accept the advice of the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) and he described the changes as the next steps towards living with Covid-19 as an endemic disease.While mask mandates would end on Monday as a legal requirement, he said the wearing of masks was still being advised on public transport and in healthcare settings.He said people who still wished to wear masks were free to do so.In schools and childcare pods for children, staggered breaks and physical distancing can also end from Monday.These settings will still be required to practice good hygiene and have good ventilation and children should stay at home if they are sick.Mr Varadkar said Nphet recommended that there be no vaccine mandates either for the general public or healthcare workers and the Government has agreed with this.Global effortMeanwhile, Ireland could more than double its contributions to global efforts to vaccinate people against Covid-19 under proposals being examined by Government.Plans to donate up to 3.3 million more jabs are being developed by Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly with a view to being finalised in the coming weeks.Ireland - which has high levels of vaccination it is own population - has already donated or pledged around three million doses.Mr Donnelly is understood to be examining how further contributions can be made with a source saying he is “keen to see greater vaccine equity and solidarity” especially with the African continent.Under the proposals Ireland will maintain sufficient vaccine stocks to cater for the current vaccination programme and any possible further vaccine roll-out later this year.However, Mr Donnelly is said to be authorising a waiver of additional vaccine options on 1.7 million doses which will be donated as part of an EU-wide donation of Janssen vaccines.The possibility of donating a further 1.1 million donation of Janssen vaccines - due in Ireland in the second quarter of 2022 - is also being examined.Almost half a million Pfizer and Moderna vaccines that are already in Ireland - and have a shelf life of at least July onwards - may also be donated on a bilateral basis with other countries.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"move by sisters of charity to rezone merrion road land would boost its value to 50m","story":"Frontline healthcare workers protest outside the St Mary’s and Caritas centres on Merrion Road in September 2020. Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill The Religious Sisters of Charity have urged planners to allow housing on their land at Merrion Road in south Dublin, in a move that could value the site at €50 million if it is sold for residential development. The order’s application to Dublin City Council comes less than two years after the closure of a nursing home and convalescent home at the Dublin 4 campus led to big job losses.The property, adjacent to St Vincent’s hospital complex and the new national maternity hospital site, is described as being in a “prime” suburban location. The nuns have had a presence there since the 1860s, when they opened a home for the “Destitute Catholic Blind”.In a formal submission to the council, they said the site buildings are physically and functionally obsolete and argued that “underutilised” land opens up an opportunity to deliver “high quality residential development and address housing need”.Advisers to the Sisters asked to change the zoning on about 4 hectares (9.88 acres) of its 6.55-hectare campus to reflect the “future development potential” of institutional lands. Citing nearby sales of housing land for €5 million per acre, a senior property industry source estimated that the nuns’ site could fetch “€50 million-plus” with zoning for homes. A spokeswoman for the order had no comment on the submission. The order placed St Mary’s nursing home and the Caritas convalescent home at Merrion Road in liquidation in July 2020, a move that proved controversial. It also shut St Monica’s nursing home at Belvedere Place, Dublin. The order said funds were not available to pay staff a full redundancy package. Seán McElhinney, assistant general secretary at the union Fórsa which represented staff at the three sites, said “approximately 208 workers” were made redundant. They only received a statutory redundancy payment, the minimum required by law “and were offered a €3,000 ‘goodwill’ payment on a take-it-or-leave-it basis”, he said. “The news that the site is to be monetised will only serve to rub salt in the wounds of the workers who have lost so much.”The Sisters of Charity ran five industrial schools investigated by the Ryan Commission and offered €5 million towards the costs of the State redress scheme for survivors. Just €2 million was contributed, the last payment being made in 2013.They also ran two Magdalene Laundries at Donnybrook, Dublin, and Peacock Lane, Cork. They declined to contribute to the State redress scheme for women who had been in the laundries. All four religious congregations which ran the 10 laundries operating in Ireland up to 1996 declined to do so.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"euro 2028 joint bid could see ireland host a quarter of games","story":"The Aviva Stadium in Dublin. Photograph: Evan TreacyInphoThe island of Ireland could host a quarter of the games in Euro 2028 under a proposed joint bid to host the football tournament with England, Scotland and Wales.The Cabinet is expected to be updated on Tuesday on the decision by the five football associations across Britain and Ireland to pursue the European Championships rather than the 2030 World Cup.The Government here is waiting for more information on the costs and benefits of hosting before making a decision to support efforts to land the tournament.However, Minister of State for Sport Jack Chambers is due to brief ministerial colleagues on the current status of the planned bid by the Football Association of Ireland (FAI) and its counterparts in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.Issues still under consideration include the costs that may occur depending on the size of the tournament and whether there will be 24 teams or an increase to 32 – something that has been mooted by Uefa.This would factor into how many games would be held in Ireland, but there is an expectation a quarter of the matches overall would be played on both sides of the Border if the bid were to go ahead and be successful.The potential bid is being positively viewed within government, including the potential to strengthen North-South and east-west ties.The State had spent about €155,000 on scoping out a potential joint bid for the 2030 World Cup before that proposal was dropped by the five football associations in favour of pursuing Euro 2028. Sources said the feasibility work can be repurposed.The Cabinet is not expected to make a decision on Tuesday, but the bid will have to be signed off before March 23rd, the Uefa deadline for expressions of interest from potential host countries.Covid measuresSeparately, the Government is set to give approval on the dropping of almost all remaining Covid-19 measures.Ministers are expected to agree to recommendations by the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) that the requirement for the compulsory wearing of face masks on public transport as well as in schools and shops can be dropped from February 28th. Nphet said last week masks should still be worn in healthcare settings and people should still be advised to wear them on public transport.Taoiseach Micheál Martin has already said the Government is following Nphet’s advice “in its entirety”.Minister for Children Roderic O’Gorman is to seek Government approval for the publication of draft legislation to allow for the exhumation of remains at the sites of former mother and baby homes.Survivors and the families of former residents are to be briefed on the contents of the Institutional Burials Bill before it is published. There is said to be “substantial changes” to a previous version of the legislation.Minister for Agriculture Charlie McConalogue is expected to bring proposals for a €7 million support package for pig farmers to help the embattled sector, which has had to cope with rising feed and energy costs alongside a drop in the price received for pigs in the market.A support package worth about €20,000 per farmer is to be paid to all pig farmers who are members of the Bord Bia quality assurance scheme.Nuclear optionMinister for Finance Paschal Donohoe will update his Cabinet colleagues on Ireland’s consideration of EU proposals to classify energy from nuclear and gas powered plants as sustainable. The controversial proposal, which is being discussed at European Council and at member state level, would see such power plants classified as “green” in guidelines for sustainable investment, but has sparked a backlash, including from some member states. Minister for the Environment Eamon Ryan has said there is no need to classify nuclear and gas along these lines.Mr Ryan will also bring amendments to the Road Traffic and Roads Bill that will also allow the Road Safety Authority to provide car owners with online access to their NCT data. The change would also allow prospective buyers of second-hand cars to view the information if the seller was willing to share it with them. Data protection issues have been overcome as no personal data is used."},{"url":null,"title":"australia reopens borders to vaccinated visitors after two years","story":"Australia has fully reopened its international borders to travellers vaccinated against the coronavirus after nearly two years of pandemic-related closings.  Video: ReutersA man with a stuffed koala toy and flowers at the arrival hall at the international terminal of Sydney Airport. Photograph: Brent LewinBloombergAustralia on Monday fully reopened its international borders to travellers vaccinated against Covid-19 after nearly two years of pandemic-related closings, as tourists returned and hundreds of people were reunited with family and friends.More than 50 international flights were to reach the country through the day, including 27 touching down in Sydney, its largest city, as the tourism and hospitality sectors look to rebuild after getting hammered by Covid-19 restrictions.Most regions of the country were reopening to all fully vaccinated visa-holders without restrictions or exemption requirements. However, the Department of Foreign Affairs warned on Monday that arrivals into Western Australia, including Perth, will have to quarantine on arrival, with this arrangement in place until at least March 3rd.“It is a very exciting day, one that I have been looking forward to for a long time, from the day that I first shut that border right at the start of the pandemic,” Australian prime minister Scott Morrison told reporters in the island state of Tasmania, which relies heavily on tourism.After being away from loved ones for months there were many emotional reunions, including for Cindy Moss, who travelled from the US state of Kentucky to see her daughter.“I just haven’t seen her in so long and it was such a big thing to be able to get over here. So I’m so excited,” she said after hugging her daughter, her voice cracking with emotion.Tourism is one of Australia’s biggest industries, worth more than A$60 billion (€38 billion) a year and employing about 5 per cent of the country’s workforce. But the sector was crippled after the country shut its borders in March 2020.Once a champion of Covid-suppression strategy, Australia shifted away from its fortress-style controls and relentless lockdowns since late last year and began living with the virus after reaching higher vaccination levels. Skilled migrants, international students and backpackers have been allowed to fly into Australia since November in a staggered reopening exercise.PartyingPassengers flying to Sydney were greeted from the air with “Welcome Back World!” painted on a sign near the runways while people in kangaroo costumes welcomed travellers and a DJ played music from a van festooned with a banner saying “You were worth the wait”.“It is a party out here, music playing, smiles on people’s faces, they will be dancing soon, I’m sure,” Australia’s minister for tourism Dan Tehan told broadcaster ABC from Sydney Airport as he gave travellers gift jars of Vegemite, the famed Australian food spread, and stuffed koala toys.Mr Tehan said he was hopeful for a “very strong” rebound in the tourism market, with Qantas looking to fly more than 14,000 passengers into Australia this week. Virgin Australia said it was seeing positive trends in domestic bookings and continued to assess demand for international flights.All trains in Sydney, meanwhile, were cancelled on Monday after pay disputes between a union and the state government, taking some shine off the reopening.As borders reopen, Australia’s outbreak of the Omicron Covid-19 variant appears to have passed its peak, with hospital admissions steadily falling over the past three weeks. The bulk of Australia’s pandemic total of about 2.7 million confirmed cases has been detected since the emergence of Omicron in late November. Total deaths stood at 4,929.Just in excess of 17,000 new cases and 17 deaths were registered by midday on Monday, with the Northern Territory due to report its figures later. – ReutersEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"hong kong to enforce mass testing amid surge in covid cases","story":"Residents line up to get tested for Covid-19 at a temporary testing centre  in Hong Kong on  Tuesday. Photograph: Kin CheungAP Hong Kong will roll out compulsory testing for Covid-19 starting in mid-March for its 7.4 million residents, leader Carrie Lam said on Tuesday, as university researchers predicted new infections could peak at 180,000 a day next month.Ms Lam said stringent coronavirus rules would be in place until mid-April with schools shut until August, as authorities battle to control an “exponential” rise in infections that has overwhelmed healthcare facilities and resources.Hong Kong is home to some of the most densely populated districts on Earth, with the majority of people living in high-rise buildings cheek by jowl with family members and often sharing tiny lifts.“The coming one to three months are crucial in fighting the pandemic,” Ms Lam told a press briefing.Residents would need to test three times under the compulsory testing scheme with daily testing capacity reaching one million. Venues including school campuses could be used for testing and isolation, she said.The measures are the most draconian to be implemented, two years into the pandemic, in the global financial hub.Ms Lam reiterated the city’s “dynamic zero Covid” strategy similar to mainland China, aiming to eradicate any outbreaks at all costs. She repeatedly thanked mainland authorities for their “staunch support”.She said authorities were not considering a city-wide lockdown, like those in mainland China. The central government would however help to build a temporary hospital.Health authorities in the former British colony reported 6,211 new cases, 32 deaths and a further 9,369 cases that came up positive in preliminary tests. They said a backlog in testing meant they were unable to get a full picture.In a paper titled “Modelling the fifth wave of Covid-19 in Hong Kong”, researchers at the University of Hong Kong said they updated their February 10th study to show the number of daily deaths potentially peaking at near 100 by late March, and cumulative deaths potentially rising to around 3,206 by mid-May.Infections could peak at 180,000 a day.Social distancingLess than two weeks ago, the same researchers had predicted daily infections potentially peaking at around 28,000 by mid-March with a total of 954 deaths by the end of June.In the absence of much more intensive social distancing measures, like a city-wide lockdown, “the trajectory of the fifth wave is unlikely to change substantially from its current course”, the study said.Hong Kong has reported that since the start of February daily infections have surged by around 70 times, overwhelming the government’s testing, hospital and quarantine capacities, as it attempts to stifle the virus.Hong Kong already has some of the world’s toughest rules to curb Covid-19. Stringent restrictions mean that very few flights are able to land while most transit passengers are banned.Ms Lam said a flight ban from nine countries including the United States and Britain would remain in place until April 20th, with other countries potentially being added to the list.Gatherings of more than two people are banned and most venues, including schools, gyms and beauty salons, are closed.The restrictions, which were first imposed in 2020, are testing the patience of residents, as fatigue and anxiety sets in with businesses across the city reeling from the closures.In total the city has reported over 60,000 infections, far less than other similar major cities. However a large proportion of the vulnerable elderly population remain unvaccinated.Ms Lam said the city’s vaccination rate should reach around 90 per cent for one dose by March, up from around 86 per cent currently. “Stay confident and we will see the rainbow,” she said.The study anticipated that the number of infected people in seven-day isolation could potentially reach over 600,000, while the number of close contacts in seven-day quarantine could reach 1.8 million, leading to a substantial disruption in society. – ReutersStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"About 2.4 million forced to leave their homes during 13-year-long war with Boko HaramTom Saater has a rags to riches story and a unique insight into Nigeria\u0026rsquos biggest cityIn one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"fully vaccinated britons allowed europe without pre departure","story":"All fully-jabbed British travellers will be allowed into the European Union without tests under a travel blueprint to be approved by the European Council on Tuesday.Children aged six to 18 who have not been fully jabbed will also be allowed to travel into EU countries provided that they have a negative pre-departure PCR test.The plans, which will cover visitors from all non-EU countries including the UK, are designed to end the patchwork of different regulations that EU countries have used, causing confusion for many British holidaymakers.Italy and the Netherlands currently require all travellers from the UK to have a negative lateral flow or PCR test before they can enter the countries. Italy also conducts random Covid testing on arrival and demands a rapid lateral flow test on entry.The European Commission is said to be “optimistic” most EU and EEA countries will implement the new EU Council recommendation, although they are not rules so member states can deviate from them if they choose.The regime will come into effect on Mar 1, well in advance of the Easter school holidays in the first two weeks of April, and is expected to apply to all those who have been double or triple jabbed within 270 days of their arrival within the country.The 20 per cent of adults in the UK who have not had a booster will be treated as unvaccinated if they have not been double jabbed within 270 days of arrival. In Italy, this currently means five days’ self-isolation and a ban from the Netherlands.The changes will mean travel protocols from outside the EU are aligned with those within the EU, with the rules based on travellers’ personal health status rather than the epidemiological situation of the countryarea of departure.Paul Charles, the chief executive of travel consultancy The PC Agency said: “A one-size-fits-all policy for those who have been fully jabbed makes absolute sense and would enable European economies to bounce back faster.“The one way to revive travel across Europe is to have a consistent policy for those coming from the UK, which is a such a huge market for the EU.”Most countries are expected to retain passenger locator forms (PLFs) for arrivals, although Grant Shapps, the Transport Secretary, is pressing to scrap the UK’s by the Easter holidays.As an interim measure the forms, in which people must provide contact and travel details, are to be significantly simplified in the coming weeks.The travel industry has been calling for the cumbersome documents to be scrapped, saying they are acting as a drag on British holiday firms.However, moves to get rid of the forms have been slowed down by objections from the Department of Health and Social Care, which has been in favour of tougher curbs.Tim Alderslade, the chief executive of trade body Airlines UK, said: “Ministers are absolutely right to remove the remaining restrictions but this needs to cut across all elements of the economy, including travel.“If there is no requirement to self-isolate for those with Covid in the UK, jabbed or otherwise, there can be no justification for continuing with travel restrictions for the unvaccinated, including the continued use of the PLF which, although not as bad as testing, remains a deterrent to travel.”The documents have already been simplified once, to shorten the time it takes to fill them in. By the end of the month, people will be given an extra day to fill them out. It is a criminal offence to provide false or deliberately misleading information when filling out the form.Unvaccinated travellers arriving in the UK will also continue to have to take pre-departure tests and PCR tests on or before day two of their entry to the UK.More from NewsIn pictures: Russian troops and tanks enter Ukraine Politics latest news: Westminster will not take lectures from SNP over \u0026#39job-destroying\u0026#39 policies, says Kwasi KwartengRussia-Ukraine latest news: Right to \u0026#39snip the feed\u0026#39 of Nord Stream 2, says Boris Johnson as he imposes own sanctionsThank God Jeremy Corbyn isn\u0026#39t in chargeEmily Maitlis and Jon Sopel to leave BBCManchester Arena bomber\u0026#39s brother Hashem Abedi guilty of attacking prison officerMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"lifting restrictions right thing do","story":"For a while yesterday, a delay to a Cabinet meeting called to agree an end to pandemic restrictions in England prompted speculation that Freedom Day had been put on hold. Fortunately, the concerns were misplaced. The cause was a disagreement between the Treasury and the Department of Health over funding free Covid tests after measures are lifted. Sajid Javid had reportedly requested some £5 billion to continue free testing but was rightly beaten back by the Chancellor, though help will continue for more than 1 million clinically vulnerable people and NHS staff obliged to test.One reason for seeking to “live with Covid” is to stop spending vast sums on testing mostly healthy people on a daily basis. This is money that could be spent elsewhere in the NHS without raising taxes. Ending the legal requirement to self-isolate in England from Thursday obviates the need for mass testing altogether and it is right to stop it, though why wait until April? Outside of the most vulnerable, if someone suspects they might have Covid, they can pay for a test kit to find out.In the Commons, Mr Johnson said that while Covid was now an endemic disease it should be dealt with without recourse to emergency powers, which are to be repealed early. Protection against Covid would henceforth rely on the exercise of personal responsibility, backed by vaccines and treatments. This is precisely the right, proportionate and balanced approach that we have urged on the Prime Minister for some time but one which (mostly masked) opposition MPs still could not bring themselves to support.The state cannot continue to impose restrictions on people other than in an emergency. Now that one no longer exists, Sir Keir Starmer is wrong to object when the rates of infection have fallen, hospitals are coping well and deaths are below average for the time of year. Labour seems wedded to legal compulsion for its own sake.But senseless red tape remains. For instance, restrictions on visitors to care homes are unduly onerous and should be modified. Moreover, if it is no longer mandatory to self-isolate, why do people arriving in the UK need to fill in passenger locator forms? These complicated documents act as a pointless barrier to travel which the hard-pressed tourism industry could do without.Mr Johnson hinted that they may be scrapped in time for the Easter holidays. Why wait? They should be dropped now for all the good they do.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Westminster will not take lectures from SNP over \u0026#39job-destroying\u0026#39 policies, says Kwasi KwartengRussia-Ukraine latest news: Right to \u0026#39snip the feed\u0026#39 of Nord Stream 2, says Boris Johnson as he imposes own sanctionsThank God Jeremy Corbyn isn\u0026#39t in chargeEmily Maitlis and Jon Sopel to leave BBCManchester Arena bomber\u0026#39s brother Hashem Abedi guilty of attacking prison officerBoris Johnson launches \u0026#39first barrage\u0026#39 of sanctions against RussiaMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"living with covid plan strategy what when changes end","story":"Boris Johnson on Monday unveiled the Government\u0027s plans for how England will live with Covid in the future.The Prime Minister announced that all Covid regulations, including those that mandate lockdown and require people to self-isolate if they test positive, will be scrapped from Thursday, Feb 24.Here, we explore everything that is set to change in the days ahead. People who test positive and their close contacts will no longer be required by law to self-isolate. Anyone who receives a positive test result after Feb 24 will be advised to isolate for five days and avoid contact with vulnerable people, but will not be required to do.People who are unvaccinated and have come into close contact with a positive case will also no longer be required to isolate.The legal duty for workers to tell employers if they are required to self-isolate will also end, as will government financial support for people who are isolating.The Prime Minister said he would not wait for a total end to this war before lifting remaining measures, warning that to do so would involve restricting the liberties of the British people for a long time.From April 1, when the general public will no longer be able to access free tests, the guidance will change again to suggest that those with Covid symptoms should exercise caution to avoid spreading the virus. At a press conference, Mr Johnson suggested the UK could learn from Germany, where people are much more disciplined about not going to work if they are sick.From April 1, the Government will remove the Covid provisions on statutory sick pay, which allow employees to claim sick pay and Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) from the first day they are not at work.From March 24, the system will return to its pre-pandemic form, which allows people to claim sick pay after four days off work and ESA after seven days.Blanket lockdown regulations will also be replaced by a requirement on local authorities to manage outbreaks through planning and pre-existing public health powers, as they would with other diseases.Mr Johnson refused to rule out reintroducing restrictions in the face of a new variant in the future, saying: You\u0027ve got to be humble in the face of nature.From Feb 24, he said the Government would end routine contact tracing and no longer ask fully vaccinated close contacts to test daily for seven days.All temporary provisions of the Coronavirus Act, which enforces legal restrictions on the public, will end from March 24.The general public will no longer be able to access free lateral flow and PCR tests from the NHS from April 1.Tests are expected to be available for the over-80s and the clinically vulnerable, but the precise groups able to access them are to be decided by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) before the April 1 deadline.Care home patients will continue to get regular free asymptomatic testing and staff will be entitled to them if symptomatic. Free diagnostic testing will continue for NHS patients, with stocks available for asymptomatic “surge” testing of staff if needed.Mr Johnson told MPs the testing, tracing and isolation budget had come at a “vast cost”, exceeding the entire budget of the Home Office in 2021, a further £15.7 billion in this financial year and £2 billion in January alone at the height of the omicron wave. He said: “We must now scale this back.”Twice weekly asymptomatic testing for staff and students in most education and childcare settings will also end from April 1. Mass testing in schools is also expected to end.The UKHSA is also working with private companies to ensure that lateral flow tests will be available in supermarkets and pharmacies when they can no longer be ordered from NHS Test and Trace for free.The Government is keen to avoid a repeat of the travel test rip-offs that saw private companies charging more than £100 for PCR tests. Ministers want to ensure there is a regulated market and see no reason why a pack of six lateral flow tests should cost more than £20.In an attempt to prevent panic buying of the kits before April 1, the Government has started rationing lateral flow tests to one pack of seven tests every three days instead of one every 24 hours.Tests for symptomatic people will be free for hospital patients, but there will not be regular asymptomatic testing on wards unless there is a local outbreak.The Government will also maintain a stockpile of tests that can be deployed if a new variant threatens to overwhelm the health service.Protection against laboratory leaks will be stepped up, said Mr Johnson as he set out a strategy to future-proof Britain against another pandemic.He said the UK Biosecurity Strategy would be refreshed to shield the country against both natural spillovers and accidental releases, as well as biological threats from other countries or terrorists. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) infection survey will also remain in place to monitor the virus, and laboratories will maintain the capability to ramp up testing to combat any new variant.But Mr Johnson made it clear that Covid would now be managed through routine public health and pharmaceutical interventions as the “first line of defence”.Vaccination will also continue into the future with the UK securing supplies of new bivalent vaccines currently in trials, which can combat multiple variants in one jab.Britain will host a global pandemic preparedness summit later this month, and is expected to sign an international treaty agreeing to ongoing surveillance.Travel tests and red tape will remain despite the relaxation of domestic restrictions.Unvaccinated travellers will still be required to take a pre-departure test and pay for a PCR test on or before day two of their arrival in the UK.All travellers – jabbed and unjabbed – will also have to continue to fill in the passenger locator form to enter the UK, to the anger of many in the travel industry and Tory MPs who have campaigned for “frictionless” travel.Grant Shapps, the Transport Secretary, is expected to announce long-term plans for travel in the next month, which could see the passenger locator form further streamlined, the scrapping of hotel quarantine for red list countries and measures to prevent a return to on-off border closures.Mr Shapps has been working with other countries to draw up a “playbook” of rules to deal with new Covid strains so action can be taken without shutting frontiers.He said this “will help us to ensure that, rather than having to shut down, we can put measures in place that are internationally agreed if required”.Following the abolition of the Covid regulations, face masks will no longer be legally compulsory anywhere.Instead, it will be left up to businesses and iniduals to decide the approach they adopt, which means companies, theatres and shops could still request that coverings are worn by employees and customers.On Monday, Sadiq Khan, the Mayor of London, said masks would no longer be compulsory on the Tube, even though officials have the power to impose them as a condition of carriage.“Following the Government dropping all legal Covid restrictions, and in light of falling infection levels in London, it is expected that wearing a face covering will no longer be a condition of carriage on the TfL network,” he said.A government source said it was “likely we won\u0027t be explicit” on the approach businesses should take to masks, adding: “We are now in a world where we’re moving away from Government diktat to personal judgement and responsibility.”Ministers will still suggest that people continue to wear face coverings in crowded and enclosed spaces where they may come into contact with people they do not normally meet in order to minimise the risk of infection.Dr Raghib Ali, a senior clinical research associate with the Medical Research Council at the University of Cambridge, urged vulnerable people to wear good quality surgical masks.Hospitals are still likely to limit visits, as living with Covid plans will leave it up to inidual trusts to decide their own policies.More than a quarter of NHS trusts have suspended routine hospital visits completely, and in some cases relatives are being prevented from seeing non-Covid patients for weeks at a time.NHS England encourages trusts to facilitate visits “wherever possible, and to do so in a risk-managed way”, but it is up to inidual trusts to set their own policies based on UK Health Security Agency guidelines.All 125 trusts have some form of visiting restriction in place. The most common policy is to have one named visitor per patient for the entirety of a patient’s stay, who can only visit for one hour once a dayMillions of over-50s could be offered Covid boosters this autumn, as Boris Johnson hailed Britain’s vaccine rollout as key to “restoring our liberties in full”.Fourth jabs will start being offered to those aged 75 and over and the clinically vulnerable from next month, with a further rollout of vaccines expected later this year, when the programme may be much more widely extended. The vaccine programme will see fourth jabs offered to those aged 75 and over from next month, around six months after their booster.  Those who are immunosuppressed will also be offered an extra jab, which for many will be their fifth dose.The Joint Committee on Vaccine and Immunisation said the extra “spring dose” would be advised for the most vulnerable ahead of the expected autumn booster programme. On Monday, the JCVI said people over 75, those living in care homes and anyone over 12 who is immunosuppressed will be offered a fourth jab. Those over 18 will be offered the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines, while those 12 to 18 will be offered Pfizer.Prof Wei Shen Lim, the JCVI chairman of Covid vaccination, said: “Last year’s booster vaccination programme has so far provided excellent protection against severe Covid-19. “To maintain high levels of protection for the most vulnerable iniduals in the population, an extra spring dose of vaccine is advised ahead of an expected autumn booster programme.“The JCVI will continue its rolling review of the vaccination programme and the epidemiological situation, particularly in relation to the timing and value of doses for less vulnerable older adults and those in clinical risk groups ahead of autumn.”Mr Johnson said that from April 1 the use of voluntarily Covid status certification would no longer be recommended but left open the possibility that they could still be used by businesses, theatres and other venues.But the Government said the pass within the NHS app for domestic purposes would only be available for a “limited period”.It will, however, continue within the NHS app for international travel to allow people to declare their vaccinated or Covid recovery status.The Prime Minister suggested companies should consider lifting work from home policies to restore public confidence after the pandemic.Full guidance for businesses is expected before April 1, when tests for the general public will no longer be free. That could include the advice that offices should consider lifting their work from home policies.The Government repealed its advice for employees to work remotely last month, but official figures from the ONS show that, by the end of January, more than a third of workers were still working from home.Virtual court hearings will become a permanent feature to clear the backlog of cases that has built up during the pandemic, despite emergency Covid laws being scrapped by the Government.More than 12,000 hearings per week have taken place across 3,200 virtual courtrooms, and the power to continue them will be transferred to a new police and crime act when remaining coronavirus laws expire in the next six months.Coroners will also be given the permanent power to carry out inquests without a jury where Covid is suspected as a cause of death.In all, 40 temporary non-devolved powers were made under coronavirus laws, of which half have already expired. Of the remaining 20, four cover the inquest and virtual court hearing provisions, and the other 16 will expire at midnight on 24 March.They include the emergency registration of nurses, healthcare workers and social workers the funding of employers’ liabilities for statutory sick pay powers in relations to the transportation, storage and disposal of dead bodies tenants’ protection from eviction and the relaxing of rules covering medical certificates for cremations.This article is being kept updated with the latest news and advice. More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Right to \u0026#39snip the feed\u0026#39 of Nord Stream 2, says Boris Johnson as he imposes own sanctionsThank God Jeremy Corbyn isn\u0026#39t in chargePolitics latest news: Westminster will not take lectures from SNP over \u0026#39job-destroying\u0026#39 policies, says Kwasi KwartengEmily Maitlis and Jon Sopel to leave BBCManchester Arena bomber\u0026#39s brother Hashem Abedi guilty of attacking prison officerBoris Johnson launches \u0026#39first barrage\u0026#39 of sanctions against RussiaMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"putins aim clear","story":"Vladimir Putin’s decision to recognise the eastern Ukrainian provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent republics marks a significant heightening of tensions between Moscow and the West. The Russian leader had earlier staged an absurd propaganda stunt by chairing a televised meeting of his security council to endorse this demarche. It has removed all remaining doubt as to his intentions to further carve up Ukraine in breach of international law.The announcement has scuppered the latest flurry of diplomatic efforts spearheaded by Emmanuel Macron, who has failed to engineer the resolution to the crisis that he confidently predicted just a week or so. France currently holds the rotating EU presidency offering Mr Macron the chance to play the roles of statesman and peace-maker. He has been trying to bring the Russian leader together with US president Joe Biden in a last-ditch effort to prevent an invasion.But while Mr Biden had agreed in principle to a summit, the latest development has surely killed off any hopes of a rapprochement.While a diplomatic solution is preferable to war, it cannot be at any price, as Ben Wallace, the Defence Secretary, told MPs. The West must not support the dismantling of Ukraine in order to persuade Mr Putin to remove his troops.The provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk have been at the centre of a bloody stand-off between the two countries since 2014 that has already cost 10,000 lives. If Mr Putin can split them from Ukraine, as he did Crimea, he will consider his acts of intimidation and aggression to have been a success.

It glides along nicely for a few yards, then skitters and gives up about a third of the way to the target. It turns out that curling, which I had long believed to be as taxing as bowls and as serious as hopscotch, is actually very difficult. I’m not alone in coming to the sport now: rinks are booked up after millions tuned in to watch the GB women’s team win gold and the men win silver at the Winter Olympics in Beijing. Ice rinks are being urged to stock up on curling stones, in anticipation of a post-Olympics boom in interest, and venues are reportedly booked up. “Our sessions are almost sold out for the next two weeks”, the manager of one of England’s biggest curling rinks told The . I head to Queens, a rink in central London, which over the past few years has been trying to reinvigorate the sport by giving it a hipster makeover. While the sport might be commonly thought of as something for the older generation, Queens is taking efforts to make it appeal to younger people. The walls are decorated with false graffiti and sports memorabilia, and the rink is ringed by a bar selling craft beer.I tack grips onto the bottom of my trainers, and have 19-year-old curler Leo De Souza explain how to wang the 44lb (20kg) granite stone as far as I can. He explains that I need to “push right until the end”, ending with a flick of the wrist. I give it a try, bracing my core and using the strength of my entire body to move the stone forwards. The stone races on, as does my heart rate. The sport might have experienced a recent surge in popularity, but it has been played for at least 500 years in some form. It emerged in Scotland in the 16th century, where people played on frozen ponds and lochs, and soon spread to continental Europe. Its rules were codified in their current form by the Royal Caledonian Curling Club, Stirling, in the mid-19th century.This year isn’t the first time that Team GB has taken home a haul of curling medals. At the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, the women’s team took home gold medals after delivering “the Stone of Destiny” that gave Team GB their first Winter Olympics gold for almost two decades. After their success, they were mobbed at the airport on their arrival home, and overnight became household names.Its ongoing popularity over the past half-millennium has undoubtedly been helped by its unique blend of physical strength and mental tactics. Curling is frequently called “chess on ice” due to the intricate turn-based tactics you need to succeed, which vary wildly based on whether your team starts first or second. Just like in chess, your stones will be either used to attack, or to protect your attacking stones from the other team, explains Stephen Lea, a 50-year-old IT manager from Tunbridge Wells who has been curling for a decade. If your team goes first, then you typically try to throw “guard” stones which block the other team from approaching the house, whereas the team who goes second will prefer to “keep the centre of the house open”. “It’s very much like chess”, he says. “There are all types of plays that different teams do.” But with hip rinks like Queens now offering curling, will the image of the sport undergo a bit of an image rehaul? It’s not the first old-fashioned sport to be folded into the trend for “competitive socialising”: Flight Club is a chain of bars across the country where groups of punters can enjoy cocktails while they play darts, and in Australia there’s even a place where you can do boozy lawn bowls. “We looked at curling as bowling’s wonderful, weird cousin”, says Dan Kapp, the marketing director of Queens. “It’s nicely social… People are craving experiences after being stuck behind a screen for two years, and it provides sensational Instagram content.”He says that the professional curling bodies have been very welcoming to the informal game they’re playing at Queens, with a shorter rink than they use in the Olympics, and plenty of drinks after. And there might be a reason for that: even in the competitive sport, a tournament always ends in the bar, says Lea: “It’s a very social game the winner buys the loser drinks”.Bad news for Team GB, then: that’s one hell of a bar tab. More from NewsIn pictures: Russian troops and tanks enter Ukraine Politics latest news: Westminster will not take lectures from SNP over \u0026#39job-destroying\u0026#39 policies, says Kwasi KwartengRussia-Ukraine latest news: Right to \u0026#39snip the feed\u0026#39 of Nord Stream 2, says Boris Johnson as he imposes own sanctionsThank God Jeremy Corbyn isn\u0026#39t in chargeEmily Maitlis and Jon Sopel to leave BBCManchester Arena bomber\u0026#39s brother Hashem Abedi guilty of attacking prison officerMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"emily maitlis jon sopel leave bbc launch podcast","story":"Emily Maitlis and Jon Sopel have quit the BBC to join LBC radio and launch a political podcast.The pair made the surprise announcement that they are joining Global, parent company of LBC.

I have happy 1970s boarding-school memories of messing around with candles when Edward Heath’s disputes with the trade unions plunged us into darkness.Even today, I feel a ghost of the old pleasure. When Storm Eunice hit us in Sussex on Friday morning, I was quite excited. When our power cut out, I was about half-way through my Saturday column for this paper and completed it with the residue left in my laptop. As well as no electricity, I had no mobile signal and no internet, but through my landline I was able to reach the ’s Comment desk to discuss how to transmit my piece. Since all power for miles around was out, I could not cadge anyone else’s connection.The only solution was the most old-fashioned: dictation. The brilliant Madeline Grant is an accomplished young writer with better things to do, but she patiently typed up my fulminations against President Putin and the weakness of the West.For me, dictating was nostalgic. Before fax machines in the 1980s, phoning over copy (always reversing the telephone charges) was the main method for journalists out on a story. Those scenes in old films of reporters fighting for a telephone box were authentic. The temperature in our house was dropping fast, but my triumph over minor adversity gave me a warm glow.Dinner was hot – no interruption of our bottled gas – and our log fire and candles made one room snug. Our last view from our bedroom window before an early night was memorably lovely. The utter absence of unnatural light enabled us to marvel at the perfected brightness of the moon.Escape from modernity is enjoyable, however, only if you can get back to it when you want to. We could not. The power was still off the next morning. I began to consider the facts.My mother was worst placed. She is a former polio victim who is about to be 90, lives alone and is immobile. Helped by extremely kind neighbours, she survived the first night well, but began to get cold the next day. Because of her infirmity, she cannot light or tend a log fire.The main worry was her stairlift. It has a back-up which can make a limited number of journeys in a power-cut, but not enough to survive a prolonged one. I supervised her journey up to bed lest the lift fail, leaving my mother in the air. It was cold, but at least I could give her a hot-water bottle. Thank God for non-electric Agas.By Sunday, the situation began to feel like the plagues of Egypt. All power was still off. My wife had caught the local flu and was sick in the night. My mother woke to find she had no water of any kind, hot or cold. The whole town of Battle was in the same situation, we heard. Without power, the water pumping station was not working properly.Visiting my mother in the morning, I was touched to find the kind neighbours with her, accompanied by the local farmer, James. He was installing his generator to help her, passing the wire through the letter-box, carefully putting it under carpets so she couldn’t trip. Its tankful powered two lights, the fridge and one blow heater for several hours. But it could not revive the stairlift, which is hardwired.I returned in the early evening to give my mother her supper and get her up to bed. Her village still had no power, and the stairlift had finally given up. It would have been nice to stay downstairs, but her electrically-operated chair for the disabled which can keep the sitter comfortable by adopting different positions was, naturally, dead.We decided to climb the stairs. Since my mother’s legs cannot support her, I was all but carrying her. It was slow and painful work, stair-tread by stair-tread. The whole process, from the bottom of the stairlift to getting her safely tucked up in bed, took well over an hour.As I write, 4,400 homes in Sussex are still without power. I have just left after giving my mother breakfast, still upstairs. She and I agreed that she should stay put, partly because she might fall coming down, mainly because of the ordeal of getting up the stairs again later. There is no solution until the power returns. A carer is with her, and my brother is nobly coming from London later. My poor sister has now tested positive for Covid.My mother has gamely overcome many adversities in life, but even she is a bit shaken. We all feel slightly embarrassed. After all, the absence of electricity was something familiar to most people 70 years ago.Yet it has become so embedded in daily life that we can barely live without it for more than 24 hours. The authorities need to acknowledge this, and find quicker ways of restoring heat and light.More from NewsIn pictures: Russian troops and tanks enter Ukraine Politics latest news: Westminster will not take lectures from SNP over \u0026#39job-destroying\u0026#39 policies, says Kwasi KwartengRussia-Ukraine latest news: Right to \u0026#39snip the feed\u0026#39 of Nord Stream 2, says Boris Johnson as he imposes own sanctionsThank God Jeremy Corbyn isn\u0026#39t in chargeEmily Maitlis and Jon Sopel to leave BBCManchester Arena bomber\u0026#39s brother Hashem Abedi guilty of attacking prison officerMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"russians have invaded ski haven courchevel like last days saigon","story":"There are benefits to being a Russian speaker: eavesdropping, for one. As we boarded our flight to Geneva last week, I couldn’t help but listen in to the conversation between two blondes in the row before us. They were heading to Courchevel, but I could have guessed that from their Fendi moon boots and Chanel Shearling backpacks. As they were flying British Airways (and not NetJets), I suspected these Russian ladies weren’t oligarch wives, but mistresses – or plain-old escorts.What was clear from their chatter was they were going to Courchevel to party. You would have thought, what with the TV constantly showing images of Russian tanks lining up along Ukraine’s borders, that they might want to hide in their bomb-proof Holland Park basements, clutching the business card of their Credit Suisse bankers. Talk of war, sanctions and repercussions didn’t seem to faze this lot one little bit.Maybe it’s because according to Rupert Longsdon, of the Oxford Ski Company – who rents chalets in Courchevel for up to €300,000 (£250,000) a week – these are “international Russians”. I presume many ‘Russian-Russians’ still can’t travel abroad much, not least because the EU doesn’t accept their ‘Sputnik’ vaccine. (Instead, they reportedly flock to Serbia – which allows visa-free travel from Russia – to access Western-made Covid jabs.)Christmas and January should be peak skiing months for Russians: February is when the Globo-Russians, many of whom reside in London, arrive at the Alpine resorts.At Le Cap Horn in Courchevel – sits oldest mountain restaurant, which is party central for Russians and where you’re expected to tip in gold bullion – ladies danced on tables in clearly never-worn-before Prada and Chloé ski suits as their hosts swigged down Dom Pérignon. “There we were, checking our phones for updates on the Ukraine crisis, while the Russians partied like Rome was burning,” says a friend.To give you even more of an idea, Le Cap Horn has a gift shop that sells Hermès handbags. “At one point, a Russian man appeared handing them out to the girls dancing on tables, who way outnumbered the men,” they add. “Lots of people were taping them, but they didn’t seem to care.”Le Cap Horn’s seafood-and-sushi menu is printed in French and Russian. If like us, you are English-speaking, regular guests, you can now expect to be seated by the loo – if they bother taking your reservation at all. The last time we were at the restaurant, five years ago, my husband paid in hundred euro bills and asked for change. The waiter laughed.Courchevel has long been the resort of choice for Russian billionaires. Roman Abramovich led the way, and others followed – most notably entrepreneurs Vladimir Potanin and Mikhail Prokhorov. Courchevel has been nicknamed “Courchevelsky”.“It’s hard to find a place to park your private jet these days,” says Longsdon, who explains that Courchevel is now the place to be for Russians for two reasons. One: they don’t have to rent their chalets out (as you do by law in, say, Austria, to maintain the community). And two: ski resorts is where “business is done”.“A lot people meet in private chalets, where they are not overheard,” he says. “They can sit down with clients at a table and talk openly.” Such privacy cannot be assured in a Russian dacha. I’ve heard many stories. One Russian family apparently rented puppies for their children as a Christmas gift, requiring redecorating a room with astroturf, and full-time dog trainers at £3,000 per day.Another chalet was the scene of a spontaneous drunken egg-and-pan baseball game, resulting in more than £25,000 worth of damage. Staff put up with it because the tips are the same as they are on yachts – namely, 10 per cent of what the chalet cost to rent, though Russians tip twice the going rate.According to another eyewitness at the resort for half-term, “it was crazy”. Writer Rhymer Rigby, who was staying in the nearby La Tania, where oligarchs helicopter in for lunch, says: “I saw a Louis Vuitton-branded yurt from my Gucci-branded gondola.”Notable also was how many fur-clad Russian ladies had their own photographers in tow. “The outfits were particularly good this year,” says a PR friend, whose family own a chalet. “Very Instagrammy.” Maybe they want to make memories before their foreign assets are frozen and, as some MPs have suggested, their children thrown out of British boarding schools.Courchevel was “our resort” for more than a decade, until Abramovich and his entourage alighted upon it (he apparently viewed every chalet in town, bidding way above the asking price, thereby fixing prices at oligarch levels. He also owns a chalet in Aspen, I’m told.)Our hotel in Courchevel was a favourite half-term destination. A British ski company looked after the children, allowing us to spend hours watching the (then) beautiful people at Le Cap Horn.Within a few years, we noticed that our hotel was filling up with loud, wealthy Russians, who booked a guide for each member of the family and kept them waiting all day in the ski room (no apology), while they nursed hangovers in their penthouse suites.Then restaurants began printing menus in Russians at the same time as prices doubled. Stories of hookers soon followed. You didn’t need a translator then (or now) to figure out what all well-endowed ladies hanging out in the lobbies of the highest-end hotels were up to.Courchevel boasts many British regulars, including David Beckham, who was there recently – but, truth be told, it’s a segregated resort now. “We never go to the big restaurants on the piste, and we never go into town because it’s ridiculous,” says a designer friend, who has been skiing there since she was four. “We would never go out at night, that’s for sure – and we can’t afford it. We spend the whole week avoiding the Russians.”This year, with kids in tow, we tried a new French resort, Val-d’Isère, with a Courchevel refugee as our guide. “The Russians have ruined Courchevel,” he says. “But their children are coming here. They are less showy – and sportier.”Judging from the mother of enormous chalets that was being constructed behind ours, and the rapidly expanding five-star hotel scene, surely it’s only a matter of time before it becomes “Valsidreski”.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Right to \u0026#39snip the feed\u0026#39 of Nord Stream 2, says Boris Johnson as he imposes own sanctionsThank God Jeremy Corbyn isn\u0026#39t in chargePolitics latest news: Westminster will not take lectures from SNP over \u0026#39job-destroying\u0026#39 policies, says Kwasi KwartengEmily Maitlis and Jon Sopel to leave BBCManchester Arena bomber\u0026#39s brother Hashem Abedi guilty of attacking prison officerBoris Johnson launches \u0026#39first barrage\u0026#39 of sanctions against RussiaMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"thank god jeremy corbyn isnt charge","story":"There’s an interesting pattern of dialogue that is provoked on Twitter whenever the subject of the 2019 general election is raised. Those of us who switched from Labour to the Conservatives in order to prevent the election of a Jeremy Corbyn-led government are frequently challenged, post-Partygate, to renounce our sins, invited to concede that a government led by the veteran Left-winger, however disastrous, would still have been preferable to the current one led by Boris Johnson.I beg to differ. As if the politics gods are always on the lookout for a way to remind us of our past decisions, we now have the Ukrainian crisis and an opportunity to consider, once again, the political instincts and loyalties of the man elected twice as  leader of the Labour Party.It might be appropriate to remind ourselves that, following Labour’s unexpectedly vigorous performance at the 2017 general election – coming second, more than 50 seats behind the Conservatives, counted as a win in the Labour Party back then – Corbyn seemed to be on the front foot, with his party regularly ahead in the polls. Apparently unable to bring himself to believe that Russia had deliberately launched a chemical attack against British residents, killing at least one British citizen in the process, Corbyn holed his already fragile leadership below the waterline. Why not send a sample of the deadly toxin used in the attempt to assassinate a former KGB agent to the Kremlin, suggested Corbyn to an astonished Commons, so that they could tell us whether it was theirs or not?There was much in subsequent months that led to Labour’s election defeat and Corbyn’s dispatch as leader. But you can easily trace his fall from the dizzy heights of Glastonbury celebrity to naïve (or duplicitous) Kremlin patsy to that moment in 2018.But for all Corbyn’s faults, he is consistent. On several occasions now, he has publicly appeared to sympathise with the interpretations of Putin’s Russia. Everything is Nato’s fault, he and his fellow-travellers on the hard-Left endlessly seem to think. How can poor Russia be blamed for annexing part of Ukraine in 2014 and for its attacks this week when the big, bad military alliance is expanding ever eastwards?He was at it again yesterday in the Commons, suggesting that “longer term, secure peace in the region” might be achieved if Nato reduced its presence in the region. This is a textbook tactic for appeasing hostile forces. So now would be as good a time as any to revisit the choice of prime minister presented to the British public in December 2019. Labour under Keir Starmer is in a difficult position since it cannot, with any sincerity or credibility, pretend that it wishes Corbyn had won that contest. Previous Labour oppositions have been able to claim, following every election defeat, that things would have been far better had the public made a different choice last time round. That is not a tactic available to Starmer’s front bench.So consider that scenario: a UK government, probably a “rainbow” coalition with all the chaos and stupidity such a phrase conjures up, led by a man who opposes the military alliance on which his own country’s security is based. Imagine that day in parliament, when the prime minister’s bike arrives and he steps off it, removes the straps securing his red box and heads into the building, preparing for his statement.“Both sides are at fault,” he might intone, perhaps reading out an email he had received from Brenda in Norwich, affirming her desire to see peace talks without preconditions. “I oppose all forms of war,” he might have told MPs. But some more than others, he would have been careful not to add.Now, there are no doubt those of Boris Johnson’s critics who regard the above scenario as preferable to, or at least the equivalence of, a couple of legally dubious parties in the Downing Street garden. As the scale of Russian aggression and anti-democratic actions become more apparent, however, Britons should be careful. December 2019 represented a lucky escape for our country, whatever you may think of the victor that night or since.The installation of Corbyn in Number 10 would not just have been disastrous for Britain far worse than that, it would have been an undeserved, key victory for Putin and his mafiocracy in Moscow. What is happening in Ukraine is serious, grown-up politics, and concerns about drinks parties and even Brexit pale into insignificance in the fight against corrupt autocracies that view their neighbours’ territory with envious eyes.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Right to \u0026#39snip the feed\u0026#39 of Nord Stream 2, says Boris Johnson as he imposes own sanctionsPolitics latest news: Westminster will not take lectures from SNP over \u0026#39job-destroying\u0026#39 policies, says Kwasi KwartengEmily Maitlis and Jon Sopel to leave BBCManchester Arena bomber\u0026#39s brother Hashem Abedi guilty of attacking prison officerBoris Johnson launches \u0026#39first barrage\u0026#39 of sanctions against RussiaIn pictures: Russian troops and tanks enter Ukraine More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"urban hedgehogs faring better country cousins","story":"At the end of Aesop\u0027s famous story, the country mouse flees the city for the safety of his rural idyll - but for the country hedgehog, the story would have a very different conclusion.Hedgehog populations have plummeted across the countryside since the turn of the century, but urban animals are faring better than their rural cousins, data shows.The latest State Of Britain\u0027s Hedgehogs report warns that between 30 per cent and 75 per cent of the population has been lost in rural areas in the past 20 years, with declines varying between regions and the largest falls in the eastern half of England.But there is a more hopeful picture for the animals in towns and cities, where a stable population might be recovering thanks to help from considerate gardeners and animal lovers, the report from conservation charities suggests.Analysis by the People\u0027s Trust for Endangered Species (PTES) and the British Hedgehog Preservation Society (BHPS) draws on a number of surveys carried out in rural and urban areas, and is the first to be released in four years.Records include citizen science recording schemes, animal road casualty records, and reports of accidental kills by gamekeepers.Data from 1981 to 2020 shows that hedgehogs have undergone long historic declines, but now the differing fortunes of rural and urban populations are becoming increasingly obvious.While the first State Of Britain\u0027s Hedgehogs report in 2011 estimated that a quarter of the population in urban areas had been lost in the first decade of the century, the latest data shows no evidence that the decline has continued.Rather, in cities and towns, the data suggests a a stable population that might be recovering and paints an encouraging picture for the city-dwelling animals.Data from the British Trust for Ornithology\u0027s Garden Birdwatch, where mammals can also be recorded as an option, suggests a falling trend until 2013 but then rising numbers, while data from the PTES Living with Mammals suggests that a decline has levelled off.BHPS chief executive Fay Vass said: “Greater awareness, and inidual and community actions, such as making gardens more hedgehog friendly, may be starting to help urban hedgehogs.However, urgent action is needed to understand why rural areas are no longer suitable for hedgehogs and how conservationists, farmers and land managers can work together to prevent hedgehogs from becoming extinct in the countryside.”Nida Al-Fulaij, conservation research manager at PTES and one of the report\u0027s authors, said the charity was alarmed at what was happening in rural areas and wanted to work with farmers to make landscapes more hedgehog friendly.If you picture a landscape, the greater mosaic of different habitats and varied features, and varied species within those features, the better it is not just for hedgehogs but for everything, she said.Getting hedgerows, the habitat that gives hedgehogs their name, into good condition would help, providing more and thicker hedges for food and cover, with different species such as broadleaf trees for leaves they can nest in, Ms Al-Fulaij said.Hedgehogs will also benefit from field margins that are not sprayed so there is a supply of food such as slugs, caterpillars and bugs.The crucial thing will be to increase the food availability and nesting and forage availability across the landscape.Ms Al-Fulaij said the wildlife charity supports moves to fund hedgerow creation as part of the new farming payments scheme, but warned there is also a need to make sure existing hedges are in good condition.Action is also still needed in towns and cities, where householders are advised to provide access through fences and make their gardens suitable for hedgehogs. More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Right to \u0026#39snip the feed\u0026#39 of Nord Stream 2, says Boris Johnson as he imposes own sanctionsThank God Jeremy Corbyn isn\u0026#39t in chargePolitics latest news: Westminster will not take lectures from SNP over \u0026#39job-destroying\u0026#39 policies, says Kwasi KwartengEmily Maitlis and Jon Sopel to leave BBCManchester Arena bomber\u0026#39s brother Hashem Abedi guilty of attacking prison officerBoris Johnson launches \u0026#39first barrage\u0026#39 of sanctions against RussiaMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"covid rule changes set announced","story":"All the Covid rule changes set to be announced by Boris Johnson TODAY as isolation axedCovid isolation rule changes and the date free lateral flow and PCR tests will be axed are likely in Boris Johnson’s ‘living with Covid’ plan, due to be published today.

The Prime Minister is expected to scrap all self-isolation, even for people who have the virus, from around Thursday. He is also likely to confirm the date free lateral flow and PCR tests will be axed - although is not expected to actually happen this week. The £ self-isolation payment for low-income workers and legal powers for councils both face being scrapped. And the Mirror understands he was weighing up whether to axe sick pay from day one of Covid isolation, despite fury from unions and Labour. Scroll down for the full guide to the changes - or join the debate in the commentsFor holidaymakers, Passenger Locator Forms could be simplied further, or even scrapped completelyTransport Secretary Grant Shapps gets his way.Travel testing, however, is likely to stay for unvaccinated people entering the UK for the foreseeable future. Mr Johnson is likely to give a statement to Parliament at around .pm on Monday. He could also give a press conference. Facing pressure from Tory MPs over his leadership, the PM has decided Britain has had all the restrictions it can tolerate. Speaking before his announcement on Monday, the Prime Minister said: Today will mark a moment of pride after one of the most dficult periods in our countryaposs history as we begin to learn to live with Covid. It would not be possible without the efforts of so many - the NHS who delivered the le-saving vaccine rollout at phenomenal speed, our world-leading scientists and experts, and the general public for their commitment to protecting themselves and their loved ones. The pandemic is not over but thanks to the incredible vaccine rollout we are now one step closer towards ato normality and finally giving people back their freedoms while continuing to protect ourselves and others.It comes after ministers confirmed all children over five will be able to get the Covid vaccine from April. But charities worry millions of vulnerable or immunocompromised Brits will be thrown to the wolves with little support.And the governmentaposs own scientic advisors have warned ending testing and isolation could trigger a rapid rise in cases. Here’s everything we know about what is likely to be announced.Self-isolation laws scrappedLegal Covid self-isolation is due to be scrapped - evenyou currently have the virus - from as soon as Thursday  February. The decision will end almost exactly two years of legally-enforced isolation for people who test positive. But it raises ethical dilemmas about whether to go to work and put others at risk, especiallyyou can no longer claim a £ isolation payment or sick pay from day one . Despite scrapping legal isolation, No said: “We’re not saying isolation is pointless. We’d expect anyone with an infectious disease to take steps not to spread that disease further - a colleague at work with flu, for example. Currently people who test positive must go into self-isolation for at least five full days in England, a period that has been repeatedly cut from  days and seven days. Fears Statutory Sick Pay will be stripped back Boris Johnson has been weighing up whether to scrap sick pay from day one of Covid illness, the Mirror understands.£.-a-week Statutory Sick Payis usually only available from the fourth day of any illness, after three ‘waiting days’ are complete. This was cut to the first day in  for people isolating due to Covid. Ministers said the move was “vital” to ensure people get help and follow the rules.But the power is contained in the Coronavirus Act, which is currently due to expire on March .That means it could be removed, even though No has advised people who are sick with the virus to stay away from work. TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady said: “It’s vital that sick pay remains a day one right and is made available to all. Workers who are laid low by Covid must be able to make ends meet – not pushed into financial hardship.”A date for scrapping free lateral flow testsBoris Johnson’s plan is expected to set a timetable for the end of free lateral flow tests, with people having to pay instead.The government warned last summer it would eventually stop paying for these rapid tests due to the huge cost of the NHS.Sources told the Mirror that claims the tests themselves will end this week are wide of the mark. However, the Living with Covid plan could set a date in the future for when they are cut off. It’s not known how much lateral flow tests will cost, but estimates have put it at £ for a pack of seven. A date for scrapping free PCR tests and Test and TraceIt’s thought the plan may contain a date for ending free ‘gold standard’ PCR tests as England’s Covid infrastructure is wound down. Whitehall sources told thethe Treasury is trying to cut the £bn-a-year cost, which will mean having to phase out free testing and all but ending the contact-tracing system. Scientists have raised the alarm about ending these free tests, with reports suggesting they could cost £ each privately. According to reports, only health and social care workers and .million vulnerable people will continue to get free PCRs. Prof Lawrence Young of Warwick University said: “Living with Covid doesn’t mean letting our guard down”. Covid travel Passenger Locator Form could be simplied or axed Fully-vaccinated people entering the UK do not need to take any Covid tests, under changes that happened on February . But they still need to fill in a Passenger Locator Form - albeit a ‘simplied’ one - and further changes to this are possible in this week’s Covid plan. It’s understood the Department for Transport was pressing to further simply the Passenger Locator Form - or get rid of it completely. It is thought there was only a slim chance of the form being axed altogether, as health officials were still worried about needing to track new iants coming in to the UK. Meanwhile, unvaccinated people still need to take one pre-departure test and one post-arrival test before entering the UK. It’s understood this rule will stay for the foreseeable future and no changes to it are due this week. £ self-isolation payment could be scrappedThe £ self-isolation payment for poor workers with Covid could end as the legal requirement to quarantine is scrapped. The Test and Trace Support Payment was introduced in September  to help low-wage workers afford to self-isolate for up to  days. No final decisions have been announced yet over the future of the £ payment, and its status was being considered by the government last week.  Legal powers for councils will goLegal changes will end remaining powers councils had under the  Coronavirus Act in England to close some venues. However, these powers were barely ever used, because powers for lockdowns flow from a separate law passed in . And the vast majority of Coronavirus Act powers - including on detention, events, gatherings, shops and restaurants and schools - already expired in September . Only a few of the more draconian powers - including the power to suspend port operations - remained in the Act. Vaccines for all children over five All children over five will be able to get vaccinated against Covid- from April. The “non-urgent offer” to the parents of nearly six million - year olds was confirmed by the Government moments after advice issued by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation . Two smaller doses of the Pfizer jab,  weeks apart, will be available to this age group to help control future Covid waves after Covid curbs have been lted. It is understood there are no plans for a major publicity drive to encourage this age group to be vaccinated and it will be left very much up to parents to decide. Itaposs understood a rollout for over-s will be less urgent than previous vaccine drives, due to the very low risk Covid poses to younger kids. The idea is that ordinary NHS care shouldn’t be interrupted to give kids the jab, like it was for adults. All children over  have been able to get the Pfizer Covid jab since September last year. Currently, only the most vulnerable kids aged  to  are eligible. They are offered two jabs but at a lower dose than for adults -  micrograms instead of .

The Kremlin said that Russian President Vladimir Putin and Mr Biden could set up a call or meeting at any time but there were no firm plans yet for a summit.  It comes following a flurry of late-night calls between French President Emmanuel Macron and Mr Putin. Mr Macronaposs office and the White House said details of a possible summit could be hammered out during a meeting on Thursday between US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. The development offers a glimmer of hope of a diplomatic solution but Western leaders still fear a Russian invasion of Ukraine could be imminent.More than , Russian troops are massed around Ukraineaposs borders, according to US estimates, with , along the countryaposs eastern flank and tens of thousands alongside Belarusian troops in the north.Fears have been mounting that Russia will stage  flag attacks to justy further aggression against Ukraine. A UK source told the Mirror that they believed an invasion was going to happen in the next  to  hours.  Boris Johnson warned at the weekend that Europe could be on the brink of the biggest war since  as he travelled to Munich for a crunch security conference.In a call with Mr Macron on Sunday night, the Prime Minister welcomed the prospect of a diplomatic solution and urged Mr Putin to step back from his current threats and withdraw troops from Ukraine’s border. A No spokesperson said: “The Prime Minister noted that President Putin’s commitments to President Macron were a welcome sign that he might still be willing to engage in finding a diplomatic solution. The Prime Minister stressed that Ukraine’s voice must be central in any discussions.

This was changed without any announcement from one box every  hours as the Prime Minister announced his bonfire of pandemic safeguards. Reports on social media suggest free tests have already run out locally in many areas of the country. Prices are yet to be confirmed but people may have to pay £ each or £ for a box when the change comes in from April .  Free testing, including for those with symptoms, will be scrapped for everybody apart from the most vulnerable. Twitter user Lucy Winter posted: “I have a brother and sister both with Parkinson’s, I rely on LFTs before going to see them.“Without this I cannot see them. They both just want hugs when we meet.” Rachel Charlton-Dailey posted: “Free LFTs shouldn’t be ending at all, but they at least should still be available to vulnerable people and those who care for them. “This is once again showing what this Government thinks of disabled people.” Edwin Hayward tweeted: “Chris Whitty says he would continue to take lateral flow testshe were in situations involving contacts with vulnerable people - but he can I assume afford to pay for them. “It’s good to see such a responsible attitude, but it doesn’t help the millions who can’t afford LFTs.” Twice-weekly testing for staff and students in education and childcare will end immediately, the Prime Minister confirmed on Monday.  PCR tests for most people who develop Covid symptoms will be scrapped from  April, as well as free LFTs for the majority of the population. Care home residents, hospital patients and other vulnerable groups will still be given free teststhey have symptoms. Mr Johnson said the full details of “who will continue to be entitled to free tests” will be set out in full next month. Prof Trish Greenhalgh, primary care health expert at Oxford University, said: “This announcement is not a plan for living with Covid, it is a plan for reducing spending on testing and cutting support for people who have or may have Covid. “Learning to live with Covid does not mean pretending it isn’t highly prevalent or pretending the virus is no longer dangerous.” Prof Christina Pagel, of University College London, said: “Removing self isolation requirements, financial support for self-isolation and free testing will disproportionately affect more deprived communities. “People within those communities will be less able to afford testing, less able to afford to isolate and more likely to work outside the home and so potentially infect others. “Combined with higher rates of existing health conditions and lower rates of vaccination, this is likely to lead to signicantly higher burden of Covid and its consequences in these communities compared to the least deprived.” Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: If NHS staff need tests they will be provided with free tests - that will be a decision for the NHS. Even before Covid, the NHS has always sensibly made a decision on tests and keeping their staff safe, because keeping staff safe means keeping their patients safe and itaposs always about patient safety.

Mandatory self-isolation will be axed from Thursday, £ isolation payments and Day One sick pay will go, and free tests will be axed from April  - with a -hour limit already in place to stop stockpiling. The Prime Minister said testing, tracing and isolation cost £bn in January alone adding: Those who would wait for a total end to this war... would be restricting the liberties of the British people for a long time to come.But the SNP said he was scrambling to save his own skin from Tory MPs angry about Partygate, while Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: This is a half-baked announcement from a Government paralysed by chaos and incompetence.It is not a plan to live well with Covid.Phillip Anderson, Head of Policy at the MS Society, warned over , immunocompromised people do not know how they can live safely alongside the virus.Lobby Akinnola, spokesperson for Covid- Bereaved Families for Justice, said: People will die directly because of the decision to scrap free testing, and those deaths are avoidable. Just as the Government was late starting testing, costing thousands of lives, they are going to be too early finishing it, with the same consequence.The Scottish and Welsh governments are furious as No confirmed neither they, nor the NHS in England, will get new money for testing beyond April.The refusal to give any extra money prompted a last-minute delay to the plan after a row at the highest levels of government. Hereaposs what was announced today and what it means for you.February : Testing advice ends in schoolsEngland’s guidance for staff and students in schools to do regular lateral flow testing is being removed immediately. They may remain for some settings like special schools but details were not immediately available. Guidance previously said: Staff and secondary school pupils should continue to test twice weekly at home, with lateral flow devicetest kits, - days apart. Testing remains voluntary but is strongly encouraged. February : Limit on how many tests you can getAs of today you can no longer get more than one box of lateral flow tests in a -hour period. It was previously a  hour period. This is to stop a rush of people stockpiling them before April , when free tests end .February : Self-isolation laws scrappedMandatory Covid self-isolation in England will be scrapped - evenyou have the virus - from .am on Thursday  February. The decision will end almost exactly two years of legally-enforced isolation for people who test positive. The legal obligation to tell your employeryou have to self-isolate will also end.But adults and children will still beadvisedto stay at homethey test positive.Between Thursday and the end of March, youaposll be advised to isolate for five days as long as you test negative twice,  hours apart at the end of that period - as is the case now. New advicewill apply from April . That raises ethical dilemmas about whether to go to work and put others at risk, especially as you can no longer claim a £ isolation payment or sick pay from day one . Despite scrapping legal isolation, No earlier said: “We’re not saying isolation is pointless. We’d expect anyone with an infectious disease to take steps not to spread that disease further - a colleague at work with flu, for example. February : Close contacts no longer have to test or isolateThe government will no longer ask vaccinated or child contacts of Covid cases in England to test themselves for  days. It will also remove the legal requirement for unvaccinated close contacts to self isolate, all from .am on Thursday.February : £ self-isolation payment scrappedThe £ self-isolation payment for poor workers with Covid will end from .am on Thursday.The Test and Trace Support Payment was introduced in September  to help low-wage workers afford to self-isolate for up to  days. Unions and Labour are worried its removal will force people to go to work, putting their colleagues at risk of infection.The medicine delivery service will no longer be available. February : Routine contact-tracing and council powers endRoutine contact-tracing will end in England as the UKaposs infrastructure for dealing with Covid is wound down. So will a set of domestic laws - the Health Protectionregulations - which gave councils powers to enact closures in their area.March : Sick pay and ESA from day one will endPeople who fall ill with Covid will no longer be eligible for immediate aposDay Oneapos sick pay from March . The law willto how it was before Covid, where you donapost get SSP for the first three days youaposre ill and only get it from Day Four. The same will happen to Employment and Support Allowancewhich willfrom Day One to Day Eight. People will no longer be eligible for ESAisolating due to Covid. Itaposs despite widespread calls for the Government to boost statutory sick pay - which is currently £.-a-week - so those struggling financially are not tempted to go back to work. TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady said: “The government is creating needless hardship and taking a sledgehammer to public health. The failure to provide decent sick pay to all – from the first day of illness - is reckless and self-defeating. Dan Shears of the GMB union said: “Today’s nonsensical announcement guarantees workers will attend the workplace with Covid. Restoring the three day limit is an act of national self-sabotage.April : Free lateral flow tests for the general public will endFrom April  the vast majority of people must paythey want a lateral flow test - eventhey have a cough and fever. No has said spending £bn a month on free tests is not an effective use of taxpayers’ money at this point. This has prompted a furious row with Labour, some medics and the Scottish and Welsh governments - which will get no new moneythey want to continue free tests. It’s not known how much lateral flow tests will cost, but No is seeking a regulated market where each test costs a low single-figure number of pounds. This suggests a box of seven could cost £-.Asymptomatic tests for NHS workers will be made available but not routinely, only as a surge effort where thereaposs an outbreak. But they will be available for care home residents. Exact lists of those eligible are being drawn up.UNISON general secretary Christina McAnea said: “The government has taken leave of its senses. Ditching every last Covid safety rule while thousands are still catching the virus every day is irresponsible. “Ending free tests for the public is a foolish move. Most people will simply stop testing because they can’t afford to check their Covid status. April : Free PCR tests will end for the vast majorityThe capacity to do hundreds of thousands of aposgold standardapos PCR tests a day will be wound down dramatically from April  in England. Youaposll no longer be able to order a free PCRyou have symptoms and go to a walk-in or drive-through centre, or get it in the post. There will be some exceptions to this, including the over-s, the immunosuppressed, and patients on NHS wards. Exact lists of those eligible are still being drawn up. Scientists have raised the alarm about ending these free tests, with reports suggesting they could cost £ each privately. Some of the UKaposs lab capacity for PCR tests will be maintained, but not all of it. UKHSA are determining precisely what right level is, to ensure there’s enough to scale upthere’s a new iant. The network of testing centres is already being scaled back and will continue to be reduced. April : New guidance for workplaces and Covid passes wound downThe legal need for firms to consider Covid- in risk assessments will be removed, except- for example - they are a lab that handles the virus. The Government will replace the existing set of ‘Working Safely’ guidance with new public health guidance. The plan says: Employers should continue to consider the needs of employees at greater risk from COVID-, including those whose immune system means they are at higher risk of serious illness from COVID-. The Government will consult with employers and businesses to ensure guidance continues to support them to manage the risk of COVID- in workplaces. The plan adds: From  April, the Government will remove the current guidance on domestic voluntary COVID-status certication and will no longer recommend that certain venues use the NHS COVID Pass. The NHS COVID Pass will remain available within the NHS App for a limited period. People will continue to be able to access their vaccination status for international travel.Date TBC: End of mandatory masks on Londonaposs public transport London Mayor Sadiq Khan said he expects rules on wearing face coverings on the Transport for London network will be lted following the Governmentaposs announcements.Following the Government dropping all legal Covid restrictions, and in light of falling infection levels in London, it is expected that wearing a face covering will no longer be a condition of carriage on the TfL network, he said. However, we know that face coverings remain a simple, effective measure that give Londoners confidence to travel, and following clear advice from public health advisers, TfL will likely continue to recommend their use on the network.Staying in place: Covid travel rules Fully-vaccinated people entering the UK do not need to take any Covid tests, under changes that happened on February . But they still need to fill in a Passenger Locator Form - albeit a ‘simplied’ one - and no further changes have been announced today. It’s understood the Department for Transport was pressing to further simply the Passenger Locator Form - or get rid of it completely. But this has not yet come to pass. Meanwhile, unvaccinated people still need to take one pre-departure test and one post-arrival test before entering the UK. It’s understood this rule will stay for the foreseeable future and no changes to it are due this week. There will be a review of these rules before Easter.  Staying in place: Surveillance and surge powersOfficials said the government will maintain strong domestic surveillance, including the ONS Covid infection survey to spot new iants, and the Siren and Vivaldi studies.There will also be measures to ramp up testing in the NHSneeded in future. SAGE experts have already warned a new iant could be more deadly than the original form of Covid - rather than less deadly, like Omicron. From Spring: A fourth dose of vaccine for over-s and the vulnerablePeople over  and the clinically vulnerable will be offered another Covid jab from the Spring. A second booster jab has been recommended for over-s by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation , which applies to around . million people. It will also be offered to around , immunosuppressed people, some of whom have already had a third dose and a booster. Anyone eligible can come forward to get another vaccine regardless of whether they have had three of four doses - as long as there has been a six month gap since their last jab. Vaccine experts are also planning for a wider booster programme for more of the population in the autumn. The JCVI said it will confirm which sections of the population would qualy for this nearer the time.Health Secretary Sajid Javid has accepted the recommendations for fourth doses, which is a “precautionary strategy to maintain high levels of immunity”.The extra spring dose is advised around six months after the last vaccine dose for over-s, those living in an elderly care home and anyone aged over  who is immunosuppressed.From April: Vaccines for all children over five All children over five will be able to get vaccinated against Covid- from April. The “non-urgent offer” to the parents of nearly six million - year olds was confirmed by the Government moments after advice issued by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation . Two smaller doses of the Pfizer jab,  weeks apart, will be available to this age group to help control future Covid waves after Covid curbs have been lted. It is understood there are no plans for a major publicity drive to encourage this age group to be vaccinated and it will be left very much up to parents to decide. Itaposs understood a rollout for over-s will be less urgent than previous vaccine drives, due to the very low risk Covid poses to younger kids. The idea is that ordinary NHS care shouldn’t be interrupted to give kids the jab, like it was for adults. All children over  have been able to get the Pfizer Covid jab since September last year. Currently, only the most vulnerable kids aged  to  are eligible. They are offered two jabs but at a lower dose than for adults -  micrograms instead of .

Defence Secretary Ben Wallace told the Commons yesterday that he had ordered his officials to review the earlier decision by a discredited medal committee not to award a gong.The move came just three hours after the Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman brushed off calls for a national apology to mark the th anniversary of Britainaposs first bomb test later this year. The chaotic scenes followed the Mirroraposs report yesterday of Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham telling veterans they were victims of the greatest injustice of them all. He said: The Prime Minister of this country, whoever that is at the time that it needs to be done, needs to stand at the despatch box in the House of Commons and make a national apology to each and every one of you, and every member of your families. Labour also called for medals, a full compensation package, NHS priority treatment, and medical research into the litany of ill health reported by test veterans and their families.Yesterday lunchtime, the PMaposs spokesman shrugged off any suggestion of an apology, telling the Mirror: These veterans played a valuable role towards developing a nuclear deterrent that has ultimately kept Britain safe for decades. “The protection, health and welfare of those involved in the nuclear testing operations is a vital consideration, as shown by the detailed, documented safety measures and radio-biological monitoring that took place during operations.  “When it comes to medals, thataposs a matter for the Advisory Military Sub-Committee which takes those issues into account.” Asked about compensation, the spokesman said: “I’m not aware of any plans along those lines.” We reported last week how the AMSC has refused gongs to five dferent groups of veterans in the past two years, while its members have been decorated for non-risky service that included charity work, organising the Invictus Games, and running Whitehall budgets. It has refused a service medal for the nuclear tests three times, claiming there was not enough risk and rigour to them.  But the government changed its tone later in the afternoon, when Andrew Gwynne, Labour MP for Denton and Reddish, asked the Commons: The UK is now the only atomic nation with no official recognition or compensation to nuclear test veterans and their families. Ahead of the th anniversary of the first British nuclear test later this year, will ministers now do the right thing and give those veterans the recognition they deserve  Defence Secretary Ben Wallace, a former captain in the Scots Guards, replied: I hear what the honourable gentleman says and I absolutely recognise that we are now the last country to do so. The recent, the last internal review was in December, Iaposve asked officials to go back and look at that again.  He later told MPs that he could not personally order a medal himself. The Mirror has campaigned for justice for survivors of the nuclear tests for more than  years. Successive governments have refused to compensate them, and no PM since Winston Churchill ordered the first test in  has ever met them. Boris Johnson promised to meet them in November, but has yet to find time to meet them in Downing Street.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Boris JohnsonPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Its p spaghetti is, like the proleration of food banks in the UK, a treatment of the symptom of poverty.We need to address the cause. The responsibility for the welfare and wellbeing of our most vulnerable citizens should not rest on the shoulders of charities, nor supermarkets. It’s easy to paint the large ­corporations as the villains, but questions need to be asked as to why people need p spaghetti and p pasta to survive in one of the richest economies in the world.  And the answers lie squarely at the well-heeled feet of those who have held the purse strings and policies of the country for the last  long and dismal years. Those years of austerity cuts to social care and health services mean the safety net of a decent and supportive society is less than threadbare. The triple threat of rocketing food prices, unmanageable energy bills, and an underfunded National Health Service is going to cause long-term damage to families, communities, and ­iniduals in almost every ­neighbourhood in the country. Every area now has at least one foodbank we live in a society where people need the ad-hoc macro philanthropy of neighbours and strangers to not starve to death.  Over the last two years of the pandemic, the Chancellor has proven time and again that he can magic up a whole orchard of flourishing and evergreen money trees when it comes to propping up his pet projects. Writing off £.billion of furlough fraud, £.billion “lost” down the back of the Downing Street couch, supposedly spent on PPE nobody has any record of, not even the company that received the payment. That money alone could have paid for TWO YEARS of the continuation of the £ uplt to Universal Credit. Somehow there is always money for crony contracts, Parliamentary p*ss-ups, weaponry and warfare, and DWP cover-ups, because it comes at the expense of social care, school dinners, and starving pensioners. So while I welcome the ­reappearance of budget groceries on the supermarket shelves as an ­immediate-term relief for millions of people struggling to make ends meet, and while I will continue to write recipes for p a head and publish them for free on my website, I’m determined that we work towards building a world where neither of those things are essential any more.

If today, you were constructing the best model for a European trade organisation, would it resemble the bloated, bureaucratic, monolith run by unelected, mediocre, pro-German civil servants called the EU  And more than half the country, predominantly older people staunchly proud of Britain’s history and its ­constitutional monarchy, thought not. Well, I’d like to ask them,they were constructing a model British state today, would they have a Windsor at the head of it  Park this year’s fairy-tale narrative about the past seven decades being one long, glorious reign, and focus on the past few days. The heir to the throne faces a police investigation over claims his advisers fixed a CBE for a Saudi tycoon who had given a fortune to one of his charities. Charles denies any knowledge of a deal but can’t deny secretly meeting the tycoon in Saudi Arabia, welcoming him to Clarence House, and giving him the CBE at Buckingham Palace.  The Queen’s second oldest son has just agreed a reported £million payoff to a woman who claimed he raped her when she was , as a minor under US law, which he denies. In fact he denies ever meeting her. So we’re expected to believe he’s just given £million to a complete stranger. And the royals won’t denysome of his hush money comes from the Queen’s Duchy of Lancaster tax-deductible fund. Which would effectively mean taxpayers crowdfunding the Duke of York’s escape route from a child sex scandal. He still retains that title, despite York MP Rachael Maskell demanding it be removed after a poll claimed % of York citizens don’t want him shaming their city. He will also remain a Queen’s ­Counsellor of State. I can’t wait to hear how he counsels her on legislation about sex trafficking. The views of York’s citizens are deemed irrelevantbecause in our monarchical system, subjects cannot question royals. I would love to hear MPs debate the issues around Charles and Andrew, and how much, and for how long, the Queen knew of her son’s connections to his convicted paedophile friend. And the morality behind Buckingham Palace finally ordering Andrew to settle the allegations against him to save the precious Platinum Jubilee. But our elected representatives cannot mention such issues in the Commons, just as we can’t see how much royals leave in their wills, because as Parliamentary bible Erskine May states: “No question can be put which brings the name of the Sovereign or the ­influence of the Crown directly before Parliament, or which casts reflections upon the ­Sovereign or the Royal Family.” Hence why MPs are forced to take an oath of allegiance to the monarch and all their heirs. What a ludicrous, humiliating stitch-up. All to keep these accidents of birth ruling over us. And to think, most Brits believe the EU is an anti-democratic gravy train which keeps charlatans in clover, while our “democracy” is the envy of the world. I’d love to think this week will convince royalists that this family they idolise is not only not better than theirs, some of its members are far worse. And we should bin the whole feudal farce once the Queen dies. But I’d be kidding myself.

Cullen and Ola, who met at the University of Lincoln, spent around £, on their new kitchen, compared to the average UK cost of about £,. The pair were working in creative advertising when they decided to buy a house together in . After the sale had been completed, they started their massive renovation - which collided with the first Covid lockdown in March  - during which they were both furloughed. The best friends, who share their project on TikTok @bricks.and.disorder, made the most of their extra free time and threw themselves into the project, taking on almost every aspect of the renovation on their own. “We were furloughed for  months, and in that time we started learning how to do DIY because we had no choice,” they joked. For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here Now, they’ve revamped around % of the house - but the kitchen is where they reckon they’ve made one of their biggest savings. “One of the first things we did was focus on the damp problem,” the pair told The Mirror. They added most people would get experts in to fix damp problems, which can be very costly. Cullen and Ola took a dferent approach. “We watched lots of YouTube videos, called the damp experts and got more information on what they intended to do. Then we used that information to do the damp proofing ourselves,” they said. “We also discovered the floor was completely rotten with dry rot and wet rot - that was a bad day.”The pair used wooden joists instead of concrete to fix the problem, as it was a much cheaper option. After solving the issues with the floor, Cullen and Ola also realised part of the ceiling was missing from a “botched job” a few years earlier - and it nearly had disastrous consequeces. “When you’re living with people whilst you’re renovating, sometimes accidents can happen. “For example our friend walked into the room above the kitchen whilst it had no floor - but it did have a carpet. Luckily he didn’t fall through, we still don’t know how.” Once the structural problems had been solved, the pair made a saving of £, on the kitchen cabinets - which they ditched in favour of shelves instead.Another cost-saving choice the pair made was on the kitchen tiles - or lack thereof. Instead of tiling the kitchen walls, the pair used washable paint which was a much cheaper option.In terms of the appliances they used to kit out the room, the pair said they took a “thrty” approach - buying a “pretty much new” fridge from Gumtree for £.The pair admit there were some things they couldn’t scrimp on, like the extractor fan and the sinkand tap . They also had to use their fingernails to open the kitchen drawersfor weeks while they decided on which handles they wanted to buy - which came to a total of £. Since the pair plastered the walls in the house, Cullen and his girlfriend Bethhave been living there while Ola lived with his mum in London.Although they agree it’s possible to live in a house while it’s being done up, they said: “It’s definitely not an experience we’d wish on anyone. “Inconsistent electricity, dusty air, moisture from the plaster, sometimes running water but sometimes not - it was tough,” they said. The pals said the main thing they’ve learnt is not to try and renovate the whole house at once - which didn’t leave them much space to actually live in. Their advice to anyone  looking to take on their own DIY project at home is to do your research before getting to work. They said: “We spent hours researching on YouTube, making calls and double checking with any family friends we could get hold of. “Be prepared to make mistakes, because we definitely did. Make sure to protect yourself - financially with backup funds and physically with masks, steel toe boots, helmets and goggles. “It helps to invest in good tools.” While the pair have taken on an enormous amount of the work themselves, they want people to ask for helpthey need it. “Sometimes it’s ok to pay to get a job done and not do it yourselfit saves you stress.”Have you taken on a massive DIY project  Email jessica.taylor@reachplcRead MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Gumtreeproperty news\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts from our Property Market newsletterSubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

If you sell goods to the EU, or buy goods from the EU and bring them into the UK, you need to be able to prove that they meet the new rules of origin requirements to access preferential tarfs. It’s vital you understand the new rules to keep your business moving. To benefit from the preferential tarfs, you must have proof that any goods you import from the EU originate there, or any goods you export to the EU originate in the UK. Proof of origin can either be a statement of origin completed by the exporter, or evidence of the importer’s knowledge of where products originate. If you cannot prove the origin, you or your EU customer may be liable to pay the full rate of customs duty and could face penalties. Andrew Macleod, founder of London-based restaurant brand Emilia’s Crafted Pasta, explains that imports from the EU are vital to his brand: “We import ingredients directly from Italy, including special cured meats, cheeses, drinks and alcohol. Each of our suppliers is hand-picked.”  Has he had to make any changes to his business now that there are new import rules in place  “Yes – of course we already knew the origin of all the goods we import as we source everything carefully. But we’ve trained two of our managers on the rules around importing, so we know that we have staff in house who are well versed in the process.”  And having successfully navigated the changes, what advice would Andrew offer other businesses that import  “We found using a customs agent really helps the process run smoothly, but it’s equally important that you understand the rules yourself,” he says. “It’s not too late, and the gov.uk site has lots of valuable information.”  You must be able to prove the origin of any product you import You can choose to work with a freight forwarder or courier To benefit from preferential tarfs, you must be able to prove that any goods you import originated in the EU Note:you’re moving goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, rules of origin work dferently.

He said: We looked out of the window upstairs and saw the first two trees laying across the electricity cable. He said they were the two biggest in the garden, standing at around twice the height of the house.Five minutes later, another gust took down the other five trees.It was a little bit of a shock to see what was a wooded garden flattened, the retired banker said, adding that his eight-year-old daughter was particularly upset because she was attached to the garden and her swings hanging from the trees.  The fallen power lines sparked two small electrical fires, which took firefighters  hours to extinguish, in the familyaposs orchard. On Monday, energy minister Greg Hands visited the home to see the damage wrought by the storms. He said some , homes were still without power and that Storm Franklin had hampered recovery efforts. Energy crews in high-visibility jackets were working in Mr Thomasaposs garden to cut up the uprooted trees and hoist the wires back up to reconnect them to the network. They expected power to be restored by the evening. Mr Thomas said: We always knew that, once they arrived, it would take two days.  He said it was a little bit frustrating but understandable that the power company had prioritised getting the hundreds of houses in the village up and running before tackling their isolated problem. He was glad the trees had not fallen towards the house. The power going out was awful for everybody but itaposs better than the house being wrecked, he said.The family have stayed warm with a wood burner and cooked eggs and sausages in a pan over the fire.Mr Thomas said: A good friend lent us a generator so we could get light when it got dark on Friday night, then about cooking we got the BBQ out. You just get on with it really. The first night was quite exciting for the children it got a little bit less exciting the second day and the third day. Mr Thomas said the family grew so tired of the conditions that they stayed in a hotel on Sunday night.

Angharad Williamson, , and partner John Cole, , allegedly killed little Logan Mwangi before throwing him in the body of water just  metres from the family home, the court was told.A teen boy, who canapost be named for legal reasons, is also accused of taking part in the murder - and all three are charged with allegedly reporting his disappearance to cover up the killing. Logan was reported missing to police by his mother - only for his body to be discovered in the river in a neighbouring park. In total, a pathologist found  external injuries to Loganaposs head, face, trunk, arms and legs which were caused by blunt force trauma, Prosecutor Caroline Rees QC told jurors at Cardf Crown Court today .It was apparent that Logan had died before his body was placed in the river, she added. The prosecution say that Logan died as a result of a brutal and sustained assault upon him which happened inside the home, she said. It is the use of forceful violence which caused the catastrophic injuries found at post mortem. Williamson, Cole, and the teenage boy are all accused of murder and perverting the course of justice. Describing Logan as a “polite, kind and caring” youngster, Ms Rees accused each of the defendants of playing their own part in his killing.Ms Rees said: Logan was described by those who knew and loved him in during his short le as a lovely little boy, Chatty, polite, kind and caring. He was five years old when his body was found by police in the River Ogmore in Pandy Park, Bridgend. Logan was murdered and each of the defendants played their part in killing him. Logan would not have stood a chance against any one of these defendants, let alone three of them acting together.  Having killed Logan behind closed doors in the family home they each played their part in covering up the circumstances of his death. Each were desperate to save themselves and each prioritised their self-preservation over everything , in particular over the needs of Logan. He would not have stood a chance against any one of the defendants, let alone three of them acting together. Ms Rees said mum Williamson phoned  at .am to ly report Logan missing, and was crying down the phone and sounding asshe were hyperventilating. The court heard she told police she had left the back gate open and then set to blame another woman for kidnapping Logan. Ms Rees said: She appeared to be distressed and asshe were hyperventilating. This was an elaborate charade. The court heard Logan suffered severe injuries compared to a fall from a great height or a high velocity road traffic collision.  Ms Rees said: Logan had suffered severe injuries to his internal organs and brain. His brain suffered suffered trauma and he had  external injuries including to the head, face, to the trunk, arms and legs. Logan was reported missing from his flat in Lower Llansantffraid, Sarn, Bridgend, in the morning of July  last year before his body was found a short while later. Ms Rees said: Logan was disposed of by the defendants asfly-tipping. Judge Mrs Justice Jefford told jurors: Cases that relate to a personaposs death are as serious as you as a jury can be entrusted to deal with. The death of anyone, particularly the death of a child, may give rise to serious feelings or emotions. In any part it is important you put your emotions to one side and judge this case on careful and thoughtful consideration of the evidence. Williamson and Cole appeared in the dock at Cardf Crown Court while the youngster appeared via videolink from another room inside the court building. Williamson and the teenage boy deny murder and perverting the course of justice.Cole denies murder but admits perverting the course of justice. Cardf Crown Court heard the three are accused of moving Loganaposs body from his home to an area near the River Ogmore at Pandy Park in Sarn, Bridgend. The charge states they moved Loganaposs clothing to the same area and allegedly washed his blood-stained bedsheets and phoned police to ly report him as missing saying his location was unknown. Logan - also known as Logan Williamson - had been reported missing by his mother before his body was discovered just  metres from his home in the Ogmore River in Bridgend, South Wales, on July . A court previously heard the youngster suffered “extreme pain” in an attack before he was found following a search. Cole is represented by David Elias QC, Williamson by Peter Rouch QC and the youth by John Hipkin QC. The trial, expected to last up to eight weeks, continues.Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON MurderCourt caseCrown courtMurder trialCrime\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Their relationship was still secret, so most of their early dates took place in private restaurants or at each otheraposs homes where they knew they were safe from prying eyes. But as they grew stronger, they started venturing out into the outside world. While in Meghanaposs Canadian hometown, Toronto, the pair wanted to celebrate Halloween, so they came up with a plan.Meghan revealed that she and Harry, along with Princess Eugenie and her now-husband Jack Brooksbank went on a night out at Soho House in Toronto - but to make sure nobody recognised them, they went in disguise. Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm.Click here to sign up.Meghan cast her mind back to the night while having a chat withEllen DeGeneres in a talk show interview.She said: He came to see me in Toronto and our friends and his cousin Eugenie and now her husband Jack, they came as well. And the four of us snuck out in Halloween costumes to just have one fun night on the town before it was out in the world that we were a couple. Ellen said: So you went with Harry to a Halloween party and they had no idea it was the two of you  Meghan confirmed this, saying: It was a post-apocalypse theme, so we had all this very bizarre costuming on, and we were able to just have one fun final night out. But it was this night that Prince Harry received a call that would change their relationship forever.In an unauthorized biography, Finding Freedom, authors Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand, the authors said the pair were having the perfect night out - until they received a call from one of Harryaposs aides at Kensington Palace. It wasnapost good news. The couple were told that the press had discovered they were dating. The next day, their relationship would be announced all over the world. So, the Halloween party was the last opportunity that Meghan and Harry would be able to celebrate their relationship privately.It appears Eugenie has remained close to Harry following his and Meghanaposs choice to stand down from the royal family, as they were seen together at the Super Bowl in the US last week. The royal pair were pictured together in the stands - although were without Meghan and Eugenieaposs husband Jack. According to royal expert and biographer Duncan Larcombe, Eugenie publicly supporting Harry at the Super Bowl shows she is breaking ranks from the rest of the royals. He told OK!: The royals have stayed quite consistent and firm when it comes to Harry and Meghan, as we’ve seen. Eugenie is breaking ranks from the rest of the royals by being seen so publicly to endorse Harry and Meghan in their new le. It endorses what they said about the royals. There are those that think that Eugenie is Harry’s only hope of him being brought back in should things not work out in paradise, so at least he is talking to someone in the Royal Family. By seeing Eugenie there, it looks like the only link he still has with his family.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

Graham Wellings, , had unwittingly cycled away from a crime scene with two hand grenades in his rucksack when police wielding guns suddenly pinned him to the ground. The dramatic scene unfolded before almost  residents of Gorse Hill in Stretford, Manchester, in January last year, when the armyaposs bomb squad had to be called in as the area was evacuated. But Mr Wellings was cleared of all criminal charges after he told a crown court judge that he thought it was cannabis inside the bag, not bombs.Minshull Street Crown Court heard how the police operation to uncover a drugs and guns gang had started with a search of garages beside Milton Court on Tuesday January , last year, the ManchesterEveningNews reports. As the activity continued, the outfitaposs boss, Nathan Morgan had become increasingly paranoid and summoned Mr Wellings to move a package infor clearing a £ drug debt. Morgan, , called a member of his drugs gang, Gary Davies, on the nearby Lakes estate. Daviesapos flat boasted an industrial drugs press and he was a central figure in the class A drugs supply operation. At the behest of Morgan, Davies summoned Mr Wellings, who at one time lived at Daviesapos flat, and handed him an empty rucksack and a bike, the court had heard. Mr Wellings cycled across Stretford to Milton Court, where Morgan gave him a package containing two live hand grenades, despite the heavy police presence in the area.  Mr Wellings had no idea he was being watched by undercover police as he cycled away believing he was carrying a package of cannabis and not smuggling grenades. A user of heroin and cocaine, he claimed he had been duped into taking away the explosives and had only reluctantly agreed to move the package to wipe out his debt. During trial, Mr Wellings said he aposwould have been absolutely insaneapos to agree to smuggle the grenades. I was taking a risk. I just thought it was only a couple of hundred pounds of class B, you know, he said. But moments after he cycled away from the scene, he was apprehended by several armed officers, who opened the drawstring bag to reveal the explosives.  The discovery prompted a huge evacuation of all  residents in the area. A jury found Wellings, of Church Road in Stretford, not guilty of conspiracy to possess explosives, namely two hand-grenades. He was also acquitted of conspiracy to supply heroin and cocaine. Gang boss, Morgan had controlled the operation from his flat and a number of others with the help of several gang members. Morgan previously pleaded guilty to possessing the grenades and ammunition found in the cupboard, and conspiracy to supply class A drug. Morgan and four colleagues in his cocaine, heroin and cannabis supply racket will be sentenced at a future date.

Anna Collyer, , from Morden in south London, had a transvaginal mesh fitted in  but has been left in agony following the procedure. Her painful symptoms have persisted despite doctors partially removing the mesh last summer.She worked as a carer in the same care home for  years but had to give up work due to the pain sheaposs suffering, MyLondon reports.She had the mesh fitted at St Helier hospital in Sutton, a controversial procedure previously used to treat mild incontinence, which is a condition that can lead to women leaking from their bladder when doing impact activities such as running and jumping, or when sneezing or coughing.  The mesh is a net-like implant and aims to give permanent support to the weakened organs and to repair damaged tissue. The mesh implants are meant to be permanent, but Anna started to experience severe pain last April when the mesh cut into her organs, leaving her unable to live any sort of le anymore. I could feel something sharp inside me, she said. The pain relief tablets were not touching it. I was in agony. Itaposs got to the stage now where  minutes is all I can walk, because the pain is excruciating. I have pain in pelvis, groin, hips, back and shooting pains in legs. The level is horrendous. I have to lie down all the time. “A good day is not being in bed. I just have to lie in the foetal position and not move. Its like a poison. I would rather be wetting myself.  After having to stop work, she now has to receive signicant support from her family - including husband Gary and three children Toby, Adam and Cassie. Her daughter Cassie said: She was an active, fun-loving person who was always up for a laugh. It is unfair and saddening she cannot enjoy le as normal anymore. The vaginal mesh procedure was once commonplace in the UK, with more than , women receiving one between April  and March  in England alone. Early trial data suggested the mesh was effective, shorter procedure with less risks compared to a full open-surgery. But the treatment was “paused” and The Independent Medicines and Medical Devices Safety Review was ordered by the then health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, in  amid mounting safety concerns.Women told the review team of “excruciating chronic pain feeling like razors inside their body and felt dismissed when reporting complications including “unacceptable labelling of so many symptoms as ‘normal’ and attributable to ‘women’s problems’”, the report says. The new review accuses medial professionals of displaying “an institutional and professional resistance” to changing practice. The report concluded that “those harmed are due not only an apology, but better care and support through specialist centres”. Anna claims doctors never advised her of the complications before fitting the MESH  years ago.Anna is on the NHS waiting list to have the mesh removed, but was told she would likely have to wait at least nine months but it could be up to two years - due to the Covid- pandemic causing huge delays. She was referred to The London Complex Mesh Centre- an organisation set up in  in response to NHS England’s call for the provision of care for women experiencing complications.  Instead of waiting for the NHS procedure, she is fundraising for private treatment, with costs for the surgery ranging from £, to £,.I am deteriorating, she said. Iaposm terried of how bad it will get. The meshes can damage organs. Having the mesh taken out is a very risky operation and not enough doctors are trained in how to do it. One Scottish MP recently backed a Bill to reimburse women waiting for expensive mesh removal surgery.A spokesperson for Epsom and St Helier hospitals, where Anna was treated, said: “We are sorry to hear Ms Collyer is unhappy with aspects of her care. While patients undergoing this procedure receive a pre-operative consultation, we would welcome the opportunity to meet Ms Collyerthere is further support we can offer.”The Trust say they are following national specialist pathways for the treatment of this condition.You can donate to Annaaposs fundraiser here.

The message was found by a member of the public late last month and could provide clues as to the whereabouts of the chef who was last seen  years ago.Photo evidence of the tribute shows a small bouquet of flowers placed next to a laminated missing personaposs photo of Claudia. On the bottom of the page, there is a chilling note written in block capitals that reads she is in the water, with two arrows pointing in one direction. There is also a separate note that says god bless her on one side of the page.  Family spokesperson Martin Dales said the tribute was originally found on January . It could be interpreted in all sorts of ways, he said. There are clearly many parts that make up the jigsaw, and after  years it is high time the truth becomes clear and the publicaposs vigilance in reporting information is vital. Information is going to find the answers here. Itaposs really down to people to keep coming forward with information. I donapost know what to think. Itaposs an unusual situation for a member of the public to come across something like this.  While the exact location hasnapost been revealed, itaposs understood the tribute wasnapost discovered at Sand Hutton gravel pits, near York, where investigations took place last September. During those investigations, specialist officers conducted a fingertip examination of the site, eight miles from Claudiaaposs home. On that occasion, around  cops were involved in combing the popular fishing site for clues, which included trimming back woodland near the two lakes. Specialist search teams also pumped water for around a week, with one lake at the site left almost empty. No one has heard from Claudia since she called her mother Joan on the evening of March , .She failed to arrive for work at York University the next day and was reported missing by her father, Peter. The disappearance remains unexplained and is now treated by North Yorkshire Police as suspected murder. Tragically, her father died earlier this year aged  without finding out what had happened to his daughter. Mr Lawrence spearheaded a nationwide search for his daughter Claudia, which cost police around £m over the last decade. Nine people have been questioned, but no charges have ever been brought. Martin paid tribute to Mr Lawrence, with whom he had enjoyed a -year friendship, following the update.  He said: He asked me to do this - to keep his daughter Claudiaaposs name in public lights and not forgotten by the authorities looking for her. On a personal level, I miss Peter hugely after nearly  years of friendship and over  years of seeking out with him what has happened to Claudia. However, a spokesman for North Yorkshire Police said: The person who left the item has been identied as a spiritualist and they have been spoken to by the investigation team. There are no substantive links to the inquiry.

Abdul Samad, , snatched his chance to prey on the -year-old as she waited for her cab at am on a street in Glasgow, Scotland.The predator convinced the woman he was a private hire driver before assaulting her multiple times as he drove his hot food delivery route. Samad was found guilty of sexually assaulting the woman at Glasgow Sherf Court, reports the Daily Record.But he failed to appear for the verdict or sentencing and a warrant has been issued for his arrest.The victim, now , said that the experience was so traumatic she was placed on antidepressants and developed an eating disorder. In the hours before the attack, the woman had been drinking with friends in Glasgow and then gone to a palaposs flat just after am.  Her friend called an Uber at am, because the victimaposs phone was out of battery, and she walked to a nearby street to meet the driver. Within minutes, a silver Nissan Primera across the road spotted her and slowed down so she waved thinking it was her Uber. Samad, who was behind the wheel, crossed to stop in front of her and she approached the window. The girl said: “The car slowed down so I wrongly identied it as my taxi. I told him where I was going and he said he could take me.” The victim said she got in the front seat because it made her feel more in control. She said there was a Just Eat delivery bag and a child carrier in the back seat of married father of two Samad’s car. But as soon as she got in, Samad sped on to the nearby M on-ramp heading east, the opposite direction to her parents’ home. She said: “Before we even reached the motorway he started acting inappropriately. He asked whether I had any undergarments on and touched my leg. “He told me to relax and stop crying multiple times.” As they sped along the M, Samad grabbed her hand and thrust it down his trousers. He then continued to sexually assault her in a prolonged ordeal. She said: “He alternated doing that all the way on the motorway. I felt too scared to stop him. He was so much bigger than me. I tried to ignore him and just stared out the window. I was crying the whole time.”Ten minutes before Samad picked her up, he was captured laughing on CCTV collecting an order fromtakeaway the Guru Grill in the city’s Oswald street.To make the delivery, he took junction A off the M at Tollcross and headed along London Road and stopped outside his customer’s house while his victim was too petried to move. He even ed to his car to retrieve a money bag while waiting for his customer, claiming he feared his victim might steal it. The young woman said that she was “frozen” by fear and didn’t dare to escape or scream while Samad did his delivery. She said: “I was so far from home. I was frozen by what had happened. I was too scared. “I just wasn’t sure what this man was capable of.” Samad’s sht was finishing, so when he ed to the car, he told the weeping girl he would take her home. Now heading on the M west, Samad continued the sexual assault. It was almost am when he dropped her off near her west end home. Once through the door, she changed into her pyjamas and ran into her dad’s bedroom.Giving evidence, her father said: “She was crying, ‘oh daddy’. She hadn’t called me daddy since shewas a child. I knew something was seriously wrong.”Hysterical, she told her dad she had been sexually assaulted and he immediately called the police. After a -day investigation, police officers had to force entry to Samad’s house to arrest him when he refused to answer the door. Samad initially claimed nothing had happened in the car until it emerged his DNA was on the girl’s clothes and the twisted predator then claimed she had forced his hand on her and touched him against his will. Speaking about her ordeal, the victim said: “When you go through something as traumatic as that, you can never forget what’s been done to you. “You try to forget the face behind it. I did everything in my power to try and get that man out of my head.” Despite the weight of evidence against him, Samad, , had pled not guilty to the charges. Procurator Fiscal Depute Mark Allan asked him: “You were a man in his late thirties and your position is that a -year-old stranger at the end of her night, desperate to get home, couldn’t keep her hands off you  Are you seriously asking us to believe that position ” Samad said “yes”, claiming he thought her behaviour was perhaps considered “culturally” acceptable. It took a jury of nine men and six women  minutes to find Samad guilty. Although he was carrying a Just Eat bag and the Guru Grill restaurant is registered with the food delivery company’s app, Just Eat insisted that Samad was not on their list of registered delivery drivers. A spokesman for Just Eat said the company did not have anyone with Samad’s name listed as a driver and could not establishhe was doing a delivery through its app on the night of the attack. She said: “Carrying a Just Eat bag is not evidence of somebody delivering on behalf of Just Eat – because many self employed couriers often deliver for multiple apps.” Read MoreRead More Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON CCTVCCTV footageCrime\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

In , famed American photographer Annie Leibovitz was given the great honour of photographing Her Majesty at Buckingham Palace. The dramatic shots show the Queen posing in the palaceaposs White Drawing Room and looking resplendent in ious combinations of jewels, orders, robes and furs. However, during the shoot, Annie made an unexpected request while the monarch was dressed in an opulent gown and dazzling tiara. She asked the Queenshe would take off her tiara and said: I think it will look better without the crown.  Iaposve heard that you do your own hair and make-up, which is so amazing, could we try without the crown  It will look better, less dressy. And with her famous quick wit, the Queen issued a sassy response, by gesturing to her opulent robe and saying: Less dressy  What do you think this is  However, the Queen duly obliged and Annie captured some wonderful shots of Her Majesty. And she must have impressed as Annie was invited back to the UK several years later to snap portraits for the monarchaposs th birthday.

She even later remarked in an interview how she was impressed with how feisty the Queen was. Annie said: What was remarkable about the shoot was her resolve, her devotion to duty, she stayed until I said it was over.Meanwhile, last week, the Queen showed off an adorable never-before-seen photo showing her surrounded by some of her great-grandchildren.  The snap could be spotted in pictures released showing her holding an in-person audience with military officials in the Oak Room, her private sitting room, at Windsor Castle.Itaposs unclear where exactly the photo was taken - but it appears to have been at her Scottish Highlands retreat of Balmoral. In it, the Queen can be seen sitting on a sofa surrounded by nine of her younger relatives.  Standing behind the sofa and posing for the camera appears to be her granddaughter, Lady Louise Windsor, beside her great-grandchildren Prince George, Isla Phillips, Princess Charlotte and Savannah Phillips. Meanwhile, sitting beside her on the sofa appear to be Prince Louis, Mia Tindall and Lena Tindall.

Many of those services which weren’t preemptively cancelled have been by blocked or flooded tracks and roads.As well as the yellow weather warning which remains across the UK until midday today, more than  flood warnings and alerts were issued.This included two severe flood warnings where there was a risk to le on the River Mersey in East Didsbury and at West Didsbury and Northenden. Rain was so bad overnight, that some parts of Manchester began evacuating people, with over  homes at risk as the River Mersey burst its banks. Have you been hammered by Storm Franklin  Email webnews@mirror  Shortly after am this morning, Councillor Bev Craig, Leader of Manchester City Council said the “process of evacuation was already underway.“We’re working closely with the police, fire service and the Environment Agency to protect residents living in the areas where we have severe flood warnings.The process of evacuation is already under way in order to protect as many people as possible given the forecast of more heavy rain throughout the day.”  Manchester and Derbyshire were some of the areas worst affected by the flooding as local rivers burst their banks and streets were flooded. Matlock, Derbyshire, was described as having had its streets in the town centre turned into a river. Such was the chaos caused on our roads and rail lines that train providers took the drastic action over advising Brits against using them, with some going as far as telling Brits to simply not travel today.  CrossCounty Trains said: “We are strongly recommending not to travel today. “Storms over the past week will have tested the infrastructure and with Storm Franklin today, we will have severe disruption across our network.” Meanwhile, National Rail asked customers to “avoid travelpossible” on Monday and South Western Railway issued a do not travel message after “a series of further incidents caused by high winds on Sunday evening”.  National Rail said the first services on most routes were cancelled, while there is a reduced timetable for Monday, alternative travel is unavailable and further disruption is expected. Major flooding across parts of Yorkshire has blocked multiple lines and shuttered South Yorkshireaposs Rotherham Central railway station until Tuesday. Rail operator TransPennine Express told customers on Twitter : Due to a river flooding the railway at Mexborough, trains are currently unable to operate between Doncaster, Meadowhall and Sheffield. All lines are blocked. In the capital, where wind gusts are up to around mph, London Overground services are cancelled or reduced. Roads across the country have been shut thanks to the high winds and torrential rain, whether because of debris like trees knocked over, or flooding carriageways.An Amber Warning for wind on Northern Ireland expired at am this morning and winds will peak during rush hour according to to Greg Dewhurst, senior meteorologist at the Met Office. He added that conditions will noticeably ease around lunchtime. The heavy showers that lashed northern England and Northern Ireland are set to move south-east he added and around midday, the Met Office removed a number of flood warnings. Storm Franklinaposs highest gust of mph was recorded at the Needles on the Isle of Wight on Sunday evening, followed by current gusts of mph on a mountaintop in Wales.  Itaposs still pretty strong out there and it will continue to be strong over the next few hours, Mr Dewhurst told the PA news agency. Thousands of homes in the UK are still without power due to Storm Eunice, and Storm Franklin is complicating recovery efforts. This came after huge waves were seen crashing on to coastal areas, homes were destroyed by strong winds, and emergency services deployed flood defences along swelling riverbanks on Sunday.  Colossal waves have been captured engulfing Newhaven lighthouse in West Quay, East Sussex, and Porthcawl Lighthouse in Bridgend, Wales. The River Don burst its banks in the Sprotbrough area of Doncaster in South Yorkshire on Sunday night, and police have warned people to stay away from dangerous fast-flowing water. South Yorkshire Police said: We ask people to remain away from the area of Sprotbrough Falls and Sprotbrough Lock in Doncaster, after the River Don burst its banks in this location earlier this evening. Many of the footpaths in this area are presently under water. The water is fast-flowing and poses a risk to people attempting to wade through it. Members of the public are being asked to remain away from the area at this time for their own safety. Thank you. Central Sheffieldaposs flood defences appear to have held, despite fears as the River Don raged through the city on Sunday night. Last week marked the first time three named storms have been recorded within seven days since the storm-naming system began in , with Dudley, Eunice and Franklin.

Her death was announced by her parents yesterday morning, February . Amaniaposs father, Khuram, wrote in a post on his @Khuram Twitter account: Our beautul daughter Amani breathed her last this morning at .am.

The -year-old daughter of Brandy Roberson from Corpus Christi, Texas, was sat in the coffee shop studying when a man she didnapost know began talking to her.A barista clocked the interaction and, unsurethe young woman felt threatened, brought over a free drink with a secret note telling her how she could silently signal for help. In marker, the cup read: Are you okay  Do you want us to intervene  If you do, take the lid off the cup.Brandy told WKYC that her daughter didnapost believe she was in any danger from the man.She was sitting at her table alone studying and this man came by and noticed what she was studying and wanted to talk to her about it, the mum continued. He, I think, just kind of became really loud and animated about it.  Brandy said that her daughter felt comfortable in the situation so did not take off the lid, but was thankful for the baristaaposs intervention none-the-less. The teenager later ed home and told her mother what had happened.She was holding the cup and knew that I would love that someone did that for her, Roberson told Today.It made me feel so grateful that the Starbucks employees were watching out for her. As a mom, that is my worst fear that something would happen to my child and nobody would be there to help. She also shared a photo of the cup with the story on Facebook, writing that she was very grateful for people who look out for other people!The post has since gone viral, racking up more than , likes. Messages written on the side of cups are an integral part of the Starbucks experience - as everyone with a hard to spell name will know. In  a Starbucks customer was completely shocked when he picked up his takeaway coffee and saw the name the staff had written on his cup. As is traditional in the coffee giantaposs stores, university student Sam gave his name to the person behind the till when ordering his iced drink.  The -year-old suffers from a stutter, and says the barista serving him mocked his speech when he was placing his order. He claims he said: Okay, S-s-s-sam. But things got even worse when Sam picked up his drink and saw what was written on the plastic cup itself. His name was actually written as SSSAM.Speaking to the The Philadelphia Inquirer, he said: Itaposs rare, as an adult, that that kind of disrespect happens.It happens, but itaposs really rare to see it in print. It felt rude.At the time a spokesperson for Starbucks told Fox News : Admittedly, we didnapost do a good job of understanding the situation. It was not an appropriate response.Weaposre trying to figure out what took place and once we do, weaposll take the appropriate actions and make a decision on how to handle it in the coming days.

The aircraft was travelling between Cincinnati and Phoenix when the bizarre event occurred shortly before twenty past one local time, reports the Daily Star.It quickly became one of the most signicant UFO sightings of last year, becoming one of several triggers that saw experts push for more transparency from the US government about investigations into alien le. The unexplained incident saw the pilot contact Albuquerque air traffic control to request information when he was heard askingthey had targets up in the air.  In an audio clip of the radio transmission, he added: We just had something just go over the top of us. I hate to say this but it looked like a long cylindrical object that almost looked like a cruise missile type of thing moving really fast right over the top of us. American Airlines initially played down the report.  However, a company spokesperson confirmed the incident in a statement that said: Following a debrief with our flight crew and additional information received we can confirm this radio transmission was from American Airlines Flight  on February .” The Federal Aviation Administration added in their statement that air traffic controllers did not see any object in the area on their radarscopes.

One pilot said airline bosses are so hostile to ET claims that a colleague was told to get counselling after ­reporting a UFO. Another told the Daily Star Sunday : When someone says UFO everyone thinks they are referring to aliens but that is not always the case, especially with the surge in drone activity. Most pilots will use phrases like unidentied traffic or aerial phenomena. No one wants to say UFO. If you say UFO people think you are either drunk, on drugs or nuts.  Another pilot added: Many airline pilots, self-included, and military pilots have had encounters at altitude with UFOs over many decades and before the internet. Encounters are reported internally and amongst colleagues and seldom reach the media. When you are fortunate to be a close witness, it is really quite serious stuff.

He said: I still donapost know what it was. I filmed it for over  minutes at dferent times, took dozens of pictures and observed it for the best part of two hours. To the naked eye it seemed like a black round rock but as I zoomed in, I could see it was roughly the shape of a triangle with a clear bulge on top towards the back. It was solid black and had no sharp edges. It wasnapost reflecting too much light and no lights were emanating from it.In Arslanaposs footage, the mystying object is seen hanging motionless over the cityaposs wealthy DHA  district.A fly and several birds also cross into the shot, showing the clear dference between them and the distant UFO.Mr Warraich said: I donapost know what it was, but I know what it wasnapost - it wasnapost a bird. I actually got birds in the clip while I was filming this thing. I fly drones myself so I know it wasnapost a commercial drone either. And it makes no sense for our military to be flying secret drones over a posh area of Islamabad where most of the army and Government officers live. When Arslan, , shared his footage online, UFO hunters were bowled over by the clarity of the sighting. The recording is extremely high quality, one viewer commented. Not just for the technical achievement of such extended physical effort to track it for so long, but also for the extended verbal commentary and description of the event. Do you realise how rare a document like this is  Another person wrote: This is how you capture a UFO. And one viewer said it was a perfect match for a sighting theyaposd had in New York. They said: It was just like this, no blinking lights, no nothing, just floating in the sky for about four minutes and then it went up until it was completely gone. Mr Warraich, who left Birmingham in  and is now a businessman, was able to watch the curious shape over Islamabad until the skies were too dark to see it. Whatever it was he saw, heaposs in no doubt that weaposre not alone in the universe. He said: With the number of stars and planets in the known universe, it is statistically impossible that we are the only intelligent beings in this universe. There must be civilisations which are millions or billions of years more advanced than us and then there must be others that are just starting out. Have they visited Earth  I think we have to look at the evidence and go where it leads. There is certainly a possibility.

Owner Sheila Kavanagh, , barely recognised her -month-old Japanese spitz, Milo, when she picked him up from the groomers.The white dog went in for a groom and tidy costing £, but when he came out, Sheila claimed he looked like a completely dferent dog. Sheila, who is currently out of work due to health reasons, was hoping to start taking Milo to official Kennel Club shows and events but is now unable to after no longer fitting the criteria due to the trim.Sheila, from Newbridge, Ireland, also claims to have noticed clipper cuts on her pups stomach, leaving Milo needing anti-inflammatory medication and topical treatment.to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories. Sheilaaposs vet daughter, Kayleigh Dooley, , said: Mum has been taking Milo to the doggy daycare on site since he was a puppy and she had built up a friendly relationship with the owner who recently opened the groomers. When she went to pick him up, the owner claimed Milo needed a welfare cut, which as a vet, I know they are not allowed to do without the owneraposs permission. Milo came out and started jumping up at my mum but she didnapost recognise him at first and thought he was a dferent dog. She couldnapost believe it but sheaposs not a reactive person so didnapost say anything at the time and as soon as she got home, she rang me straight away and she didnapost sleep for a whole week.  I took him into my practice a few days later so the vet could check him over and he was put on medication as he was walking funny and seemed tender and sore. Double coated breeds can get clipper alopecia after being shaved like that so his fur wonapost grow back the same and he may suffer from alopecia in some areas. Itaposs going to take a lot of work with conditioners and oil to give him his coat back and weaposre looking at at least a years worth of work.Sheila and Kayleigh claim to be told that Milo needed a welfare cut due to a number of mats in his fur. Kayleigh claims she set up a meeting with the owner and was able to get a refund for the service. Kayleigh added: We felt like the blame was shted onto my mum but a welfare cut can not be performed without the owneraposs permission. He was matted but not as matted as he made out he was. Mum had given him a bath a week prior and as heaposs a double coated breed, she didnapost realise how hard it would be to dry him so he had a couple of mats underneath. We bought Milo for mum to give her some companionship whilst sheaposs off work and the plan was she could take up a new hobby and take him to shows but now, he canapost be shown. It took me a week to get a meeting with them and I managed to get the money back but nothing will make up for what they have done.The owner admitted the groomer was unqualied and was employed based on experience rather than official qualications.The groomers, who have not been named, have been contacted for a comment.Has your dog had a groom from hell  Email paige.freshwater@reachplc.

In the early hours of this morning columns of tanks rolled into Donetsk and Luhansk separatist regions in eastern Ukraine. The Vladimir Putin backing separatistaposs words suggested a clear plan by the Russian authorities which has been unfolding since the end of last year. In December, Zhirinovsky told MPs over the move on Ukraine: “I wish  would be a peaceful year, but I love the truth.Follow our live blog for all todayaposs Russia Ukraine conflict updates “I’ve been telling the truth for  years. This will not be a peaceful year. “This will be the year when Russia will finally become a great country again. And everyone has to shut up, and respect our country. “Otherwise they will shut us up, and destroy Russians first in Donbas, and next in the west of Russia. “So let’s support the new direction in Russia’s foreign policy.”Zhirinovsky, who is currently hospitalised with Covid-, is considered to be the jester of the Kremlin, but also particularly clear-sighted on some issues.War watchers have noted that February  is the anniversary of the date on which popular protests in Ukraine drove out pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych and toppled his regime.This was one of the incidents which led to Russiaaposs seizure of Crimea. Zhirinovsky warned that the Russian government would take a more aggressive direction in its Ukrainian policy on February . Two days before the invasion, the Twitter account of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs changed its logo to read: . .  As well as having a track record in the prediction business, Zhirinovsky is also known for his strong anti-West stance and fire and brimstone rhetoric.In the s he called for nuclear weapons to be used against the Russian North Caucasus republic of Chechnya.  He has also called for forcibly retaking Alaska from the US. Putin’s prime minister Mikhail Mishustin has suggested that the invasion was not dreamed up over night, and that he had been working for “many months” assessing how to stop economic damage from Western sanctions from recognition of the two Ukrainian regions. “We have been preparing for many months for the potential reaction over the recognition of LNR and DPR,” he told an emergency Russian national security council session when Putin ordered his key allies to personally back the move. Fireworks were launched in Donetsk as the tanks rolled in last night.

That was until they received a letter from an aposangelapos called Helper, who claims to have been keeping an eye on Sunny in Heaven. The family said: We had to put down our dog. He was . We got this letter from our vet. No words right now. The vets letter reads: Hello. My name is Helper. I am an angel. There are a lot of angels in Heaven and we all have dferent jobs.to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories. My job is to write to people and let them know that their pets have arrived in Heaven. One of the head angels told me that you were worried about Sunny and asked me to write you about him. Reassuring the family that Sunny made it into Heaven, the angel said he has settled in and is doing just swell. The letter added: I know that he was ill when he was with you. He had gotten very old and when you get old, your body is not as strong as it used to be. Sunny was tired and I think maybe he knew that it was time to come here. And it is a good thing he did because now he is not old anymore and he isnapost sick either. In fact, I saw him just a little while ago and he was running and jumping with some other dogs and having a great time.  Relaying a message from Sunny, the angel told the family just how much their dog has been missing them - but said he wants them to know that he will see them again one day. Sunny misses you and hopes that you understand he had to come here, it continued. I am sure that one day Sunny will be there to greet you when you come here and you will have a grand reunion. Until then, we will keep him busy and happy. Here we donapost have time like you do. It never gets dark. It is just one long day. And everyone here is your friend, so donapost worry. Sunny is not ever going to be lonely. Someday when he sees you again, it will be like you were never apart. Donapost feel sad. Sunny is just fine. He is happy and he sends his love to you. Sharing their thoughts on the letter, which has been shared on Reddit, one user said: Our vet sends sympathy cards signed by all of the staff. Itaposs kind of hard to take, but they know people are hurting.Ask vet staff what the hardest part of their job is, and itaposs putting down a pet who has been part of your le and family day in and day out for many years. In agreement, another veterinary worker added:Sometimes we ask another employee to swap with uswe are too emotional. It doesn’t do anybody any goodyou’re crying louder than the owner. They add up though, and sometimes it just explodes. One of the most memorable experiences for me was this sweet old widow and her friend. They both quietly sobbed while we put down her senior dog. We gave them time alone afterwards with him, and after  minutes, they exited the room and closed the door quietly behind them. I went in to prepare her pet for the next step, and the dog was covered in beautul handpicked field flower bouquets. Maybe they had a little ceremony for him. It brings tears to my eyes every time I think of this, and now whenever I have to euthanise a pet, I try to pick some flowers along the way.Do you have a heartwarming dog story to share  Email paige.freshwater@reachplc.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON RedditTeamDogsDogsAnimals\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Calling all dog lovers!to TeamDogs for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Amongst these is Beinn Odhar # its southern slopes lying firmly in the county of Stirling, whilst its summit stands proudly in Argyll.If approached from the west, north or south you could keep your toes in Argyll all day. Unless on a round of Corbetts # there are five here that make a fine challenge # it is easier to approach the Corbett via its gentler slopes from Tyndrum. This also gives the opportunity to explore the adit # access tunnel # and old lead mine on its higher slopes where the mineral vein continuation from Sron nan Colan is exposed. The Beinn Odhar lead mining venture appears to have been a short one but the views once the summit is reached are tremendous.Leaving the car park, cross the A and head left passing the Tyndrum Inn, the Green Welly Stop and cross the bridge.Turn right immediately after crossing the bridge to join the West Highland Waynorthwards, passing the KeyStore.You will need to stay on the WHW for the next .km as it slowly climbs out of Tyndrum with the A on your left and the Crom Allton your right until you reach the bridges over the burn and railway.Cross the bridges and go through the gate at the north end. You will be heading up on to the open hillside to your right.You now have a choice. Either head straight up in a north easterly direction picking your own route on the grassy slopes or veer slightly right back to the Crom Allt to pick up a faint path. If you use the latter, ensure you head upwards at around NN. Either way you will tend to end up on sections of the old mining path as it zigs zags upwards by default due to the natural line of the slope.Once you reach m # after approximately .km depending on how direct your route was # the ground becomes stonier. The adit and mine are higher to your left, northwest, on the crest of the ridgeline, whereas the faint path runs just under this soyou want to explore them it is worth scrabbling up the rocks to have a look. The bottom of the adit starts at around ms.Heading up from the adit and mine # or path # the route flattens out, passing a lochan and the county boundary to your left. Ahead, the final ascent is best tackled by heading northeast then northwest to follow the hill’s natural line. There are no particular dficulties.The summit views are fabulous and an excellent panorama of Beinn Dorain can be had from the steep northern slopes above Coire Luaidh.It is easiest todown the southwestern slopes you ascended, but other possibilities could include some of the neighbouring Corbetts, especially the longer days in summer.Safety in the outdoorsThe described routes and accompanying information are there to be used as a guide and do not replace the use of map and compass and the skills required to use them.Whilst every effort is made to ensure the route is accurate at the time of going to print,  please be aware track and path closures can happen at any time.

In addition there may also be a possibility of linking into the generation of tidal energy being taken forward by the private sector.#Executive director Kirsty Flanagan said in the report: #[The] key issue for the buses will be meeting revenue implications and there will be a need to match fund this capital bid with  per cent of the capital costs.#It should be noted that Transport Scotland, through its infrastructure partner CMAL, is taking forward a series of transport connectivity projects on the island, most notably the expansion of Port Ellen Ferry Terminal. There is potential to work with this project to add impact to our proposal.#[A] replacement Jura ferry [is planned] to create an increased capacity and resilience. [We are] working with CMAL on small vessel replacement.#[We are] looking to have a common style of vessel, -m long, to provide resilience across the west coast network and reduce upfront costs with a single model. Low to zero emission is a key priority.#[In relation to] strategic connectivity linking Port Askaig, Port Ellen and the airport…[a] route has been identied with improvements to accommodate increasing capacity readily deliverable.#There are two roads connecting Ports Ellen and Askaig which run broadly parallel # the A which runs past the entrance of the airport and the B which runs to the rearof the airport.#By virtue of the A road status and its slightly better standard the A should be the preferred route for all traffic and the B road promoted more for cycle and walking.Ms Flanagan also said: #The council has determined to submit two bids to the next round of the Levelling Up Fund to be announced by the UK Government.#One bid will be for an area regeneration town centre project, maximum £m, and the other a transport bid up to £m.#The latest information from the UK Government is that it is likely to be an Easter deadline, and the criteria will be largely the same as the first round subject to some refinement.

At last Thursday’s meeting it was agreed that a further full council meeting be held, in public, at the earliest opportunity. This will allow further detailed consideration and discussion on the content of Mr Webster’s report and his recommendations, and of the next steps required by the council.“Mr Webster’s report will be published today as part of the papers for that council meeting, which will take place on Friday  February.”Carol Hamilton, SBC’s executive member for children and young people, added: “The report authored by Andrew Webster QC which will be published today is of acute interest to me and to many people across the Borders.

century” has been unveiled at the National Museum of Scotland.The prehistoric specimen has been hailed as the best-preserved skeleton of a pterosaur – a huge flying reptile – and the largest ever discovered from the Jurassic period.The giant winged creature, more popularly known as pterodactyls, is closely related to dinosaurs and had an estimated wingspan of more than . metres, similar to that of an albatross today.The fossil, which was found during a National Geographic Society-funded excavation on the Isle of Skye in , will now be added to the museum’s collection, where it was unveiled on Tuesday.Speaking about the ground-breaking discovery, University of Edinburgh PhD student Natalia Jagielska, who was lead author in a new paper featuring the fossil, described the finding as “a discovery of the century”.Posing proudly with it for photos, Ms Jagielska said: “The finding has pieced together a huge gap in fossil records for us.“I am glad that the world is going to see one of the best pterosaurs that has been discovered in centuries.“Britain hasn’t seen this kind of preservation of pterosaurs in  years.“It’s a discovery of the century, this doesn’t really happen.”The palaeontology expert said the last time such findings were made was during the days of Mary Anning – a palaeontologist celebrated for her discoveries of Jurassic fossils – in the early s.Holding a much smaller stuffed toy version of the reptile on her shoulder, Ms Jagielska said the fossil shows that the pterosaur was “much bigger and more erse than we expected during the Jurassic period.”“They were also very goofy looking creatures,” she laughed.“The discovery is also super interesting because this fossil shows there was clearly a lot of evolution going on in that time period.“And it shows that Scotland is a key piece to discovering that evolutionary iation, the best place in the world, it might be..remove“If these delicate bones of the pterosaur can be preserved well, that means other creatures can, andother creatures can, we might fill the gap in records of the Jurassic period just in Scotland alone.”Professor Steve Brusatte, a palaeontologist and professor at the University of Edinburgh, explained how the “superlative” fossil was found on the trip which he led about five years ago.“It was a very stressful excavation as we were battling the tides to cut this thing out the rock with diamond-tipped saws,” he said.“We actually lostfor a moment as the waves lapped up over it and we had to come back near midnight to get the most of it out.”He said the fossil, with bones “feather light” and “as thin as sheets of paper”, took several days to cut from rock.Running his hand over part of the reptile’s jaw found in the historic specimen, Prof Brusatte described the discovery as “the best thing we’ve found on Skye”.“I have been bringing my teams to Skye from Edinburgh for about a decade now, but this one takes the prize.“This is a crown jewel fossil and is a beautul, exquisite skeleton.“The thing about working on Skye is we are always battling the tides, so it’s a very challenging place to work.“But when you find something like this, it’s so worth it.”The painstaking excavation was led by Dugald Ross, of Staffin Museum, which he built himself in the s when he was just a teenager.Amelia Penny, a post-doctoral researcher at the University of St Andrews, was the one who first discovered the fossil during Prof Brusatte’s field trip after spotting its jaw protruding from limestone at Rubha nam Brathairean .“I knew I had found something interesting,” Ms Penny said, recounting the jaw-dropping moment.“There were other teams on the beach with me that day and they said: ‘We think this could be a pterosaur skull, we think this could be really signicant’.”Speaking at the fossil’s unveiling on Tuesday, Ms Penny said: “I feel proud to have spotted it.“I also need to be humble about it, there was an element of chance with me finding it.“But I feel very proud, I feel very lucky.”The species found is a new species of pterosaur, Professor Brusatte said, and experts have called it Dearc sgiathanach , which translates as “winged reptile” and also references the Isle of Skye, whose Gaelic name means “the winged isle.”The specimen will be the subject of further study by Ms Jagielska, which aims to reveal more about Dearc’s behaviour, particularly how it lived and flew.Pterosaurs were the first vertebrates to evolve powered flight, some  million years before birds.They lived throughout the Mesozoic era – the so-called age of reptiles – as far back as the Triassic Period, about  million years ago.In the later Cretaceous Period – the time of Tyrannosaurus rex and Triceratops – and immediately before the extinction event that wiped out the dinosaurs  million years ago, pterosaurs grew to the size of fighter jets.However, they were previously thought to have been much smaller during the Jurassic Period.Fragmentary specimens from England had hinted at the possibility that larger pterosaurs lived during the Jurassic Period and Dearc sgiathanach is the first complete specimen to confirm this.The unique fossil will now be added to National Museums Scotland’s collection and studied further..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title:  uDiscovery of the century u pterodactyl fossil on

greeting those spectators who arrived to support the team.Refreshingly, though, a group of youngsters were amongst the entourage travelling with the north Glasgow visitors, and they soon felt at home, happily mixing with the Pupils# own young supporters and joining in song.First, an attempted Pupils clearance found its way to Finnart#s number , who kept his composure to slot home a close-range finish and make it two goals in two games against the Pupils.Then, a header from a swirling cross from Finnart#s left-hand side couldn#t be kept out, despite the efforts of Alasdair Ferguson in goal.The Pupils# Rhys Casci did go close with a one-on-one effort in the first half after being freed by a low pass from midfield, but the Tarbert-based player opted to shoot early and the keeper got his body in front of the effort and gathered at the second attempt.After the interval, the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils hoped to use the westerly tailwind to put pressure on the visitors# goal, but it was a quieter half than the hosts would have liked.Finnart battled to repel the Pupils, limiting them to two dangerous efforts from outside the box, first from Casci who forced a save from the away keeper to tip his low shot round the post for a corner, and then from Scott Souden whose deflected effort forced the keeper into a save.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils made some changes late on with youngster Andrew Renton and right-back Michael McKinlay making afrom injury, but it wasn’t enough to turn the tide of the game and the visitors took all three points, to leave themselves two points behind leaders Kilsyth Athletic with two games in hand.Conversely, the Pupils are three points adrt at the foot of the ision, but importantly have two games in hand themselves.In the aftermath of the game, the Pupils# management team stated they were satisfied with the effort and performance level of the squad, acknowledging that the dference between the sides on the day, despite the polar

He was protected well by right back Conner Brown, left back Burns and central defensive pairing Ross Souden and captain Keith Mitchell.With less than  minutes remaining, McCallum – who had shted into central midfield with the introduction of second sub and debutant Cameron Wylie at right midfield – intercepted a ball from a Glenvale player, his tackle putting Lang one on one with the hosts# keeper.Lang showed excellent composure for his tender years to slot the ball low into the net with his right foot, just inside the box, his teammates joining him in celebration.After seeing out the final five minutes of regulation time, four nervy minutes of added time were played as Glenvale pushed for an equaliser.In the st minute, Ferguson was called upon to make the save of the day, stopping a powerful Glenvale drive from  yards out, before a Pupils defender cleared the danger.The final whistle sounded soon after and the Pupils# squad and management could cheer a hard-earned, much-needed win, especially impressive considering the inexperience of much of the squad, who are still learning at this level, but judging by this showing, are certainly contributing.Tomorrow , the Pupils host high-flying Harmony Row from Govan, at Kintyre Park.Kick-off pm.

Avoid plantingthe ground is frozen or extremely waterlogged.Your planting hole should be no deeper than the roots, but at least three times the diameter of the root ball.It#s a good idea to soak bare-rooted trees for about  minutes before planting.Place the tree in the planting hole so the first flare of roots on the stem are level with the soil surface. If you plant the tree too deep, it can result in rot and disease.You may need to insert a stake for top heavy or larger trees. Refill the planting hole, firm gently and water in.Drought stress is common in newly-planted trees so make sure you keep watering throughout the growing season.

only to the local people whose lives are enriched by music, but also for the tourism on which so much of the local economy depends.#Campbeltown and the surrounding district is famed throughout the

It is also unpleasantyou step in it and causes particular problems for people with visual impairment, people who use walking aids, for infant buggies, families enjoying green spaces and activities on sports fields.It can also lead to a disease called toxocariasis, which is linked to blindness.The Dog Fouling Act of  places responsibility on #the person in charge of the dog# at the time of the misdemeanour. Sothe dog you are walking isn#t yours, you are still liable for the fineyou don#t clear up after them.Dog mess is clearly an issue of concern to our community.What have we heard on the matter of unsightly irresponsible dog fouling in South Kintyre from our elected ward councillors  To date, nothing.The last thing we want is filthy paths, cemeteries, beaches and green spaces, enforcement and penalty fines. Don#t be the dog walker who doesn#t clean up.Tommy Macpherson, Scottish Conservative and Unionist candidate, South Kintyre ward.Households in Argyll and Bute have received £, from low income pandemic payments and £, from bridging payments that support families with children in receipt of free school meals.Across Scotland, these payments have amounted to the SNP Scottish Government delivering more than £ million to more than , low income households – including more than , school age children receiving bridging payments.The pandemic has been incredibly dficult for so many families for a iety of reasons – some have lost wages and jobs, others have seen an increase in heating bills as we all spent more time at home.I#m glad the SNP Scottish Government has been helping families in Argyll and Bute to get through this tough time with £,, of support, in addition to offering Scottish low income benefits and the Scottish Child Payment.We know that families in Argyll and Bute are going to continue to feel the pressure as we face a cost of living crisis, so it is reassuring to see the Scottish Government#s focus on helping those who need it most and their commitment to delivering bridging payments this year.Sadly, the contrast between the SNP Government in Holyrood and the Tories at Westminster could not be clearer.While the SNP get on with extending the Scottish Child Payment to under s and doubling the payment to £ per week per child from April, the Tories are cutting support for those who need it most and implementing unfair tax hikes on households.It#s now beyond all doubt that Westminster control is not working for people in Argyll and Bute. The only way to keep Scotland safe from Tory cuts is to become an independent country, with the full powers needed to build a fairer society."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week february 18 2022","story":"It was one of several nature shots Graham took during a winter break in Kintyre.If you have a photograph you would like to share, please email it to editor@campbeltowncourier or get in touch via the Courier#s Facebook page."},{"url":null,"title":"pupils prepare for league matches","story":"Kick off is at pm.The Pupils will be hoping to continue their away day joy from two weeks ago when they secured a - victory at Glenvale.The Pupils then have another away trip scheduled the following Saturday, February , against St Peter#s in Renfrew.Then, the Pupils# conclusion to their league season sees them play four home matches in a row.For more information on everything from fixture information and matchday photography to club fundraising and the upgrades to Kintyre Park, follow @PupilsAFC on Twitter and Campbeltown Football on Facebook."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week february 18 2022","story":"Instinctively, I would answer: #Doubt.#But is that right  The opposite of faith is surely not doubt, but certainty. If you are sure you know something to be the case beyond contradiction, you don#t need faith.Doubt, on the other hand, is strongly linked with faith because, while you may have faith strong enough to move mountains, there is always the possibility your faith is misplaced.I would argue the existence of God is proven by large amounts of evidence, but in the end that is a matter of faith.The Bible recognises this right at the start where Adam and Eve leave the Garden of Eden and do not see God face-to-face anymore.From now on, they, and we who come after them, must live by faith.This is what it is to be human – and faith is always open to challenge.When suffering occurs, when disaster looms, people ask, #Where was God # and use what has happened to deny God exists.Yet the faithful keep believing. Why There have been many attempts by faithful people to explain unbearable tragedies with faith in a loving God. Few are convincing – at least at the time.For me, the love that people give to one another is God reflected in human goodness.Living by faith is not easy. Sometimes it means being assailed by doubts and I believe we must be honest about our questions.After all, did not Jesus say: #The truth will set you free.# When those most bitter and painful tragedies strike us down, faith can be a consolation – sometimes the only consolation – even as at the time it is tested to breaking point."},{"url":null,"title":"council considers cremation price rise","story":"Argyll and Bute already charges above the Scottish average for exclusive right of burial and coffin interment, but below the average for a cremation.

Meanwhile, the Scottish Institute for Sport came aboard with funding and coaching help.Defeat at the European Championships in Finland ensured that the team arrived in Salt Lake City as underdogs. All eyes instead were on the men’s squad, who were favourites for a medal. “We were quite happy to fly under the radar,” says Martin.The curling was held in the city of Ogden, some distance from the main events. A small band of supporters, including MacDonald’s father, was there to cheer the women on. “He was the madman with the kilt and the British and Scottish flag,” she says.In the round-robin, Team GB lost to Canada, described by Donnelly as curling’s equivalent to Brazil in football and the All Blacks in rugby. Other defeats followed and it looked like the Scots were on their home early.As it turned out, they had one last chance to get back into the tournament and seized it. Victory in the semi-final against Canada saw Martin and her team lining up against Switzerland in the final.At this point, the UK and world media had caught up with the story. BBC decided to carry the final live on BBC before switching to BBC. Almost six million viewers watched a tense match where it fell to Martin to throw the last stone for victory. “The stone for glory,” whispered Donnelly.The rest was tears, cheers, and a mass welcome home at Glasgow Airport. The team were awarded MBEs, and Martin appeared on Ally McCoist’s team on Question of Sport.“It went a bit crazy,” says MacDonald, “but it was good”.They were hugely popular, says Donnelly. “I think people recognised in the nicest possible way they were just ordinary but extraordinary women.”Debbie Knox’s twin daughters were only young at the time, but now  they call her their “shero”.: Queen sends her congratulationsFor Martin, now a coach and mentor to players, it had been a try, try, and try again experience.“I lost so many Scottish finals, so many bronze medal matches over the years.

At the same time, it worth remembering that a dferent Scotland is possible and indeed in  was within reach.What was needed was for the losing side to accept the outcome of the referendum as a Once In A Generation event and for the Scottish Government to set out on a path of governance based on achieving a Scotland at ease with that outcome and itself. It would not have been easy and would have required real leadership from the First Minister and the co-operation of other parties, but as a national mission that work would have been well worth it. A good start might have been the sort of cross-party Team Scotland arrangements that Alex Salmond proposed in the event of a Yes vote. In addition the SNP leadership could have proposed that their party suspend Clause a of its constitutionand declared its commitment to Clause b . Who could disagree that national unity and harmony based on the outcome of a free and fair referendum is ultimately in the greater Scottish interest Instead, Nicola Sturgeon deliberately turned her face against the outcome of her governments referendum and chose the path of ever deeper and ever more bitter ision and stre. Far from seeking national unity, she could not even be bothered to attend a church service organised to promote reconciliation. One only needs to see the the denigration of commentators such as Sarah Smith and the partisan dismissal of the best available evidenceto witness the results of that decision.The Scotland that we have today was created by Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP. We can only dream of what could be achievedthey worked as hard at creating unity as they have at creating ision. They should never be forgiven for what they have inflicted on us.Peter A Russell, Glasgow.ABUSING THE FIRST MINISTERBEING of a certain age, I am fortunate not to be privy to the goings-on in social media s except through the likes of The Herald and ious other traditional news outlets. Personally, in the unlikely event that I was involved in the same way, I would treat any inappropriate responses with contempt. Sarah Smith strikes me as being well able to take care of herself in this respect and I suspect that her impending departure to the United States is purely a good career move.I presume that Jill Stephensonis including herself as one of your better-educated readers and, as such, she should be aware that the meaning of words is all about context. Having examined Ms Smiths comments regarding Nicola Sturgeon \"enjoying\" the extra powers in relation to the pandemic and studied my Collins dictionary, I can only describe her use of the description was at best an unfortunate choice of word. Also, there is a lack of subtlety in her description of her detractors and she would have been more honest to openly criticise some parts of the supporters of independence.No decent person can excuse the vitriol reported regularly in media sources but Ms Stephenson is deluding herselfshe thinks such remarks are one-sided. While not being involved in these exchanges, I have overheard Ms Sturgeon being subjected to misogynistic and sometimes venomous comment from older men of my acquaintance who should know better.Gordon Evans, Glasgow.BBC ALWAYS PUTS ENGLAND FIRSTTHE point missing in the stooshie over Sarah Smith is that Scotland isn’t represented by the British Broadcasting Corporation. It doesn’t really matter who the Scotland political editor is because the organisation always has to put England first.Former BBC Scotland correspondent Kenneth MacDonald said the BBC dropped the ball with its  referendum coverage and this was because of colleagues from England. The BBC admitted it alienated independence supporters but still has not explained what it’s doing to win back their trust.When you listen to the BBC news, it’s about England, not Scotland. That’s because  per cent of the population lives down south. Power and network commissioning is all centred in England. And it’s well known that the BBC doesn’t spend as much in Scotland as it takes in licence fees. As in the Union, Scotland will never be an equal citizen in the BBC orbit. You loseyou are born in a Celtic nation.The BBC has helped separate Scotland from rUK, as has Brexit and nearly  years of enduring a Westminster Government Scots did not elect.Once Scotland regains its independence, it needs to establish a Scottish Public Broadcasting Corporation to reflect the ersity of opinion, culture and dynamism within Scotland.I’m certain most Scots wish Sarah Smith well in her new position covering the US. I just hope she develops a thicker skin, because over there, she’ll need it.Leah Gunn Barrett, Edinburgh.COULD SCOTLAND EMULATE TEAM GB IT was an uplting experience towards the end of the Winter Olympics in Beijing to be proud to be Scottish and British, as many are, with the men’s curling team, led by Bruce Mouat, winning silver and the women’s team, led by Eve Muirhead, winning gold . One was made proud not only by the sporting prowess of the two curling teams, but also by their demeanour.Team GB received £ million from lottery money and part of that was allocated to curling, which no doubt helped the curlers to reach the high standard of play required to be successful at the top levels. While the expenditure on curling was more than justied by the results, that on some other sports was much less so. In Your Guide To An Independent Scotland Scotland’s Future, published in advance of the  Referendum, the SNP stated: \"On independence the National Lottery will continue to operate in Scotland.

Regrettably and perhaps unsurprisingly given the poor performance of GB overall, the BBC and most of the UK mainstream media provided few,any, updates on the medal table, in stark contrast to coverage of the Summer Olympics held in Tokyo, Rio and London. More importantly, Norway’s hugely better performance raises questions about the financial support for UK sports, and in particular whether the limited and selectively targeted support provided through Lottery funds is sufficient, not only to help win medals across a greater number of sports but to signicantly boost participation levels across all sports, especially those sports where at present there may be few prospects of winning medals.As we all wish for our planet to be made more habitable and we strive as iniduals to become fitter and healthier, is it not time for the UK Government to commit more of its resources to maximising the wellbeing of all of its citizens rather than to maximising the profits of wealthy friends and party donors Stan Grodynski, Longniddry.IN POWER TO STAY THERE have been a number of letters saying that, objective achieved, the SNP will dissipate like snow aff a dyke.

We can’t wait to see who’s available to snap up.”The overseas market is likely to be popular in next month’s draft, with several big-name players set to be in the offing, although the international schedule may ultimately dictate availability.Welsh Fire have dispensed with England big-hitter Tom Banton while World Cup-winner Liam Plunkett’s retirement from English cricket creates another vacancy as they have seven spots to fill – the most of any of the men’s sides.Oval Invincibles, the reigning women’s champions, have retained captain and last year’s most valuable player Dane van Niekerk, as well as Mady Villiers and the  breakout star Alice Capsey.England captain Heather Knight will continue to play for the Spirit but international team-mate Tammy Beaumont has been released, with no limit on the number of players the women’s team could retain. vw,vw,px, px\"Oval Invincibles captain Dane van Niekerkwas last season’s most valuable player in the women’s Hundred Lauren Winfield-Hill captained Northern Superchargers last year but has not been retained by the Headingley-based club, while Australia all-rounder Ellyse Perry and New Zealand captain Sophie Devine stay at Birmingham Phoenix.Issy Wong, who will play again for the Phoenix, said: “Last year was incredible for us and the women’s game, it’s only going to get bigger and better with world-class players like Ellyse Perry being able to join this time around.“We can’t wait to get going again and to perform in front of full houses again.”For the first time, both men’s and women’s sides will be able to select an additional fourth overseas player in a wildcard draft in June – although teams will still only be able to field three overseas players in their XI.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

which has been described as the “discovery of the century” has been unveiled at the National Museum of Scotland.The prehistoric specimen has been hailed as the best-preserved skeleton of a pterosaur – a huge flying reptile – and the largest ever discovered from the Jurassic period.The giant winged creature, more popularly known as pterodactyls, is closely related to dinosaurs and had an estimated wingspan of more than . metres, similar to that of an albatross today.The fossil, which was found during a National Geographic Society-funded excavation on the Isle of Skye in , will now be added to the museum’s collection, where it was unveiled on Tuesday.Speaking about the ground-breaking discovery, University of Edinburgh PhD student Natalia Jagielska, who was lead author in a new paper featuring the fossil, described the finding as “a discovery of the century”.Posing proudly with it for photos, Ms Jagielska said: “The finding has pieced together a huge gap in fossil records for us.“I am glad that the world is going to see one of the best pterosaurs that has been discovered in centuries.“Britain hasn’t seen this kind of preservation of pterosaurs in  years.“It’s a discovery of the century, this doesn’t really happen.”The palaeontology expert said the last time such findings were made was during the days of Mary Anning – a palaeontologist celebrated for her discoveries of Jurassic fossils – in the early s.Holding a much smaller stuffed toy version of the reptile on her shoulder, Ms Jagielska said the fossil shows that the pterosaur was “much bigger and more erse than we expected during the Jurassic period.”“They were also very goofy looking creatures,” she laughed.“The discovery is also super interesting because this fossil shows there was clearly a lot of evolution going on in that time period.“And it shows that Scotland is a key piece to discovering that evolutionary iation, the best place in the world, it might be.“If these delicate bones of the pterosaur can be preserved well, that means other creatures can, andother creatures can, we might fill the gap in records of the Jurassic period just in Scotland alone.”Professor Steve Brusatte, a palaeontologist and professor at the University of Edinburgh, explained how the “superlative” fossil was found on the trip which he led about five years ago.“It was a very stressful excavation as we were battling the tides to cut this thing out the rock with diamond-tipped saws,” he said.“We actually lostfor a moment as the waves lapped up over it and we had to come back near midnight to get the most of it out.”He said the fossil, with bones “feather light” and “as thin as sheets of paper”, took several days to cut from rock.Running his hand over part of the reptile’s jaw found in the historic specimen, Prof Brusatte described the discovery as “the best thing we’ve found on Skye”.“I have been bringing my teams to Skye from Edinburgh for about a decade now, but this one takes the prize.“This is a crown jewel fossil and is a beautul, exquisite skeleton.“The thing about working on Skye is we are always battling the tides, so it’s a very challenging place to work.“But when you find something like this, it’s so worth it.”The painstaking excavation was led by Dugald Ross, of Staffin Museum, which he built himself in the s when he was just a teenager.Amelia Penny, a post-doctoral researcher at the University of St Andrews, was the one who first discovered the fossil during Prof Brusatte’s field trip after spotting its jaw protruding from limestone at Rubha nam Brathairean .“I knew I had found something interesting,” Ms Penny said, recounting the jaw-dropping moment.“There were other teams on the beach with me that day and they said: ‘We think this could be a pterosaur skull, we think this could be really signicant’.”Speaking at the fossil’s unveiling on Tuesday, Ms Penny said: “I feel proud to have spotted it.“I also need to be humble about it, there was an element of chance with me finding it.“But I feel very proud, I feel very lucky.”The species found is a new species of pterosaur, Professor Brusatte said, and experts have called it Dearc sgiathanach , which translates as “winged reptile” and also references the Isle of Skye, whose Gaelic name means “the winged isle.”The specimen will be the subject of further study by Ms Jagielska, which aims to reveal more about Dearc’s behaviour, particularly how it lived and flew.Pterosaurs were the first vertebrates to evolve powered flight, some  million years before birds.They lived throughout the Mesozoic era – the so-called age of reptiles – as far back as the Triassic Period, about  million years ago.In the later Cretaceous Period – the time of Tyrannosaurus rex and Triceratops – and immediately before the extinction event that wiped out the dinosaurs  million years ago, pterosaurs grew to the size of fighter jets.However, they were previously thought to have been much smaller during the Jurassic Period.Fragmentary specimens from England had hinted at the possibility that larger pterosaurs lived during the Jurassic Period and Dearc sgiathanach is the first complete specimen to confirm this.The unique fossil will now be added to National Museums Scotland’s collection and studied further.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our

This falls in with ‘Candlemas’ on nd February as a Christian festival and a traditional end of the Christmas season. Candlemas commemorates the presentation of the infant Jesus at the Temple in Jerusalem as described in St Luke’s Gospel and when some denominations bring candles to their church. Candlemas is also one of the so-called ‘Quarter-days’ marking the changing seasons of winter, spring, summer and autumn. It is followed by Whitsun, Lammas Day and Martinmas as the term-days with their administrative and legal implications for the payment of rents and flittings. Saint Bride or Saint Bridget has been one of the most popular of the saints of the celtic church. Of course, there were many ‘Bridgets’, but the one whose festival date is on st February was ‘Bridget of Kildare’ in Leinster whose death was dated to AD . Bridget was one of the patron saints of Ireland and is remembered in the tradition of plaiting rush crosses around st February to set over doors and windows to protect the home from fire and other danger.   or the endearing ‘Bride’s little fosterling’.’ . ‘Bride’s Day, the birthday of spring’. century, traditions of Saint Bride were collected by Alexander Carmichael among his prayers, hymns, blessings and charms from the Hebrides. He suggests that accounts of Saint Bride were not easily recovered and summarised the tradition: ‘The serpent is supposed to emerge from its hollow among the hills on St Bride’s Day, and a propitiatory hymn was sung to it. Only one verse of this hymn has been obtained, apparently the first. It dfers in dferent localities: [Early on Bride’s mornThe serpent shall come from the hole, I shall not molest the serpent, Nor will the serpent molest me.’ The snake is a powerful element in mythology and religion and a creature to be respected as the ‘hymn’ makes clear. Familiar in the snake coiled round the rod, it is a symbol of medicine and healing, and the appearance of the adder or snake on Saint Bride’s Day offers a feeling of hope and transformation, and of turning the corner with the ening of the days. . century. .!... !"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Donnie-Munro-picture-scaled.jpg","title":"special donnie munro concert to bring skye live back with a","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe island#s premier music festival is set toin style on Thursday th May # following a two-year break due to the pandemic # with an opening night extravaganza # ‘Coming Home: An Evening with Donnie Munro and friends’ and featuring special guests in the form of multi-award-winning Gaelic supergroup Mànran.The show will be Donnie’s first in his hometown since  and will see him perform with a full eight-piece band line-up on the spectacular Skye Live Festival site at Am Meall in Portree. The singer said: #This offers me a fantastic opportunity to bring this amazing line-up, featuring some of Scotland’s top musicians together, for an exclusive performance to open this year’s Skye Live Festival.He added: #It has been fantastic to watch the festival grow in strength, year on year, in what must be one of the most special and unique festival locations anywhere in the world, and to see it become internationally recognised as, ‘one of the best boutique festivals in the country’, is just fantastic for the island, and it is such a great honour for me to be invited to be a part of it all and to be bringing the music back home here to where it all began.#Joining Donnie Munro on the night will be Mànran, internationally recognised as one of the most iconic and respected Scottish bands on the road today.

February  at Flesherin, Point, Dolan worked with his dad making Harris Tweed before getting an apprenticeship with a bakery in Stornoway.However, his ambition was always to join the Merchant Navy, which he did in  in Glasgow.Not long after, he joined the crew of the British-India ship SS Manela which sailed to South Africa during World War Two.Dolan said: “I also went to America, Canada and Australia while at sea and could be away for up to two years at a time, but it was always great to get on the boat in Glasgow and head home to Lewis.“I ed to Lewis for a time after the war and spent many happy years living with my sister Mary Ann down in Back.

Women are more likely to ditch their partner than their pet, found a poll for nationwide pet retailer Jollyes. Asked about their relationship with their partner and their pet and which one they would ditch first,  per cent said they would ditch their partner against  per cent who would ditch their pet. Men were more loyal to their partners, with  per cent saying they would ditch their pet and  per cent saying they would ditch their partner. Overall,  per cent would ditch their partner first and  per cent said the pet would go first. The study was carried out by Jollyes to gauge humans’ attitudes to romance and relationships as it launches the search on social media for a canine couple to take part in a romantic dinner for two at its doggy dates diner, “C’est Jollyes”, open for one day only on  February at its Runcorn store in Cheshire . Two dogs will get the chance to enjoy a three course dinner featuring a menu from Jollyes Artisan Lestage range including angus beef with sweet potato, venison and salmon, and duck with sweet potato. The survey showed some big dferences in attitudes to pets and partners around the UK. People in North East England were more likely to ditch their partnerover their pet, followed by London , Northern Ireland , South West . [See table in editor’s notes below for regional breakdown.] Owners were asked what they loved most about their pets, with loyalty, unconditional love, loving nature, affection and a warm heart among the qualities cited. No matter how much love an animal gives, most pet ownerswould prefer a romantic Valentine’s night with their partner than one spent with their pet. Of male respondents,  per cent chose a night with their partner, compared with  per cent of female respondents. The figures were broadly similar across the country. Among the other popular traits cited by pet owners were: “they are so loyal and loving. And cute!” “unconditional love and loyalty” “they comfort me when I’m feeling blue” “doesnt argue or answer back” “they always cheer me up” “waggy tail and warm heart” and “her loving nature, always there for me when I need her”. One said: “Sometimes playful, sometimes cuddly, intelligent, independent, sometimes dangerous. All rather like my partner really.” Not everyone was totally enamoured with their pet. One said: “Nothing, it hates me, only loves my we”. And not all pets’ traits would make for a romantic night out – one said: “hassle free”, another said “doesn’t answer back” and one said “it’s a tortoise and he’s as indferent to use as we are to him”. Phil Turner-Naylor, head of marketing at Jollyes, said: “We’re known as a nation of animal lovers and this goes to prove it. When it comes to relationships, a lot people would choose their pet over their partner. “The good news for romantics though is that a big majority choose people over pets. What it does show, especially for men, is that partners have to work hard to keep the romance going or they might find themselves in the dog house. Women are looking for a romantic night with their partner on Valentine’s, butthe men don’t get it right, they had better watch out.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1645089617694.jpg--1_700_people_apply_for_a_life_less_ordinary_with_stena_line.jpg?1645089617000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220217news1 700 people apply for a life less ordinary with stena line","story":"Ferry company Stena Line has been overwhelmed with the positive response from the public to its recent recruitment campaign ‘A Le Less Ordinary’, which aims to fill  vacant positions onboard its Irish Sea ferries. , applications were received from people across the UK and Republic of Ireland. The campaign promoted the unique nature of le onboard, with % time-off providing the perfect work-le balance for people wanting to live and work onboard for either a one or two-week sht and then spend equal time off. The positions available are part of the Onboard Sales and Servicesteam, with vacancies for service assistants and chefs. With January being the traditional time of the year when many people look for a new career, Stena Line had hoped for a favourable response but even the most optimistic of predictions could not have expected it to be so over-subscribed. Stena Line has now undertaken the initial stage of the selection process and, for the first-time, is hosting two Open Days for prospective candidates on Monday th February, where they will get a chance to meet members of Stena Line’s crews. The Open Days are taking place in Belfast and Birkenhead with the latter being held onboard one of Stena Line’s newest ferries, Stena Edda, giving candidates a chance to get a first-hand taste of le onboard on the Irish Sea. Stephen Bryden, Stena Line’s Head of Onboard Sales and Services, commented on the success of the campaign: “I am astonished by the public’s response to the A Le Less Ordinary recruitment campaign. We have never received so many applications. It really goes to show how many people are attracted to a le at sea with a company like Stena Line. Now our HR team has the challenge of how to sort and interview so many applicants, but that is a nice challenge to have.

I was her son and I was also her friend, companion and chauffer.“We had meals out together or we would have taken trips to places like Portrush and Portballintrae.“She would say to me ‘I liked that wee place you took me to today, but it wasn’t as good as the last one’.”Hannah enjoyed seven years of good health after Robert’s passing, but Mervyn began to notice that she was getting confused from time to time. However, it wasn’t until she didn’t recognise her own home that he knew something was wrong.“That night sticks out a mile,” he said. “When mummy wanted to say something quietly she had this habit of giving you a nudge in the ribs. And as we approached the house she gave me a wee nudge and said ‘do these people know we are visiting ’.”After a fall at home she was taken into hospital and was later diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease.Hannah had always said she wanted to be cared for at home and Mervyn was determined to honour her wishes. He juggled caring for her with his full-time job, assisted by a home help and carers who visited daily.It took an emotional toll on him, and he found himself getting exasperated by his mum losing or forgetting things, but after accepting she had a ‘disease of the mind’ things became easier.“People would say to me you’re doing a great thing looking after your mother, but to me it was duty that I was happy to do. But I did wish I had another sibling to share it with. I did have an older brother, Robert Samuel Strahan Currie, but he died in infancy.“At the start, caring for my mother was very, very hard. But I had to come to terms with the fact she had a disease of the mind.“It’s like a net curtain comes down and you see you loved one, but you can’t really talk to them.“People have said it’s like looking after the living dead because it can feel like they’re not getting any benefit of all the things you do for them.“But when she died it was still very dficult. I thought because she had Alzheimer’s that I wouldn’t miss her so much, but the loss was still very big as we had drawn so close.“If someone said to me ‘you can have her back but she’ll still have Alzheimer’s’ I’d still want her back.“Despite all the trials that a single carer experiences I count that particular role in my le as being the most rewarding of all. It was a privilege and honour and to have God’s blessing and strength.”Mervyn, who volunteered to help at two vaccination centres during the pandemic, decided to volunteer as a steward for this year’s Alzheimer’s Society Belfast GLOW Walk to help other people who are caring for a loved one with dementia.He will join people of all ages and walking abilities for a colourful around walk from The Titanic Quarter along the River Lagan and past many historical locations.Participants are encouraged to dress in neon, bring glow sticks and sport their brightest outfits to raise funds and awareness for the , people living with dementia in Northern Ireland.There’s never been a more important time for Belfast residents to glow the distance and come together to raise vital funds for le-changing dementia support. Alzheimer’s Society’s services, including the Dementia Connect support line, have been used over six million times since the start of the pandemic but too many people are still facing dementia alone.Bernadine McCrory, Alzheimer’s Society Northern Ireland Country Director said: “We would like to thank Mervyn and all of our amazing volunteers who helping us with the GLOW event this March.“Belfast GLOW is a fabulous opportunity to make memories with family and friends, all while raising money and awareness for the , living with dementia across Northern Ireland who continue to be disproportionally hit by the pandemic.“Nobody should have to face dementia alone without adequate support. That’s why we’re urging the people of Belfast to shine a light on dementia alongside your family and friends this March and help make a dference in the fight against dementia.“Every pound raised will help Alzheimer’s Society provide vital information and support, improve care, fund research and create lasting change for people affected by the condition.” Help create a brighter future for people affected by dementia alongside family and friends at Alzheimer’s Glow Belfast at the Titanic Quarter on  March.at alzheimers.org.uk glow "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1564499438658.jpg--agri_food_leaders_call_on_stormont_to_follow_the_science_on_climate_change_legislation.jpg?1564499438000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220221newsagri food leaders call on stormont to follow the science on climate change legislation","story":"Industry leaders within the agri-food supply chain have said thatpassed unchanged, the Executive Climate Change Bill would have devastating consequences, including job losses, for the Northern Ireland economy. The damage done to local food production will require a reliance on food imports that would exacerbate global emissions and increase prices for the consumer. The impact would be particularly felt in rural towns and communities who depend on the sector for their livelihoods. They are calling on Assembly MLAs to recty the Bill by making meaningful amendments that are in line with the scientic evidence and that support their local communities who rely on the sector for their livelihoods. The organisations behind this warning are the Dairy Council for Northern Ireland the Northern Ireland Food  Drink AssociationNorthern Ireland Grain Trade Association , Northern Ireland Meat Exporters Association , the Livestock and Meat Commission , the Ulster Farmers Union . Speaking on behalf of this supply chain alliance, Conall Donnelly, Chief Executive of NIMEA said: “To be very clear, our collective members are in support of Climate Change legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We want to play our part. We are already investing in and implementing carbon-reducing technologies right across our supply chain and will continue to do so. Because of our natural grass advantage, we already have a world-class reputation for sustainable food production. Our high-quality beef, lamb and dairy produce is reared with care on small family farms utilising natural grass and is the envy of many countries around the world. We believe Northern Ireland has the potential to be a shining light in sustainable food production. We want to work with policy makers to get this right for the environment and the local economy. That means having realistic and science-based climate change targets relevant to Northern Ireland so that we can continue to be part of the solution to climate change.” David Brown, Deputy President of the UFU said, “ passed without further amendments, this legislation would not follow the expert advice from scientists that make up the International Panel of Climate Change and the UK’s Climate Change Committee. It could unnecessarily obliterate tens of thousands of jobs as well as threaten consumer access to affordable, quality food. Perversely, food may need to be imported from where which would simply increase global emissions. “This Bill also has the potential to damage rural towns and communities who depend on our sector for their livelihoods. But it will affect us all as consumers when we are no longer able to access local fresh food that is produced to high environmental and animal welfare standards. We are asking politicians to work with us. We want to tackle climate change in a way that helps protect the environment and maintains the unique economic and social role that agriculture and food production has on this island.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1645454612923.jpg--covid_19___mon_21st_february_figures.jpg?1645454612000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220221newscovid 19 mon 21st february figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows four further coronavirus related death and , new positive test results.

Everything we did we did together.”Despite being a dedicated politician and DUP member from an early age, his friend said that he was able to unite people of all political beliefs and none.“We never talked about politics, obviously I would have asked about his career and what he wanted to do, but politics never came up,” he said.The -year-old Deputy Speaker of the assembly was married to Laura with whom he had four children.“His wit was unbelievable as was his intelligence, I was in awe of how much information he could retain.“But it was his kids and Laura that were his le.“I remember when he and Laura started dating in school and it was just an instant attraction. We all knew after about six months of them dating that was it, that was who Chris was going to end up with.“In the last few days people have said what a devoted family man he was, but Laura was equally devoted to him.“They were a team, she was his support, she was his rock. Whatever he wanted to do with his career she backed him. They were teenage sweethearts, they were destined to spend their entire le together. they were a team both at home and professionally, she was his biggest supporter.”Mr Caughey-Rogers said the death of his closest friend “still hasn’t set in”.“I have spoke to a few of our old friends, to be honest we are still not at the point of being able to deal with the fact that he’s not going to be here.“The type of person Chris was, he could bring anyone together and you could see that in the unity in the response to his passing. “It’ll be strange going back home and not arranging to go out for a drink with him. Any time I knew I was coming home I would have messaged and arrange to meet up, I can’t imagine coming home and not seeing my friend. He is such a loss, to his friends, his family and his community”.Read MoreMark Bain:OpinionPolitically ided, but Stormont parties unite in grief and respect for Christopher StalfordRelated topicsChristopher StalfordKeir StarmerNorthern Ireland AssemblyMore On Christopher StalfordAnti-Protocol rally postponed as ‘mark of respect’ following death of DUP’s Christopher Stalford PremiumPortrait showed how important family’s love was for ChristopherKey dates in le and political career of the late DUP politician Christopher StalfordWarm tributes paid across political benches at Stormont to Christopher Stalford PremiumViewpointOpinionDeath of Stalford puts our squabbles into real perspectiveMost ReadShow at Lyric Theatre cut short after cast complain about behaviour of audienceThe dissident funeral, a UVF gun, and the web of criminality that left four men deadMichelle O’Neill criticised over IRA memorial launch at Tyrone GAA clubSam McBrideOpinionSteeped in politics from his teens, just days ago Christopher Stalford had been given good news...Our everlasting love affair with the song Kenneth Branagh wanted as ‘a message of hope’Top VideosPlayStorm Franklin brings sea foam to Portstewart PlayVideo: Sea wall breached as Storm Franklin hits PortstewartPlayDUP MLA Mervyn Storey leads his party’s Assembly team in a prayer and moment of silence for Christopher StalfordLatest Northern IrelandHome Bargains creating  jobs at new Belfast outletBelfast man Graham Watson jailed after punching woman in face and dislodging toothNorthern Ireland weather alert: Yellow warning issued for ‘blizzard conditions’ and gusty windsFlooding will not beat us, says north coast restaurant ownerNorthern Ireland minimum alcohol pricing consultation launchedLatestTom O’Toole ruled out of Ireland squad for Six Nations game against Italy after injury picked up against DragonsJohnson suggests stripping Russia of hosting duties for Champions League finalLegal requirement to wear a mask to end in IrelandEmily Maitlis and Jon Sopel announce departure from BBC for GlobalPioneering RAF snfer dog given ‘animal Victoria Cross’ award,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

You know where to look to catch the look of someone in particular, eyeing each other up across the political ide.But the barricades were down today. A ceasefire akin to the Christmas truce of  when the British and German forces met in no man’s land, exchanged gts and even played a friendly game of football.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up As then, hostilities at Stormont will resume, but at noon on Monday there was little appetite for the usual cut and thrust. Party politics was set aside. Only one item was on the agenda. The House paid its respects and heard the fine words of tribute to Christopher Stalford.One by one his colleagues and rivals stood to deliver the words they did not wish to say. And it was, in a strange way, lovely to hear them say these words and know they meant every one of them.Gone were the tones of bitterness. Gone, too, the cutting cross-party interjections, those with which Christopher Stalford was so prolic during his time in the Assembly.Speaker Alex Maskey opened the Assembly and told of how their backgrounds came from dferent perspectives of le here, but how they had formed a very positive working relationship.But it will be among the ranks of the DUP that Christopher Stalford will be most missed by those who knew him best.As Mr Maskey gave way to DUP deputy leader, Paula Bradley, she stood, wearing black and clutching a handkerchief. You could tell tears were not far away as she began by saying she wished to “honour and give thanks for the le of our much-loved friend and esteemed colleague”.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseAn emotional DUP deputy leader Paula Bradley pays her respects FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueAn emotional DUP deputy leader Paula Bradley pays her respectsShe added: “Words cannot adequately explain the sense of pain and loss that is felt on these benches. Christopher’s joy came not in holding office but in how he could use that office to improve the everyday lives of those he was honoured to represent. It was a mark of the man that he had friends on all sides of this chamber.”Very quickly that became apparent. Across the chamber, Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey led the tributes from Sinn Fein due to the absence of Michelle O’Neill, who’s self-isolating at home due to Covid.She said: “Sadness has fallen upon this chamber. No words can describe the shock, anguish and pain his family is feeling.“I first met Mr Stalford at Belfast City Council and instantly thought he was older than me due to his mannerisms and the attire of his pinstriped suit, initially thinking this was the instructed unorm of all DUP councillors at that time.“He enjoyed the cut and thrust of debate in committees and the debating chamber. While our politics dfered, we shared similarities, growing up in working-class communities in south Belfast.”Mrs O’Neill later tweeted: “I’m struck by the shared sense of loss across the political spectrum. I am reminded that there is far more that unites us than ides us. Rest in peace Christopher.”For almost two-and-half hours, tributes came from all corners of the house, and MLAs also stood respectfully in a minute’s silence.From the SDLP, Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon said: “This is a very sombre day for our Assembly, but particularly for Christopher Stalford’s friends and colleagues in the DUP.“I got to know a man who was challenging, argumentative, ambitious, some may even say combative, during debates, but also a man who was kind, quick-witted, fiercely intelligent and very funny. Christopher Stalford was unique.”Ulster Unionist leader Doug Beattie echoed what many in the Assembly had felt when they heard the tragic news.“My heart sank,” he said.“I have no quick quip to truly outline the person that we all knew, that we all had interactions with. Christopher was unique, absolutely unique. He was a fierce debater. I didn’t just like Christopher Stalford, I was jealous of Christopher Stalford.”There was none of the usual passion from TUV leader Jim Allister, a man rarely lost for words. In fact, they struggled to come today.The tributes continued throughout the session, but perhaps most enlightening was the insight into the person behind the political mask worn in public.The anecdotes from committee rooms and back corridors of power, even the tales of casual conversations between rivals MLAs. Not agreeing about something doesn’t always mean the respect, even the friendship, of those from rival parties doesn’t exist.Alliance leader Naomi Long said: “I did not expect this morning, that I would be standing here paying tribute to him in these circumstances. But it doesn’t surprise me at all that my last conversation with him was about his children and his family, because they were at the heart of everything he did.”Those on the sharpest end of his tongue will miss his presence too.Sinn Fein’s Emma Sheerin added: “You knew that when you met him outside you’d be met with warmth, a bit of craic, good humour, and a genuine friendly comment.”Her party colleague, John O’Dowd, said: “Christopher Stalford was a formidable political opponent. There were times when I debated with Christopher that I tried not to like him afterwards, but I couldn’t. He was such an affable inidual.”The sharp suits, the sharp tongue – it will all be missed at Stormont.But Christopher Stalford, as all those who paid their respects noted, will be even more sorely missed by the family he has left behind.Most ReadShow at Lyric Theatre cut short after cast complain about behaviour of audienceMichelle O’Neill criticised over IRA memorial launch at Tyrone GAA clubThe dissident funeral, a UVF gun, and the web of criminality that left four men deadSam McBrideOpinionSteeped in politics from his teens, just days ago Christopher Stalford had been given good news...Police recover body of missing man Raymond ‘Rainbow’ Gracey from Comber RiverTop VideosPlayStorm Franklin brings sea foam to Portstewart PlayVideo: Sea wall breached as Storm Franklin hits PortstewartPlayDUP MLA Mervyn Storey leads his party’s Assembly team in a prayer and moment of silence for Christopher StalfordLatest PoliticsSinn Fein favours a single .% corporation tax for smaller firms on both sides of border, children waiting for help from NI mental health servicesPortrait showed how important family’s love was for ChristopherKey dates in le and political career of the late DUP politician Christopher StalfordChildhood pal of late DUP politician Christopher Stalford: ‘I can’t imagine coming home and not being able to see my friend’LatestSam Skinner expects France to be eager to avenge recent defeats against ScotlandWhat is the Nord Stream  pipeline £m Belfast drugs seizure one of the largest in Northern IrelandSheku Bayoh inquiry hears police officers want immunity over their evidenceManchester Arena bomber’s brother smiled before assault on prison officer,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Europe needs gas because it is replacing decommissioned coal and nuclear plants before renewable energy sources such as wind and solar are sufficiently built up.– Why is the US against Nord Stream  The US, European Nato allies such as Poland, and Ukraine have opposed the project going back before the Biden administration, saying it increases Europe’s dependence on Russian gas and gives Russia the possibility of using gas as a geopolitical weapon.

That means the pipeline was not going to help meet heating and electricity needs this winter as the continent faces a gas shortage.The winter shortage has continued to feed concerns about relying on Russian gas. Russia held back from short-term gas sales – even though it fulfilled long-term contracts with European customers – and failed to fill its underground storage in Europe.Russian President Vladimir Putin has said the shortage underlines the need to quickly approve Nord Stream , increasing concerns about Russia using gas to gain leverage over Europe.– Could Russia cut off gas to Europe in retaliation While Europe needs Russian gas, Gazprom also needs the European market. That interdependence is why many think Russia will not cut off supplies to Europe eventhe Ukraine conflict escalates further, and Russian officials have underlined they have no intention to do that.Meanwhile, the Ukraine crisis, on top of the winter shortage, has already given European governments more reason to find their gas somewhere , such as through liquefied gas brought by ship from the US, Algeria and other places.Most ReadShow at Lyric Theatre cut short after cast complain about behaviour of audienceMichelle O’Neill criticised over IRA memorial launch at Tyrone GAA clubThe dissident funeral, a UVF gun, and the web of criminality that left four men deadSam McBrideOpinionSteeped in politics from his teens, just days ago Christopher Stalford had been given good news...Police recover body of missing man Raymond ‘Rainbow’ Gracey from Comber RiverTop VideosPlayStorm Franklin brings sea foam to Portstewart PlayVideo: Sea wall breached as Storm Franklin hits PortstewartPlayDUP MLA Mervyn Storey leads his party’s Assembly team in a prayer and moment of silence for Christopher StalfordLatest WorldEU advises further relaxing travel rules for foreignersWestern leaders allege Russia sending troops to eastern UkraineRussia recognises Ukraine-held areas as part of rebel regionsUkraine-Russia: Germany suspends Nord Stream  gas pipelineHong Kong orders mandatory Covid tests for all residentsLatestSam Skinner expects France to be eager to avenge recent defeats against Scotland£m Belfast drugs seizure one of the largest in Northern IrelandSheku Bayoh inquiry hears police officers want immunity over their evidenceManchester Arena bomber’s brother smiled before assault on prison officerRoy CurtisOpinionPhil Mickelson has a track record of unapologetic disloyalty – it was joyful to see Rory McIlroy take down golf’s dirty money league,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

When it was announced that the new curator would be serving both Newry and Downpatrick this caused great consternation.ldquoWe can understand that frustration and since our local councils were brought together seven years ago where parity should have existed between Newry, Mourne and Down, it has felt that the legacy Down area has been left behind somewhat.ldquoWe have to be straightforward about the facts and Downpatrick is the county town. This carries major signicance. The historical and ecclesiastical heritage of Downpatrick is equally signicant, as is our links to St Patrick. The museum in Downpatrick is the Down County Museum and must be treated as such.The SDLP politicians say while they appreciate the local authorityrsquos need for a curator that serves both Downpatrick and Newry, they are firmly on the view that the curator must be based in Downpatrick.Cllr Enright confirmed that he and Cllr Brown have also been meeting with the Friends of the Museum over the past few weeks and will be calling for a special motion on the restructuring plan to be debated publicly at next monthrsquos full council meeting.ldquoThe council proposal makes no sense whatsoever at all to promote the relatively insignicant Bagelrsquos Castle in Newry over the Down County Museum which is one of the premier professional conservancy and historical centres in Northern Ireland, added Cllr Enright.Cllr Brownrsquos motion calls for a full-time curator to be based at and responsible for the Down County Museum and that the existing curatorial posts of keeper and assistant keeper of collections are permanently filled and not downgraded, with the vital and highly skilled role of the museumrsquos technician photographer also retained and not downgraded.ldquoI am calling for council officers to develop, in consultation with relevant stakeholders, a new, long-term strategic plan for how the council can most effectively invest in museums across the district, he confirmed.ldquoCouncillors are highly concerned by the plans to downgrade staff provision at the Down County Museum and to base the only full-time museum curator in Newry.

Arrested in Belfast in September , he was a prisoner in Dublin when the Rising raged in  and was despatched along with other State prisoners to Fort George in Scotland the following year.Liberated in , Russell threw himself back into revolutionary politics in support of Robert Emmetrsquos ill-fated coup by attempting to raise once again the standard of rebellion in Co Down. After an anticlimactic call to arms in Loughinisland in July , Russell escaped the county only to be arrested in Dublin and ed to Downpatrick for trial and execution.One of the earliest collections acquired four decades ago by the fledgling Down County Museum was a small parcel of documents relating to the trial of Thomas Russell.The documents include the order from the viceroy, Lord Hardwicke, to initiate proceedings against Russell and the list of jurors who would decide his fate, not that it was ever in doubt. Also contained within the collection is a series of fascinating depositions sworn before local gentry which condemned not only Russell, but two Co Down men, James Corry and James Drake, to execution.The improbability of success for the  Rising is revealed in the deposition of Patrick Doran from Annadorn, who said that ldquonone but fools andmadmen would endorse a Rising so soon after the sobering experience of . Doranrsquos deposition goes on to describe Russellrsquos green Generalrsquos coat, decorated with gold lace and rich epaulettes.Another deposition, from Hugh Magennis, of Ballydugan, provides us with the vivid impression of Russellrsquos ldquomilitary step and appearance, while William Cosby of Saintfield described the mysterious stranger of Wilsonrsquos ballad as a ldquolarge handsome looking man.Such witness statements helped to deliver a guilty verdict and Russell was executed outside the County Gaol, now Down County Museum, on Friday, October , . He was buried in the parish churchyard his gravestone arranged and paid for by the indomitable Mary Ann McCracken of Belfast.These documents held in Down County Museum shed considerable light on an episode of local history that had profound national signicance. Scholars of th century Ireland have visited the museum to consult its rich archive and conferences staged there to discuss the sitersquos deep imprint on Irish history and memory.The size and quality of its collections and the historical importance of its buildings underpin the importance of the internationally-recognised Down County Museum.The ongoing depletion of its highly-qualied and committed staff, which under Newry, Mourne and Down Council proposals now appears to include only a part-time curator, the replacement of the keeper of collections and an assistant with two new positions at a signicantly lower grade, and the removal of the important position of a photographer technician, reflects a disregard for the heritage industry in the county and represents an insult to the hundreds of donors who presented valued family possessions to Down County Museum in the good faith that the Council would preserve, celebrate and cherish them.The fear of many is that the downgrading of the Museum mdash for that is what this is mdash will lead to a reluctance among the public to donate artefacts to the collection and undermine applications for the funding of future projects.The public knows exactly what kind of jewel we have in Down County Museum. One can only hope that a broader awareness of the worrying impact of the Councilrsquos vision will create a clamour whereby the lsquoWrong should cease and the Right prevailrsquo..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Drumaness A and B square off  ","story":"THE ladies of Drumaness B, still buoyant from their win over Strangford B, were unable to repeat another giant killing act against their club-mates, Drumaness A.But in a good glamoured match attended by the league secretary, they can be pleased with their team performance while the result was never in doubt.The title holders conceding  points to the B teammade sure that they got enough points in every game to stay ahead of the have-a-go opposition.Pat Mulholland started the ball rolling with a  pointwinning margin against Philomena Rogan before Charlie Murray added another  points in his match with Katy Rice and Hugh Scott collected a similar winning margin over Norma Gilgunn for an overall score of  points.The ladies were more resolute in the next round of matches and were more content in their performance than points and finished the match with a respectable score overall..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"East Down AC  ","story":"LAST Wednesday some of the East Down AC juniors headed to Mallusk for the Ulster Schoolsrsquo Cross Country Championships.On this occasion they were running in school colours rather than the red and yellow of East Down AC but several of the club coaches were in attendance and watching with interest.The athletes had to qualy for the honour of racing at this level through an inidual top  place or as part of a team that came in the top three at the district qualiers.Although the course was fairly flat and the ground mostly firm underfoot, the long flat stretches were interspersed with a sharp, slippy rises and muddy turns so runners had to choose whether to run wide for safer footing or risk slipping by following the shortest route.The squally showers and very strong gusty winds were an added challenge.Jessica Martinrepresenting Victoria College Belfast over a distance of m came th out of a field of  runners in a time of ..Year Nine girlshad four EDAC runners in the pack Erin Moore, Cara Napier and Charlotte Barr.

With five minutes to go in the half they kicked a penalty to the corner and executed an effective catch and drive line-out to bring the deficit to one point at -.The home support were glad to see the conversion attempt bounce back off the uprights.Down maintained their slender lead into the break when they would turnaround to play with the wind in the second period.Throughout the second half, Down half-backs, Benjamin Hart and Brian Mitchell, managed the wind advantage very effectively to maintain territorial pressure on the County Tyrone school.However, it was the green forwards who capitalised on this pressure scoring all the points that would see the local school comfortably through to the semi-finals.In the th minute second-row, Reuben McKibbin touched down, in the th minute hooker, Fionn Carey got over the line and Ryan Connolly got Downrsquos fth and final try of the day seven minutes from time with Phillips converting two of these tries.With a minute to go in the fixture, Omagh did manage to score a consolatory, unconverted try, although Down Highrsquos controlled attack and physical defence were too strong for a repeat of the early season outcome between the two sides.In other Down High fixtures last week, a hybrid U- U- team came from behind to defeat Clounagh U-s -, while the U-s added to their impressive record this season with four victories over Methodist College, Belfast.The Medallion B XV also defeated Omagh Academyrsquos Medallion team - on Saturday morning in a pre-cursor to the first XV game.

Nineteen other councillors, from the SDLP, Ulster Unionists, DUP and Alliance voted in favour.A lively debate was sparked by the SDLPrsquos Mr John Doris and involved  other councillors.Mr Doris said while he was keen to support the charity which will benefit from the drag hunt the council has money invested in Delamont and he felt it was ldquoinappropriate for the horses and hounds to go across the council track of land.He said the Delamont country park is taking shape very well and it would be ldquovery unwise to allow it to be used in this way.Mr Doris told councillors it would be ldquofoolish even to allow a drag hunt on an experimental basis.He said there is no guarantee that the hunt will stay on the periphery of Delamont.Party colleague, Mr Cathal O Baoill, argued in favour of permitting the hunt. He said the type of person who is a hunting, shooting and fishing man, like something from the Irish RM, is a major tourist attraction. It is a section of the countryside and a major cultural aspect which should be preserved.He pointed out thatthe hunt is successful, it will result in a smelly bag being torn apart.DOWNPATRICK ndash An alternative line has been suggested this week for the poundm Downpatrick town centre by-pass.Down Ulster Unionist councillor, Mr William Biggerstaff, is suggesting that the road could be constructed along part of the route of the former railway line.Mr Biggerstaff believes thatthe line is adopted by the Department of Environment, it will considerably reduce the costs of the provision.ldquoI would envisage incorporating part of the old railway line embankment as the foundation for a new roads system, said Mr Biggerstaff.He expressed concern that the Government-backed regeneration of Downpatrick will be hampered by the failure to resolve the traffic problem.ldquoThere will be no point in regenerating Downpatrickthere isnrsquot road network facility to make use of, she said.ldquoAfter meeting officials of the Department, it is my view that the by-pass will eventually go ahead.

The Eastern Health Board has announced that intends closing Mourne House residential home for the elderly, despite a strong protest lobby.A spokesman for the Southern Board said last weekrsquos vote was ldquototally unanimous and followed preliminary discussions with staff and patientsrsquo relatives.The two-storey building, which was built in the rsquos, was turned into a holiday home for the mentally handicapped in . At one stage it provided holiday accommodation for  patients.With the Board running down its holiday operations at Navan House in recent years, it is now being used as an extension of the Boardrsquos mental health hospital in Armagh and contains  patients.The spokesman said the decision to close is in line with Board policy aimed at ing people to the community.ldquoNavan House costs around pound, a year to run. The Board believes this money could be better spent developing community services, he continued.The spokesman said a final decision will only be taken following consultations with patients, staff, local councillors and community groups.ldquoThere is a general recognition that we should have fewer long-stay patients in mental hospitals. There is no need to retain a facility which is  miles away from the main hospital in Armagh, the spokesman added.CROSSGAR ndash SDLP MP, Mr Eddie McGrady, has reported success in his campaign to have the mains water system in the Crossgar Killyleagh area improved.The South Down MP pointed out that after serious supply problems just before Christmas  he took the meter up with the Minister, Mr Richard Needham.ldquoI am now pleased that the Department having considered a study is designing a scheme to lay a waterman from Raleigh to New Line, Crossgar, which will increase the reliability of the supply to the Killyleagh and Shirley areas. This work should commence later this year, said Mr McGrady.ldquoThis study also identied the need to replace two watermains in Killyleagh. One of these on the Downpatrick Roa has already been replaced and work to replace the other at Kerry Drive should be completed by the end of this month.ldquoThis is indeed welcome news and hopefully the new waterman will enhance the standard of supply in these areas, added Mr McGrady.SAINTFIELD ndash A lamb processing plant providing up to  jobs is being planned for Mid Down.A facility handling , lamb carcasses a year could be up and running within twelve months, it was announced this week.A number of green-field sites in the Saintfield, Crossgar and Ballygowan areas are being considered, with construction work could begin in August.The main behind the scheme is Mr Alex Waugh, a director of the Newtownards-based company, Milltown Livestock and Meats.A separate company led by Mr Waugh is currently involved in discussions with the Industrial Development Board, the Department of Agriculture, the Planning Service and other government agencies.ldquoThere are a lot of hurdles to cross, but I am confident the factory will be built. Initially, we would hope to employ  people, rising to around  with two years, Mr Waugh said.ldquoThis will be an ultra-modern processing plant in the provincersquos main sheep producing area. I have spoken to many farmers and I am encouraged by their remarks, he continued.ldquoWe do not have a sheep processing plant in Northern Ireland and only three abbatoirs have slaughtering facilities for sheep. At present, less than half of our lambs are processed in the province.Mr Waugh said the plant will provide an opportunity for the sheep industry to gain a larger shore of the important British and European markets.Mr Waugh added: ldquoWe are progressing as quickly as possible and hope to get started by August or September. If that happens, there is no reason why we cannot be in production by next April..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Kilcoo win All Ireland  ","story":"KILCOOrsquos triumphant senior footballers ed home to jubilant scenes on Saturday night after their dramatic extra-time win over the much-fancied Kilmacaud Crokes in a pulsating All-Ireland Club final at Croke Park.Hundreds of supporters gathered outside the clubhouse at Paacuteirc Eoghan Rua as the Andy Merrigan Cup was proudly laid on the village pitch for the first time ever.Indeed it was the first time that the coveted All-Ireland title was back in Down since the all-conquering Burren side brought it home in .After one of the most dramatic finals in recent history last weekend, Kilcoo players finally got their hands on the trophy, confirming the sidersquos place as the best in Ireland.After going so close in  when the Galway-based Corofin snatched the cup from the locals in extra time, there was no heartache last weekend with Kilcoorsquos late late show securing victory.Amid wild celebrations at the final whistle, assistant manager Conleth Gilligan spoke of an ldquoenormous sense of relief.He continued: ldquoWe are delighted to get over the line, for so many reasons. We didnrsquot want the disappointment again. We were actually down in Croke Park last Sunday for a kick-about and we did a presentation with the lads.ldquoWe happened to do it in the media room and when I walked into it I immediately got that feeling of walking in after the  final loss and having to answer all the questions about where it all went wrong.Conleth continued: ldquoI remember thinking to myself that I never want to have to do that again.For Magpies manager, Mickey Moran, it was a case of creating your own destiny.The Kilcoo boss has suffered All-Ireland heartache on three separate occasions ndash with Slaughtneil, Mayo and Kilcoo ndash and at half-time on Saturday he was on the verge of another when his side trailed by six points.ldquoMickey really gave it good. Every now and again, does give really cross speeches, said Gilligan.ldquoHe hadnrsquot done one of those at all this year he hadnrsquot even raised his voice but this was one where he basically asked the boys to stand up and be counted or get their bags and go out on to the bus now.His words hit home with the players leaving nothing on the pitch as they overcame the Dublin kingpins in a breathtaking finale graced by scintillating football.With just added time of extra time left to play, Jerome Johnston fired the winning goal home to cue scenes of pandemonium that would last well beyond the final whistle.As the players, management and travelling support arrived back up north to their native-village as All-Ireland heroes, Moran prepared a heartfelt speech alongside goalkeeper Niall Kane, who also highlighted the magnitude of their achievement.The celebrations lasted long overnight and into the weekend, with those involved with the club finally relaxing after a strenuous season in which they were forced to never stop working until it was over..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Matthew puts in stirring dance in honour of his late friend%2C Ryan  ","story":"A MOVING dance tribute to his late friend who died in an accident earned Matthew MacNabb the top score of the night in Sundayrsquos Dancing With The Stars Ireland.The contemporary dance from the Downpatrick man and his partner Laura Nolan also got the top combined score of the night between judgesrsquo scores and viewersrsquo votes, which means they are immune for being sent home next weekend.The  year-old, who gained popularity from his appearance in ITVrsquos Love Island over the summer, met his friend Ryan Freeman while he was travelling in the United States.Ryan died in an accident in Phoenix, Arizona, at the age of  while Matthew was quarantining before he went on to Love Island.Matthew chose to honour his friend in the lsquodedicated dancersquo night week as each celebrity paid tribute to someone special in their lives.He told the Recorder: ldquoIt was an incredible moment.

They say residents have been looking for a modern leisure complex for over two decades.Council chairwoman, Cathy Mason, was one of a number of local politicians provided with a progress report on the Newcastle project last week by senior council directors.She described confirmation of plans for new leisure facilities in Newcastle as really welcome news.She continued: ldquoThese new local amenities will be of great benefit to local residents, their families and tourists alike and I am delighted that the plans are in the final stages. The plans will include a new leisure pool and state of the art gym facilities.Cllr Mason also reaffirmed the view that the rear of the Newcastle Centre is no longer fit for purpose and, as a result, will be demolished in the near future.She continued: ldquoFor too long, the people of Newcastle have had to put up with substandard facilities. I hope to see the finalised plans for the new leisure complex and site approval in the coming months so that contractors can start working on the project as soon as possible.The council chairwoman said it is essential that the local authority ldquomoves in a timely manner to ensure the leisure centre project comes to fruition so that Newcastle residents can access the new facilities as soon as possible.Cllr Mason said Sinn Feacutein will continue to do all it can to ensure the new leisure facilities are delivered, insisting that she will continue to stand up for rural families across South Down to provide essential services in the heart of their respective communities..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Roads officials urged to address pedestrian safety in Darragh Cross  ","story":"ROADS officials have been asked to consider providing a new pedestrian crossing in Darragh Cross as part of a series of measures to make the village safer.The appeal was made by Rowallane councillor Patrick Brown when he met with a local roads official in the village last week to discuss increasing concern about pedestrian safety as a result of the speed of vehicles.The Department for Infrastructure has said while there will not be a mph zone implemented in Darragh Cross due to current legislation, it has been asked to extend the current mph in force outside the villagersquos primary school and the nearby Barnamaghery Road.Cllr Brown has also asked the districtrsquos Policing and Community Safety Partnership to locate one of its electronic speed indicator signs in the village.He said the devices have helped reduce speed in other areas and believes that one in Darragh Cross would be effective with a decision on his request expected next month.ldquoA speed indicator device will help address speeding concerns in an area where children are particularly vulnerable and I would like the sign in place as soon as possible, he continued.ldquoI have also discussed with roads officials the potential opportunity for a pedestrian crossing near the main shop which would be funded by the government departmentrsquos active travel department, which would be another welcome measure for pedestrians in Darragh Cross.Cllr Brown said that as a result of his recent meeting which he described as ldquoconstructive, roads officials gave a commitment to assess safety railings in place a Manse Road.ldquoThis particular issue was raised with me last month as damage to part of the railings is adding to residentsrsquo safety concerns. The assessment will happen after the new local authority-funded play park has been built at the GAA site, he said.Cllr Brown confirmed that he is also pushing for the safety railings to be extended from the Oaks Restaurant to the GAA ground to ldquomaximise the safety of residents, in particular, families with young children who will be making frequent use of the site.He added: ldquoI share residentsrsquo concerns about road safety in Darragh Cross and believe that enacting these measures over the coming months should be a departmental priority.ldquoHowever, I hope that collectively, these steps will begin to alleviate many of the villagersquos safety concerns for the future..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Traders invited to get  involved in town future  ","story":"TRADERS in Downpatrick are being urged to have their say on the future development of the town with a primary focus on what can be done to revive its economic fortunes.The appeal comes after Newry, Mourne and Down Council confirmed that it is to organise a workshop event to gauge the business communityrsquos key priorities, particularly in a post-Covid environment.Details of the workshop event comes as the debate continues about appointing a dedicated town centre manager who would act as a link between the business community and wide range of statutory agencies and funders to help drive new initiatives and opportunities.Council officers have already spoken with a number of businesses on the issue, but it was confirmed at Monday nightrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee that a more co-ordinated plan now needs to be developed.Officials argue this is necessary in order to agree priorities on the way forward to manage expectations through the development of strategy focused on the needs of the town.Plans for a workshop to discuss the issue are being drawn up with appeals to everyone in business in Downpatrick to take part to provide as wide ofview of the potential way forward as possible.The workshop will focus on the main priorities to help develop a new strategy with calls for an independent person to head up the exercise which, it is hoped, will outline recommendations on the way forward.A proposal to appoint a Downpatrick town centre manager to help plan the townrsquos economic revival and long-term future was tabled last year and referred to the council committee for discussion.A number of councillors believe such an appointment is a ldquocritical component of the drive to support the business community, increase footfall and, crucially, help attract new investment to the county town.It has been suggested a town centre manager could work closely with the business community to develop fresh ideas and initiatives, but nothingwill happen before the outcome of the proposed workshop is known.Downpatrick councillors Dermot Curran and Oonagh Hanlon have welcomed confirmation of the workshop and are fully supportive of the development of a strategic plan being mapped out for the town.Cllr Curran believes that appointing town centre manager deserves close attention and is keen to hear what the business community and other stakeholders have already said about the way forward.ldquoI see great merit in having a dedicated town centre manager, he continued.ldquoThe proposed workshop that is to be held is crucially important and I would appeal to everyone in business to get involved and have their say. This is a crucially important exercise and it must happen as soon as possible.Cllr Curran believes one area that requires particular focus is developing Downpatrickrsquos night-time economy which he is confident would help breathe new le into the town centre.He is also keen for Downpatrick to have an umbrella body representing all business groups and interests, pointing to the success of Chambers of Commerce which he believes play important roles.ldquoAgreeing the way forward for Downpatrick is crucial and a new strategy can help kick-start the townrsquos economic revival, especially at a time when ambitious plans are being advanced for the regeneration of the former Irish Street police base and a number of empty adjacent buildings, Cllr Curran added.Welcoming plans for the workshop, Cllr Hanlon said it has been identied that a strategic plan needs to be considered to focus on the needs of the town.She also confirmed that she as met with a number of stakeholders who believe that Downpatrick needs a strategic plan.ldquoThere is so much effort and productive work from local groups such as the Town Committee and Community Collective alongside local businesses, Cllr Hanlon continued. ldquoEngagement from a iety of stakeholders via theworkshop will ensure that we have a bold and progressive plan for the future of Downpatrick.She added: ldquoCouncil assistance to facilitate this is will be imperative as we continue to build our local economy, arts and events offerings..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Tributes and presentations to Downpatrick clergyman  ","story":"ANOTHER chapter in the distinguished history of Downpatrick Non-Subscribing Presbyterian Church closed last Sunday when the Rev Dr David Speers preached his final service after  yearsrsquo service.Dr Steers, who was also in charge of Ballee and Clough Non-Subscribing Presbyterian churches, is leaving the district to take up a new post in Dunmurry.He introduced his final service with the history of the replica High Cross which stands at the entrance to the Down Cathedral, explaining how its engravings depict Jesus Christ and the prophets St Anthony and Paul and how the illustrations guided the early Christians over a thousand years agoDr Steers said the Non-Subscribing congregation in Downpatrick worships in a building erected over  years ago, encouraging them to keep this faith going.He continued this theme with readings from Psalm  and the first letter to John, explaining the dference in the perception of God from the Old to the New Testament, with the departing ministerrsquos sermon reminding the congregation that despite their comfortable lives, to continue to do Godrsquos work in the community.Laura Patterson accompanied the hymns lsquoHoly, holy, holyrsquo, lsquoJust as I amrsquo, The Lordrsquos my shepherdrsquo and lsquoGod sent his Sonrsquo.At the conclusion of the service, church treasurer, Carol Nixon, spoke of Dr Steers leadership, pastoral care and how he led by example, fully participating in all the church worship and witness as well as many fundraising events.In addition, she reminded those in attendance of his leadership, both within the church group and in the community where he is well known and respected by all denominations, and wishing him the congregationrsquos blessing in his new charge.The Downpatrick churchrsquos senior elder, Mr Freddie Straney, made a presentation to Dr Steers and thanked him for his loyalty and  yearsrsquo service.Eileen Neill, on behalf of the younger members, presented Dr. Steers with a delightful and talented illustration of the Downpatrick church which she had created, with Ms Nixon presenting the ministerrsquos we Sue, with a flower arrangement, thanking her for the many ways she had supported her husband both in and outside the pulpit.Also during Sundayrsquos service, the congregation took the opportunity of presenting Mary Stewart with a gold brooch, church illustration by Eileen Neill, flowers and rose plants to mark her  years as church secretary.Dr Steers responded to his gts with moving words which touched everyonersquos spirit.He recalled how he became associated with the church in  and was in charge in  before being fully appointed in the group, also thanking Mary for all her work.The ious speeches were dficult and emotional, but very sincere and from the heart.

Picture by Brian LittleI first met him at Stormont in the late s, when he was still at school, and a frequent visitor to Stormont with his friend and constituency predecessor Mark Robinson MLA.As a student he was a bit of a political geek, with a depth of knowledge and analysis of local, national and international politics that belied his youth, equally at home discussing the latest developments in Washington or Westminster, as he was with Sandy Row or Stormont . As with many of us who were involved in politics from a young age, he initially came across as a bit square and we often joked that he started off middle aged and became younger with age.He came from a close and loving family, but was not born with a silver spoon in his mouth, and achieved his many successes through hard work and ability. Indeed, from early meetings his intelligence, talent and potential shone through, which was why as soon as I joined the DUP in , I headhunted him to work for me, first as a student, and then after graduation, becoming his first employer.    \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

High Sherf, Deputy Mayor and MLA filled me with pride but given his abilities no little surprise. When he became Principal Deputy Speaker he was filled with joy, not least because he knew the pleasure it would give his much loved family.Christopher was someone who cared about his city and his community. Although he moved house several times, it was always within Belfast itself. He was passionately committed to delivering for his constituents, and was a fearsome debater, who could deliver an argument with clarity, passion and wit. He was a true Unionist and Orangeman through and through, andyou had cut him in two he would have had DUP written through him like a stick of rock.He was not however a two dimensional political ideologue. Although he never swayed in his unionist convictions, his friendships and courtesy cut across the political spectrum. Indeed one of his sparring partners from Queens, Mary Durkan who became an SDLP Councillor in Londonderry, would be sure to ask me any time I met her “How is Stalfie doing ” The breadth of tributes paid to Christopher is a measure of the respect he engendered throughout the political world and beyond.Christopher was a Bon viveur and good company, a man with a wide hinterland of interests, and hidden depths as anyone who has heard him perform Sinatra in karaoke can testy. He was also a man of quiet, untrumpeted kindness. When my mother died a few months ago, knowing that I would be alone, he insisted that I spend Christmas Day with him and his family, That was the Christopher that lay behind the public image.Above all he was a devoted family man, who glowed with love and pride for his beloved we Laura and their four children. The country has lost a great representative, I have lost a great friend, but it is the loss of a husband, father, son and brother that will be most keenly felt and cruelly missed.

Just this week, we discussed his eldest child’s school transfer and it is dficult to put into words my shock, sadness and devastation just days later we are discussing his passing.“He was a genuine and funny person, who was dedicated to public service. Christopher revelled in the role of Principal Deputy Speaker of the Assembly, carrying out his duties in an even-handed and fair manner, no matter the situation.”Mrs Long added: “My thoughts, prayers and deepest sympathies are with Christopher’s we Laura, his four children, the wider family circle and his party colleagues.“His friends and colleagues throughout the world of politics will miss his political contribution, and his constituents his local efforts and leadership across South Belfast.”• North Antrim MP Ian Paisley has paid his own tribute to Christopher Stalford – a DUP colleague he described as “colourful and full of fun”.Mr Paisley said: “To Laura and his lovely wee family I express my prayers and deepest condolences and pray God will comfort them in this valley of tears.“Christopher was a young energetic and enthusiastic member of the party from before his days at Queens University where he become very actively involved in politics.“On meeting Christopher in those days It was inevitable that he would make a le in political service. He just loved politics and engagement with the public and he was an excellent barometer of where public opinion within unionism rested.”He said a “shadow of loss” hangs over the party.Mr Paisley added: “He rose very quickly through the ranks of the party achieving electoral success and ultimately making the South Belfast assembly seat his own. He was cut out for the deputy speaker role and would have no doubt climbed to higher office.“I last spoke to Chris in the middle of the past week after his appearance on the media.

He said: “I’m sure you meant well, but that last line is, at best, misjudged, and at worst, is offensive to his family who would rather he was with them.”But Alliance leader Naomi Long lept to her defence.“Please, stop attacking Carl Lockhart over her tweet, today of all days,” she tweeted. “She is grieving.” Ms Long noted Carla was quoting Philippians v “about the faithful being torn between service in this le and being with Christ in eternity”. She added: “It’s a very common Christian quote, which his family will understand.” Her tweet attracted over  likes.Similarly, SDLP leader Colum Eastwood branded the criticism as “disgusting”, adding that it “shows how this  can be so poisonous”. He added: “Many people seem to converse in a way that they would never dream of doing in person. I just don’t get it. Solidarity with Carla Lockhart.”Ms Lockhart told the News Letter that she stands by her comment. “Christopher’s faith, shared by Laura, his beloved we, offers that promise of eternal le in glory when the Lord calls us home,” she said.“That time is not of our choosing - Christopher’s love and zest for le, and most of all his love for his family - would have meant he no doubt would have loved to have lived a long le. But we know that was not God’s plan.“For the family - in the depths of such sorrow - there is great comfort in that surety that Christopher is in his heavenly home. The surety of our eternal home however does not remove the sadness for those left behind.”Another tweeter, Fred Crawford, also came to her defence. He said: “The comments underneath show the widespread illiteracy regarding Christianity in our society. All Christians believe that to be with Christ is far better, that is the hope of the faith and why we believe what we do. This view should be respected right now.”A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe prehistoric specimen has been hailed as the best-preserved skeleton of a pterosaur – a huge flying reptile – and the largest ever discovered from the Jurassic period.The giant winged creature, more popularly known as pterodactyls, is closely related to dinosaurs and had an estimated wingspan of more than . metres, similar to that of an albatross today.The fossil, which was found during a National Geographic Society-funded excavation on the Isle of Skye in , will now be added to the museum’s collection, where it was unveiled on Tuesday.Speaking about the ground-breaking discovery, University of Edinburgh PhD student Natalia Jagielska, who was lead author in a new paper featuring the fossil, described the finding as “a discovery of the century”.Posing proudly with it for photos, Ms Jagielska said: “The finding has pieced together a huge gap in fossil records for us.“I am glad that the world is going to see one of the best pterosaurs that has been discovered in centuries.“Britain hasn’t seen this kind of preservation of pterosaurs in  years.“It’s a discovery of the century, this doesn’t really happen.”The palaeontology expert said the last time such findings were made was during the days of Mary Anning – a palaeontologist celebrated for her discoveries of Jurassic fossils – in the early s.Holding a much smaller stuffed toy version of the reptile on her shoulder, Ms Jagielska said the fossil shows that the pterosaur was “much bigger and more erse than we expected during the Jurassic period.”“They were also very goofy looking creatures,” she laughed.“The discovery is also super interesting because this fossil shows there was clearly a lot of evolution going on in that time period.“And it shows that Scotland is a key piece to discovering that evolutionary iation, the best place in the world, it might be..remove“If these delicate bones of the pterosaur can be preserved well, that means other creatures can, andother creatures can, we might fill the gap in records of the Jurassic period just in Scotland alone.”Professor Steve Brusatte, a palaeontologist and professor at the University of Edinburgh, explained how the “superlative” fossil was found on the trip which he led about five years ago.“It was a very stressful excavation as we were battling the tides to cut this thing out the rock with diamond-tipped saws,” he said.“We actually lostfor a moment as the waves lapped up over it and we had to come back near midnight to get the most of it out.”He said the fossil, with bones “feather light” and “as thin as sheets of paper”, took several days to cut from rock.Running his hand over part of the reptile’s jaw found in the historic specimen, Prof Brusatte described the discovery as “the best thing we’ve found on Skye”.“I have been bringing my teams to Skye from Edinburgh for about a decade now, but this one takes the prize.“This is a crown jewel fossil and is a beautul, exquisite skeleton.“The thing about working on Skye is we are always battling the tides, so it’s a very challenging place to work.“But when you find something like this, it’s so worth it.”The painstaking excavation was led by Dugald Ross, of Staffin Museum, which he built himself in the s when he was just a teenager.Amelia Penny, a post-doctoral researcher at the University of St Andrews, was the one who first discovered the fossil during Prof Brusatte’s field trip after spotting its jaw protruding from limestone at Rubha nam Brathairean .“I knew I had found something interesting,” Ms Penny said, recounting the jaw-dropping moment.“There were other teams on the beach with me that day and they said: ‘We think this could be a pterosaur skull, we think this could be really signicant’.”Speaking at the fossil’s unveiling on Tuesday, Ms Penny said: “I feel proud to have spotted it.“I also need to be humble about it, there was an element of chance with me finding it.“But I feel very proud, I feel very lucky.”The species found is a new species of pterosaur, Professor Brusatte said, and experts have called it Dearc sgiathanach , which translates as “winged reptile” and also references the Isle of Skye, whose Gaelic name means “the winged isle.”The specimen will be the subject of further study by Ms Jagielska, which aims to reveal more about Dearc’s behaviour, particularly how it lived and flew.Pterosaurs were the first vertebrates to evolve powered flight, some  million years before birds.They lived throughout the Mesozoic era – the so-called age of reptiles – as far back as the Triassic Period, about  million years ago.In the later Cretaceous Period – the time of Tyrannosaurus rex and Triceratops – and immediately before the extinction event that wiped out the dinosaurs  million years ago, pterosaurs grew to the size of fighter jets.However, they were previously thought to have been much smaller during the Jurassic Period.Fragmentary specimens from England had hinted at the possibility that larger pterosaurs lived during the Jurassic Period and Dearc sgiathanach is the first complete specimen to confirm this.The unique fossil will now be added to National Museums Scotland’s collection and studied further..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga,

Women are more likely to ditch their partner than their pet, found a poll for nationwide pet retailer Jollyes. Asked about their relationship with their partner and their pet and which one they would ditch first,  per cent said they would ditch their partner against  per cent who would ditch their pet. Men were more loyal to their partners, with  per cent saying they would ditch their pet and  per cent saying they would ditch their partner. Overall,  per cent would ditch their partner first and  per cent said the pet would go first. The study was carried out by Jollyes to gauge humans’ attitudes to romance and relationships as it launches the search on social media for a canine couple to take part in a romantic dinner for two at its doggy dates diner, “C’est Jollyes”, open for one day only on  February at its Runcorn store in Cheshire . Two dogs will get the chance to enjoy a three course dinner featuring a menu from Jollyes Artisan Lestage range including angus beef with sweet potato, venison and salmon, and duck with sweet potato. The survey showed some big dferences in attitudes to pets and partners around the UK. People in North East England were more likely to ditch their partnerover their pet, followed by London , Northern Ireland , South West . [See table in editor’s notes below for regional breakdown.] Owners were asked what they loved most about their pets, with loyalty, unconditional love, loving nature, affection and a warm heart among the qualities cited. No matter how much love an animal gives, most pet ownerswould prefer a romantic Valentine’s night with their partner than one spent with their pet. Of male respondents,  per cent chose a night with their partner, compared with  per cent of female respondents. The figures were broadly similar across the country. Among the other popular traits cited by pet owners were: “they are so loyal and loving. And cute!” “unconditional love and loyalty” “they comfort me when I’m feeling blue” “doesnt argue or answer back” “they always cheer me up” “waggy tail and warm heart” and “her loving nature, always there for me when I need her”. One said: “Sometimes playful, sometimes cuddly, intelligent, independent, sometimes dangerous. All rather like my partner really.” Not everyone was totally enamoured with their pet. One said: “Nothing, it hates me, only loves my we”. And not all pets’ traits would make for a romantic night out – one said: “hassle free”, another said “doesn’t answer back” and one said “it’s a tortoise and he’s as indferent to use as we are to him”. Phil Turner-Naylor, head of marketing at Jollyes, said: “We’re known as a nation of animal lovers and this goes to prove it. When it comes to relationships, a lot people would choose their pet over their partner. “The good news for romantics though is that a big majority choose people over pets. What it does show, especially for men, is that partners have to work hard to keep the romance going or they might find themselves in the dog house. Women are looking for a romantic night with their partner on Valentine’s, butthe men don’t get it right, they had better watch out.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_abbfecaabacdf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_addddbfbadfc   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1645089617694.jpg--1_700_people_apply_for_a_life_less_ordinary_with_stena_line.jpg?164508961700","title":"  people apply for a life less ordinary with stena line ","story":"Ferry company Stena Line has been overwhelmed with the positive response from the public to its recent recruitment campaign ‘A Le Less Ordinary’, which aims to fill  vacant positions onboard its Irish Sea ferries. , applications were received from people across the UK and Republic of Ireland. The campaign promoted the unique nature of le onboard, with % time-off providing the perfect work-le balance for people wanting to live and work onboard for either a one or two-week sht and then spend equal time off. The positions available are part of the Onboard Sales and Servicesteam, with vacancies for service assistants and chefs. With January being the traditional time of the year when many people look for a new career, Stena Line had hoped for a favourable response but even the most optimistic of predictions could not have expected it to be so over-subscribed. Stena Line has now undertaken the initial stage of the selection process and, for the first-time, is hosting two Open Days for prospective candidates on Monday th February, where they will get a chance to meet members of Stena Line’s crews. The Open Days are taking place in Belfast and Birkenhead with the latter being held onboard one of Stena Line’s newest ferries, Stena Edda, giving candidates a chance to get a first-hand taste of le onboard on the Irish Sea. Stephen Bryden, Stena Line’s Head of Onboard Sales and Services, commented on the success of the campaign: “I am astonished by the public’s response to the A Le Less Ordinary recruitment campaign. We have never received so many applications. It really goes to show how many people are attracted to a le at sea with a company like Stena Line. Now our HR team has the challenge of how to sort and interview so many applicants, but that is a nice challenge to have. Thank you to every single person that has applied to work with us.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_abbfecaabacdf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_addddbfbadfc   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1564499438658.jpg--agri_food_leaders_call_on_stormont_to_follow_the_science_on_climate_change_legislation.jpg?156449943800","title":"agri food leaders call on stormont to follow the science on climate change legislation ","story":"Industry leaders within the agri-food supply chain have said thatpassed unchanged, the Executive Climate Change Bill would have devastating consequences, including job losses, for the Northern Ireland economy. The damage done to local food production will require a reliance on food imports that would exacerbate global emissions and increase prices for the consumer. The impact would be particularly felt in rural towns and communities who depend on the sector for their livelihoods. They are calling on Assembly MLAs to recty the Bill by making meaningful amendments that are in line with the scientic evidence and that support their local communities who rely on the sector for their livelihoods. The organisations behind this warning are the Dairy Council for Northern Ireland the Northern Ireland Food  Drink AssociationNorthern Ireland Grain Trade Association , Northern Ireland Meat Exporters Association , the Livestock and Meat Commission , the Ulster Farmers Union . Speaking on behalf of this supply chain alliance, Conall Donnelly, Chief Executive of NIMEA said: “To be very clear, our collective members are in support of Climate Change legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We want to play our part. We are already investing in and implementing carbon-reducing technologies right across our supply chain and will continue to do so. Because of our natural grass advantage, we already have a world-class reputation for sustainable food production. Our high-quality beef, lamb and dairy produce is reared with care on small family farms utilising natural grass and is the envy of many countries around the world. We believe Northern Ireland has the potential to be a shining light in sustainable food production. We want to work with policy makers to get this right for the environment and the local economy. That means having realistic and science-based climate change targets relevant to Northern Ireland so that we can continue to be part of the solution to climate change.” David Brown, Deputy President of the UFU said, “ passed without further amendments, this legislation would not follow the expert advice from scientists that make up the International Panel of Climate Change and the UK’s Climate Change Committee. It could unnecessarily obliterate tens of thousands of jobs as well as threaten consumer access to affordable, quality food. Perversely, food may need to be imported from where which would simply increase global emissions. “This Bill also has the potential to damage rural towns and communities who depend on our sector for their livelihoods. But it will affect us all as consumers when we are no longer able to access local fresh food that is produced to high environmental and animal welfare standards. We are asking politicians to work with us. We want to tackle climate change in a way that helps protect the environment and maintains the unique economic and social role that agriculture and food production has on this island.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_acdbdbcbcabc   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ddcdfbafeecdcfe   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1645454612923.jpg--covid_19___mon_21st_february_figures.jpg?164545461200","title":"covid  mon st february figures ","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows four further coronavirus related death and , new positive test results.
