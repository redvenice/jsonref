Valeska previously worked as a messenger for David Miscavige and claims she had a close relationship with his wife Shelly Miscavige (right)  57, who has not been seen in public since 2006          Valeska claims members were not allowed to look at Tom Cruise in the eye, talk to him, and had to address him as \u0027sir\u0027 when he came around . Above he is pictured in 2008 with Katie Holmes and David Miscavige          Valeska was 18 years old when she was ordered to work aboard the Freewinds ship, which is used by top management and members who pay huge sums to live onboard for weeks at a time completing high-level Scientology courses Valeska, who was 18 at the time, says she spent the next 12 years on the ship \u0027against her will.\u0027 However, in a statement to DailyMail.com, the Church of Scientology denied that Jaquier\u0027s death was a suicide and said his death had \u0027no bearing\u0027 on Valeska being transferred to Freewinds. In a death certificate provided by the church to DailyMail.com, Jaquier\u0027s cause of death was determined to be \u0027natural\u0027 from his history of heart disease.They also claim he was worth about $1.2m at the time of his death.   \u0027Ms. Paris served as a crew member aboard the Freewinds religious retreat as a volunteer religious worker from September 1996 to December 2007. She was an adult and there of her own free will as part of her religious commitment to the Church of Scientology,\u0027 a spokesperson for the church said. Valeska says that during her first six months on the ship she was working on decks and in the engine room before being moved to the restaurant.\u0027When I was first on the ship, I had my passport seized, no days off for six months, no privileges, phone calls were not allowed. I was told by the captain I was never getting off the ship,\u0027 she claims.\u0027The ship was full of blue asbestos, every night we\u0027d get on our knees, we\u0027d be picking chunks of blue asbestos with our bare hands, to this day, I have this cough which won\u0027t go away. I finally got off decks and worked in the restaurant.\u0027 She recalls one of the busiest times on the ship was during the annual Maiden Voyage, a special week-long event which saw many church VIPs come aboard the Freewinds.\u0027We worked many, many late nights. Before Maiden Voyage, we\u0027d be working until 4 a.m., and during it, we wouldn\u0027t be sleeping at all. I would fall asleep on the toilet. \u0027If you have so little sleep, you lose your memory, I\u0027d forget what people wanted to drink or even ordered to eat. During this time, I would be in COB\u0027s dining room, serving the food, and cleaning up. \u0027When he saw me on my first Maiden Voyage, he called me over and said: I forgot I\u0027d sent you here, how do you like it? and I said: No, I really didn\u0027t like it at first, but now I\u0027m getting used to it.\u0027\u0027\u0027He couldn\u0027t believe it, and said: Why don\u0027t you like it?\u0027          Valeska said she once broke the rules and had to serve Tom Cruise and then-girlfriend Penelope Cruz on Freewinds in 2003.  She claims females were forbidden by Miscavige from serving Cruise because, \u0027He\u0027s so good looking that if you serve him, you\u0027ll end up falling in love with him.\u0027          Valeska was a second-generation Scientologist, starting off as a cadet at its headquarters in Saint Hill, England, she then signed a billion-year contract to be a full-time member of the Sea Org, even though she was only 14. She later moved to Clearwater, Florida, where the church is basedAfter Maiden Voyage in 2003, Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz came aboard the ship and crew members were expected to follow a strict set of rules while tending to them, she claims.  \u0027They\u0027d spend all their time ing and playing around on a $2,000-a-day yacht with Miscavige, meanwhile, we\u0027d be working under horrific conditions.\u0027We were shown pictures of Tom, Penelope and all his entourage so we knew who they all were. \u0027We were told not to tell anyone they were coming, otherwise you\u0027d be sent to the RPF. You can\u0027t look at him in the eye, you can\u0027t talk to him, address him as sir, and stay the f*** out of his way.\u0027We then found out that he was coming on the ship tomorrow, so COB was asking who was going to serve him. He ended up picking a man as he said no woman is allowed to serve him. \u0027He said, and this is the God\u0027s honest truth, right in front of me and two other women: He\u0027s so good looking that if you serve him, you\u0027ll end up falling in love with him.\u0027The next morning, Tom had his breakfast while COB was sleeping - he was in bed every day until midday - and the guy who was meant to serve him overslept, so I ended up serving him. \u0027He had this egg white omelette with a bunch of vegetables. Penelope came in a white dress and she had a special diet as well. \u0027She was very nice, super calm, wearing no make up, laid back, but he was very hyper. Tom and COB only drank Smart Water, all meals were specially made. I also served Penelope for dinner.\u0027Any couples not married who came on the ship were not allowed to share a cabin, but Tom was allowed a room with her. Sea Org members were angry, there was hostility about that. \u0027Every night they\u0027d watch a movie in the cinema room. He was very much in love with Penelope and happy. Penelope was getting audited at the time in 2003, she was doing Scientology for sure. When she left the Church, the auditor got in trouble.\u0027          Valeska signed a billion-year contract to be a full-time member of the Sea Org at 14 The following year, after he split from Cruz, the Mission Impossible actor came back right after Maiden Voyage and it was his 42nd birthday, but Valeska was not invited. Miscavige made sure it was a night to be remembered. Cringe-worthy YouTube clips have surfaced from the event showing Cruise, now 56, singing and dancing to the band, then proclaiming: \u0027This is incredible... It\u0027s the best birthday ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, and I mean: ever!\u0027Valeska says: \u0027The Starlight Cabaret, which is the entertainment and event space on the ship, was decorated for Tom\u0027s birthday, it looked ridiculous, there was every poster of every movie he\u0027d ever done, apart from ones with Nicole Kidman. She was considered a Suppressive Person. No Nicole posters allowed anywhere. \u0027They also did a concert and all the songs were from movies he\u0027d been in except Nicole ones. They flew his favorite Chinese chef to cook for him, this was all paid for by Scientology.\u0027I was one of the only people on the ship who was not allowed to go to his birthday, as I had the audacity to have a cold sore, I was so run down,\u0027 she says. From then on, she claims, she was taken off the ship for every Maiden Voyage. \u0027I got put in isolation, had an ethics interview, and security check to find out what my evil intentions were to COB and Shelly: Do you have an evil purpose to COB? Do you want to do something bad to him? They do this line of questioning until they find out why I am evil to them. And when you come up with nothing you get yelled at and told to confront your evil intentions,\u0027 she says.\u0027It was all a blessing in disguise, as I can\u0027t dance, and everyone was ordered to dance. There were three girls, who did dance, and then accused of flirting with him, so they were locked in a room, told to write up their crimes for being interesting in front of Tom Cruise.    Valeska says she considered Shelly (pictured left, and right, with Leah Remini) a \u0027mother figure\u0027 who took her under her wing           This is the Scientology base in Twin Peaks, California, where Shelly is believed to live          Valeska doesn\u0027t believe Shelly is living in a \u0027Scientology prison\u0027 as others have suggested and thinks she is not there against her will\u0027The only Scientology celebrity that COB likes is Tom Cruise, the others are all below him. Tom Cruise would call him on the phone, they\u0027d be on the phone all the time,\u0027 she claims.       Although Valeska feared Miscavige, she claims she had a close relationship with his wife, Shelly Miscavige, who has not been seen in public in more than a decade. \u0027But my relationship with Shelly was great, she kept an eye on me, and was keen for me to keep up with my education. Scientology didn\u0027t care, and we were never sent to school as Sea Org members,\u0027 she claims.  Valeska says Shelly was like a \u0027mother figure\u0027 to her and she kept in touch with her through letters even after she was sent away on Freewinds. \u0027We wrote letters for years, she took me under her wing. When I was first engaged to a guy, she wrote two pages demanding to know everything. From the age of 15 to 25, for ten years we would write back and forth,\u0027 she says.August marked the 12-year anniversary since Shelly was last seen in public. Former church members have speculated that she has been at a secret Scientology base called Twin Peaks in the San Bernardino Mountains since 2006.Valeska, however, has a different theory and doesn\u0027t believe Shelly is living in a \u0027Scientology prison\u0027 as others have suggested.\u0027She\u0027s not there against her will, the treatment she\u0027ll be getting is a lot better than most would receive. She\u0027s living in the mountains and, yes, sure, she\u0027s under security watch and it won\u0027t be like before, as she was living like a queen,\u0027 she says.\u0027Yet, it\u0027s not like she\u0027ll be in RPF (Rehabilitation Project Force) conditions. Imagine his wife going into the RPF, she knows more than anyone about COB\u0027s secrets, he is going to have to keep her happy.\u0027The church has long denied any rumors suggesting Shelly is missing and have insisted that she is devoting her time to the work of the Church of Scientology.Valeska says she used to see Shelly on the ship when she came aboard for Maiden Voyage and the two kept in touch through written correspondence about their personal lives, including Valeska\u0027s first marriage. Weddings were common among Sea Org members and most married as teens and twenty-somethings since sexual contact is not allowed before marriage. \u0027When I was on the ship, I married a guy called Roberto, I was only 20. Shelly was pleased, she told me: Good, you have someone to look after you, I don\u0027t need to do it. She wanted to see all the photos from my wedding album,\u0027 she says.          Valeska eventually fled the church after completing RPF (Rehabilitation Project Force) in Australia. She now lives with her husband and three kids - Declan, eight, Evan, six, Rhys, in Brisbane           An email conversation between Valeska and her father Jean-Francois Paris, shows how leaving that church has forbidden her from speaking to her own dad  The negative publicity rocked the church and Miscavige.\u0027I would hear him scream at the top of his lungs while I was working in the kitchen next to the execs room, I would be shaking, it was so scary. \u0027When Lisa McPherson happened, he changed. All of the execs he was friends with, that all disappeared. His circle went even smaller,\u0027 she alleges.Shelly\u0027s usually strong relationship with her husband began to falter - he dismissed the whole of his board of executives in favor of younger, more eager to please, dedicated Sea Org members, such as Lou Stuckenbrock, for whom he created the position \u0027COB Communicator\u0027.\u0027Shelly became more and more stressed out. COB would be in the dining room with his Communicator Lou and she would eat afterwards,\u0027 Valeska claims.\u0027In her letters she would never say anything, but she was writing less and less, I got the sense she was more stressed. She wasn\u0027t perfect, but she stood by COB for years, and I never saw them argue, but I always saw that he was very close with Lou.\u0027In 2005, he said in a meeting that Shelly had been taken off his lines, but he wasn\u0027t going to orce her, he was way too qualified to ever marry any other Sea Org member. She was extremely dedicated to him. His words were: She messed up his communication lines.\u0027 Shelly has since retreated from public life once a prominent member of the church, she was even absent at Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes\u0027s wedding in 2006.In 2013, Hollywood actress and famous Church defector Leah Remini filed a missing person report with the Los Angeles Police Department for Shelly. Police eventually said that they had interviewed Shelly and confirmed she wasn\u0027t being held against her will and didn\u0027t want to make any public statement.  Valeska\u0027s correspondence with Shelly came to a stop after she left. She says her time at the church worsened in 2007, after she was sent to England \u0027on a mission\u0027 during Maiden Voyage.Only days into it, Valeska got into hot water for daring to speak to a married man and she was ordered back to the Freewinds and sent to the engine room. After all this treatment, Valeska was suicidal and desperate to get out.\u0027In my mind, I was either going to end it or get off that ship,\u0027 she adds. But Valeska also had no skills for the real world, her brother Raphael, 36, and father Jean, 66, were and still are in the church today, she\u0027d never be allowed to see them again if she absconded.She\u0027d also \u0027disconnected\u0027 from her mother Ariane and younger sister Melissa, 38, 14 years ago when they left the Church.\u0027They wouldn\u0027t let me off this ship. I had served COB and knew their dirty little secrets. It was still hard to leave, I\u0027d been in the Sea Org since 14, I had no education, no money, never had a bank account, I had no idea how to live in the real world.  \u0027I\u0027d lose my brother and father instantly, I didn\u0027t know if my mom or sister would reconnect or where they lived. I\u0027d been indoctrinated that Scientology is life,\u0027 she says.Valeska was sent to the RPF in Australia, in the hope that it would \u0027rehabilitate\u0027 her. During this time, she met Chris Guider, a former rugby league legend in Australia who gave it all up in the 80s for Scientology.\u0027After graduating the RPF, they started making my life hell again. They were threatening to send me back to the ship, but I\u0027d already decided I would never, ever go back to that place again,\u0027 she says.\u0027When we finally got free, we had no one to judge us, I could watch TV when I wanted to, I had a normal room that wasn\u0027t a dormitory, I felt so much freedom. That\u0027s when I realized that Scientology was, in a nutshell, s**t.\u0027I hadn\u0027t seen my mom and sister for ages. I hadn\u0027t seen my mom for so long that when I first saw her, I went up to the wrong person. We didn\u0027t recognize each other. \u0027My dad sent me a text saying he was going to disconnect from me for talking to my mom and sister, this was at the same time as I was eight months pregnant with my first child.\u0027Today, Chris and Valeska now live happily in Brisbane and have three children - Declan, eight, Evan, six, Rhys, three - but still live under the shadow of Scientology\u0027s disconnection policy.Valeska said: \u0027I have three children who\u0027ve never met their grandfather. I haven\u0027t spoken to my brother since 2010. My family is destroyed. But we got out and we\u0027re having a good life. Hopefully my dad and brother will wake up one day, and my door will always be open for them.\u0027In a statement to DailyMail.com the church said: \u0027What has been said about us all too often—as is the case here—is pure propaganda. It is inaccurate and intentionally avoids showing who Scientologists really are and what we do. \u0027Propagandists look to capitalize on the growing curiosity about Scientology. They have manufactured controversies where there are none while refusing to show the Church, its organizations, its humanitarian programs as well as its unprecedented growth in Churches worldwide.

Ms Parr, pictured with the fine, said the penalty had been cancelled but she wants an apology from the parking firm and has been trying to get one for four months\u0027That was when we got into the car and released that something isn\u0027t quite right.\u0027There were crumbs all over the back seat and the petrol light was on so I knew then that the car had been driven.\u0027 The £70 fine from Parking Eye said the vehicle arrived at 9.16am before leaving  at 10.36am.Ms Parr said: \u0027We were simply gobsmacked. We immediately called Asda and explained the situation and they agreed to drop the charge.\u0027We called Manchester Airport Parking Services Limited and demanded answers.\u0027We complained that the company had been driving our vehicle but they just simply ignored us and said someone will get back to you.\u0027This is clearly not the professional service you expect from an airport car service.\u0027In August, £70 appeared in her bank account from the company which Ms Parr said she assumed was to cover the fine.She added: \u0027This was extremely odd. We then phoned Greater Manchester Police to report what had happened with the car.\u0027However after a few weeks of investigation, we were told that we could not prosecute because they don\u0027t know who the driver was at the time of it being in Asda.\u0027Ms Parr claims she has contacted the company seven times but said she has not had an explanation.She added: \u0027Every time I rang the company, I was just told that someone would get back to me but I never heard anything back.\u0027          Ms Parr, pictured, said the honeymoon was \u0027spoiled\u0027 by the incident\u0027I have gone through hell trying to find out what happened to our car, it\u0027s actually spoiled our honeymoon completely.\u0027I feel like I have been burgled because the police cannot do anything in taking action against this firm.\u0027The whole experience has been absolutely disgusting.\u0027Manchester Airport Car Parking Services has not responded to a request for comment.The firm has previously been accused of losing cars, racking up speeding tickets and damaging a valuable Range Rover in a collision with a bus. One young family with a three-month-old baby claimed they were stranded for hours after the company allegedly crashed their car into a tree in June this year.The family claim they had to pay the recovery bill for the wreckage and have been told the company will not pay up to replace it. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/11/17/4F108BD300000578-0-image-a-22_1536683094276.jpg","title":"Ex Scientologist reveals women forbidden serve Tom Cruise","story":"    Former Scientologist Valeska Paris (pictured with a guest aboard Scientology ship Freewinds) has told how she was allegedly banished to the notorious cruise ship by church leader David Miscavige when she was 18           Valeska (left) who was born into the church, claims she was sent to work on the ship after her stepfather\u0027s suicide - which caused a publicity scandal after his death was blamed on ScientologyValeska, a second-generation Scientologist, was born into the church in Switzerland through her parents Ariane Jackson and Jean Françoise Paris.Rising up the ranks, first as a cadet at its headquarters in Saint Hill, England, she then signed a billion-year contract to be a full-time member of the Sea Org, even though she was only 14. She later moved to Clearwater, Florida, where the church is based. After Valeska\u0027s parents split up when she was a child, her mother married Albert Jaquier, a Scientologist and successful businessman who she claims  lost his entire fortune to the church, blowing $6 million on expensive courses.She says he later committed suicide, leaving a diary, which denounced Scientology for pushing him over the edge. Although they\u0027d split up before his death, an incensed Ariane went public and exposed the church for their treatment of Albert.With her mother causing a PR commotion, a panicking Miscavige allegedly ordered Valeska to be sent to the Freewinds ship, which is used by top management and members who pay huge sums to live on board for weeks at a time completing high-level Scientology courses.

He ended up picking a man as he said no woman is allowed to serve him. \u0027He said, and this is the God\u0027s honest truth, right in front of me and two other women: He\u0027s so good looking that if you serve him, you\u0027ll end up falling in love with him.\u0027The next morning, Tom had his breakfast while COB was sleeping - he was in bed every day until midday - and the guy who was meant to serve him overslept, so I ended up serving him. \u0027He had this egg white omelette with a bunch of vegetables. Penelope came in a white dress and she had a special diet as well. \u0027She was very nice, super calm, wearing no make up, laid back, but he was very hyper. Tom and COB only drank Smart Water, all meals were specially made. I also served Penelope for dinner.\u0027Any couples not married who came on the ship were not allowed to share a cabin, but Tom was allowed a room with her. Sea Org members were angry, there was hostility about that. \u0027Every night they\u0027d watch a movie in the cinema room. He was very much in love with Penelope and happy. Penelope was getting audited at the time in 2003, she was doing Scientology for sure. When she left the Church, the auditor got in trouble.\u0027          Valeska signed a billion-year contract to be a full-time member of the Sea Org at 14 The following year, after he split from Cruz, the Mission Impossible actor came back right after Maiden Voyage and it was his 42nd birthday, but Valeska was not invited. Miscavige made sure it was a night to be remembered. Cringe-worthy YouTube clips have surfaced from the event showing Cruise, now 56, singing and dancing to the band, then proclaiming: \u0027This is incredible... It\u0027s the best birthday ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, and I mean: ever!\u0027Valeska says: \u0027The Starlight Cabaret, which is the entertainment and event space on the ship, was decorated for Tom\u0027s birthday, it looked ridiculous, there was every poster of every movie he\u0027d ever done, apart from ones with Nicole Kidman. She was considered a Suppressive Person. No Nicole posters allowed anywhere. \u0027They also did a concert and all the songs were from movies he\u0027d been in except Nicole ones. They flew his favorite Chinese chef to cook for him, this was all paid for by Scientology.\u0027I was one of the only people on the ship who was not allowed to go to his birthday, as I had the audacity to have a cold sore, I was so run down,\u0027 she says. From then on, she claims, she was taken off the ship for every Maiden Voyage. \u0027I got put in isolation, had an ethics interview, and security check to find out what my evil intentions were to COB and Shelly: Do you have an evil purpose to COB? Do you want to do something bad to him? They do this line of questioning until they find out why I am evil to them. And when you come up with nothing you get yelled at and told to confront your evil intentions,\u0027 she says.\u0027It was all a blessing in disguise, as I can\u0027t dance, and everyone was ordered to dance. There were three girls, who did dance, and then accused of flirting with him, so they were locked in a room, told to write up their crimes for being interesting in front of Tom Cruise.    Valeska says she considered Shelly (pictured left, and right, with Leah Remini) a \u0027mother figure\u0027 who took her under her wing           This is the Scientology base in Twin Peaks, California, where Shelly is believed to live          Valeska doesn\u0027t believe Shelly is living in a \u0027Scientology prison\u0027 as others have suggested and thinks she is not there against her will\u0027The only Scientology celebrity that COB likes is Tom Cruise, the others are all below him. Tom Cruise would call him on the phone, they\u0027d be on the phone all the time,\u0027 she claims.       Although Valeska feared Miscavige, she claims she had a close relationship with his wife, Shelly Miscavige, who has not been seen in public in more than a decade. \u0027But my relationship with Shelly was great, she kept an eye on me, and was keen for me to keep up with my education. Scientology didn\u0027t care, and we were never sent to school as Sea Org members,\u0027 she claims.  Valeska says Shelly was like a \u0027mother figure\u0027 to her and she kept in touch with her through letters even after she was sent away on Freewinds. \u0027We wrote letters for years, she took me under her wing. When I was first engaged to a guy, she wrote two pages demanding to know everything. From the age of 15 to 25, for ten years we would write back and forth,\u0027 she says.August marked the 12-year anniversary since Shelly was last seen in public. Former church members have speculated that she has been at a secret Scientology base called Twin Peaks in the San Bernardino Mountains since 2006.Valeska, however, has a different theory and doesn\u0027t believe Shelly is living in a \u0027Scientology prison\u0027 as others have suggested.\u0027She\u0027s not there against her will, the treatment she\u0027ll be getting is a lot better than most would receive. She\u0027s living in the mountains and, yes, sure, she\u0027s under security watch and it won\u0027t be like before, as she was living like a queen,\u0027 she says.\u0027Yet, it\u0027s not like she\u0027ll be in RPF (Rehabilitation Project Force) conditions. Imagine his wife going into the RPF, she knows more than anyone about COB\u0027s secrets, he is going to have to keep her happy.\u0027The church has long denied any rumors suggesting Shelly is missing and have insisted that she is devoting her time to the work of the Church of Scientology.Valeska says she used to see Shelly on the ship when she came aboard for Maiden Voyage and the two kept in touch through written correspondence about their personal lives, including Valeska\u0027s first marriage. Weddings were common among Sea Org members and most married as teens and twenty-somethings since sexual contact is not allowed before marriage. \u0027When I was on the ship, I married a guy called Roberto, I was only 20. Shelly was pleased, she told me: Good, you have someone to look after you, I don\u0027t need to do it. She wanted to see all the photos from my wedding album,\u0027 she says.          Valeska eventually fled the church after completing RPF (Rehabilitation Project Force) in Australia. She now lives with her husband and three kids - Declan, eight, Evan, six, Rhys, in Brisbane           An email conversation between Valeska and her father Jean-Francois Paris, shows how leaving that church has forbidden her from speaking to her own dad  The negative publicity rocked the church and Miscavige.\u0027I would hear him scream at the top of his lungs while I was working in the kitchen next to the execs room, I would be shaking, it was so scary. \u0027When Lisa McPherson happened, he changed. All of the execs he was friends with, that all disappeared. His circle went even smaller,\u0027 she alleges.Shelly\u0027s usually strong relationship with her husband began to falter - he dismissed the whole of his board of executives in favor of younger, more eager to please, dedicated Sea Org members, such as Lou Stuckenbrock, for whom he created the position \u0027COB Communicator\u0027.\u0027Shelly became more and more stressed out. COB would be in the dining room with his Communicator Lou and she would eat afterwards,\u0027 Valeska claims.\u0027In her letters she would never say anything, but she was writing less and less, I got the sense she was more stressed. She wasn\u0027t perfect, but she stood by COB for years, and I never saw them argue, but I always saw that he was very close with Lou.\u0027In 2005, he said in a meeting that Shelly had been taken off his lines, but he wasn\u0027t going to orce her, he was way too qualified to ever marry any other Sea Org member. She was extremely dedicated to him. His words were: She messed up his communication lines.\u0027 Shelly has since retreated from public life once a prominent member of the church, she was even absent at Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes\u0027s wedding in 2006.In 2013, Hollywood actress and famous Church defector Leah Remini filed a missing person report with the Los Angeles Police Department for Shelly. Police eventually said that they had interviewed Shelly and confirmed she wasn\u0027t being held against her will and didn\u0027t want to make any public statement.  Valeska\u0027s correspondence with Shelly came to a stop after she left. She says her time at the church worsened in 2007, after she was sent to England \u0027on a mission\u0027 during Maiden Voyage.Only days into it, Valeska got into hot water for daring to speak to a married man and she was ordered back to the Freewinds and sent to the engine room. After all this treatment, Valeska was suicidal and desperate to get out.\u0027In my mind, I was either going to end it or get off that ship,\u0027 she adds. But Valeska also had no skills for the real world, her brother Raphael, 36, and father Jean, 66, were and still are in the church today, she\u0027d never be allowed to see them again if she absconded.She\u0027d also \u0027disconnected\u0027 from her mother Ariane and younger sister Melissa, 38, 14 years ago when they left the Church.\u0027They wouldn\u0027t let me off this ship. I had served COB and knew their dirty little secrets. It was still hard to leave, I\u0027d been in the Sea Org since 14, I had no education, no money, never had a bank account, I had no idea how to live in the real world.  \u0027I\u0027d lose my brother and father instantly, I didn\u0027t know if my mom or sister would reconnect or where they lived. I\u0027d been indoctrinated that Scientology is life,\u0027 she says.Valeska was sent to the RPF in Australia, in the hope that it would \u0027rehabilitate\u0027 her. During this time, she met Chris Guider, a former rugby league legend in Australia who gave it all up in the 80s for Scientology.\u0027After graduating the RPF, they started making my life hell again. They were threatening to send me back to the ship, but I\u0027d already decided I would never, ever go back to that place again,\u0027 she says.\u0027When we finally got free, we had no one to judge us, I could watch TV when I wanted to, I had a normal room that wasn\u0027t a dormitory, I felt so much freedom. That\u0027s when I realized that Scientology was, in a nutshell, s**t.\u0027I hadn\u0027t seen my mom and sister for ages. I hadn\u0027t seen my mom for so long that when I first saw her, I went up to the wrong person. We didn\u0027t recognize each other. \u0027My dad sent me a text saying he was going to disconnect from me for talking to my mom and sister, this was at the same time as I was eight months pregnant with my first child.\u0027Today, Chris and Valeska now live happily in Brisbane and have three children - Declan, eight, Evan, six, Rhys, three - but still live under the shadow of Scientology\u0027s disconnection policy.Valeska said: \u0027I have three children who\u0027ve never met their grandfather. I haven\u0027t spoken to my brother since 2010. My family is destroyed. But we got out and we\u0027re having a good life. Hopefully my dad and brother will wake up one day, and my door will always be open for them.\u0027In a statement to DailyMail.com the church said: \u0027What has been said about us all too often—as is the case here—is pure propaganda. It is inaccurate and intentionally avoids showing who Scientologists really are and what we do. \u0027Propagandists look to capitalize on the growing curiosity about Scientology. They have manufactured controversies where there are none while refusing to show the Church, its organizations, its humanitarian programs as well as its unprecedented growth in Churches worldwide.

Now that it has been proven that items are often not cheaper over the weekend, it is no surprise that stores are choosing to map their own route and stick to low costs all year round. Richard Hyman, a veteran retail adviser, said: \u0027Black Friday has probably been the most stupid retail import from the USA this country has ever seen.\u0027Nine out of 10 Black Friday items cheaper at other times of the year Further research from Idealo found that nearly all items could be found cheaper at different points around the year.They compared prices of over 20,000 products over a 12 month period and discovered that some of the best selling products on Black Friday were substantially less expensive on different dates.Below are the top 10 product categories and how much shoppers can save by buying the items at alternative times of the year. It suggests, for example, that the best day to buy a DSLR camera is 5 September, according to its historic data The only item that was cheaper on Black Friday was laptops:   1.

Lidl then tweeted a tongue-in-cheek advert for an £89 Yamaha keyboardThe German supermarket tweeted: \u0027Just because you don\u0027t have £872 to spend on a piano, doesn\u0027t mean you can\u0027t be the next Elton\u0027, alongside a picture of an £89.99 Yamaha keyboard.The picture is also captioned \u0027It\u0027s a Lidl bit funny...\u0027 Twitter users were quick to praise the witty response, calling it a \u0027masterstroke\u0027 while one user said \u0027give your marketing manager a rise\u0027.The official John Lewis account then tweeted Lidl a link to its £15 children\u0027s piano with the message: \u0027It\u0027s a Lidl bit cheaper\u0027.One wag replied to both saying: \u0027Do you pair want to leave this argument till the weekend. I’ve heard Saturday nights all right for fighting\u0027 - a joke linked to another of Sir Elton\u0027s big hits.                        Five actors aged between four and 50 were used to play Sir Elton, using prosthetics, CGI and help from the star and his husband David Furnish to ensure they had the same mannerisms and piano playing style.Viewers are taken back through key moments in his life with scenes of the star on stadium tours, travelling on a private jet, recording Your Song, playing the piano in a local pub and performing in a school recital. It ends with Sir Elton - then little Reg Dwight - running down the stairs on Christmas morning to see his grandmother Ivy and his mother, who brought him up together because his father, Stanley, was largely absent.John Lewis has said the advert is \u0027inspired by real events\u0027 but admits the finale involves \u0027some creativity\u0027 because the singer was never gifted a piano at Christmas, but he had learned to play at his grandmother\u0027s house - and denied claims they paid him £5million to take part. It is also the second of the retailer\u0027s Christmas ads to feature Your Song after singer Ellie Goulding recorded a cover for the 2010 campaign. The  nod to Elton\u0027s mother and the influence on his career comes almost a year after her death last December.Two years before she passed away the star found the courage to apologise to her after a nearly nine-year feud that culminated in her inviting an Elton John impersonator to perform at her 90th birthday party because she missed him so much.Elton severed all contact with her after a catastrophic argument where she blamed Elton\u0027s husband, David Furnish, for turning him against her.She was also upset the Candle In The Wind singer demanded she cut all ties with her longtime friends Bob Halley and John Reid, who  worked for him for decades.But he later sent Sheila a large bouquet of white orchids for her milestone birthday and also shelled out £30,000 for Sheila to undergo a double hip replacement.When she died last year Elton spoke of his grief - but happiness that they had become close again.In September this year rumours emerged that Sir Elton had agreed to take part - but John Lewis has denied he was paid the £5million fee being mooted. They also said some of his fee was donated to charity.The musician said today: \u0027The John Lewis Christmas campaign has so many warm memories for me and my family.\u0027It\u0027s been a lovely opportunity for me to reflect on my life in music and the incredible journey I have been on, and how first playing my grandmother\u0027s piano marks the moment when music came into my life.\u0027The ad is absolutely fantastic and I\u0027ve truly loved every minute of being a part of it.\u0027His husband David Furnish, who was involved in producing the advert, said:  \u0027I think Elton has enjoyed the process of making this tremendously. \u0027I think, you know, emotionally he is thinking about the journey he’s been on as an artist, and that moment, you know, when music came into his life at a very young age when he was encouraged by his mother and his grandmother with his piano\u0027. The Boy \u0026amp The Piano was released online at 8am this morning before being shown on ITV at 9.15pm tonight.Actor Simon Burbage plays Elton in the 1980s and 1990, while the lookalike used to recreate the scenes from the 1970s is Oliver Marshall. The singer as a teenager is played by Brandon Stein, while Hudson Trindall is performing at a piano recital and the young boy on Christmas morning is Freddie Henderson.           Sir Elton sings his first big hit Your Song in a present day gig but the advert goes all the way back to his 1950s childhood          Actor Oliver Marshall wearing prosthetics and original clothes is shown performing on his stadium tour on the West Coast with the crowds recreated using CGI          Viewers are also transported into his tour plane in the 1970s when he became a global superstar and multi-millionaire      Sir Elton, again using an actor, is shown performing Your Song on TV and then recording it for an album in 1970  In the 1960s the star first started performing in the Northwood Hills pub in Pinner, around the corner from where he grew up  Elton, played by Hudson Trindall, is shown performing in a school recital watched by his family in an advert inspired by events in his life (pictured, right, Elton as a child)           The heart of the advert is revealed at the end as Elton as a young boy tears the paper from the piano in front of his grandmother and mother, played by Deborah Baxter and Katie Bonna (left to right)          The child actor looks in wonder at the musical instrument with the message that gifts can inspire and change lives          The final scene shows Elton playing the same piano himself, although John Lewis admit while he learned to play with his grandmother he never received one as a Christmas giftJohn Lewis addressed speculation about the cost of this year\u0027s ad, describing reports that it had paid Sir Elton £5million as \u0027wildly inaccurate\u0027 and said the ad cost £7million with most of the money going on advertising spending.          Sir Elton said his mother Sheila (pictured together at his 50th birthday party in 1997) was an inspiration to him - but they had an eight-year feud before having a reconciliation two years before she died last DecemberIt added that Sir Elton had requested that a portion of his fee be donated to the Elton John Charitable Trust when he was first approached to be involved.  John Lewis customer director Craig Inglis said: \u0027The ad tells the story of why Elton\u0027s piano was more than just a gift and we hope to remind customers of that special moment when they\u0027ve given a gift at Christmas time that they know will be treasured forever.\u0027The retailer, which reported a 98.8 per cent profits crash for the first half of the year in September, said the ad was a \u0027crucial part\u0027 of its overall marketing campaign and \u0027one of the most effective marketing campaigns in the industry, delivering an excellent return on investment\u0027.John Lewis and Waitrose employees have been given the first opportunity to share the two minute and 20 second ad at 6am on Thursday before its launch on the store\u0027s social media channels, its website and in shops at 8am.The ad first airs on television on Thursday at 9.15pm during ITV\u0027s Dark Heart, although ITV viewers may have noticed that the theme tunes to some of the channel\u0027s shows including Coronation Street and This Morning were played solely in piano notes on Wednesday to tease the advert\u0027s premiere.Customers at the retailer\u0027s flagship Oxford Street branch can also step into a 2,000 square foot recreation of the ad production set to try on some of the costumes, listen to recordings from Elton John\u0027s 17-11-70 album and have photos taken at the piano.

Elton John. Didn’t he refuse to speak to his mother for years? Nice that he appreciated her eventually\u0027, while one critic tweeted: \u0027Remember the time that Elton John’s mum hired an Elton John lookalike to play at her party? That didn’t make the cut into that ad\u0027.But others saw the other side and said: \u0027Such an emotional journey, so gripping, so true to life for so many people and heartfelt especially after @eltonofficial losing his Mother. Well done John Lewis this year!\u0027.Another added: \u0027I was quite moved by #JohnLewisChristmasAd. The power of music and a mother\u0027s love combined. Lovely\u0027.Mother and son\u0027s relationship appeared hit rock bottom in 2016, two years after he married Mr Furnish. Sheila had been a witness at their civil partnership in 2005.Sir Elton said: \u0027I don’t miss her. When she says things in the press, like, “I haven’t spoken to Elton since he married that f****** a****** David Furnish”. That was pretty hard to take\u0027.He added: \u0027I don’t hate my mother. I look after her but I don’t want her in my life.’But they made up fully around six months before she died last year, shortly after he was hospitalised for 12 days, including two nights in intensive care, after picking up a serious infection while touring South America.In May 2017 he confirmed they were close again after he shared a throwback picture on Twitter to celebrate reconnecting with Mrs Farebrother on America\u0027s Mother\u0027s Day with the message: \u0027So happy we are back in touch. Love, Elton.\u0027Mother and son fell out in 2008 after she allegedly refused his request not to talk to two of their oldest friends.          Sheila and Elton at the height of his fame in 1976 - she has been credited for being a driving force behind his career          1947: Elton John is born Reginald Dwight on March 25 to father Stanley and mother Sheila. As he grew up his father was largely absent and his mum encouraged him to play the piano from the age of three.His parents orce and Sheila remarries his stepfather John, and the couple encourage him to write songs and get him a job as a pub pianist age 15. She remained a strong and constant support during his long career. 2008: Mother and son fall out after a row over mutual friends and his husband David Furnish\u0027s influence on his career2015: Mrs Farebrother said that her son \u0027hated\u0027 her and gets an an Elton John impersonator at her 90th birthday party. He then sends a bunch of white orchids - his first contact for seven years. May 2017: He posts a US mother\u0027s day message saying he is \u0027happy they\u0027re in touch\u0027 - confirming they had reconciled their differences.December 4, 2017: Sheila Farebrother dies aged 92.                                                    This was further inflamed when she claimed that Elton never told her she had become a grandmother when boys Elijah and Zachary were born.In 2015 she told the Daily Mail that her son had called out of the blue and ordered her to cut off all contact with Bob Halley - Sir Elton\u0027s driver turned personal assistant - and John Reid, with whom he had fallen out.Mrs Farebrother, who lived in a bungalow on the South Coast, said: \u0027I told him: \u0027I\u0027m not about to do that and drop them. Bob is like a son to me. He has always been marvellous to me and he lives nearby and keeps an eye on me\u0027.\u0027She said Sir Elton flew into an expletive-filled rage, adding: \u0027To my utter amazement, he told me he hated me.\u0027And he banged the phone down. Imagine! To me, his mother!\u0027She is said to have told him during the row: \u0027I said to him, And you think more of that f***ing thing you married than your own mother.\u0027During that period, however, it is understood Sir Elton continued to support Sheila financially and to provide a roof over her head, despite all that has passed between them.He is also said to have paid £30,00 for her double hip replacement.At one point she filled the void left by her son with a tribute act to the pop star.Sheila Farebrother hired him to provide the entertainment at her 90th birthday in March 2015 and would send emails to Mr Bacon, who himself described their link as \u0027quite surreal\u0027.Prompted by the milestone birthday, Sir Elton got in touch with his mother for the first time in seven years, sending her white orchids.They then continued to work on their relationship until their reconciliation was properly confirmed by Sir Elton in May 2017.The star last saw her a week before she died.When it was announced on December 4 last year he said he was in \u0027complete shock\u0027.He also posted a photograph of them together in happier times and wrote on Instagram: \u0027So sad to say that my mother passed away this morning. I only saw her last Monday and I am in shock. Travel safe Mum. Thank-you for everything. I will miss you so much. Love, Elton\u0027.The singer says he has been spurred on to shower his sons with affection because he received none from his own father.Elton took a swipe at his late father Stanley Dwight while giving a speech in which he said a lack of love had led him to drink and drugs.He said recently: \u0027I never stop telling them I love them, and they never stop telling me they love me\u0027.          Elton John, then 24, at home with his mother Theresa and stepfather Fred in 1971, and the couple were his rock for many years but his own father Stanley was largely absent      John Lewis\u0027 2017 Christmas advert has left viewers in tears over a mischievous and flatulent monster called Moz and  his relationship with a seven-year-old soulmate - with fans comparing it to Disney\u0027s much-loved Monsters Inc.The giant furry monster with a bulbous nose, wonky teeth and a love of snoring, jumps out from under the bed every night to play with companion Joe in a festive tale making many  laugh and cry.The little boy, aged 7, who is played by young twin brothers from London named Ethan and Tobias, is initially frightened after seeing a pair of enormous eyes peering from the dark under his bed.But the two unlikely friends are shown sharing games, playing piggyback and Scalextric in his bedroom – all without mum, dad, or older sister finding out.Moz then leaves his friend as he realises the little boy needs to grow up without him and wraps a farewell gift for him under the Christmas tree - a nightlight to help him sleep.Elbow performed The Beatles\u0027 Abbey Road masterpiece Golden Slumbers as the soundtrack.2016 Last year\u0027s star was Buster the Boxer and his trampoline antics.John Lewis said the advert where the dog, played by five-year-old Biff, beats a young girl to her new toy is their attempt to cheer up Britain after a \u0027tough year\u0027.The advert told the story of a little girl called Bridget who loves to jump.Set to a cover version of \u0027One Day I\u0027ll Fly Away\u0027, her mother and father buy her a trampoline, toiling while she sleeps to build it before hiding it in the garden to surprise her with on Christmas Day. As the snow falls an array of animals start using it as the Boxer watches forlornly through the window.The next morning Bridget sprints out to use it for the first time but her joy turns to shock as cheeky Buster has the last laugh and uses her new toy  before her.2015A lonely Man on the Moon is shown to viewers sitting by himself on a bench, completely unaware that he is being observed by the youngster back down on EarthThe elderly man, played by a 77-year-old French actor called Jean, gazes up wistfully towards the Earth, as the Oasis song Half The World Away, performed by 19-year-old Norwegian singer Aurora plays mournfully in the background.She tries desperately to send him a message but all her efforts fail, while he remains unaware that anyone cares about him and sits alone on a bench, wistfully staring up at the Earth.Eventually, on Christmas morning, a present arrives from the sky, carried by party balloons, and the old man unwraps it to reveal a vintage telescope.He uses it to spot Lily and, realising that someone cares about him, his eyes fill with tears.2014John Lewis hoped the bond between a boy and a penguin would capture the public\u0027s imagination.The two-minute festive commercial told the story of seven-year-old Sam, played by actor Rhys Edwards from Hertfordshire, and his friend Monty.The boy gradually realises Monty is longing for a penguin companion. And so on Christmas morning Sam surprises Monty with the gift of a new penguin friend named Mabel.The soundtrack was John Lennon\u0027s song Real Love, performed by Tom Odell.2013The £7million Disney-inspired advert told the story of a selfless hare who is determined to make sure his best friend, a bear, doesn\u0027t miss Christmas for once.The commercial features the tale of two good friends, a bear and a hare, who are sad at the thought of being separated for Christmas.The tale opens as winter is starting to draw in and the fun and excitement of preparing for Christmas begins.As the first snowflake falls and lands on the bear\u0027s nose, the hare starts to feel sad because he realises his friend will soon go off to hibernate, so – as usual - missing Christmas.While the bear is keen to join in, eventually he finds he cannot hold off his winter sleep any longer and disappears into his cave.Viewers see the bear fast asleep while all the other woodland creatures become excited about the big day to come.However, the hare is missing his friend and finds it increasingly difficult to join in the preparations until the moment he has a great idea for a very special present.He disappears off in to the wilderness to return with the gift – an alarm clock – which wakes the bear just in time to gather around a beautifully decorated tree to celebrate with all his friends.2012The Christmas ad, called The Journey, shows the extraordinary lengths to which some will go in their search for a gift for someone they love.The 90-second commercial opens in a family\u0027s snow-covered garden, with children happily making a snowman and snowwoman.When the snowman mysteriously disappears the next morning, the viewer is transported to a magical world, following him on an epic journey across river, mountain, road and city.The motive for the snowman\u0027s secret journey isn\u0027t revealed until the last scene, when he returns on Christmas morning with gifts for his wife.Newcomer Gabrielle Aplin sings The Power Of Love, the 1984 hit from Frankie Goes To Hollywood, as the soundtrack. 2011In 2011, the John Lewis advert showed a young boy so desperately excited about Christmas that he couldn\u0027t wait to give presents to his parents.It was accompanied by a cover of The Smiths\u0027 Please Please Let Me Get What I Want\u0027.2010And the 2010 offering saw iniduals choosing and wrapping their presents in the lead up to the big day, as Ellie Goulding sings a cover of Elton John\u0027s Your Song.Various people furtively hide the presents they\u0027ve carefully chosen: parents sneak a rocking horse upstairs while their children\u0027s backs are turned a mechanic struggles to wrap a spotted teapot and a small boy braves the snow in his dressing gown to hang a stocking outside his dog\u0027s kennel.2009This was the first of the store\u0027s Christmas campaigns created by advertising agency Adam \u0026amp Eve, now adam\u0026ampeveDDB, and the first to feature a musical cover by a current artist, on this occasion a Taken By Trees version of Sweet Child O\u0027 Mine by Guns N\u0027 Roses.The ad shows children opening gifts for adults including a laptop, coffee machine and handbag, followed by the tagline: \u0027Remember how Christmas used to feel? Give someone that feeling.\u00272008Culminating in the tagline: \u0027If you know the person, you\u0027ll find the present,\u0027 it shows a succession of characters followed by a matching gift.The soundtrack is a cover of The Beatles\u0027 From Me To You recorded for the campaign, with vocals by Matt Spinner, a member of the John Lewis IT department and its music society.2007The ad shows a group of people stacking a pile of potential gifts including a desktop lamp, a computer and a leather satchel in an empty room. The finished product ends up creating a shadow that looks like a woman walking her dog through the snow, accompanied by the tagline: \u0027Whoever you\u0027re looking for this Christmas.\u0027  "},{"url":null,"title":"Bug eyed puss called Wilfred internet star","story":"    Michael Rapaport at the \u0027White Famous\u0027 TV show premiere in LA, his cat video went viralThe strange looking feline sits completely still staring at the comedian who starred in Prison Break and Friends.The unflinching and lack of blinking seems to spook the actor who calls for his mother in his thick Manhattan accent. He says: \u0027Ma!

An emotional Sir Elton John is the star of the 2018 John Lewis Christmas advert, which tells the uplifting and poignant story of his rise to superstardom sparked with the gift of music          Elton, then Reg Dwight from Pinner, tears the paper away to reveal a beautiful piano that would inspire him to play  In the 1960s the star first started performing in the Northwood Hills pub in Pinner, around the corner from where he grew up          Actor Oliver Marshall wearing prosthetics and original clothes is shown performing on his stadium tour on the West Coast with the crowds recreated using CGI          Viewers are also transported into his tour plane in the 1970s when he became a global superstar and multi-millionaire          The finale shows Sir Elton playing the same piano and ends with the message: \u0027Some gifts are more than just a gift\u0027But on her 90th birthday he sent Sheila a large bouquet of white orchids for her milestone birthday and also shelled out £30,000 for Sheila to undergo a double hip replacement.When she died two years later he spoke of his grief - but happiness that they had become close again.In September rumours emerged that Sir Elton had agreed to take part - but John Lewis has denied he was paid the £5million fee being mooted. They also said some of his fee was donated to charity.The musician said today: \u0027The John Lewis Christmas campaign has so many warm memories for me and my family.\u0027It\u0027s been a lovely opportunity for me to reflect on my life in music and the incredible journey I have been on, and how first playing my grandmother\u0027s piano marks the moment when music came into my life.\u0027The ad is absolutely fantastic and I\u0027ve truly loved every minute of being a part of it.\u0027His husband David Furnish, who was involved in producing the advert, said: \u0027I think Elton has enjoyed the process of making this tremendously. I think, you know, emotionally he is thinking about the journey he’s been on as an artist, and that moment, you know, when music came into his life at a very young age when he was encouraged by his mother and his grandmother with his piano\u0027.The Boy \u0026amp The Piano was released online at 8am this morning before being shown on ITV at 9.15pm tonight.The advert coincides with the start of ticket sales Sir Elton worldwide farewell tour and next year Taron Egerton will play him in Rocketman, the biopic film being made about the star, with his blessing, due for release next year.John Lewis says the movie and tour is unrelated to their choice of star and advert, which was filmed over the summer."},{"url":null,"title":"Pregnant womans relaxing bath brought abrupt end pooch dives in","story":"The cute dog peeked his head over the top of the bath tub (left) before jumping in with his owner Connie (right)Puppy love!

She added: ‘Customers feel their loyalty has been taken for granted.’ Closures hit rural communities especially hard, with those on low incomes and the elderly most likely to suffer.Tory MP Simon Clarke, a member of the Treasury committee, which is investigating the diminishing accessibility of financial services, said: ‘Banks are depriving people of essential services.‘With no bank manager on hand vulnerable people are left without any guidance on financial matters.’Parliamentary records show there were 20,583 branches in 1988, but the consumer group’s analysis shows that there are just 7,586 today.Sparsely-populated parts of Scotland account for the top 70 communities farthest from a bank.Areas where recent closures have led to towns or villages without a single branch include Lymm in Cheshire, Broseley in Shropshire, Fishguard in Pembrokeshire and Sturminster Newton in Dorset.While banks argue that one of the country’s 11,500 Post Office branches can plug the gap, there are many crucial banking services they do not offer.These include opening or closing accounts, transferring money between accounts, making a complaint about the bank and requesting a replacement debit card.Banks also require customers to call into a branch for matters such as anti-fraud checks or to discuss legal documents such as lasting power of attorney.Almost half of those surveyed by Which? said they were unlikely to use a Post Office for banking services, questioning the level of staff expertise in financial services and complaining about long queues.Martin Kearsley, banking services director at the Post Office, said: ‘We are uniquely placed to bring vital services to local communities right across the country.

As the air is warmed up by people and equipment inside the building, it will get warmer and then rise through the building to vent out at the top floor above the ground, creating a natural air circulation.On the other hand, some of the rock face is exposed in the interior of the building, providing an ideal thermal mass to help regulate the building\u0027s temperature. On the official booking app of InterContinental Hotels Group, rooms can be booked from December 1 and onwards at a starting nightly price of 3,325 yuan (£371).

However John Lewis also sold other size Monty toys which were priced at £12 and £35.As well as this they had created a plush toy for Monty\u0027s love interest Mabel, along with tote bags, socks, onesies, pyjamas, scarfs, tops and even cufflinks.

Some said that the plush toy which was available for the character was more in reach than a £872 piano.John Lewis, like with the Monty the Penguin range had created a whole Moz the Monster collection including soft toys, slippers and bedding.           Sophie Holden said she wasn\u0027t impressed with the John Lewis advert and its qualityThe store even transformed part of its children\u0027s department at its Oxford Street branch into the house that Moz had lived in and had created a life size cuddly toy of the creature that children could cuddle and pose with.Following the release of the Christmas ad, other brands poked fun at the advert and put their own spin on the production which was said to have cost up to £7 million to create.Lidl posted a tweet with a picture of a £89.99 keyboard on a Christmas backdrop which read: \u0027It\u0027s a Lidl bit funny\u0027.

That\u0027s because the sculptor Gutzon Borglum, who also designed Mount Rushmore, \u0027put all the holes in it with amber glass\u0027 during a 1916 redesign, park Superintendent John Piltzecker said. \u0027It led to the flame\u0027s deterioration.\u0027The torch was further weakened in July of that year by the Black Tom explosion, an act of German sabotage at a munitions plant nearby in Jersey City.The 1980s gilt flame that the statue is holding now restores sculptor Frederic Auguste Bartholdi\u0027s original design, officials said.The old torch, meanwhile, made another fundraising trip at the end of 1984, traveling to Pasadena, where it starred in the Rose Parade.A trench was dug under the statue so that the 16-foot original torch could be moved into the pedestal when it returned to New York.It couldn\u0027t depart the pedestal that way Thursday, Piltzecker said. \u0027It had to come out in two pieces.\u0027Joining the torch\u0027s two pieces was a full-scale copper replica of the statue\u0027s face. The torch and the face will be highlights of the new $100 million museum, which is scheduled to open in May 2019."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/11/16/12/043CD8F1000003E8-6397393-image-a-24_1542370820446.jpg","title":"BBC sitcom Allo Allos famous topless portrait goes sale 5 000","story":"    East Bristol Auctions (pictured is Andrew Stowe from the auctioneer) will be selling the painting, which has given it a guide price of £5,000 to £10,000.

She arrived alone. She pulled up her car in front of our house. I greeted her at the door.\u0027           Festus Onasanya also used a similar ‘method’ involving fake driver details, when he was caught speeding on June 17 and August 23 last yearDr DeFeo said Onasanya, his wife and himself spent no less than two hours discussing the \u0027nitty gritty\u0027 of a charity lease in his living room.They were there together throughout apart from the occasional \u0027loo breaks\u0027 and his wife going into the kitchen to prepare a \u0027hot lemon squash\u0027. The Peterborough MP allegedly conspired with her brother Festus to offload the blame when her Nissan Micra was caught speeding in July last year.Jurors were told that Mr Onasanya, 33, a singer from Chesterton, Cambridge, used a similar \u0027method\u0027 involving fake driver details, when he was caught speeding on June 17 and August 23 last year.He has already pleaded guilty at the Old Bailey  to perverting the course of justice in relation to the incidents, as well as to the charge incident involving his sister.Miss Onasanya, a former solicitor who is now a Labour whip responsible for party discipline, deliberately gave police false details so they could not trace the real driver, jurors at the Old Bailey were told.The investigation was triggered when the MP\u0027s Nissan Micra was detected driving at 41mph in a 30mph zone at 10.03pm on July 24 last year in Thorney, Cambridgeshire.The MP, who had risen for Parliament\u0027s summer recess several days earlier, replied to a notice of intended prosecution (NIP) naming Mr Antipow as the driver.Officers became suspicious when they unsuccessfully tried to contact Mr Antipow, and found that the address and phone number on the document were false.The court heard how analysis of records for Miss Onasanya\u0027s two mobile phones placed her in the area where the speeding offence took place.Prosecutor David Jeremy said: \u0027Mr Antipow does exist, but he was not driving Ms Onasanya\u0027s car.\u0027 Miss Onasanya became \u0027trapped in a number of lies\u0027 when she decided to \u0027adopt her brother\u0027s method of evading prosecution\u0027, jurors were told.Mr Jeremy said: \u0027This case did start as an offence of speeding. It has become, as a result of the choices made by Miss Onasanya, a case about lying.\u0027Lying persistently and deliberately, lying all the way to this court and, it may be, even lying in this court. Lying in a way that has had to be coordinated with lies told by her brother.\u0027Mr Antipow was connected to the siblings due to living in a property that they rented in Chesterton for several months in 2016.Investigators found that Mr Onasanya had previously lived at the false address for Mr Antipow that was provided on the prosecution notice, while its occupants are said to be linked to him.A phone number supposedly belonging to the Russian was traced back to a company called IT Fleet Automotive, where Mr Onasanya worked as a self-employed delivery driver, it was claimed.When the original prosecution letter to Mr Antipow was returned to police due to the incorrect address, officers wrote to the MP in September asking her to clarify the details.When another NIP letter was sent to Mr Antipow and again received no response, investigators repeatedly failed in their attempts to get hold of Miss Onasanya.She told investigators in November that Mr Antipow had filled in his own details on the returned speeding form.When the MP eventually agreed to attend a voluntary interview at Bedford police headquarters on January 2 this year, she refused to answer questions.Mr Jeremy said: \u0027What a shame she did not tell the truth from the beginning\u0027.\u0027By this time Miss Onasanya would have known that she and her brother had a problem - that the speeding allegations had not gone away and been fobbed off using Festus\u0027s method.\u0027Miss Onasanya denies one count of perverting the course of justice.

I’m also reading In the Flow by Boris Groys, a fascinating book of essays about contemporary art.The book that changed my life Franz Kafka’s The Metamorphosis. I read it when I was 15 and it made me realise that you could do anything you wanted in literature – that there were absolutely no rules. It made writing seem like a true place of freedom. Not a wastrel freedom, but a meaningful freedom.The book I wish I’d writtenAny of the books of the New Testament, because I would like to have seen the miracles.The book that had the greatest influence on me A book of plays by Harold Pinter made a strong impression on me when I was 17 or 18: the heightened tension between the characters, the formality and humour of the sentences, how absurd, simple and mysterious the story was. For a long time, I couldn’t get his voice out of my head and it was impossible to find my own voice.The book I think is most underratedOf the books I’ve read recently, A House in Norway by Vigdis Hjorth seems to be seriously underrated – in English, at least. Unfortunately, I liked it so much that I didn’t share it with anyone else. I wanted to feel like it was mine. It’s about an artist’s attempt to make her art serve as politics, and her failure. It’s also about a woman alone. I love anything – books, movies, stories – about a woman alone.The last book that made me cryWhen my father was 12 he wrote an autobiography for school. He died this autumn, and a cousin pulled out a bound, photocopied version of it at dinner recently. I opened it and his love of life – his optimism and sweetness and innocence and joy – were all there in the first sentence I read, and I began to cry at the table.The last book that made me laughI think of laughter as social communication, and I’m usually alone when I’m reading. When people laugh while reading it’s often just showing off, a way of boasting about what a good time they’re having without you. Plus, even when a book is funny, like Linday Wong’s dark and fascinating memoir, The Woo-Woo, the humour tends to be so mixed up with other things that my reaction wouldn’t be laughter.The book that changed my mindThe Philosophy of Andy Warhol (From A to B and Back Again) made me see how the depressing ugliness and pettiness of one’s own time can be beautiful and grand, if looked at in the right way. His paintings have that effect, too. I felt very distant from today’s culture before I read this book in 2006, and it brought me much closer to it. More recently, Malcolm Harris’s excellent non-fiction work Kids These Days made me understand – and pity – millennials. I hadn’t thought about their social media obsession as a form of labour.The book I couldn’t finishI tend not to finish books. I often read to get closer to an author, to know them, and once I feel like I do know them, I tend to stop. I’m trying to correct this bad habit, because though you can love an author without finishing the book, you can’t love the book. The last books I loved that I stopped reading for no good reason were Louis-Ferdinand Celine’s Death on the Installment Plan, Frederick Douglass’s Autobiographies, and Allan Bloom’s The Closing of the American Mind.The book I’m most ashamed not to have readI don’t feel ashamed about not having read books, mostly because I think I will eventually read them. Moby-Dick, Invisible Man: it’s not only my fault! Books choose you. It has to be mutual. I sometimes open and begin them, but they seem to say “not now”, so I return them to my shelves, where they seem happy. I don’t believe in forcing it.My earliest reading memoryI remember reading Madeleine L’Engle’s A Wrinkle in Time on a plane, and feeling completely dizzy to be reading a book while high up in the clouds. It was the mixed pleasure of being far from home and the earth, and in a vivid new world in my imagination, and the magic of being surrounded by people –but still alone. I’ll never forget it.My reading guilty pleasureIn 1967, the great Hollywood costume designer Edith Head published a style manual for women called How to Dress for Success. Although this book is outdated in many ways, it’s still delightful, insightful, rigorous and brilliant, and I get a secret thrill when reading it.The book I give as a giftThe novel Two Serious Ladies by Jane Bowles. Her sentences are so surprising, the plot is like something from a dream, and her mind is deeply unfathomable, precise, funny, earnest and otherworldly. It feels like giving someone an exotic fruit.The book I’d most like to be remembered forProbably my first book, a collection of stories called The Middle Stories. I wrote it in my early 20s when writing was still a completely pure thing for me. I felt utterly and deeply alone with the book, in a way that has never been as possible since. The black hole-like aloneness in that book is valuable, I think, so I would like it to last through time.• Sheila Heti’s Motherhood (Harvill Secker) is shortlisted for the Scotiabank Giller prize.

The tribunal did not agree with Walker’s claim that her sacking was a result of discrimination.The former executive said it was time for the company to carry out an extensive pay audit to ensure no other female employees were being discriminated against. She had previously refused to settle the case as the company refused to do one.“The Co-op have been found wanting, and I want to see the organisation change as a result,” she told the . “Going through this process has also revealed to me that the law is fundamentally flawed and must change. But more fundamentally, we need societal change: people shouldn’t want to work for companies who treat their employees differently and are breaking the law.“This is a major victory for women, but my case proves that pay discrimination can happen to anyone.”Walker said she first raised questions about equal pay in 2015 after comparing her salary to other male executives who sat alongside her on the board. The tribunal heard that senior executives had also questioned Walker’s performance over the progress of a huge IT project called 1HR, but she argued she had brought in the “right people” to improve performance.Walker told the tribunal that the company went through a regrading exercise of all staff, and she told Richard Pennycook, then the chief executive, in 2016 that it was “not looking good” from an equal pay perspective. “I told him that I thought the Co-op had an equal pay problem, which not only exposed the business to legal claims but was inconsistent with the Co-op’s declared values,” she said.A spokesman for the Co-op said the tribunal had dismissed most of Walker’s claims and held that her dismissal was not discriminatory.“Whilst the tribunal upheld the unfair dismissal claim on procedural grounds, we are pleased it found the Co-op had substantial reasons for justifying the termination of Ms Walker’s employment.”The tribunal accepted that Walker was sacked as part of a proposed restructuring, but Walker said this never took place.The company said it was considering whether to appeal against the equal pay claim. “We maintain we did not pay Ms Walker unfairly and continue to believe we acted in the best interests of our Co-op and its members,” said the spokesman.Walker said that she had used her savings and remortgaged her house to fund her three-year legal battle, which she described as “a living hell”.“Everything about the system stops people claiming and protects companies and going through this is financially unrealistic for most people,” she said.Walker was supported by the Fawcett Society and the former BBC correspondent Carrie Gracie, who won her equal pay battle with the corporation and donated her pay settlement to the Equal Pay Advice Service to support other women looking to make claims.“I take my hat off to Sam Walker for having the courage to take on the Co-op, another supposedly values-led organisation, but it has been a savage ordeal that no woman should have to go through in 2018,” said Gracie. “Most of us live in a culture of pay secrecy, and there will be many more victims who have no idea they are being discriminated against.“I hope this sends a message to employers to do right by the women in their organisation and if problems do occur to put their hands up and apologise rather than fighting them until the last breath.”Sam Smethers, the chief executive of the Fawcett Society, said the high-profile case had played an important role in raising awareness about equal pay. “This case is hugely significant because it shows what is possible when women get the chance to challenge pay discrimination,” she said. “Very few women do most are completely shut out. Pay discrimination can happen anywhere and that’s why we have to support women on low incomes particularly.”Walker said she was now determined to help other women with equal pay disputes, and she will speak alongside Gracie at the Fawcett Society’s Know Our Worth conference on Saturday. “Anyone thinking about doing it, I will help them prepare before they even make their claim,” she said. “I think there is a massive and growing network of strong women who are demanding change – if you think you have a case, come on, bring it on.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0fdac8e7c1661c8a92802ca1b3cf4709a6c309e/0_50_5202_3121/master/5202.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a9d914c3b359a9a52e402eb86d344ce1","title":"man sues british airways ba for sitting him next to fat passenger","story":"Civil engineer says other BA passenger encroached on his space, causing back injuriesA holidaymaker who is suing British Airways for £10,000 has told a court he was injured after being forced to squeeze into a seat next to an obese man who was “the size of Jonah Lomu”.Stephen Prosser, 51, claims he suffered personal injury and loss of earnings after being made to sit next to the large passenger during a 12-hour flight from Bangkok to Heathrow.On Friday, Pontypridd county court heard the self-employed civil engineer claim cabin crew ignored his complaints that he would be injured if forced to sit next to the “extremely large” passenger, who he described as being 6ft 4in (1.93 metres) and weighing approximately 22 stone (140kg).Prosser, who is 1.60 metres (5ft 3in), said: “He was that large that he had to force his buttocks between the arm rests of the seats.“I sat with his knees wedged against the seat in front and the rest of his body was overspilling into my seat by some inches.“I was immediately aware that this was going to be problematic for me and I could feel the weight of his pure bulk putting lateral pressure on my upper body. This forced me into a position of unnatural posture.“Due to the size of him when he placed his arm down at times it would rest on my armrest, and he would accidentally turn the volume of my audio up to an extremely loud volume each time.”He said he chose not to take issue with the passenger because he seemed “self-conscious”, but did complain to cabin crew, who allegedly told him there were no other seats available on the fully booked Boeing 777 and did not allow him to swap with someone else.Prosser, from Penygraig in Tonypandy, south Wales, said the incident in January 2016 left him with a continual back spasm and an injury causing his sacroiliac joint at the bottom of his spine to malfunction.He said being forced into an unnatural position during the long-haul flight also aggravated a 12-year-old spine injury caused by driving long distances for work.He said he had been unable to work overtime as a result of his back pain, and he was left lacking energy, which had affected his relationship with his partner and forced him to give up mountain biking.Jack Harding, representing British Airways, said Prosser was “exaggerating” by comparing the other passenger to the late New Zealand rugby legend Jonah Lomu, who was 1.93 metres tall and weighed 120kg.Harding said: “You say the man reminded you of the late rugby player Jonah Lomu. Would you say that’s a colourful explanation?

Those lenders have turned to the Post Office to offset closures, with postmasters across 11,547 sites offering basic transaction services in their stead.Post Office sites are also restricted in the services they can offer, with customers unable to open or close accounts, transfer money between accounts, request a debit card replacement or make a complaint about their bank.Stanaway said: “We want to see banks properly justifying the reasons for closure and taking into account their customers’ needs before shutting their doors – and their customers out.”The Post Office said in a statement that it took its responsibility “very seriously” and was “uniquely placed to bring vital services to local communities right across the country”.But Mike Cherry, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said the Post Office should be “doing more, to both improve its small business banking offer and make more firms aware of it”.He added that bank branches were still “vital” to small business owners in areas where internet services were still lagging, or whose customers preferred to pay cash.“Bank branch closures damage high street footfall, restrict cashflow in local economies and force business owners to waste time travelling to and from their next nearest branch, which could be miles away.“Yes, small business owners need to consider alternative ways to bank, but the sheer pace of branch closures is frightening. Firms need time to adjust.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29574a5fc4538544de79febe40a365392267baf5/0_83_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=150a07c11905bf8639094903df9f64fe","title":"i felt like i had seen the future capturing japan megacities tokyo shanghai","story":"Architectural photographer Cody Ellingham takes to the streets of Tokyo and Shanghai to reveal secrets old and newWith his moody night-time shots of urban environments, New Zealand-born photographer Cody Ellingham tries to tap into the current of a city, to travel forward into its future or retreat into the past.Ellingham, a creative based in Tokyo, came to photography while travelling through northern Japan shortly after it was devastated by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami.

Theresa May betrayed so little of her emotions as she emerged from Downing Street to unveil her Brexit deal on Wednesday night that with the sound off, you wouldn’t have known if she was resigning or declaring peace in our time.But perhaps she didn’t quite know herself. Only minutes earlier, her Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, had told the Conservative chief whip that he would be quitting, although his resignation was only formally accepted the next morning. She must have known this fragile truce couldn’t hold, that cabinet ministers who had lost the fight inside the room were now taking it outside. This was a prime minister with power slipping through her fingers.Yet even in what may be her last days in office, May still has her uniquely stultifying ability to drain a moment of its drama. Ministers sometimes complain that she chairs cabinet meetings, rather than leading them that her own views remain oddly opaque. There was a flavour of exactly that detachment when she came to parliament on Thursday morning. With ministers dropping like flies, she didn’t even try to pretend this was the deal anybody had wanted, although it does at least tick the boxes of ending freedom of movement and minimising economic disruption. Rather, she wanted the nation to know that she had done her best in trying circumstances, and if some felt it wasn’t good enough then that was regrettable but – well, there it was. The overall air was of a postwoman plodding through a blizzard, just trying to deliver what the people had ordered, as if her own feelings barely mattered. And perhaps, in a way, they don’t.Years ago, when May first started being seriously discussed as a future leader, Europe was the one issue on which even her closest political allies couldn’t be sure where she stood. The best they could offer was that she didn’t seem terribly interested. (There is a ring of truth to former aide Nick Timothy’s charge that deep down she never believed Brexit could work, although he is wrong to suggest that if only she had believed harder in fairies everything would have worked out if anything, she merely comes across as rather more in touch with reality than he was.)But whatever she feels deep down, it is not the May way to emote, any more than it is to inspire. She prevails by grinding people down, wearing them out, pointing out the lack of a better alternative it’s how she became leader in the first place, how she has survived despite her party’s misgivings, and evidently how she will now seek to stave off the attempted leadership challenge now under way. This time she could hardly get away with pretending that nothing had changed, but the message was that nothing will be changing the deal is the deal. Her best hope is to persuade her party that anything is better than the risk of accidentally installing Jacob Rees-Mogg in Downing Street, before somehow trying to sell her unloved deal to the nation on the grounds that at least this way everyone will know where they stand and Brexit will be over. The British people, she insisted at an almost unnaturally calm press conference, just want her to “get on with it”. Perhaps she is banking on what the academic Rob Ford calls “Brexhaustion”, or the fact that for every man or woman glued to every twist and turn there is probably one who barely cares now how this thing ends, just so long as it ends.Yet that end now looks a very long way off indeed. There is something almost wickedly disingenuous about continuing to pretend, at this moment of great national jeopardy, that with the right person in charge we could swiftly extract a deal offering exactly the same advantages as EU membership but with none of the tiresome obligations. It is no more credible that Jeremy Corbyn, a man who can barely get through a TV interview over Brexit without contradicting his own party’s policy, could pull this mythical sword from the stone than that Boris Johnson or Rees-Mogg could.If negotiations have truly reached a stalemate, then stopping the clock on article 50 and throwing the ball back to the people in a second referendum arguably seems the fairest way forward. Having never personally been convinced of the case for a people’s vote, nonetheless I’d bite your arm off for one if it’s a choice of that or crashing out without a deal, a scenario in which the health secretary apparently cannot guarantee that lives would not be lost. The more real the prospect of no deal becomes, the more pressing the case for seeking consent, no matter how resistant both May and Corbyn are to the idea.But let’s not pretend that the outcome of a second referendum would necessarily be any more welcome than the last one, that the losing side would be any more reconciled to defeat, or that we wouldn’t spend the next 10 years arguing about who lied and cheated. And before we get to any of that, the last act of the Tory psychodrama must first play itself out. May is not just running out of road on Brexit. Relations with the DUP, which won’t back her deal, have descended into the deep freeze amid mutterings of private promises betrayed. She surely can’t rely on their votes now to drive through whatever tattered fragments of her domestic policy are left.Desperation to keep the Brexit show on the road is now bending the rest of government out of shape, with rumours of policy and spending decisions being twisted to keep restless ministers on board. She could see off the Rees-Mogg charge but survive only as a puppet leader, her strings jerked by any Brexiter willing to stay in cabinet – a deal Michael Gove seems to have initially offered her. It seems unlikely that any domestic legacy of her own could be salvaged from such wreckage.But if her premiership has been sorely lacking in imagination at times, by taking the referendum result so literally she has at least provided a moment of dreadful clarity about the consequences. Tory Brexiters demanded the impossible. Well, now they have it a deal impossible to get through parliament, impossible to sell to leave voters so cynically led to expect something better. If nothing else, history will surely remember her more kindly than either the architects of leave or her predecessor, David Cameron, whose catastrophic error of judgment landed us in this mess. They broke it, but she owned it, which explains the odd note of pity that creeps in when her name crops up in conversations beyond Westminster. It may now be for someone else to glue the pieces back together."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af9893bb1d905cbb7a0f650d63116e29b55ae78e/0_362_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e526d96437c30f1d9e73471515d3f80","title":"facebook big company tech world truth","story":"The tech giant claimed to be bringing the world together for the benefit of humanity. The truth is far less palatableFacebook, like so many companies in Silicon Valley, has always told us it was a different kind of company. Not so much a business really, but a social utility. That it was linking the world for the benefit of democracy, friendship and human connection.It made grand statements about providing internet access to rural areas through special solar-powered planes. (The project was scrapped earlier this year.) It told the developing world it was giving them the internet for free via Free Basics. (Users in India rose up in protest once they realised they weren’t getting the internet but rather a walled garden of just Facebook and some partner sites.) It let anyone, anywhere, use its platform to target ads and news stories to people around the world. (We all know how that turned out, да?)At some point Facebook’s marketing team even released a video trying to convince us it was a comfortable chair that we could sit on. (I have no explanation for this. It made no sense.)But the events over the past year have made it abundantly clear that Facebook is no different from several other large corporations adept at feeding us one line while actually serving up something a bit less palatable.A New York Times investigation this week expanded on Facebook’s many missteps when faced with Russian manipulation of its platform, and exposed the company’s “dark arts” tactics to hurt their critics and competitors. It detailed the company’s work with Definers Public Affairs, a DC consultancy that planted articles across the web criticising Google and Apple, as well as critics such as George Soros, the billionaire philanthropist who has been vocal about Facebook and other tech companies.For all its innovation, Facebook did not invent cover-ups or smear campaigns. Documents from the 1980s show that Shell and Exxon were aware of and predicted the negative impact of their products on the environment. Dupont knew that one of the chemicals it used to make Teflon carried serious health risks – but withheld that information from the public for decades.Tobacco companies were found guilty in the US in 2006 of having deceived the public about the health impact of smoking. And politicians have long used “oppo research” to dig up dirt on their opponents that they can then release during election time to stir up public outrage.Facebook and its thousands of progressive employees would surely shudder to be included in the company of big oil, chemical manufacturers, tobacco companies and politicians. And yet, are they really so different?To be clear, Facebook is not all bad. It has helped us stay in touch with family and friends. It lets us share videos of cute panda bears while we kill time in the doctor’s office. And it lets us voice our pent-up rage at distant relatives whose political views are wildly different from our own.But doing one or a few good things doesn’t mean you are a good company or have good values. Because guess what? The large, shady corporations that many of us distrust also do plenty of things that greatly simplify our lives. Chemical companies produce plastics, which are ubiquitous thanks to their functional versatility and low cost. Oil gets many of our cars from one place to another.Along with the practical value of these products comes the marketing of the good of their parent companies. Remember the commercials from Chevron that showed us fluffy, healthy animals, completely untarred, accompanied by a calm voice telling us that the company cared deeply about the environment? In a similar vein, Philip Morris has a global initiative to eliminate smoking, and Dupont, the manufacturer that once leaked toxic chemicals from one of its plants, now has a philanthropic initiative that aims to “help feed the world”.There is, however, one thing all these companies have in common that Facebook does not. Tobacco, oil and chemical manufacturers have all faced a reckoning in which fines and regulation have worked to keep them on a straighter (if not straight) path.If it wants to avoid a similar fate, Facebook would do well to recognise what it is. It is not a social movement, not a tool for democracy, and certainly not a chair. It is a company, and like most companies, driven first and foremost by profit. The good companies are the ones who acknowledge this but are equally aware of their responsibility and their need to act ethically and with transparency. The bad companies are the ones who believe they are something else – who tell themselves and the world that they are one thing, when in fact they are something very different."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af60c041a00b4120dde08227f56b9c18a2c3f7fb/71_281_2045_1227/master/2045.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1066e42c09f89c7610429c04c02a96ea","title":"kweku adoboli deporting cruel city trader ghana","story":"Britain was the former City trader’s home from childhood – yet he has been sent ‘back’ to GhanaKweku Adoboli came to the UK at the age of 12, and has lived his life here for the past 26 years, attending school and university. Yet on Wednesday night he was deported to Ghana, a country he has not lived in since he was four, and to which he has no connection. How did this happen?Adoboli was jailed in 2012 for his part in losing billions for UBS, while working as a junior banker at the Swiss bank. Few iniduals ever go to jail as a result of bank losses – yet Adoboli was convicted on two counts of fraud and sentenced to seven years. He served half his sentence.In a recent interview he described his shock at what happened as he prepared to finish his sentence: “You don’t expect at any point for someone to say, ‘Well, actually, we are going to deport you.’ You feel British, you think British. There is no part of you that thinks you are going to get deported.”The immigration rules are now weighted heavily in favour of deporting a person after a criminal sentence. If you are sentenced to more than four years’ imprisonment, Home Office guidance says you will need to have “very compelling circumstances” for a deportation order not to be made. For Adoboli, spending the majority of his life in the UK was not deemed “compelling” enough.Adoboli’s situation has echoes elsewhere. The boxer Kelvin Bilal Fawaz, an amateur light middleweight champion of England, was detained and threatened with deportation to a country he didn’t know, despite growing up in the UK – and despite only being charged with minor offences in his late teens.“Anthony” is another example. He and his father fled from the Caribbean when he was eight, after his mother was killed in front of him in an act of gang warfare. He was abused and neglected, and taken into care, which also failed him. It was during the 2011 London riots – when magistrates were told they could ignore sentencing guidelines – that he was sentenced, handed a deportation order and detained.“We are prisoners in a land we’ve been in for most of our lives,” Anthony says. “This is my country. How can you tell me that it’s not? I was in this country when the Queen Mother died, when we invaded Iraq, when the Twin Towers came down, when Obama came to power … I remember penny sweets, ticket inspectors on the backs of buses, red phone boxes, the Millennium Dome being built. What are they talking about when they say I’m not British? They expect you to wipe your history. How?”Many who arrived in the UK as children or young people live without any secure immigration status – even though they would be eligible – due to lack of support and information, unaffordable fees, the complexity of a constantly changing legal system, and lack of legal aid. People who arrive in the UK as children can become “deportable” adults, with no rights as British citizens.This includes thousands of children who came here seeking asylum and were deported to war zones once they reached 18. In addition, the Home Office has been accused of “profiteering” by making almost £100m through charging children to register as British citizens – including thousands born here.This July, a government-commissioned review of detention condemned the policy of removing people brought up in the UK. Labour MP David Lammy, among more than 100 MPs to support Adoboli, tweeted: “Deporting those who arrived in the UK as kids is inhumane and counterproductive. No one should be punished twice.”Yet clearly the UK does currently operate a two-tier justice system, where people with insecure immigration status are punished again with detention and deportation after serving their time. This does not just punish the inidual, but also their families and friends who are left behind.The home secretary, Sajid Javid, wrote to Adoboli’s MP, rejecting his final appeal to stay, saying that “action” must be “taken against foreign nationals who abuse our hospitality by committing crime”. What Javid’s response makes clear is that, despite living here since childhood, people such as Adoboli are still considered “guests”, forever reliant on “our hospitality”.• Luke Butterly works for Right to Remain, a UK-based human rights organisation challenging injustice in our asylum and immigration systems"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a450f081a1caa5bd105bce570d2ca3937968b5d/0_0_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a0fca2e7383b2d8e5cd6efb2eab7a1e","title":"i couldnt go to the jobcentre i didnt have a cv building my business as a refugee","story":"When Moh Agha fled the war in Syria and arrived in the UK, he started selling books on ebay to support his family. Now he stocks more than 3,500 items and runs training courses for other refugees. This is how he got back in businessMoh Agha had a lot to take in when he first arrived in the UK with his young family in November 2013. “It’s not easy moving to a new country with a wife and two small children,” he says. “Everything was unfamiliar. We had no friends or family, it was very cold and people spoke very fast and with a strong accent.”After fleeing Syria for Saudi Arabia, the family arrived in the UK. “We moved from London to Bristol, then settled in Wolverhampton,” he says. “It wasn’t easy for me to go to the jobcentre, because I didn’t have a CV I’d always owned my own business. I wanted to open a shop, but it was very expensive because of council tax and business rates. I also found it hard to leave my wife Ranim and my daughters Yara and Amal (now 11 and six) at home alone, because they didn’t speak English. So when I discovered ebay and selling things from home, I realised it could be the solution.”Around this time, by chance, Agha attended a very British institution: the car boot sale. “I met a lady who was trying to sell old books – she had maybe 700 or 800 of them,” he recalls. “She didn’t want to take them home at the end of the day so she was giving them away for free. I took them back to my garage, sorted them out and listed 20 for sale on ebay. The next day all of the books were sold. I then listed the rest and spent the next six months looking around for more. The profit was small, but I was happy to be building a store and getting good feedback.”As Agha and his family began to build up a network of fellow Syrians between Manchester, London and Bristol, he realised that many in his community were struggling to find traditional items they missed from home. “I went to a big wholesaler in London and bought some Syrian kitchenware and house decorations and listed them,” he says. “I made a profit straight away and I realised that there was a real demand there, so I started to import more items from Egypt and Lebanon.”But building up an online store from scratch wasn’t without its challenges. “I’d watch videos explaining how to sell on ebay, but I couldn’t always understand them because they were in English or out of date,” he says. “I realised many people in my community needed these items, but didn’t know about ebay or were not sure how to use it. So I started making videos in Arabic, advertising my items and explaining how to make an ebay account and use PayPal.”Agha’s store, Almaskiya, now stocks 3,500 different items – from prayer mats to copper falafel makers – and he’s not just selling to the Syrian community anymore. “There’s a mould to make sweets that we use every Eid,” he says. “I made a 20-second video explaining how to use it, and now people from Europe are buying it at Christmas and Easter. We have orders for it every day now, actually. And there’s a metal straw that we use to drink tea in the Middle East. The idea came to me that people who drink coffee might want to use it to keep their teeth white. That’s become one of our bestsellers.”The business is growing – “we make a good profit in high season and we cover our costs the rest of the time” – but Agha hasn’t stopped there. “After I made the videos explaining ebay, a lot of people asked me how they could start selling too,” he says. Agha now runs free workshops around the UK for people interested in becoming ebay sellers. “Even though I know these people could become my competitors, I believe that everyone has their own strategy and their own way of doing things – and there’s room for millions of sellers. When I hear people thank me or say: ‘I’m going to pray for you’, or I see them start businesses with a good turnover, I feel proud,” he says. “It’s the best part of my day.” Millions of people are using ebay to start a side hustle, make more of a hobby or carve out a career.

And why should we care? Author of The Multi-Hyphen Method, Emma Gannon, explainsAlex Haddow, a comedian and picture editor, agrees: “I feel that by doing lots of things that pique my interest all the time, I get the most out of everything,” she says. “And because that keeps my interest up, I put more into them and get better results.”At the same time, the internet has given us access to a myriad of free tools and a huge global audience of potential customers and clients, whether using e-commerce hubs such as ebay, or building a following via social media – making many business ideas more viable than before. Not only is it easier to take that first step, but it’s reassuringly non-scary. After all, there’s no risking it all to follow your dreams it is, by definition, a bit on the side. Unsurprisingly, the rise of the multitasking worker comes hand-in-hand with fewer people working in a traditional “job-for-life” role. According to HR organisation the CIPD, around a quarter of workers have been in a job for less than two years, as working on a project-by-project basis lessens the stigma around job-hopping (and creates more impressive-looking CVs).Simultaneously, advances in technology have led to general job security being called into question. I started my side hustle in 2010, when I began to suspect that my magazine job wasn’t going to be around in five years’ time, and have been earning money with a blog and consultancy business ever since. This means we’re quicker to move on and less likely to look back. “I resent the job-for-life notion,” says journalist and volunteer Georgie Bradley. “The idea of clocking in, chaining myself to the desk, then clocking out nine hours later seems soul-destroying.”Researching my book on multi-faceted careers, The Multi-Hyphen Method, I met many more people making side hustling an art. Janet Oganah is a prime example: a former family law barrister, she is now a civil servant and podcaster. “Choosing a multi-hyphenate lifestyle was not an easy decision,” she says. “But it was one of the best ones I have made. I was invested in my legal career I did important work that changed lives. But I was uneasy about relying on one income stream, particularly with the cuts to publicly funded work.” Oganah turned to podcasting as a lucrative, creative way of ersifying her career. For Sally Steel, a teacher who launched a crochet business on ebay, the flexibility was vital for family life: “I wanted to work more creatively and be able to do the school run. I started teaching part-time, building my business while my twins were asleep or at nursery,” she says. “It meant I could spend more time with my children while earning a living. And the happiness I feel at being my own creative boss is worth all the hard work.” This fulfilment is a key factor. For Emma Glass, a paediatric clinical research nurse and author, it’s achieved through the variety of her days. “I feel lucky to have opportunities in both nursing and writing,” she says. “I like working in a clinical environment and with patients, and then spending the evening with publishers and writers and having entirely different experiences within a single day.” Of course, nobody wants to have 17 jobs to make ends meet, and it would be irresponsible to glorify that, but embracing multiple skills to create a modern portfolio career is exciting. We’re told to pick one thing to be good at from our school days, but we all have so many skills and interests. Being a multi-hyphenate answers this, expanding our earning potential and giving us the flexibility to choose how and when we work. After all, says Sarah Kingston, writer, consultant and owner of a marketing agency: “I get to be creative, challenged and excited about what I do. Why have one job title when I can have three?”Millions of people are using ebay to start a side hustle, make more of a hobby or carve out a career.

They now sell sauces globally.“Everyone loves a good story, don’t they,” says Sahota. “It’s something customers can relate to but also, in our case, it helped us stand out with retailers who we wanted to stock our products.” To highlight the backstory, Sahota cast his father in a series of online comedy music videos to promote the brand.Don’t think all advice is good adviceIf launching a business or a product is like having a baby, entrepreneurs face a similar barrage of well-meaning, often contradictory advice from family, friends and a million business books. “Sarah Wood, the co-founder of the video ad tech company Unruly, once said the best piece of advice she ever got was that advice itself was overrated,” says startups’s Shane Donnelly.Sahota hates the kind of motivational self-help quotes that flood Instagram – “An investment in yourself pays the best interest” and all that sort of thing. “It starts off really well intentioned but it can really get on top of you after a while, so I ignore it all now,” he says.Do ask for experience not advice“A lot of advice is regret in disguise,” Bailey says. “Everyone’s got an experience, but rather than ask for advice, I often recommend asking for that experience.” In other words, not so much “what would you do?” but “what did you do?” – then make your own decision.“The worst advice I got was when I called this big wholesaler in east London and he said: ‘My biggest piece of advice for you is just quit, this is really hard’”, Sahota recalls. “And then he goes: ‘I’ll take a pallet off you if you want.’ And I remember thinking: ‘You told me to quit but you also want a pallet of my sauces? I’ll show you.’”Don’t stick with a product beyond its sell by dateBuilding a product around yourself only enhances your emotional attachment to your baby, but attachment parenting can be bad when things get tricky. “Where people come unstuck is they fall in love with their first creation and stay with it even when the evidence is against it,” says Bailey.“Holding a sentimental attachment to elements that just aren’t working will do your startup no long-term favours,” Donnelly adds.Do go back to the beginningIf sales or interest in your product aren’t what you had hoped, Bailey suggests going back to page one of your story. “Remember what it was that first motivated you,” he says. “What problem were you trying to solve? You have to be open to trying 10 or 20 different solutions and seeing what works.”For Sahota, the first element was working – his sauces were popular and central to his story – but to satisfy investors and progress as a business, he knew the answer was to make his crisps work. “And we should have made that move a lot sooner,” he says. “But I felt like I couldn’t look beyond the sauces unless I was dead.”Don’t look like an amateurIt doesn’t matter how good your story is if you come up short when talk turns serious. “You’ve got to have that nice soft exterior to connect but when you sit down with the supermarket or an investor, they have to know you mean business,” says Sahota. “You need to be able to say: ‘When you put my product on your shelves, I’ll drive customers in to your store because I’ve got followers who want it and I will add value to the category.’ That is hugely important for retailers.”Do ask the right questionsCustomer research is vital for any new business. “But people always ask their customers: ‘Would you use this product that does this cool thing,’” says Bailey. “But that’s a leading question. They’ll say: ‘Yes’ – and that looks like validation. But you should be asking about experience and behaviour.”Knowing how someone lives will help you to see how your product fits into people’s lives.To do this, Bailey suggests directing people to a landing page on your website and setting up a waiting list long before you launch anything, and then having a conversation with those people on the waiting list. “Even if you just get 10 people, that also means they feel the problem you’re trying to solve. And if nobody signs up, that tells you something, too.”Don’t fall into bad habitsKnowing how to structure each day – and what to do – can be tough for a solo starter, particularly one who has come out of an office environment. “You need to create really good habits straight away,” Sahota says. “There’ll be days when it’s really hard and those habits will get you through even if you’ve run out of willpower or motivation.” The sauce entrepreneur sets himself daily goals. “It could be something really simple like sending one really good email to a potential lead and following it with a phone call. On some days it’s good to set your goals low so you feel like you’ve achieved something.”Do take care of number one“Basically, get enough sleep and you’re halfway there,” Bailey says. “I used to work for a big consultancy, working all hours and travelling, and I hated the lifestyle. When I started my first business I was like: ‘I’m going to take my work-life balance seriously.’ Nonetheless, two years later, an investor turns to me during a crisis and says: ‘Dave, here’s what you’re going to do. You’re going to take a holiday for a week and come back to this fresh.’ It was what I needed.”Now you’re well versed in the major dos and don’ts, it’s time to get down to business.

But is their moment coming to an end as we tackle our waste problem?When was the last day you didn’t see a gull? Throughout Britain we ordinarily cross paths with these birds more often than with any other wild creature. They are hard to avoid. In the last 30 years – the life of a large gull – they have come among us as never before. Though still popularly regarded as seagulls, many have moved inland, far from the seaside or saltwater. They have adapted to life in many places we have made, and they have thrived.Cities and their hinterlands where we jettison our rubbish now sustain far more gulls than the birds’ former more traditional marine habitats. Indeed, in a paradox that might define the Anthropocene era, surviving coastal birds are now regarded as threatened with local extinction, while the same gull species in urban areas are so prevalent they are thought of as pests.Almost every human inhabitant of Britain’s cities could watch gulls every day if they wanted to. Urban rooftop nesting gull colonies are now spread throughout the UK. The birds feed among us, on our streets, as well as on our rubbish dumps. Many people are on their guard, however, because, one way or another, they have met the birds before and haven’t necessarily enjoyed the encounter. Gulls are frighteningly big – of a scale that seems out of sorts with their new habitat. They are loud. Their clawed feet stamp about the place. They lift off and fly with skill and menace, suggesting both ancient winged dinosaurs and futuristic drone ops. They seem to have an uncanny knowledge of what is going on and how to turn it to their advantage.Above all, they steal our chips. And these opportunistic scavenging raids on a staple of the national diet have come to epitomise a contemporary mashup of nature and people in the feral world we have made, which we must now live in and share with other animal life.As we have evolved in and adapted to an urban milieu, so the gulls have followed in our slipstream. And it now seems they will be with us, like badges of our creation, for the duration of this, our late hour. They are tracking us like no other bird: this year herring gulls were discovered drunk in south coast towns last year a herring gull was dyed a lurid orange after falling into a vat of curry in south Wales. These avian encounters with human activities say much about how we live today, yet we commonly despise the gulls for showing us these truths.The beginnings of this entangled story can be traced back to little over 100 years ago, when gulls first shifted from being seagulls. Among the early reporters on the arrival of black-headed gulls in inner London was the birdwatcher and conservationist WH Hudson. Severe winters in the late 1890s drew the birds upriver from even harsher coastal conditions. Many people regarded these ghostly white waifs as unwanted immigrants and shot at them, but Hudson (himself an immigrant from Argentina) saw the birds as beautiful additions to the urban avifauna.Hudson was moved by the sympathetic actions of “working people” who came to the Thames Embankment to feed scraps from their lunchboxes to the hungry birds. Since then, the gulls’ reliance on human food has continued to prompt many people to regard them as scavengers rather as entrepreneurs, as feckless immigrants rather than refugees, as chancers and idlers, as scroungers keen to exploit any handouts going.These ideas have dogged gulls all the way to our current annual panics, triggered when a wild animal reveals itself to be rather good at aping human life and finding a way to successfully live in the world that we have made. Every summer, horror stories appear in the news after tales of chip-thieving are beefed up with accounts of tortoise and chihuahua murders. “Experts” are found who are happy to predict that, after our precious chips and our blessed pets, it will not be long before human children (or “tots”, in tabloid terms) are taken.Gulls do seem big and they are strong. Every time I have been out ringing the large species on a rubbish dump in Essex, I have returned bloodied from holding the birds and with beak marks on my hands that took a week to fade.But gulls are losing out at our hands much more than the other way around. A gull moment – 30 years or so – is coming to an end. Little food waste is now going into landfill. We are still too wasteful, but now most gull-edible trash is being composted or incinerated. That is surely good, but it also means that the good times for herring and lesser black-backed and great black-backed gulls are over. They will have to shift their behaviour once more. We’ve seen them do it before – but will they manage again?• Tim Dee is the author of Landfill (Little Toller)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b8cd9807083cf2b13fe30a30fde7b2dee873fd7/0_41_5437_3262/master/5437.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e82beb4b5496cd16963233d7045d36f","title":"the empire of the eagle book mike unwin david tiplin","story":"The Empire of the Eagle: An Illustrated Natural History, by Mike Unwin and David Tipling, is published by Yale University Press and celebrates the world’s 68 eagle species in all their magnificence and beguiling ersity"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28f6d9e95b4a8f878777c321e0e7c6ae0e3dd495/0_0_2592_1533/master/2592.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c65a358dbc780769e9201df502899b1 700w","title":"clogs feminist shoes footwear ugly fashion","story":"A determined ‘clogerati’ of celebs and writers have made the clog the fashion lover’s shoe of choiceUgly fashion is big business. But nowhere more so than on our feet, it seems, with the news that clogs – the bulbous footwear more commonly linked to farmers and folklore – have become the discerning fashion lover’s shoe of choice.Following on the from the unlikely success of Birkenstock shoes, Crocs and the “ugly trainer” which went as far as co-opting the “ugly” moniker in order to sell shoes, the trend occupies both ends of the ugly spectrum. The good news is the majority of these clogs are not as ugly as they sound.At the prettiest end, and arguably the cause of the resurgence, is the Dior “Diorquake”. This riveted clog with a low heel sits alongside sleek versions at Marni and Joseph, while newer brands like Rachel Comey and No. 6 are growing in popularity. Cheaper still are Swedish Hasbeens, the cult Scandi label whose wooden-soled platforms play fast and loose with the traditional clog shape. Its bestseller this season is its classic bulbous Louise design. For the truly fashionable it’s all about Dansko, the brand worn by nurses and now hipsters including Gillian Jacobs, the star of Netflix hit LoveDansko shoes have earned the nickname “status clogs”. Sometimes, the uglier the clog, the cooler it is.With all trends, visibility is everything. So we can thank a powerful triumvirate for the shoe’s moment in the sun: US Vogue, which calls clogs the “bookworm’s fashion shoe” Alexa Chung, whose early 00s Miu Miu pair arguably led her to design her own version for her namesake fashion label and the influential fashion blogger, Leandra Medine, who is well known for turning the provocative into the desirable.The first clog-maker’s guild was formed in Netherlands in the late 16th century, although designs vary depending on the country and region. The one rule is that they must be made of wood and leather, which probably explains the myriad shapes we now have.People tend to hop on a trend because it signifies something bigger – that Dior’s clog takes its name from “Youthquake”, the 1960’s cultural term coined by Diana Vreeland and defined by the decade’s youth mobilisation, suggests Dior and Mechling are on the same page.Jeremy Atkinson, England’s last remaining hand-carver of bespoke clogs, thinks the shoe’s popularity is less about gender and more about society in general. Based in Hertfordshire, Atkinson started making clogs 37 years ago, swept up partly by the 1970s self-sufficiency movement that took its cues from the writer John Seymour, who encouraged people to go back to smaller production. Atkinson can make a pair in under two days, and now ships to Finland, Tasmania and north London.Clogs generally need to be made by hand so that they fit the foot, he says, which results in a relationship between wearer, shoe and shoemaker. Atkinson thinks the people who buy his clogs tend to be aware that the world has become “orced from its roots” and that by nature of their material – wood and leather in the case of his shoes – clogs represent “a sympathetic attitude to the land”. He mentions a pair he made for a computer technician who wanted to feel “more grounded” while he worked. Clogs are shoes for uncertain times.But what about practicality. Atkinson says clogs work well in wet and heat, although avoid mud. Provided they fit – they’re meant to tip when you walk rather than your toes gripping the side – you can wear them all day. Masha Popova, Russian Vogue’s web editor, claims to walk nine miles a day in a pair. Karin Kugelberg, retail manager of Swedish Hasbeens, agrees that while the clog is one of the only shoes which transitions from summer to winter, it’s best to wear them with a pair of socks – which may rule out clogs for some."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2d4f85da2010688a1519a1b29ae85aa54c9c0ac/0_0_4032_2418/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b194114d9638f1e95ad8b90afc151534","title":"the best party outfits for all ages in pictures","story":"How to hit the festive circuit with style• ‘It’s a marathon, not a sprint’: top tips for doing the gruelling seasonal circuit"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4d78a82e5f53f490a163dc61d9304292c1156be/0_245_3264_1958/master/3264.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ff0f684542fc6ab356b1ee97249efb7","title":"theres no such thing as humane meat or eggs stop kidding yourself","story":"Many people think they consume humane meat, but only a tiny fraction actually do. The majority of consumers are totally wrong about what they eatA few years ago I wanted to visit the best egg farm I could find. I had been inside an egg factory farm. I had seen a dozen sheds, each with a dozen rows of wire cages stacked two high and 150ft deep. Those cages were so small the birds inside couldn’t even spread their wings. They were half-starved, diseased, and undeniably miserable.Factory farming was clearly wrong, so I wanted to instead find a farm that represented an ethical and humane way to raise animals for food.Fortunately some small farms, such as those who set up stands at farmers’ markets, are willing to let people visit their facilities. So in March 2016, I drove from my home in San Francisco up California’s northern coast, through towering redwoods and past crashing waves, to one of the best egg farms in the state.The award-winning farm was nestled in a landscape of bucolic green grass and rolling hills. It looked like it came straight out of an advertisement. I saw a charmingly rundown-yet-functional mobile chicken coop standing in a football-field-sized pasture peppered with free-roaming chickens. I thought to myself, why couldn’t all farms be like this? I had seen what happened behind the locked doors of factory farms, but here I seemed to be witnessing a better way. I would soon learn just how wrong I was.Take cage-free eggs, for example. Just because the birds aren’t in cages doesn’t mean they’re healthy or happy. Cage-free birds have around the same total space per bird they just live in a large shed with thousands (often tens of thousands) of other birds.In this stressful environment, birds frequently peck each other so much that they lose feathers, bleed, and even die from what is effectively cannibalism caused by the birds’ high-density confinement. The air quality on cage-free farms tends to be worse due to the chickens walking around and kicking up dust and feces, which also threatens food safety.Raising chickens on pasture avoids some of these issues, but it invites new problems. Pasture-based flocks suffer due to predation and disease from wild animals.Maybe there are some rotational, labor-intensive methods that do reduce environmental impact. However, eco-conscious animal farming does little to mitigate health concerns aside from the overuse of antibiotics. And the animal suffering, especially on chicken farms, is still staggering.You may be thinking that even if the vast majority of farms still have serious issues, surely at least a few farms – perhaps even just a handful – have happy animals. Maybe you’ve even been on a specific local farm that you’re convinced has happy animals no matter if most farms misuse humane labeling.This response is valid, to an extent. Where I grew up in rural Texas, I lived around many pasture-raised cattle who seemed perfectly content to chew their cud. I even helped raise a handful chickens and goats myself. Yes, their slaughter might be a terrible experience, but it seems plausible that one day of even intense suffering might not outweigh a few years of happy cud-chewing life.When people call upon the idea of ethical animal farming – even if that constitutes little or none of their actual consumption – it has dangerous effects as a “psychological refuge” they indirectly use to justify their consumption of factory farmed products.Consider that over the past decade, most Americans have been exposed to the realities of animal farming from hundreds of undercover investigations over the years and dozens of scientific reports on the industry’s environmental and public health impacts.At the California egg farm I visited, the devil was in the details. Despite the pastoral scenery, I found that the birds were in worse health than those of any other farm I’d been to. I saw many cases of Marek’s, a highly contagious disease that had led to partial blindness in many of them swollen abdomens, some with over a pound of fluid buildup in their less-than-five-pound body vent gleet, a fungal infection in the opening of a bird’s reproductive and digestive tract and lice.Like the hens in factory farms, many of them suffered and died from cancer, stuck eggs, reproductive tract infections, and other ailments that result from artificial breeding for hyperactive reproductive systems that make them lay unnatural numbers of eggs. Moving the chickens from indoors to pasture doesn’t eliminate this genetic suffering.The farmer told me about the challenges of pasture farming, like how many birds he lost to predators. He didn’t mention anything about how it affected the birds’ welfare he just noted it as a reason their eggs were so expensive. To stem the loss, he chained a dog to the chicken coop, a Great Pyrenees with matted fur and no water nearby.When I visited the farm, I sincerely wanted to believe that these animals had good lives, but the evidence just wasn’t there to support it. It wasn’t as bad as the factory farms I visited, but it still wasn’t the kind of life I’d want to live myself.Of course, the current scarcity of humane animal farms doesn’t preclude their theoretically possibility. But consider the cost: the eggs at the farm I visited cost over $6 per dozen. Hardly anyone is willing to pay that much for food, and that farm still had serious ethical problems.I was disappointed by the visit to this farm and other farm visits, as well as evidence from hundreds of other visits to “humane” farms by animal protection advocates and investigators. Mercy For Animals, the international non-profit animal protection organisation, says it randomly selects farms to investigate, and other groups have specifically sought out farms with leading humane certifications in order to show that even the animals on those farms still suffer tremendously.Given the inability of farmed animals to revolt or organise on their own behalf, we would need extensive regulations and enforcement to maintain high animal welfare throughout the industry. This would include the expenses of regular independent inspections and livestreamed security footage at all facilities.Consumers or taxpayers would also need to pay for direct costs such as more space per animal, an army of veterinarians and medical supplies for sick and injured animals, and a reversion of the artificial breeding that has made these animals grow meat and produce milk and eggs at ultra-fast rates. That level of welfare doesn’t exist at the very best farms today, so even the steep price tag of the eggs from the pasture farm I visited is still too low to guarantee that the animals have good lives.So even if humane animal farming is possible in theory, and maybe even real in a handful of isolated cases, it can’t feasibly feed around 10 billion people by 2050.The fact is that when we use animals as raw materials or labor in the food system – the way we use property like steel, lumber, or even other humans in the case of slavery – this inevitably leads to mass cruelty because cheap prices and profits will always come before their welfare.This means we need to take a position against animal farming just as we take strong positions against human-on-human wrongdoing.Then I think we’ll be on track to end all animal farming.This is an edited extract from The End of Animal Farming, Beacon Press."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db06657dee5853b96de3ca72dd25df85ffcd4fee/0_87_2535_1522/master/2535.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef04f3aecdbc268a5fedd2e29068db67","title":"gibraltar jayce olivero abingdon hazard","story":"Student and non-league defender on the thrill of turning out for his country and tears that greeted their first competitive winIf Craig David considers his 7 Days hectic, he clearly has never met Jayce Olivero. Take the international break last month when Olivero and his country tasted their first competitive win, against Armenia Saturday 13 October 2018 will live with Gibraltar forever. By the Tuesday night they were celebrating another, against Liechtenstein, and by Wednesday afternoon, via Gatwick airport, he was back home in Headington. By 9am Thursday, Olivero, a third-year student at Oxford Brookes University, was sitting in a two-hour lecture. Two days later he helped Abingdon United beat ninth-tier Tuffley Rovers in the Hellenic League Challenge Cup.Olivero, who had trials at Leicester and West Ham in his mid-teens, knows what is coming. “I always get that question,” he says, laughing. “I’ve been very fortunate to play against players like Hazard, Lukaku, Dzeko, Nani, all these great players … Kompany, Courtois, just a big list of brilliant players. Kevin De Bruyne.Olivero speaks eloquently about juggling his BSc sport, coaching and physical education degree with playing for Gibraltar, for whom he made his debut aged 17. They play on an artificial pitch at Victoria Stadium, round the corner from the international airport, with that looming limestone rock as the backdrop.“It is crazy for spectators, who are watching the game and all of a sudden there are planes landing a few metres away,” Olivero says. “It’s crazy, but it’s just the way it is. What really is special is that big rock that overlooks our pitch and our stadium. I think that is what really inspires us. When our national anthem goes off, we are looking up at the rock. That rock holds everything, it is everything we are and represent. That rock is really special.”It was the match in Yerevan that captured the hearts of those far beyond Gibraltar. After 22 games without a competitive win, Gibraltar, who five years ago became Uefa’s smallest member with a population of around 35,000, had won.The homecoming was special. On the ground along with GBC, Gibraltar’s public service broadcaster, and a sea of supporters were almost a dozen of Olivero’s relatives, each wearing match-worn shirts carrying his name and number. “Every time I play I have given a shirt to a member of my family a shirt, so they all have one. It makes me happier to see them wearing the top and them feeling proud rather me just having it in my room.”The defender counts De Bruyne, Hazard and Ricardo Quaresma among his toughest opponents but is loth to swap shirts with players he considers to be his heroes. “I really value the shirt of Gibraltar, our history and our past,” he says. “That’s why I like to keep them because years down the line I want to look back and remember playing.He believes being rejected by Leicester and West Ham made him mentally stronger and exposed the areas of his game he needed to improve. When he was on trial at Leicester, in February 2016, the club were en route to being crowned Premier League champions.For now, his focus is Friday’s Nations League qualifier against Armenia. Olivero will miss Abingdon’s trip on Saturday to Flackwell Heath in the Hellenic Premier League but will return in time for next week’s home match against Brackley Town Saints.Will it be another famous night on the rock? “Hopefully,” Olivero says. “We always have to remain humble. We have got things clear. We have won, we have made history but there is a lot more things to achieve. We have to keep our heads down, keep working and trying to improve. I have tasted that feeling of success and I just want it again. We know what we have to do.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83cbc9b9c4b9fb5cb7102c1ca4aba6947ed0e6b8/0_90_3042_1825/master/3042.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c1c7e92be1e8e7bc69558cea2b50c07a","title":"ivan rakitic barcelona croatia england world cup semi final interview","story":"Ivan Rakitic packed his bag, kissed his family goodbye and said see you on the 15th. It was early June and he was not planning to be back until mid-July, four days after his daughter’s birthday. His wife, Raquel Mauri, told him he had better explain, so he made a promise: “I told her: ‘Don’t worry, when it’s over we’ll have a big party,’” he grins. “And I kept my word.” The day Althea turned five, he was still in Moscow. That night he called, wished her happy birthday and said sorry: daddy wasn’t coming home just yet. He had a World Cup final to play.“Nobody had us down as finalists, but the idea was always to reach the last day I didn’t want to be back sooner,” he says. Just like Sunday’s Nations League match, England stood between Croatia and a final. A final four, this time the final then. Kieran Trippier put England ahead and around the Luzhniki they sang about football coming home, 52 years later. Rakitic, though, remained convinced he was not. “At half-time we had faith,” he says. “It was a brilliant goal, the game turned their way but we didn’t feel they were better or that it was lost, maybe because of what had happened before.”Belief had built early, growing with every step, a sense of destiny by the time they met England, there was a sense of mission about Croatia, a kind of indestructibility. Rakitic says their opening victory against Nigeria got them thinking “maybe we’ll be OK”. Then came the hammering of Argentina – “we had to ensure the ball didn’t reach Messi” – victory over Iceland and two penalty shootouts, first against Denmark then hosts Russia. And that, he insists, “is no coincidence”.Both times, he scored the decisive penalty. “If I told you I was as calm as I’d be taking any penalty, I’d be lying,” he says, “but …” Still, he looked calm and, listening to him now, he sounds it too. “We’re a small country but there are Croatians in Australia, South America, Africa, the other side of the world, and you think: ‘I can make history with my “brothers”.’ Mostly, though, you think about ‘nothing’: conversations with my wife, FaceTime with my daughters, everyday things.”Rakitic’s mother-in-law had joked that his dog takes better penalties his wife, though, has a “sixth sense” and was more optimistic. “Before Denmark, she had a feeling it would go to penalties and I’d get the winner, so I was thinking: ‘Bloody hell, if I score, she’s right.’ I don’t think it’s a lottery. If we close our eyes, maybe, but it’s not like that. A lottery is you calling and saying: ‘You’ve won a prize.’ Well, thanks. Something falls into your lap. But this is about football, quality.”Against England, there was no need for penalties. Rakitic talks eloquently about the tactical analysis at half-time, the key roles played by John Stones and Jordan Henderson and the need to apply pressure higher and more consistently, denying them a way out. He describes England as an “organised” team with “well-rehearsed” movements, and traces the team’s shifts since the summer, insisting that their victory in Seville was no fluke and dismissing suggestions that they were merely beneficiaries of a kind draw in Russia, noting “no one gives you anything for free”. But he also talks about Croatia’s clarity, their confidence in Moscow – and that was borne out.Ivan Perisic equalised, a post was struck, and while it went to extra time, the tilt felt decisive. It did to Croatia, certainly. “We could see it in those first 15, 20 minutes when, honestly, they didn’t know what to do,” Rakitic says. “You feel the control, you feel happy, comfortable. They’re finding it harder to reach your goal and you’re getting closer to theirs. You even think: ‘Extra time? Fine, no problem.’”Soon, they were in the very best place. “I congratulated Gareth Southgate first, but it was a moment of madness,” Rakitic says. “Someone said we showed a lack of respect because we didn’t shake hands afterwards but you have to understand what it meant. A country like Croatia – I don’t know how many inhabitants London has, probably double our entire population – had reached the final. It’s not that we disrespected England, it’s just that you feel like running to hug every Croatian on the planet. Inside, you feel … I don’t know, you can’t explain it.”It almost did. Croatia were in the final, but in what physical shape? Did exhaustion cost them? It is something Rakitic believes proved more relevant post-World Cup than it was then. Croatia lost 6-0 to Spain in September and were largely outplayed by England during a 0-0 draw behind closed doors in Rijeka, prompting him to insist: “That game was forgotten immediately it could have been a party but no one will ever talk about it. Football’s nothing without fans we need different punishments.” Now Croatia have recovered, he says: Thursday’s wild 3-2 win over Spain means that another victory over England, this time at Wembley, would mean another “final”.“I don’t think it’s coincidence that many of our players started the season late, or have been injured or exhausted. I played maybe 70 games last season, practically two seasons in one, and after the World Cup, those first days home were like …” Rakitic puffs out his cheeks. “There was this bajón, a slump, where I didn’t want to hear anything, see anything. Genuinely, I was completely exhausted, empty inside and out. At the time, though, after the semi-final in Russia, there’s so much joy it gives you strength: ‘If I have to play again tomorrow, I’m up for it.’”Not tomorrow, but four days later – five for France – Croatia did play again. For the first time, Rakitic’s family travelled. It was his 99th cap. Born and raised in Switzerland, which he calls a “model” of “coexistence”, as a teenager he took a decision he “wouldn’t wish on any kid” and chose to represent his parents’ country. He insists he feels Swiss and a little Spanish, but is Croatian “to the final hair on my head”, and recalls a package arriving in Möhlin during the 1998 World Cup containing Croatia shirts for him and his brother. Now, his team had gone further. How did he feel, standing there pre-final, national anthem playing?“That’s a great question,” he says. “You think …”There is a long pause. Eventually, he says: “You feel a pride so strong that if Superman flew down, he couldn’t drag you away he couldn’t shift you, so powerful is the desire, the will. It’s amazing. You experience emotions you’ll never forget. It’s unique. I’ve been fortunate to win the Champions League but, with respect, even that doesn’t come close. You think: ‘OK, stop everything, let’s play.’”So, they did. They played well too, but didn’t win. France scored from a non-existent free-kick and were awarded a debatable penalty by VAR. “Don’t talk to me about VAR I’ve dreamed about it a thousand nights,” Rakitic says. “That was maybe our best game. For an hour we were better than them, far superior. You can see it in your opponents’ faces sometimes and we could see that France didn’t know how to stop us, how to control us, how to get out, to attack. They were uncomfortable. But, for all that, the footballing god, at that moment …”“In that final, the footballing god was French. The first goal comes from a free-kick that’s not a foul and VAR could have intervened because Pogba was offside. Then VAR didn’t get the penalty wrong exactly but if he hadn’t given it there wouldn’t have been many complaints. If there’s a penalty, I see it once and I know I don’t need to see it 10 times. Anything that improves football is welcome but with VAR play stops, football loses that something. You score and can’t celebrate, you wait to see if the referee’s finger’s in his ear or he’s …”Rakitic draws the imaginary TV screen and he’s back in Moscow. “You go over and over it, especially the first night. You say to yourself, to each other: ‘You were the better team, you created chances, France weren’t comfortable.’ There are those goals, then Pogba shoots, and it bounces back to him for another shot. Mbappé’s going at 50kph and scores – we’re caught on the attack, wrong-footed. Little things didn’t go for us. But we played a great, great game and our heads never dropped despite losing for some time.“You think: ‘Bloody hell, we did everything to win.’ And then a combination of having it taken away from you and them winning it, and … pffff … it doesn’t feel right. But that’s football. The best team doesn’t always win the team that gives the most isn’t always rewarded. And I don’t know if I’ll make it to the next World Cup. To have come so close and not to have won it, and like that. You congratulate France, who deserved to be champions, but we could have been deserving winners.”Croatia celebrated as if they were, half a million on the streets, and rightly so what they achieved was as historic as it was unexpected. “Some things can’t be explained or planned, it just happens,” he says. “The atmosphere was different to previous tournaments. It’s not easy, 23 players on top of each other for a month and a half, but it was spectacular. You miss your family, your children, your friends, but we enjoyed the day-to-day. After the World Cup we said to each other: ‘Wow, it’s over, so fast. It’s gone, what a shame.’” It was time to head home. Ivan Rakitic had a party to go to."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d28605c18de8bd866f2c22fe9f8269a553e7b8f6/0_0_5629_3378/master/5629.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d118f3b3614a5c2f587aa91cc2408bac","title":"i cant breathe older women do double the unpaid work of men says study","story":"Study of 31 countries finds women over 60 undertake domestic and care work ning up to to seven hours a dayOlder women spend twice as much time as older men on unpaid work, research has found.Researchers who examined employment patterns across developed and developing countries found the disproportionate amount of unpaid domestic and care work performed by women persists into older age regardless of geography. In Ghana, older women spend just over two hours a day doing unpaid work, a figure that rose to almost four hours in British households. In Cape Verde, meanwhile, women spend seven hours a day on such tasks.At the same time, and particularly in poorer countries, older women are juggling large amounts of mostly informal and highly precarious paid work too, according to the report.Researchers found that there were risks for older women engaging in such work, including mental and physical health problems, and financial losses due to the demands of multiple activities. There was also a danger of women encountering violence and abuse during their work as a result of discrimination, the report found.Governments must refocus their social protection policies to support older women, warned the report’s authors.“These findings reveal the full extent to which gender inequalities persist into older age,” said lead author Fiona Samuels, senior research fellow with the ODI’s gender equality and social inclusion programme.“The social expectations on women to simply get on with unpaid domestic and care work are putting them under increasing strain and limiting their life choices.”The researchers found that in Ethiopia, one of the countries where field research was conducted, household chores have a shaping influence on how older women structure their days.Women interviewed for the project spoke of a relentless cycle of household tasks – cooking, cleaning, washing – as well as physically demanding duties such as collecting water and firewood. When they become too old to carry these items, many women simply resort to dragging them.Inevitably, there is a limit to their powers of endurance. “How can I work?” reflected one 70-year-old interviewed for the study. “Can people work without their hands? My own clothes are even washed with someone else. I do not wash them. I also have asthma. I cannot breathe.”The report made several recommendations for governments, including supporting social pensions for older women and reducing and redistributing unpaid care work, through better care provision, including childcare.Age International, the organisation that commissioned the research, are calling on the UK government to do more to ensure the “invisible” contributions of older women are recognised and valued in its international development programmes, so that they have greater choice in their work."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a053756d3d0434e9f70a9be730f97072e833b6ab/1015_984_2315_1389/master/2315.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=207318e4a254535b6f1d72c912fe78a0","title":"experience i dropped two nuclear bombs","story":"The sky lit up 10,000ft above our eye level was a writhing molten mass. I was in aweI became aware of Operation Grapple in July 1956. There wasn’t a big Top Secret stamp on it. Everyone in the country had an idea that Britain was trying to become a nuclear power. I was a 22-year-old co-pilot in the RAF, just happy to be chosen for the mission.My main role was to monitor the flight instruments to make sure the captain was flying correctly. We practised dummy drops for months, flying Valiant bombers from Wittering airbase on the CambridgeshireNorthamptonshire border to a range over Orford Ness.After almost a year perfecting the drills with 1321 flight and, later, No 49 Squadron, we left for Christmas Island. Our drop proper came on 31 May 1957. The target was Malden, a tiny uninhabited island in the Pacific. After 50 minutes of flying we reached the rendezvous and the bomb aimer, one of five crew, went to lie down on a mattress in the well in the belly of the fuselage from that position, he looked straight ahead through the bomb sight at the aiming point. We then made a practice run – up to the release point, then a sharp turn to get away. When the order was given to proceed with the live run, we put metal shutters over all the windows in the cockpit so the violent light from the explosion wouldn’t affect our eyesight the bomb aimer had to keep his shutter open until the drop, though. I could only see through a small piece of welder’s glass in one of them. Despite being 45,000ft above the Pacific, we were in total darkness, the captain, Sqn Ldr David Roberts, and I flew purely by instruments.The bomb aimer took the safety latch off the weapon and said, “Steady, steady, steady”, to get us to hold our heading. As we crossed the release point, he pressed the button and announced, “Bomb’s gone.” We felt some elation, and the aircraft noticeably lifted as the 12,500lb bomb – codenamed Orange Herald – fell away. But almost immediately came the escape manoeuvre: Roberts rolled the aircraft into a steeply banked turn to get away from the upward rush of the exploding nuclear bomb. If we had carried on in a straight line, the fireball would have come up under the aircraft and that would have been it. The trouble was the accelerometer wasn’t showing any G-force at all. I told the captain “More G!” but as he pulled back on the stick we started to judder the aircraft was stalling. We had been turning, we just hadn’t felt the added G. We realised the accelerometer wasn’t working, and the overcorrection sent the bomb aimer – who was making for his seat – crashing back into the well.We knew that if we didn’t turn, we wouldn’t escape the explosion. Thankfully the captain regained control, the bomb aimer scrambled to his seat and, 53 seconds after the moment of release, the weapon exploded. Complete darkness turned to unfiltered daylight. It was as if there was no dark glass in the small aperture you could see the sky and the land below as clear as anything. Three minutes later, we felt a biggish bump as the shockwave hit the aircraft, then a smaller one a second later. We saw the sky lit up 10,000ft above our eye level was a writhing molten mass. I was in a state of awe. At 85, I’m one of three aircrew still alive from Operation Grapple, and to my knowledge I’m the only person to drop two nuclear bombs. For my second flight, the captain was Sqn Ldr Barney Millett, and instead of targeting an atoll like Malden, the drop on 8 November was just off Christmas Island itself. Same procedure, this time no faulty instruments, though this was a thermonuclear bomb – a hydrogen bomb yielding 1.8 megatonnes of TNT – more than twice the power of the previous one.We were checked with a Geiger counter when we got back: it wasn’t mentioned that we were in major danger, so no one was in a state of jitters. To date, I haven’t had medical issues resulting from Grapple, but I know that people on the ground who watched the explosions claim to have been affected. I think the services took the precautions they believed sufficient, but I don’t want to decry the people who say they have fallen ill.As for the ethics, my feeling was, it was a weapon of war. Whether it’s a 1,000lb bomb or a 10,000lb bomb, they’re not nice things to have, but they’re essential to defend our country. This was at the height of the cold war. The Soviet Union was a powerful nation we assumed it would use nuclear weapons if necessary, just as we would have done.• As told to Nick Thompson.Do you have an experience to share?

The former Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre criticised Rusbridger in his lecture on Sunday night.“His record on investigations in the public interest was exceptional, a model for how to hold the powerful to account,” Viner said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0526103a0c5e197a4c1d0f1e9206434ccd2b5600/248_98_1540_924/master/1540.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ec49c73b6390e2cd1340069190cfe8df","title":"bbc women complain andrew neil tweet observer journalist carole cadwalladr","story":"Senior female journalists say deleting comment about Carole Cadwalladr not enoughSenior female BBC journalists have complained to executives at the corporation about the presenter Andrew Neil, after he failed to apologise for calling an Observer journalist a “mad cat woman”.Neil, the host of the late night show This Week and one of the corporation’s most high-profile political interviewers, made the comment about Carole Cadwalladr – whose work helped expose the Cambridge Analytica scandal – as part of a string of tweets posted in the early hours of Tuesday.The language echoed that used by Leave.EU’s founder, Arron Banks, who has regularly branded Cadwalladr a “mad cat lady” during her investigation into his Brexit activities and business empire – comments widely criticised as misogynistic.Neil later deleted the tweets and retweeted a statement from the BBC press office saying he “recognises it was inappropriate” to send the message.But the BBC journalists, who declined to be identified because of potential repercussions, said this was not enough and confirmed complaints had been made to executives about the “sexist” comment on Neil’s combative Twitter account.They also highlighted the “bizarre” juxtaposition of Neil’s criticism of Cadwalladr – whom he dubbed “Karol Kodswallop” and likened to a character from The Simpsons, Eleanor Abernathy – with comments made the following day by the BBC director general, Tony Hall, who said he was appalled by the abuse journalists receive on Twitter.Two senior BBC women also expressed exasperation that the corporation took some female presenters off air earlier this year for impartiality reasons after they tweeted support for equal pay at the corporation, but BBC bosses did not punish Neil for a tweet criticising an inidual at the heart of a major political story.Another BBC journalist complained that “when producers tweet something stupid they are left to swing in the wind” but Neil was given greater freedom due to his status in the corporation.The BBC would not comment on speculation that Neil had refused to formally apologise over the comments. A spokesperson said: “Andrew acknowledges that the tweet was inappropriate, and it was removed shortly after it was posted. The tweet was sent from Andrew’s personal account, however the BBC has social media guidelines which it expects all staff to follow and these have been discussed with Andrew.”The tweets were sent in the middle of the night but Neil has said he was in the United Arab Emirates to present an awards ceremony. He is the longstanding chair of the Dubai-based publishing company ITP Media Group.Neil, a former Sunday Times editor, often uses his Twitter account to promote pieces published by the rightwing magazine the Spectator. He is chair of its parent company, Press Holdings, which is owned by the billionaire Barclay Brothers.The BBC has previously insisted that, regardless of his personal views, Neil abides by strict impartiality rules and treats politicians of all parties equally while on air.In his tweets Neil also criticised the BBC’s political satire show The Mash Report as “self satisfied, self adulatory, unchallenged leftwing propaganda”.“When it comes to so-called comedy the BBC has long given up on balance, on radio and TV. Nobody seems to care. And I don’t want rightwing comedy, whatever that is. I’d just like comedy. Which is in really short supply. On TV and radio.”He also said the Primal Scream singer Bobby Gillespie, who recently looked on stony-faced as Neil danced on the set of This Week, was a “miserable jock” who likes to “spout Corbynista propaganda from his fancy Islington pad”.Neil has cut back on his TV commitments since marrying Susan Nilsson in a 2015 ceremony in the south of France.

Here are other celebrities who have tried to dodged a photo opTaylor Swift has more conspiracy theories surrounding her than the moon landings: that she has an evil twin she banished to Japan, that Kanye West inducted her into the Illuminati, that she has no belly button… if there’s anyone more likely to have lizard skin photoshopped on to them by a YouTuber, I’d like to see them.So the internet has duly combusted at the news that one of these theories – that she is transported in giant suitcases as a way of avoiding the paparazzi – could indeed be true. Zayn Malik, her collaborator on Fifty Shades soundtrack smash I Don’t Wanna Live Forever, confirmed the news to Vogue, saying: “She was travelling around in a suitcase.”While it points to a viable circus career should she continue to release albums as middling as Reputation, Swift’s efforts are just the latest way she and her peers have sought to maintain their privacy.The Spider-Man co-stars and lovebirds should have won a joint Oscar for virtue signalling when they hid behind signs they had written featuring the websites of charities supporting orphans, autism, and youth mentoring. Benedict Cumberbatch similarly stoked his wokeness by hiding behind a sign that read “Go photograph Egypt and show the world something important” in 2013, before recording a voiceover for a Family Guy video game the following year.Perry told the New York Times that she repeatedly wears her Adidas tracksuit day after day, so that paparazzi photos all look the same and are thus devalued. She actually nicked this idea off Daniel Radcliffe, who told Jay Leno in 2007: “I would wear the same jacket and zip it up so they couldn’t see what I was wearing underneath, and the same hat … They became un-publishable, which was hilarious because there’s nothing better than seeing the paparazzi get really frustrated.”Showing that he learned absolutely nothing from filming Marathon Man, Dustin Hoffman’s facility for hide and seek would have even a five-year-old shaking their head in disappointment.

These antics were also used, a little like Perry and Radcliffe, to make paparazzi pics unusable, posing as she did with chopsticks in her mouth like walrus tusks – but which actually ended up stoking the kooky image all the more.According to William Boyd, writing in these pages in the wake of Bowie’s death, the Thin White Duke had an ingenious deflection tactic when travelling around New York. “I saw Bowie stepping out of a yellow cab and paying the driver. Greeting him and vaguely surprised to see him in this form of transport I asked him if he ever had any problems moving around the city. Not at all, he said, he happily used cabs and subways. ‘I just carry one of these,’ he said, and held up a Greek newspaper. People think: that’s David Bowie, surely? Then they see the Greek newspaper – no, can’t be, just some Greek guy who looks like him.”She may have since usurped this method with her suitcase shenanigans, but Swift’s original means of avoiding the paps was to walk so that she didn’t show her face to the cameras – either by moving backwards, or sideways like a crab.

CaroleB999It is becoming increasingly obvious that the whole decision should be passed back to the electorate. The argument from the likes of Jacob Rees-Mogg etc that “democracy has spoken” does not hold true. In June 2016 the people of this country were asked to sign a blank cheque after a campaign of lies and myths, “easy trade deals, 350 million for the NHS”. It has been proven over the past two wasted years Brexit is creating a crisis not seen since Suez and the second world war. Brexiteers are running scared of another vote, many young adults now have the vote, it is their future that is being played with. I should add I am 68 years old and a staunch remainer: the EU is not perfect but the alternative is much, much worse. kimorrisYou know what’s tragically hilarious about all of this? One of the reasons people want to leave the EU is because they believe the UK can negotiate stronger trade deals with the wider world than the EU can manage. How’s that looking, Leavers? We couldn’t even negotiate the orce settlement like professionals. Keith TaylorNo Deal looking very likely now. Bad times ahead, especially for the poorest and most vulnerable in society. The rich among us will feed like vultures on the financial chaos that ensues. Every food, health and welfare standard will get binned to obtain bad trade deals.

NTDRaab, like Davis and Johnson before him, is running off the stage so he doesn’t have to confront the consequences of his outrageous lies. Easiest deal in history? We hold all the cards?

It might spark a leadership contest too.May could ask the European council to extend article 50, giving her more time to come up with a deal that could be passed by parliament – at present, the UK will leave on 29 March 2019.Such a request would not necessarily be granted. Some EU governments are under pressure from populist parties to get the UK out of the EU as soon as possible.If Conservative MPs believe May is no longer fit for office, they could trigger a no-confidence vote.Members of the European Research Group claim that Graham Brady, the chair of the powerful 1922 Committee, will receive the necessary 48 letters this week.A vote could be held as soon as early next week.

She would then set an election date, which could be by the end of January.This is an unlikely option. May’s political credibility was severely damaged when she called a snap election in 2017, leading to the loss of the Conservative party’s majority.Alternatively, a general election could be called if a simple majority of MPs vote that they have no confidence in the government. Seven Tory MPs, or all of the DUP MPs, would have to turn against the government for it to lose the vote, triggering a two-week cooling-off period. May would remain in office while MPs negotiate a new government.Another route to a general election would be for the government to repeal or amend the Fixed-term Parliaments Act which creates a five-year period between general elections. A new act would have to be passed through both the Commons and the Lords – an unlikely scenario.May could decide it is impossible to find a possible draft deal that will be approved by parliament and go for a people’s vote.The meaningful vote could be amended to allow MPs to vote on whether the country holds a second referendum.

Of all British armed forces in United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland including all islands.” It is dated 18 February 1941. After ordering the cessation of all hostilities by British forces, it sets down further conditions, including “the British Command to carry out at once, without argument or comment, all further orders that will be issued by the German Command on any subject. Disobedience of orders, or failure to comply with them, will be regarded as a breach of these surrender terms and will be dealt with by the German Command in accordance with the laws and usages of war.”Written amid the anxieties of Britain’s early membership of the European Communities and published in 1978, Deighton’s thriller sets up two ideas that will become important in the rhetoric of Brexit. Since there is no sense that Deighton has a conscious anti-EU agenda, the idea seems to arise from a deeper structure of feeling in England. One is the fear of the Englishman turning into the “new European”, fitting himself into the structures of German domination. His central character is a harbinger of the “rootless cosmopolitan” who cannot be trusted to uphold English independence and English values, and who therefore functions as the enemy within, the quisling class of pro-Europeans. This is the treason of the elite, the puppet politicians and sleek mandarins who quickly accommodate themselves to the new regime.Deighton was building on real historical memories of the appeasers whose prewar conduct makes the notion that they would have quickly become collaborators in the event of a defeat to the Nazis highly credible. This idea of a treacherous elite would later ferment into a heady and intoxicating brew of suspicion that the Brexiteers would both dispense to the masses and consume themselves. (In 2014, the BBC announced plans for a five-part TV version, which was screened in 2017, shortly after Brexit.)The other crucial idea here is the vertiginous fall from “heart of Empire” to “occupied colony”. In the imperial imagination, there are only two states: dominant and submissive, coloniser and colonised. This dualism lingers. If England is not an imperial power, it must be the only other thing it can be: a colony. And, as Deighton successfully demonstrated, this logic can be founded in an alternative English history. The moment of greatest triumph – the defeat of the Nazis – can be reimagined as the moment of greatest humiliation – defeat by the Nazis. The pain of colonisation and defeat can, in the context of uneasy membership of the EU, be imaginatively appropriated. (Boris Johnson, in the  of 12 November, claimed that “we are on the verge of signing up for something even worse than the current constitutional position. These are the terms that might be enforced on a colony.”)SS-GB was in part the inspiration for an even more successful English thriller, Robert Harris’s multimillion-selling Fatherland, published in 1992 and filmed for television in 1994. Harris had begun the novel in the mid-1980s but abandoned it. He revived and finished it explicitly in the context of German reunification in 1990 and of fears that the enemy Britain had defeated twice in the 20th century would end the century by dominating it: “If,” Harris wrote in the introduction to the 20th anniversary edition in 2012, “there was one factor that suddenly gave my fantasy of a united Germany a harder edge, it was the news that exactly such an entity was unexpectedly returning to the heart of Europe.”In retrospect, German reunification is perhaps the greatest missed opportunity for the English finally to have done with the war. Had there been a capacity to generate new narratives of Europe, this could have been shaped as a moment of British vindication – the final working-out of the consequences of nazism. As Anthony Barnett puts it, “the triumph and relief of the unification of Germany could and should have belonged to us in Britain, as well as to Germany itself. It was the final liberation from nazism, the end of that country’s punishment, a time to welcome a great culture back into our arms.”Why, then, were there no photographs of Margaret Thatcher and Helmut Kohl holding hands at the Brandenburg Gate to match the pictures of Kohl and François Mitterrand at Verdun in 1984? Because Thatcher literally carried in her handbag maps showing German expansion under the Nazis. This was a mental cartography that English conservatism could not transcend – the map of a Europe that may no longer exist in reality, but within which its imagination remains imprisoned. “Europe,” Barnett writes, “moved on from the second world war and Britain didn’t.” One might go so far as to say that England never got over winning the war.In fact, Britain not only did not move on in 1990 – with the resurrection of a united Germany, it moved back. Harris is no anti-European reactionary and would become one of the most furious critics of Brexit. Yet, like Deighton, he was tapping into profound national anxieties.The real twist of the knife in Harris’s story is that the novel is set in Germany and the main characters are German. There is nothing of significance to say about England 20 years after its surrender. Except, that is, that is part of a European Union: “In the west, 12 nations – Portugal, Spain, France, Ireland, Great Britain, Belgium, Holland, Italy, Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland – had been corralled by Germany, under the Treaty of Rome, into a European trading bloc. German was the official second language in all schools. People drove German cars, listened to German radios, watched German televisions, worked in German-owned factories, moaned about the behaviour of German tourists in German-dominated holiday resorts, while German teams won every international sporting competition except cricket, which only the English played.”A dystopian fantasy this may be, but in the English reactionary imagination, dystopian fantasy was and is indistinguishable from reality. Rhetorically, it was commonplace among British anti-Europeans that the EU was a continuation in another, more insidious form, of previous attempts at domination from the continent. In 1989, for example, the Bruges Group of anti-European Tories heard Prof Kenneth Minogue of the London School of Economics tell them that “the European institutions were attempting to create a European Union, in the tradition of the mediaeval popes, Charlemagne, Napoleon, the Kaiser and Adolf Hitler”.The cover of that issue of the Spectator’s bore the headline “Speaking for England” – a conscious reference to one of the moments of high drama in September 1939 when Leo Amery in the House of Commons invited Labour’s Arthur Greenwood to “Speak for England!”, implying that the appeasing prime minister Neville Chamberlain did not do so.Ridley’s remarks were dismissed by Lutz Stavenhagen, minister of state in the German foreign office, as the sort of thing that might be heard “in the pub after a football match”. And Ridley himself had to resign. But these were not the mere rantings of a marginal crank. As Peter Jenkins wrote in the Independent at the time, “it is widely supposed that Mrs Thatcher’s heart is with him, if not her head … It is no secret that she, like him, fears that monetary and economic union in Europe will become the tool of German domination rather than the means of containing a united Germany. She too instinctively mistrusts the Germans and finds it impossible to forget the experiences of the second world war.”Thatcher had the Falklands war. It may have been a last hurrah for Britain’s imperial pretensions, but it functioned even better as a kind of epilogue to the great psychodrama of the second world war and a real-life version of the invasion thrillers. In her victory speech of July 1982, Thatcher was quite explicit in invoking the Falklands as a renaissance of the old wartime spirit, and victory as proof that Britain was no different then from what it had been during its Finest Hour. She chided those who believed that “we could never again be what we were”. The doubters “were wrong. The lesson of the Falklands is that Britain has not changed and that this nation still has those sterling qualities which shine through our history. This generation can match their fathers and grandfathers in ability, in courage, and in resolution. We have not changed. When the demands of war and the dangers to our own people call us to arms – then we British are as we have always been.”Yet even in this triumphal mode, Thatcher gave new life to the metaphors of retreat and invasion. “We have ceased to be a nation in retreat,” she said, implying that the nation had been precisely that for a long time. “Why,” she asked, “do we have to be invaded before we throw aside our selfish aims and begin to work together … ?”Within this question is a claim: “we” were invaded. The beauty of the Falklands conflict is that it played out the invasion fantasy of SS-GB – a fascist regime violating the sanctity of the homeland – but at a safe distance of almost 8,000 miles. The tiny population of the Falklands – 1,820 people in 1982 – served as a metaphor for the UK. “British people,” said Thatcher, “had to be threatened by foreign soldiers and British territory invaded and then – why then – the response was incomparable.” What had not happened in 1939–45 had finally happened in 1982.It helped that the tiny Falklands population that was serving this microcosmic function was almost entirely white – a “British people” that no longer existed – and that this “British territory” was an almost entirely rural landscape. The Falklands was a kind of make-believe England with no black and brown immigrants. Its pre-industrial terrain was a fantasy version of the post-industrial landscape that Thatcher herself was in fact creating at home in England, without the empty steel plants and rusting machines.It was not just war that was needed to reassure Britain that it had a meaningful collective existence, it was the idea of invasion and submission.There could be no release from the dark fantasies haunting the imagination of British conservatism, and there would continue to be a need for an imaginary invader and dominator. In 1990, while Germany was being reunified, there was very little depth to anti-German feeling in Britain – surveys at the time showed that most British people were in favour of German unity and trusted the Germans a lot or somewhat. The imagining of a German-dominated Europe through the evocation of Hitler was not an authentic popular prejudice against an old enemy. It was a way – albeit one that still seemed to have few real-world consequences – of thinking about the European Union itself, of summoning it into being as the ghastly ghost, not just of the Nazis, but of Nazis who had in reality won the war.The war imagery filled a hole. England had no deep imaginative commitment to the European project. As an idea, the EU had a distinctly weak grip on English allegiance. It was always understood by most people as a more or less grudging concession to reality, a matter for resigned acceptance rather than joyous embrace. The popular mood a year after Britain joined was nicely captured by an official at the Department of Trade and Industry, who likened the British public to “a crowd of holidaymakers who, after much doubt and expense, have made a dangerous journey only to find the climate chilly, the hotel not what it was cracked up to be and the food too expensive … bloodthirsty feelings are mounting, not only towards the other nationalities in the hotel but to the courier who got them there.”Yet a result that seemed both decisive and conclusive proved to be neither – Europe continued to poison British politics. And perhaps one of the reasons it did so is that, as the 1975 referendum campaign showed, there was a very deep underlying ision about the meaning of the second world war. The war was – and remains – crucial in structuring English feeling about the European Union. In 1975, many of the leading advocates on both sides were veterans, as were many voters. But instead of this common experience creating a common emotional ideal of Britain’s relationship to Europe, it fed two completely opposite stories, each very deeply felt.One of these stories was that the catastrophic experience of the first half of the 20th century carried two lessons that must never be forgotten: unrestrained nationalism led to war, and Britain could not stand aside from the fate of Europe. As the historian Robert Saunders has shown, the successful pro-European campaigners in 1975 were both highly explicit and highly emotive in making these connections. For them, “the emphasis was on the horror of war, which had devoured millions of lives in the prosecution of national rivalries. Britain in Europe used the poppy, the flower of remembrance, in its literature, while its logo was a dove of peace.” Pro-Europe posters said “Nationalism kills” and “No more Civil Wars”. Another, published for the anniversary of victory in Europe, directly evoked the joy of that triumph and sought to channel it into a sense that the common market was the great reward for victory: “On VE Day we celebrated the beginnings of peace. Vote Yes to make sure we keep it.” Another poster read simply: “Forty million people died in two European wars this century. Better lose a little sovereignty than a son or daughter.”These appeals worked for the majority of voters, but this very mention of sovereignty opened up, for a significant minority, a gaping wound. “For some,” wrote Saunders, “the surrender of national sovereignty to the EEC was a betrayal of all those who had fought and died ‘to deliver Europe from Nazi dictatorship’.” A woman from Bournemouth wrote to the anti-EEC Labour minister Barbara Castle that “I … did not fight and suffer a war for six years to be dictated to by the Germans.” “Hitler’s ghost,” wrote another of Castle’s correspondents, “must be shaking with laughter at Roy Jenkins, Hattersley \u0026amp the rest of the traitor crew.” Some, Saunders writes, “viewed the Community as a new power-grab by Germany, a country which ‘on two occasions … has failed to conquer the British militarily’”. For Castle’s correspondents, the notion “that the GERMANS love us any more today than they did in 1914 \u0026amp 1939” was dismissed with contempt. “The leopard does not easily change its spots.”What’s striking is that we can begin to see in this hysterical rhetoric the outlines of two notions that would become crucial to Brexit discourse. One is the comparison of pro-European Brits to quislings, collaborators, appeasers and traitors. The leave campaign in 1975 likened the treaty of accession to the Munich agreement of 1938, remembered as a shameful act of surrender to the Germans. Christopher Frere-Smith, who ran the Get Britain Out campaign, warned repeatedly that accession to the common market marked a “new Munich”, with Ted Heath and Roy Jenkins (who was leading the in campaign) playing the roles of Neville Chamberlain and his foreign secretary Lord Halifax. Voters were warned not be “fooled by the press bosses and the establishment politicians. They were wrong about Hitler and they’re wrong again.”But the other idea is the fever-dream of an English Resistance, and its weird corollary: a desire to have actually been invaded so that one could – gloriously – resist. And not just resist but, in the ultimate apotheosis of masochism, die. Part of the allure of romantic anti-imperial nationalism is martyrdom. The executed leaders of the Easter Rising in Dublin in 1916, for example, stand as resonant examples of the potency of the myth of blood sacrifice. But in the ironic reversal of zombie imperialism, the appropriation of the imagery of resistance to a former colonising power, this romance of martyrdom is mobilized as defiance of the EU.In his anguished complaint about the vitiating effects of membership of the common market in 1977, Enoch Powell lamented: “The breath which condemns submission to laws this nation has not made condemns submission to scales of value which this nation had not willed. To both sorts of submission I ascribe the haunting fear, which I am sure I am not alone in feeling, that we, the British, will soon have nothing left to die for. That was not a slip of the tongue. What a man lives for is what a man dies for, because every bit of living is a bit of dying. Patriotism is to have a nation to die for, and to be glad to die for it – all the days of one’s life.” This takes martyrdom to new levels of self-annihilating fantasy: death in the anti-EU resistance is not a fate or even an act. It is a daily pleasure.The anti-Europe campaign in 1975 very consciously evoked the language of wartime resistance. The Common Market Safeguards Campaign published a newspaper called Resistance News, and the group of MPs around the leading Tory leaver, Neil Marten, was known as the “R” Group – R for resistance. During the war, Marten had been dropped into both France and Norway to work with the resistance movements, so presumably his followers could think of themselves operating behind enemy lines in deepest Dorset. All of this is much more ’Allo, ’Allo! than Army of Shadows – tragedy played out the second time as farce. But, in what would become the camp sitcom of Brexit, that would not diminish its force.Europe’s role in this weird psychodrama is entirely pre-scripted. It does not greatly matter what the European Union is or what it is doing – its function in the plot is to be a more insidious form of nazism. This is important to grasp, because one of the key arguments in mainstream pro-Brexit political and journalistic discourse would be that Britain had to leave because the Europe it had joined was not the Europe it found itself part of in 2016. In Andrew Gilligan’s formulation on the 40th anniversary of British accession in the  in 2012, “the British people joined, and were happy to join, a common market. They did not sign up to a social chapter, a single currency or any moves down the road to a superstate.” Or as Boris Johnson put it in September 2017, the “post-imperial future” was “sold to the people purely as a common market, a way of maximising trade”. But “then came the gradual realisation that this was a very different agenda, an attempt not just at economic but political integration of a kind that the British people had never bargained for.” In itself, this is no more than usually mendacious – the truth being that “ever closer union” was always an explicit part of what the British signed up to in 1973 and voted for in 1975.What matters, though, is the way it misses the point. The idea of Europe as a soft-Nazi superstate was vividly present in 1975, even when the still-emerging EU had a much weaker, less evolved and less intrusive form. The imaginary existential struggle between the gallant English Resistance and the Euroreich was already being played out in one part of English consciousness. It was not a product of the ways in which the nine-member Common Market became the 28-member European Union. It was a product of England’s deeply ided and strangely unsettled relationship to the second world war and what it meant.Yet what brings these disparate modes together is the lure of self-pity, the weird need to dream England into a state of awful oppression. If we return to Nicholas Ridley’s rant, the striking thing is the way it wishes Britain back into wartime: “I’d rather have the shelters and the chance to fight back.” This suggests that what Britain was experiencing in the 1990s at the hands of the EU was actually worse than the war of 1939–45 in which it triumphed. And what could be worse than winning the war? Only losing it. Ridley’s conjuring of the EU as a “German racket designed to take over the whole of Europe” evokes a worse kind invasion than that in Deighton’s SS-GB: invasion by stealth. The suggestion is that a physical invasion by the Nazis would have been preferable to the membership of the EU which achieved the same ends by more cunning and dishonourable means. At least the Nazis could have been, in Churchill’s great and galvanic rhetoric, fought on the beaches, hills, fields and streets. They offered the “chance to fight back”.The new German invasion, cloaked in the guise of peaceful cooperation, is more damnable because it does not give the English Resistance a proper physical target. Hostility to the EU thus opens the way to a bizarre logic in which a Nazi invasion would have been, relatively speaking, welcome. This is a deeply strange kind of displacement – a victor learning to think like the vanquished. But it makes a kind of sense. On the one hand, as the white paper on entry to the common market emphasised in 1971, the experience of not being invaded was one of the genuinely distinctive things about being British: “Our physical assets and our economy had suffered less disastrously than those of other western European countries as a result of the war: nor did we suffer the shock of invasion. We were thus less immediately conscious of the need for us to become part of the unity in Europe.”Yet the paper went on to contrast the fate of Britain since the war with that of the six members of the existing common market, all of whom had been invaded: “The contrast between their experiences in recent years as members of the Communities, and ours outside, when our resources have not been growing sufficiently to do all we should like to do at home and abroad, suggests that they chose the right road … All the Community countries enjoyed rates of growth of gross national product (GNP) per head of population, or of private consumption per head, roughly twice as great as Britain’s.” It was not entirely ridiculous at some subliminal level to see these two things – being invaded and growing twice as fast as the country that wasn’t – as cause and effect. The “right road” to prosperity did not seem to lie through successful self-defence – on the contrary, invasion worked well for the six.Britain was genuinely in a topsy-turvy situation, the winner that had been surpassed by the losers. Why not draw a topsy-turvy conclusion: in a dark stratum of the reactionary mind, we must think of ourselves as a defeated nation? And if Britain was to be defeated, the EU must be its invasive oppressor. Must be, because there was no other possible candidate. The very absurdity of this notion was its strength. The paranoiac must at some stage ask himself: but why are they out to get me? Since there was no actual evidence of any western European hostility, the answer must lie in some deeply hidden motivation. How could they hate us when we saved them in the war? The proto-Brexiteers came up with a counter-factual truth that was at the same time highly satisfying: they hate us because we saved them.Since the English mood in relation to joining Europe was largely one of surrendering to necessity, it was not so hard to think of the act as surrender full stop. In the literary journal Encounter’s 1971 symposium on whether the UK should join the common market, for example, Sir William Hayter, warden of New College, Oxford, and former British ambassador to Moscow, looked back on his contribution to its debates almost a decade earlier: “in 1962 I wrote that ‘in a few years we shall have to make an unconditional surrender to get in’. I am afraid those few years have gone by, and now it is not even certain that an unconditional surrender will get us in.” Peter Shore MP, the most persistent Labour party critic of Europe, during the 1975 referendum took up this theme: “What the advocates of membership are saying … is that we are finished as a country that the long and famous story of the British nation and people has ended that we are now so weak and powerless that we must accept terms and conditions, penalties and limitations almost as though we had suffered defeat in a war.” It was a masochistic rhetoric that would return in full force as the Brexit negotiations failed to produce the promised miracles.This is an edited extract from Heroic Failures: Brexit and the Politics of Pain by Fintan O’Toole, published on 22 November by Head of Zeus, and available at bookshop• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5570d5326d01f64e62a67252e589bcf9cb8bd891/271_0_2930_1759/master/2930.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=57a730b70daf76c5d4400279522b9127","title":"ireland to remain open door to uk for eu citizens post brexit","story":"Withdrawal deal says UK will respect Irish EU membership and keep common travel areaIreland will remain an open door to the UK for EU citizens after Brexit with no mandatory passport checks on those who travel to Britain via Dublin and Belfast, it has been confirmed.After Brexit, EU citizens not already settled in the UK will be subject to immigration rules but will be able to travel to Britain via Ireland and Northern Ireland uninhibited.This is because the withdrawal deal states the UK will respect Ireland’s continued membership of the EU and its freedom of movement rules while at the same time keeping the common travel area (CTA), which has allowed British and Irish citizens to move freely between each others’ countries since 1922.This means EU citizens, who after Brexit will be classified as third-country immigrants in the UK, will be able to travel to Dublin and on to Belfast and take a domestic flight or ferry to Britain without passport checks.The revelation came as tensions over the future of Northern Ireland intensified, with the Democratic Unionist party MP Sammy Wilson claiming the withdrawal deal was a “punishment beating”.Ireland’s deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, criticised Wilson’s comments, saying: “That kind of language doesn’t help anyone and reminds us of a time we are moving away from.” Ireland has made a strategic decision to stay out of the fray over the Brexit deal, and Coveney told members of the Irish parliament it would be wrong to try to influence events in Westminster.The UK Home Office says the UK and Ireland will maintain a high level of cooperation on border security to ensure legitimate travel is facilitated while those who intend to abuse the arrangements are prevented from entering.However, it is far from the once-mooted scenario where Dublin border officials would have provided the British with details of immigration as a first filter to potential onward travel to Britain.Under the withdrawal agreement, family members of EU citizens will also be free to travel to Ireland unimpeded as part of the routine freedom of movement rules.Sources stress that simple freedom of travel does not equate to rights to jobs or social benefits, and point out that the UK would still have control over immigration through controls in the workplace and welfare regime.The Home Office said: “As is the case now, people will be able to enter the UK from Ireland without passing through a routine immigration control. However, they are nonetheless always required to meet the UK’s immigration requirements.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e10990665f465b444bb365177ab2d22cdc15586a/0_32_3311_1987/master/3311.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ea842218bb6b5bd984299e79a604dba","title":"john mcdonnell peoples vote labour brexit","story":"Labour government would prioritise negotiating new deal but public vote not ruled outJohn McDonnell has said a people’s vote remains on the table, but Labour would first prioritise negotiating a Brexit deal that protects jobs and the economy and fighting a general election.The shadow chancellor said the party would not back Theresa May’s deal and called for the prime minister to step aside for a minority Labour government to renegotiate a new deal. Speaking on Radio 4’s Today programme, McDonnell confirmed that Labour would first pursue negotiating a deal that respects the results of the referendum.He admitted a general election may not be easily available to Labour because of the constraints of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, which allows for an early general election if two-thirds of MPs vote in favour.He believes May does not have the votes to get her deal through parliament. He said: “What is absolutely certain is that the government’s proposal won’t command a majority in the House of Commons and we have to recognise that. There’s no use not facing that reality now.”He called for a new deal that had a close and collaborative relationship with the single market. But leaders of the European Union have already warned that negotiators have “exhausted the margin of manoeuvre” in the talks and the draft deal is “the best we can do”.McDonnell insisted there was still time and room for further negotiations. He said: “I think if anyone watched what happened in the Commons yesterday and gave themselves the breathing space to think through the options now will realise there has to be some movement, and in the past, yes we’ve met Michel Barnier and others, and actually we’ve found that if we can create the right atmosphere and relationship there can be negotiations which are constructive. I think everyone realises the dangers that there are over a no-deal Brexit both to the UK, but also for Europe itself.”McDonnell also warned a no-deal Brexit would be “catastrophic” for the UK economy.Labour’s Brexit spokesman has previously called on May to spell out a contingency plan to avoid a high-risk, no-deal Brexit.

Soaring use of food banks, increasingly visible homelessness and cuts to school budgets have widened concerns about the Conservative party’s fiscal strategy.After visiting towns and cities including London, Oxford, Cardiff, Newcastle, Glasgow and Belfast, Alston said that “obvious to anyone who opens their eyes to see the immense growth in food banks and the queues waiting outside them, the people sleeping rough in the streets, the growth of homelessness, the sense of deep despair that leads even the government to appoint a minister for suicide prevention and civil society to report in depth on unheard-of levels of loneliness and isolation.”He called for the elimination of the five-week delay in receiving benefits under the universal credit system, which has plunged many into destitution.Flaws in its design and implementation harmed claimants’ mental health, finances and work prospects, and benefits sanctions were “harsh and arbitrary”. Vulnerable claimants “struggled to survive”, he said.The ministers he met – including Esther McVey, who was the work and pensions secretary until Thursday, when she resigned over the Brexit deal – were almost entirely dismissive of criticisms of welfare changes and universal credit, he said. Instead they described critics as political saboteurs, or said they failed to understand how it worked.He highlighted the chancellor’s decision in this month’s budget to give a tax cut to the rich rather than using that money to alleviate poverty for millions, adding: “Austerity could easily have spared the poor, if the political will had existed to do so.”Alston said the government was in a state of denial and there was a “striking disconnect” between what ministers said and the testimonies he heard from ordinary people.“Even while devolved authorities in Scotland and Northern Ireland are frantically trying to devise ways to ‘mitigate’, or in other words counteract, at least the worst features of the government’s benefits policy, ministers insisted to me that all is well and running according to plan.”He said he had met people who didn’t have a safe place for their children to sleep, who had sold sex for money or shelter, young people who felt gangs were the only way out of destitution, and people with disabilities who were being told they needed to go back to work or lose support, against their doctors’ orders. He described how town hall budgets had been “gutted” in England resulting in a record sell-off of libraries and parks, and closures of youth centres.“I have also seen tremendous resilience, strength and generosity, with neighbours supporting one another, councils seeking creative solutions, and charities stepping in to fill holes in government services,” he said.On food banks, he said: “I was struck by how much their mobilisation resembled the sort of activity you might expect for a natural disaster or health epidemic.”A common theme of the testimonies he heard was the impact on people’s mental health and feelings of loneliness and fear.“I was surprised by the talk of suicide, by the people I met who said they had considered suicide … There are some pretty serious mental health dimensions.” In his conclusion, Alston called for “the legislative recognition of social rights” in the UK, a move that has long been resisted by UK governments but which is the status quo in countries such as Sweden and Germany."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ffe97371ed17ea692e1a908e11c6e00b4cc85e1/0_93_3030_1818/master/3030.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb0a41ad4ffde3d37d8b84181e8073af","title":"bold and brave root century puts england back in the driving seat sri lanka cricket","story":"A brave and brilliant century by Joe Root has given England the chance of a famous victory in a compelling Test match in Kandy. The England captain’s innings was brave not because he was ever in any physical danger – no pace bowler propelled a ball at him until the 55th over – but because the conception of this knock and the approach of the entire England lineup was so unusually bold and risky.They swept and they scurried and they swept again. Their first seven batsmen were all out sweeping, which can easily prompt old-timers to rail against the modern way. Thus they risked severe censure from the wise men in the boxes if their strategy failed abysmally. It did not. They have scored 324 for nine on what is regarded as a Bunsen burner, seldom seen in England (except at Ciderabad).In the 20th century the sweep was often the stroke of the last resort here on a pitch that still offered prodigious turn, though seemingly more slowly, it became the first port of call for just about every English batsman. Had the lineup failed then everyone from Root and Trevor Bayliss would have been castigated. Both have been brave enough to accept that possibility and to carry on regardless.And the brilliance? Well, this simply relates to the execution of the plans, primarily by Root, but with important contributions from Rory Burns, Jos Buttler and Ben Foakes. Root swept with such amazing precision and power. Somehow he seemed to be hitting the ball with a hint of top spin as it sped away to deep mid-wicket or square leg – or to deep backward point when he employed the reverse sweep with equal facility. Of course there were other strokes: occasionally a forward defensive or a straight drive and there were two perfectly struck sixes despite several boundary fielders, one to mid-wicket off Dilruwan Perera, another gun-barrel straight off Akila Dananjaya.This was Root’s 15th Test century, which puts him alongside Jack Hobbs who had 102 innings for England and Alec Stewart (235) on the list of centurions – this was Root’s 140th knock in Test cricket. Among England cricketers in this century only Kevin Pietersen – in Mumbai and Colombo in 2012 – has played innings of such stunning audacity in Asia in a situation where the match is in the balance.Any suggestions that the captaincy sits heavily upon Root’s shoulders – and there have been plenty of those – can be shelved for a while. On this tour in particular Root has seemed more relaxed and authoritative in his leadership role. Along with his coach they have been guided by the principle of “when in doubt take the aggressive option” and they have stuck to it. This mantra may lead to a series victory it has certainly provided some mesmerising cricket.The Sri Lankans were only allowed to bowl two maidens in the day and one of those was in Perera’s opening over at the start of proceedings. Burns delivered his highest and best innings for England so far (59) and it feels like there could be many more. After the early departure of Leach he personified the determination to attack. He judged the length of the spinners adeptly and this allowed him to cut (and sweep, of course) with remarkable freedom – and daring. He set the pattern as England scored 87 runs in the first hour.Keaton Jennings was caught at slip, reverse sweeping for 26, and then both Burns, for 59, and Stokes, for a second ball duck, were lbw playing that shot. It became significant that both Burns and Stokes opted to review their dismissals to no avail since both Moeen Ali and Adil Rashid were later victims of incorrect decisions, which they were unable to send to the third umpire.Next Buttler added 74 with Root and as the partnership developed it was England’s captain who played the more dashing strokes. Buttler made 34 but such was the ease of his timing he promised more he is tormenting the Sri Lankan spinners but not for long enough. Moeen slog swept his second ball for six before becoming another lbw victim, but once again Foakes displayed a calm head and a sure technique. He was there for a celebratory embrace when Root glided a rare delivery from Suranga Lakmal down to the third man boundary to reach his century.Eventually after adding 82 with the admirable Foakes, the captain was the seventh man to fall sweeping, against Dananjaya. The pattern was broken when both Sam Curran, out first ball, and Rashid were dismissed playing backward defensive strokes – though Rashid, given lbw, had touched the ball with his bat.Now Foakes, alongside Anderson sped to his half-century with a six, the last shot of the day. Suddenly from the leafy hills beyond came a thunderstorm of considerable velocity. By then England led by 278 runs. On the first day we would have concluded that this was more than enough. We are not so sure now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/527e0a5f5ad2423a0a1027779b940132046e2bd2/148_135_4745_2847/master/4745.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d592dcdf405dc15ae4163ec0d6bb49e","title":"joe schmidt ireland all blacks worlds top two rugby union","story":"It is not every day that Ireland are a good bet to beat the All Blacks. Not just any old bunch of silver ferns, either, but a team unbeaten in Tests on European soil since 2012 and still the world’s No 1 side. New Zealand are knocked from their rankings perch about as often as Steve Hansen fancies doing Strictly Come Dancing.Ireland, though, are increasingly sure-footed on the game’s biggest stages. At home they have not lost in their last 10 Tests, dating back to New Zealand’s contentious 21-9 victory two years ago. Under Joe Schmidt they now march to a different tune to previous Irish squads. The 40-29 victory over the All Blacks in Chicago in 2016 will always be celebrated but their ambitions remain far from satisfied.As current Six Nations grand slam champions and the world’s second-best team, the chance to take another giant leap beneath the Dublin floodlights now presents itself. New Zealand cannot yet be overhauled in the rankings but they can be undermined psychologically. Hansen’s men, by their own high standards, have wobbled slightly of late and should probably have lost three of their tricky quartet of recent Tests against South Africa (twice), Australia and England. Had England not let a 15-0 first-half lead slip at Twickenham, this week’s mood music would have been appreciably darker.Ireland, either way, have shed any last vestige of an inferiority complex. Schmidt’s attention to detail is legendary and none of his players will take the field unsure of their roles. There is more than a dash of steely Kiwi in them nowadays they will have pored over the England video and concluded New Zealand can be made to look as mortal as anyone. Ireland will seek to play as Eddie Jones’s side did in the first half-hour last Saturday: quick, brusque, direct, hard-nosed, relentless.Motivation will not be a problem, with the heavy-duty, painfully physical 21-9 loss to the same opponents at the Aviva Stadium in this corresponding fixture two years ago still the subject of much debate. A number of incidents that day would now earn instant red cards and Ireland, while obliged to keep it legal, will be physically braced this time. “Spiky” is the word Schmidt has been using: it will be that and more.All of which makes for the year’s most compelling 80 minutes – “You can’t say it’s just another game,” murmured Johnny Sexton this week – with no shortage of riveting plotlines. The last time Sexton encountered Beauden Barrett during the drawn 2017 Lions series, it was the former who enjoyed the last laugh. Brodie Retallick and Sam Whitelock may be packing down as a starting duo for a record 50th time in New Zealand’s boiler room but eclipsing the 6ft 10in Devin Toner will be tough. And then there is Schmidt, the brains behind it all. An Ireland win could just see the 53-year-old succeed Hansen as All Black coach from 2020 onwards, which would be more than a touch ironic.What a springboard, too, it would give Ireland heading into next year’s World Cup in Japan. Not unlike England in 2003, a compelling victory over New Zealand en route to the tournament would validate everything they are doing and send a message around the rugby world. If they do it, moreover, without Conor Murray, their scrum-half totem, and another absent Lion, the flanker Sean O’Brien, it will be all the more striking.They cannot assume, however, that the visitors will do the job for them. New Zealand, in particular, still boast Retallick, the scourge of England. Neither he nor Whitelock were involved in Chicago and both will be central on Saturday. Disrupt Ireland in the lineout and you cut out their heart and lungs: Retallick is the forward the All Blacks would least like to see dropping to one knee in the opening moments.Ireland will also be anxious to get to Aaron Smith, about to win his 82nd cap, and limit Damian McKenzie’s exhilarating footwork to his own 22. Mostly, though, they will be concentrating on building pressure, looking after the ball and then striking, when the moment comes, to maximum effect. As Hansen observed this week: “They’ll find a weakness and they’ll punish you. He’s pretty good, Joe, at finding a trick or two so we’ll be expecting one or two.”Kiwis of a certain age already know what it is like to lose a Test in Dublin. It almost feels like rugby’s old testament now but New Zealand’s defeat to Australia in the 1991 World Cup semi-final at the old Lansdowne Road still echoes down the years. It was David Campese’s finest hour: the no-look pass over his shoulder to Tim Horan, the diagonal dagger finish in the left corner. The modern All Blacks will not have to counter Campo’s genius but, as with that fine Wallaby side, Ireland have sufficient wit to make life hugely difficult.Will it, ultimately, be enough? New Zealand, if the sky does fall in on them, can hardly say they were not warned. Only Ryan Crotty’s last-gasp try saved them in Dublin in 2013, since when Ireland have unearthed a golden generation of players – James Ryan, Tadhg Furlong, Garry Ringrose, Jacob Stockdale – far more accustomed to winning than losing.New Zealand also look less settled in certain pivotal positions and Ireland’s defence coach Andy Farrell has a proven knack of throttling All Black ambition in big games like this. Ireland have won five and lost five when this weekend’s referee, Wayne Barnes, has previously been in charge but shaking hands with a northern hemisphere referee on a mild November afternoon in Dublin will add to New Zealand’s faint stirrings of unease.IrelandR Kearney K Earls, G Ringrose, B Aki, J Stockdale J Sexton, K Marmion C Healy, R Best (capt), T Furlong, D Toner, J Ryan, P O’Mahony, J van der Flier, CJ Stander.\u0026nbspReplacements\u0026nbspS Cronin, J McGrath, A Porter, I Henderson, J Murphy, L McGrath, J Carbery, J Larmour.Schmidt, either way, insists he will be delighted with “any old win against the All Blacks … I’ll take 3-0.” The drier conditions, in truth, will probably require his side to score upwards of 25 points, with the quick feet of Joey Carbery and Jordan Larmour potentially useful later. If Sexton stays on for an hour at least and Ireland can retain 15 players on the field, a famous home triumph is a real possibility. If, alternatively, New Zealand find a relieving Irish backstop under screeching pressure, the world champions will feel they can cope with anything in Japan next year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ece7c74c106e7e15adf383dcb95e23a67b74f0f3/255_500_3529_2118/master/3529.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c3f1f0752ab1e4d4a3382cbe898597d","title":"tommy fleetwood francesco molinari race to dubai world tour championship","story":"Perhaps a Race to Dubai will break out after all. Francesco Molinari’s advantage, of more than €1m over Tommy Fleetwood with just one event of the European Tour season to go, had looked unassailable until Friday. For Fleetwood, the equation is simple he must win the DP World Tour Championship and hope his close friend finishes worse than a two-way tie for fifth.That Fleetwood is firmly of a mind to deliver his side of the bargain was illustrated during the second round. A 67 left him within three of the 11 under par lead held by Matt Wallace as Molinari, pertinently, slipped to a 73. The Open champion is eight adrift of Wallace at halfway and in share of 27th. The order of merit trophy engraver should hold fire the chaser has gained potentially crucial momentum.“Every shot seems very important,” said Fleetwood. “It’s just a completely different feeling to any other week of the year. All your senses are a little bit heightened and every shot means that little bit more because it all comes down to this. From a tournament perspective, 72 holes is a long time but it’s a very short period of time that we’ve got left now in the grand scheme of the year.”Molinari’s trouble arrived on the closing six holes, which he played in three over. This was curiously scrappy from the typically unflappable Italian.Rory McIlroy’s positive Dubai touch continued courtesy of a 67. He therefore joins Fleetwood on eight under. Patrick Reed, who partnered McIlroy on day two, signed for a 66 to move to minus nine. McIlroy has a habit of bringing out the best in the Masters champion.“It’s something that I’ve always wanted, to be a worldwide player,” Reed said. “To come overseas and to win an event here would mean a lot. I haven’t won overseas yet. To win the finale would definitely make Christmas a lot better.”Henrik Stenson, who has enjoyed plentiful success in Dubai before, may yet end a troubled 2018 with a smile. The Swede, who was troubled by a tendon injury in his left elbow throughout the key part of this season, underwent minor surgery after playing his part in Europe’s Ryder Cup victory in France. After a 66, which moved him to minus seven in total, Stenson revealed the full extent of his fitness woe.“It put me behind the eight ball because I couldn’t prepare properly for the Open,” said Stenson. “I went there and played but was in agony, it was a rough week.“There was no way I was going to miss Paris if I had the opportunity to go. It’s something you dream about and it was nothing short of that when we got there. Those were memories for a lifetime. I played on anti-inflammatories, it was pretty uncomfortable in the mornings and during early practice rounds. But when you are playing in a Ryder Cup, you can cope with a little bit of pain and push through.”Stenson confirmed he and his long-time caddie Gareth Lord have “taken a break” with Scott Vail, previously on the bag of Brandt Snedeker, on duty here. Stenson and Lord combined to win multiple events, including the FedEx Cup and Open.“We are good friends, we have had an amazing run, we have been together for almost six years,” Stenson said. “We didn’t feel we were as good together as we were in the past. We lost the golden touch a little bit and felt it might be good to do something different.“We talked about it, we both wanted to go to the Ryder Cup. This was going to be our last event but I was injured and not sure if I could make it back and Gareth has had a shoulder problem for two years. We both had to go into the repair shop, he has just had shoulder surgery and will be out for a couple of months anyway.“We decided to take a little bit of a break, we are great friends and there are no bridges burnt. We might be back out there together in the future. Scott and Gareth are good friends as well so we are keeping it in the same circle.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94320aac20a4e8e10219c6775e58381ad9ccad4c/0_246_4602_2761/master/4602.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a5c88de1daaacd898e1dd55327866a0","title":"magnus carlsen v fabiano caruana world chess championship game 6 live","story":"Bryan will be here shortly. In the meantime here’s his report of yesterday’s Game 5, where Carlsen weathered an early surprise by the challenger before the sides played to a 34-move draw.Magnus Carlsen and Fabiano Caruana played to a fifth draw in as many games on Thursday in the latest episode of their world championship showdown in London, as the Norwegian champion adroitly weathered early fireworks to negotiate a peaceful result after 34 moves and three-and-a-quarter hours.Caruana, playing with the white pieces, led with a Rossolimo (1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 g6), marking the third time in a week the players opened with the Sicilian variation. The American was first to deviate with 4. O-O, then prompted gasps with 6. b4!?, a highly aggressive move offering a pawn sacrifice with the hope of creating pressure and confusion and, ideally, winning chances in the long term.The challenger settled into a comfortable position, but Carlsen was able to escape from immediate danger shortly after (10. Bxa1 d6 11. bxc5 Ne7 12. Qe2 b4 13. Qc4).

But the promotions planned between now and Christmas will be key to the fortunes of retail chains that make the bulk of their profits at this time of year.“We have seen more clothing retailers participating in the event each year and while a number of big names such as Marks \u0026amp Spencer are not participating, online stores such as Asos, boohoo and Gymshark are encouraging consumers to move online to get a discount.”When Black Friday arrived in the UK five years ago, the promise of a bargain led to scuffles as shoppers scrambled to pick up deals. But in recent years the event has become more sedate as shoppers surf the internet from their sofa to find the best deals, particularly on coveted home appliances and personal gadgetry such as smartphones and fitness trackers.A number of chains, including M\u0026ampS, have turned their back on Black Friday as it puts pressure on them to cut prices at what should be the industry’s most profitable time.Amazon is billing this year’s wave of promotions as its “biggest ever Black Friday sale” with tens of thousands of “lightning deals” that offer bargains in limited quantities. The biggest reductions include a 55in Philips 4K Ultra HD TV for £1,199 – a £300 discount – and more than £100 off DeLonghi coffee machines.In previous years shoppers have sat on their hands in October and splashed out in the Black Friday sales. This trend showed up in the monthly ONS figures with retail sales falling last month as shoppers kept a tight rein on spending amid the growing Brexit uncertainty.“It highlights how Black Friday is encouraging shoppers to hold back buying full-price items and heavily impacting retailer sales in the weeks prior to the event,” said Mills."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ff8bba8c500347faf78fbf9dbde2c72a31597c0/0_307_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14e4bc68f35fbeb2e4d31a87677e7670","title":"share your caribbean highlights for the chance to win a 200 hotel voucher","story":"Send us a tip on affordable experiences in the Caribbean, be they places to stay, activities and attractions, or bars and restaurantsPalm-fringed beaches, rum punch and infectious reggae beats … Carnivals, rainforest and a laid-back vibe … The Caribbean is one of the world’s most alluring holiday destinations, and we want to hear your highlights – especially for those not on an A-lister budget.

New members of Congress are posing for photos on Capitol Hill in Washington. Yet the Sunshine state is still counting votes in the knife-edge US Senate race between the Republican Rick Scott and the Democrat Bill Nelson.He should know. Shrum was a senior adviser to Al Gore in the 2000 presidential election, which all came down to Florida. Katherine Harris, the Florida secretary of state and co-chair of George W Bush’s statewide campaign, announced that he had won the state - and with it the presidency. At first Gore, phoned Bush to concede but, as the margin tightened, he called back to withdraw his concession.Democrats pushed for a recount Republicans resisted. Armies of lawyers flew in from both sides. For five weeks they wrangled over how the ballot papers had been designed. There was the question of what voters intended with punch-card ballots when they only detached a portion of the perforated paper (“hanging chads”) or merely dented instead of removing the punch-out (“dimpled chads”).Another mystery surrounded why people in Democratic strongholds voted for the third party candidate Pat Buchanan, a conservative Christian, rather than Gore. Shrum recalled: “As Buchanan said to me, ‘There were not thousands of Jewish Democrats on the gold coast wanting to vote for me.’”Ron Klein, who was co-chair of the Gore campaign in Florida, elaborated: “The biggest paradox of the whole thing was these large Jewish areas. One of them is called Century Village in Boca Raton: 10,000 older people, call them Roosevelt New Deal Democrats. Pat Buchanan was sort of some version of Donald Trump at an earlier stage.Klein, now a lawyer based in Fort Lauderdale, and colleagues spent weeks camping out at the Broward county election supervisor office. Also on the scene was the self-declared “dirty trickster” Roger Stone, who claims he was one of the organisers of the so-called “Brooks Brothers riot” during the recount, which saw Republican activists chanting outside a meeting of election canvassers. Stone would return with a vengeance to help Donald Trump win Florida and the presidency in 2016.Democrats sued to force a recount in a few counties where they thought it would help them overturn Bush’s narrow margin. The battle went all the way to the supreme court which, in a 5-4 vote, ruled that no alternative method of recount could be established in a timely manner. In effect, this put Bush in the White House.Sidney Blumenthal, an aide to Bill Clinton who was working with Gore’s team, said: “The Republicans didn’t play fair in terms of intimidating vote counters. The Bush v Gore supreme court decision will live in infamy as one of the most twisted decisions ever handed down. There’s no question in my mind that the election was stolen in 2000 with enormous consequences. There’s no telling how different our history would have been.”The alternative timeline remains dizzying: would a President Gore have prevented the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks, not invaded Iraq and prevented the global financial crisis? What would that have meant for Barack Obama and Donald Trump?The Broward and Palm Beach county election supervisors, Brenda Snipes and Susan Bucher, have attracted widespread opprobrium for their handling of the midterms. Snipes completed a recount on Thursday but submitted it to the state two minutes late, meaning that several days of painstaking work went up in smoke. Bucher admitted she was in “prayer mode” during the recount and blamed overheating machines for missing the deadline.Florida has 67 counties with 67 election supervisors, each using his or her own methods. Wilson said: “There’s not a unified system of tabulation. It’s all a crap shoot. There are 67 counties, with probably two-thirds of them not running the same equipment. They all have different standards for their ballots. It’s all unavoidable.”He added with frustration: “I would love for us since 2000 to have got our shit together. One of the reasons it bothers me is we are a state with enormous resources and our elections are always close.”But Florida is always under special scrutiny, its problems magnified. One reason is that it is the third most populous state in the nation and far more electorally competitive than the top two, California and Texas. Troubles in overwhelmingly Democratic or Republican states do not get any attention because they do not change statewide outcomes. The Associated Press observed: “Ballots got wet and couldn’t be read last week in New York City. In Utah, some counties didn’t have enough machines, causing hours-long lines. Google any state and ‘voting problem’ and chances are you will find something.”But Florida is a victim of its own importance. Save for 1992, it has voted with the winner in every presidential election since 1964. It is therefore the natural stage for nationwide battles to play out – and could be again in 2020, when Trump’s evidence-free claims of vote rigging could wreak further damage.David Becker, executive director and founder of the Center for Election Innovation \u0026amp Research, said: “Florida is as close to a 50-50 state as we have, or perhaps have ever had, in the United States.”Becker has been involved in Florida elections for two decades and said much has changed since 2000. “The only thing deja vu is that the state-wide margin is razor thin. We don’t have hanging chads because the technology has been improved. You can imagine how difficult it would have been if hanging chads had been thrown into this. Management and supervision has got much, much better over time. There have been significant improvements.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38235d689265870214e38cdccf23651bae3bfeed/75_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c6660810234a85d06fd9a21a365c1d2","title":"silvio santos sbt owner claudia leitte","story":"Viewers demand Silvio Santos be removed after telling Claudia Leitte he couldn’t hug her because it would make him ‘excited’He is one of South America’s most powerful TV tycoons, an 87-year-old media mogul who has for decades been a fixture on Brazilian screens.But many viewers are now demanding that Silvio Santos, the celebrity owner of Brazil’s SBT network, be pulled off the air after he made the latest in a series of improper and offensive remarks to a guest.During an telethon benefiting disabled children last weekend, Santos told Claudia Leitte, one of Brazil’s most famous singers, that he couldn’t hug her because it would make him “excited”.“The way you are dressed it makes me want to get up out of my seat, have a few beers and then … seek comfort,” he smirked, prompting uneasy laughter from the studio audience and a grimace from the singer.Santos has a reputation for his infelicitous and vulgar remarks: he once declined to dance with Brazilian pop star Anitta because, he said, it would arouse him he told a woman from a troupe of plus size dancers she was pretty despite being its only black member and asked a small child if she preferred sex, money or power – all on live television.Two days after the programme aired, Leitte challenged Santos in a Facebook post. “We see an example of what happens with many women every day, in many places. This is rampant, cruel painful and scary,” she wrote. “We are the victims.”Coming after last month’s election victory of far-right president-elect Jair Bolsonaro, the storm has exposed some of Brazil’s social faultlines.Conservatives – including the president-elect – say they want to return to a more “traditional” past, but Bolsonaro’s rise has prompted an outspoken reaction from Brazilians who despair at his sexist and authoritarian attitudes.Many see Santos as part of the same macho mindset.“Silvio Santos represents a patriarchal culture, a sexist culture,” said Jacqueline Pitanguy, a sociologist and director of human rights, non-profit group CEPIA. “It is clearly a case of sexual harassment.”Video of the incident clearly shows Leitte’s discomfort when Santos said: “You are no longer a pretty little blonde. Now you are a sexy, provocative woman.” “What we saw on TV was a pathetic scene of a woman being embarrassed,” said Regina Navarro Lins, a TV psychologist and writer. “How long will women have to put up with this?”In an Instagram post, the actor Bruna Marquezine said: “When a presenter assaults a singer on national network, we can see how violence is normalized in our society. It’s become so normal we don’t know now how to react. Shame, fear of retaliation and exposure paralyze us. But you have to remember: THIS IS NOT NORMAL.”Bolsonaro has not commented on the incident, but later phoned into the telethon, telling a delighted Santos he was a fan.Many viewers supported a national icon they said was doing his job as an entertainer. Santos’s daughter, Daniela Beyruti, defended her “super father” on Instagram, saying she missed old-style TV, with “lots of joking and little embarrassment”.A spokeswoman for SBT said neither the channel nor Santos would comment.Santos started out as a street vendor, launched the Silvio Santos Programme in 1963, selling products via competitions, and set up his SBT network during Brazil’s military regime.Days before the telethon, SBT screened patriotic interludes of postcard Brazil images, one of which bore the slogan “Brazil, love it or leave it” – a phrase used during the dark days of the military dictatorship Bolsonaro has praised. The interludes were removed after complaints.“I thought this was shocking,” said Maurício Stycer, a TV critic who has written a Santos biography. “He needs to get up to date.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ac99a954aaae871ffd25d23602eabe77da39d5d/0_238_6708_4025/master/6708.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c6623a2cafd5b37f89cde9b938e47cd","title":"maoi easter island statue british museum talks return","story":"Delegation from island, backed by Chilean government, will ask for return of statue British Museum acquired in 1869Towering at the entrance of the British Museum’s Wellcome gallery is a 2.5-metre basalt statue from Easter Island. For indigenous Rapa Nui islanders, such statues – known as moai – carry the spirit of prominent ancestors and are considered the living incarnation of their relatives.Next week, a delegation from the island – which has been part of Chile since 1888 and is officially known as Rapa Nui – will travel to London to request the moai’s return, emboldened by the backing of the Chilean government and the museum’s willingness to engage in talks for the first time since it acquired the statue in 1869.Having spent 150 years away from its home, the statue – known as Hoa Hakananai’a –has become the focal point of a movement to return the moai which has steadily gathered momentum since August, when the island’s mayor, Pedro Edmunds, wrote to the museum requesting the statue’s return. Among the proposals the delegation will bring to the table is the idea of a replica statue being carved by artisans on the island to take the place of Hoa Hakananai’a.Chile’s indigenous development agency, Conadi – which oversees the government’s relations with the country’s nine indigenous ethnicities including the Rapa Nui – is helping to fund the delegation’s visit. The group will be led by the country’s minister for national property, Felipe Ward.“The Rapa Nui people want to explain to the museum’s administrators that the moai is the living soul of the island. Hoa Hakananai’a acts as their ambassador and we want that to remain the case – but we want to exchange him for a moai that will be sculpted by craftsmen on the island so that the representative is there voluntarily. This is very important,” said Ward.The British Museum’s press office said that they were looking forward to the delegation’s visit and “discussing any future proposals they have”.Under the command of English navigator Commodore Richard Powell, the crew of HMS Topaze removed Hoa Hakananai’a from a clifftop in 1868, along with a second, smaller statue known as Hava.Powell gave them to Queen Victoria when the ship returned to England the following year, and the monarch donated them to the British Museum.When the island became part of Chile in 1888, the state assumed sovereign rights over the territory as well as the moai that dot the island’s windswept grassland. Under Chilean law, the moai are not considered objects but an integral part of the land.According to Jo Anne Van Tilburg, an archaeologist who leads the Easter Island Statue Project and has devoted her career to the island’s renowned monoliths, the object is one of the finest examples of a moai.“Hoa Hakananai’a is a superb example of the Rapa Nui statue carver’s art. It is carved of a basaltic stone, unfinished but embellished with a suite of bas-relief petroglyphs – thus it is unique,” she said.Although the museum is governed by a strict charter that dictates the circumstances under which objects can leave its collection, Manutomatoma said the Rapa Nui are encouraged by its openness to enter into dialogue.However, she is not content with just repatriating the statues in the British Museum’s collection, given that all of the moai are of equal cultural and spiritual importance to the Rapa Nui. “To recover Hoa Hakananai’a would be great, but with time we will be asking the other countries to return our ancestors,” she said.Museums in a number of other countries, including France, New Zealand and the United States, have moai."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Dead man was in his 50s and had returned to his Leixlip home from Ireland football matchMr Justice Peter Kelly warns of reliance on UK facilities for wards of court ahead of BrexitProf Terry Hughes is jointly awarded John Maddox Prize for bringing public attention to coral bleaching through Australian researchKashimbo Musonda was dismissed from her post at Waterford University Hospital in 2017Musician, showband singer and National Song Contest entrant died aged 86Clive Staunton (50) was gunned down outside his home on Thursday nightPivotal moment in history of Northern IrelandMen in their 30s had been held in Killarney and Tralee Garda stationsBarnardos, Inclusion Ireland and Irish Traveller Movement slate State-wide trendVested interests \u0026lsquohell-bent\u0026rsquo on maintaining political influence, claims Shane RossPlacing pupils on reduced timetable without consent considered \u0026lsquoa form of suspension\u0026rsquoConcern in Dublin for May\u0026rsquos prospects as ministers resign and MPs move to oust herChief of Staff says he has \u0026lsquounique\u0026rsquo perspective to give Pay CommissionDublin Midlands Hospital Group working with HSE after \u0026lsquoisolated\u0026rsquo incidentBusiness leaders in Belfast tell Karen Bradley \u0026lsquoany deal is better than no deal\u0026rsquoPatients\u0026rsquo daycare payments, covering the cost of a meal and transport, stolenKashimbo Musonda was dismissed from her post at Waterford University Hospital in 2017Desmond Duffy said he \u0026lsquocovered up\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquodenied\u0026rsquo abusive relationship with Desmond Sullivan"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3698954.1542364198!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"remembering derry s momentous civil rights march 50 years later","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t1968: Front row - Willie Breslin, Dermie McClenaghan, Johnny White, Fionnbarra Ó Dochartaigh, Michael Canavan, Billy Kelsall, Ivan Cooper, John Hume, James Doherty, John Patton, Claude Wilton, Brendan Hinds. Aidan McKinney is in the third row, directly behind Dermie McClenaghan Terry Doherty’s hair is visible but his face is obscured behind Michael Canavan. Photograph: Larry DohertyOn a bright, cold Sunday morning, six men line up in the middle of Derry’s Craigavon Bridge.The moment – captured by Derry Journal photographer Larry Doherty – would become one of the iconic images of the civil rights era.Like many of those in the photograph, Michael Canavan keeps a framed copy hanging at home. Today, he has brought it with him, and as he and the other former marchers prepare to re-enact the famous picture for The  they crowd around it, recalling memories of the day and pointing out absent friends.“When I look at that photo, I’m remembering the people who aren’t here,” says Dermie McClenaghan.Chief among them is John Hume, who is too unwell to participate in total, 10 remain of those, eight are still resident in Derry, and only six – McClenaghan and Canavan, as well as Ivan Cooper, Fionnbarra Ó Dochartaigh, Terry Doherty and Aidan McKinney – are in sufficient health to return.Cooper, now in a wheelchair, was determined to attend. “I go to church on a Sunday morning,” he says, “but I couldn’t miss this.”Held on November 16th, 1968, the march was the city’s response to a much smaller protest a month earlier. That previous demonstration, on October 5th, had made world headlines when the marchers were attacked by the RUC and drenched with water cannons on nearby Duke Street. Among those present was Ó Dochartaigh: “We knew deep down we wanted change, and we weren’t going to wait another generation.”The Derry Citizens’ Action Committee (DCAC) was established Cooper was chairman, Hume vice-chairman. Fifty years on, the sense of history – and of occasion – is palpable among its surviving members as they introduce friends and family to their former comrades.McClenaghan has brought along his wife and Doherty his son and granddaughters, visiting from Italy photographer Larry Doherty’s daughters Dara and Moira have come to watch their father’s photograph re-enacted.It has been made possible by event controller Billy Scampton – well used to stewarding events for Derry City FC – and his police contacts at Strand Road in Derry, who have willingly agreed to halt the traffic at either end of the bridge while the picture is taken.The irony is not lost on those present. McKinney shakes his head, a wry smile on his face. “I can’t get over the fact that it was the police who attacked us on October 5th, and 50 years on they’re closing the bridge for us.”As the six make their way onto the middle of the bridge and take up their places, McKinney recalls the “enormous tension” before the march. “The expectation was that there would be a large number of people and that the police would stop it.”“We were scared,” says Canavan. “I remember the fear.”The leadership lined up at the front of the march, with substitutes ready and waiting behind them. “The idea was that everybody had a second and even a third,” explains Terry Doherty. “That’s why in the picture we’re lined up in rows behind them, so that if the front row got arrested the second row could just take their place.”Doherty was to stand in for Paddy “Bogside” Doherty, who had taken charge of the marchers behind them.“I was supposed to be going back and forth to tell Paddy Bogside what was happening,” says Doherty. “We had 20,000 people behind us all wanting to go somewhere, and he was standing on top of a car keeping everyone calm.”As the head of the march crossed the bridge, the photograph was taken. Ahead of them – just out of shot – was the police barricade.Canavan, McClenaghan and others “broke” the barricade. “I remember going over it and I actually fell over and I was picked up by a cop,” remembers McClenaghan.The barricade was more symbolic than practical, says Ó Dochartaigh. In the event, the marchers were able to simply walk around it, a solution which McKinney believes suited the police. “The numbers defied them, and they had been told not to challenge the march. People were able to just walk the barrier.”“I remember I found this staircase down from the bridge, and I told everyone to get to the Diamond by whatever route they could,” adds Canavan.Situated inside the city walls, the Diamond was both the geographic centre of the city and, to unionists, its symbolic heart its breaching, by the marchers, was equally significant. “We had 20,000 people in the Diamond, inside the walled city,” says Canavan.“It was just a moment in time,” says McKinney. “The mass impetus of such a massive number of people, you knew things were never going to be the same again.”He was right. Within a week, Northern Ireland’s prime minister Terence O’Neill would announce a programme of reforms which conceded a number of the demands of the civil rights movement, including the introduction of a points system for the allocation of housing, an end to discrimination in employment and a review of the voting system.As Canavan would later write in his report on the DCAC’s activities: “October 5th is but six short weeks ago and on Saturday last those few in number had become thousands strong and the might that humbled them lay outmanoeuvred, defeated and disgraced before the world.”The reforms were “a direct consequence of the march”, says McKinney. The key, in his view, is that those present came from all backgrounds and sections of the community. “20,000 peaceful people made a powerful statement.”McClenaghan agrees. “The most significant thing was the numbers. I think it was the biggest march that had ever happened in Derry, and it showed the strength of the civil rights movement.“The numbers gave it an authenticity, and I do think it empowered people. It influenced all sorts of movements – the women’s movement, the gay rights movement – because it gave people a sense of what they could do if they got together.”Fifty years on, the former marchers are together again. As they stand on the bridge, they remember that day, and those that followed. Once again, a photograph is taken.As the Sunday morning traffic resumes, they make their way back to the pavement and bid each other farewell.Canavan shakes hands, his eyes sparkling. “That was such fun,” he says."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination.

He was a real lump.I felt discomfort as soon as he sat down because I was pinned against the side of the cabin. I asked whether they could move him or move me but it was a full flight and they decided not to move me to a crew member\u0027s seat because I\u0027d have to keep on getting up to allow them to get to the galley.Mr Prosser\u0026#39s case is set to be heard at Pontypridd County Court on FridayThey said there wasn\u0027t anything they could do so I said I wanted to make a formal complaint which I did with the on-board customer services rep.I had no choice but to go back to my seat and the discomfort at being squashed up against the cabin soon turned to agony.He is claiming between £5,000 and £10,000 as general damages for pain, suffering and loss of amenity.The case is set to be heard at Pontypridd County Court on Friday.Before the hearing, a spokesman for BA said: As the case is subject to ongoing proceedings, it would be inappropriate for us to comment.Brexit deal latest: 23 Tories submit no confidence letters in Theresa May - but \u0026#39no vote until next week\u0026#39Comment: How can mediocre Mrs May compare herself to cricket icon Geoffrey Boycott?The Irish Backstop deal... why we’re in it, why we can’t leave and why it could bring down the GovernmentComment: Far from a road to ruin, a WTO Brexit is the only way out of Mrs May\u0026#39s messInternational hotel chains apologise for unhygienic practices Theresa May\u0026#39s draft Brexit withdrawal agreement - read in fullWhat is the Brexit deal, and what happens next? The resignation game: Would you have made it as far as Theresa May or quit by now?Conservation row in Italy after three endangered bears drown in unprotected water tankThe history of Thanksgiving: Pies, parades and presidential pardonsNew drug developed with UK backing will revolutionise treatment for deadly sleeping sickness, say expertsWho could replace Theresa May as Tory leader?

Since it was posted by a blogger using the pseudonym, Huazong, the video has been shared widely and watched nearly 30 million times.One online user wrote, “I always thought five-star hotels would be much better I never expected this to be the case.”Some hotels pictured that later issued apologies included the Le Royal Meridian Shanghai and two Sheraton hotels in other Chinese cities, all operated by Marriott, as well as the Waldorf Astoria in Shanghai, one of the Hilton hotel brands. Other hotels whose cleaners were caught on camera and also issued statements included the Park Hyatt hotel in Beijing, and the Shangri-La Hotel in Fuzhou in eastern China. Many of them have said they’re investigating.City tourism and health agencies in Beijing and Shanghai are investigating and in touch with the hotels featured in the video.Raising and enforcing such standards is an uphill battle at Chinese hotels given low wages and worker shortages. Still, the government has been eager to boost the country’s tourism industry to find another avenue for growth in efforts to shift the economy away from manufacturing and exports, and toward services industries.Hidden camera videos of poor practices by cleaning staff in Chinese hotels surface every so often on social media. Last year, another video went viral with the results of an investigation by an independent testing team that found many luxury hotels brands including the Intercontinental and the JW Marriott didn’t change the sheets and towels between guests.Brexit deal latest: 23 Tories submit no confidence letters in Theresa May - but \u0026#39no vote until next week\u0026#39German Green party comes within spitting distance of Merkel, new poll showsComment: How can mediocre Mrs May compare herself to cricket icon Geoffrey Boycott?The Irish Backstop deal... why we’re in it, why we can’t leave and why it could bring down the GovernmentComment: Far from a road to ruin, a WTO Brexit is the only way out of Mrs May\u0026#39s messTheresa May\u0026#39s draft Brexit withdrawal agreement - read in fullWhat is the Brexit deal, and what happens next? The resignation game: Would you have made it as far as Theresa May or quit by now?Conservation row in Italy after three endangered bears drown in unprotected water tankThe history of Thanksgiving: Pies, parades and presidential pardonsNew drug developed with UK backing will revolutionise treatment for deadly sleeping sickness, say expertsWho could replace Theresa May as Tory leader?

Yet the series almost immediately transcended its format to deliver a moving and very funny rumination on depression and middle-age malaise. Will Arnett plays BoJack – one time star of Nineties hit sitcom Horsin’ Around – as a lost soul whose turbo-charged narcissism prevents him getting his life together. A valentine to the Spielberg school of Eighties blockbuster, with Winona Ryder as a small town mom whose son is abducted by a transdimensional monster. ET, Goonies, Close Encounters, Alien and everything Stephen King wrote between 1975 and 1990 are all tossed into the blender by Millennial writer-creators the Duffer brothers. It was clear Stranger Things was going to be a mega-smash when Barb – the “best friend” character eaten in the second episode – went viral the weekend it dropped. Netflix’s Marvel shows tend towards the overlong and turgid. An exception is the high-kicking Daredevil, with Charlie Cox’s blind lawyercrimefighter banishing all memory of Ben Affleck\u0027s turn donning the red jumpsuit in 2003. With New York’s Hell’s Kitchen neighbourhood as backdrop, Daredevil is caked in street-level grit and features a searing series one performance by Vincent D\u0027Onofrio as the villainous Kingpin. The perfect antidote to the deafening bombast of the big screen Marvel movies. Did he do it? Does it matter considering the lengths the Durham, North Carolina police seemingly went in order to stitch him up? Sitting through this twisting, turning documenting about the trial of Michael Peterson – charged with the murder in 2003 of his wife – the viewer may find themselves alternately empathising with and recoiling from the accused. It’s a feat of bravura factual filmmaking from French documentarian Jean-Xavier de Lestrade, which comes to Netflix with a recently shot three-part coda catching up with the (very weird) Peterson clan a decade on. Stranger Things: the Euro-Gloom years. Netflix’s first German-language production is a pulp romp that thinks it’s a Wagner opera. In a remote town surrounded by a creepy forest locals fear the disappearance of a teenager may be linked to other missing persons cases from decades earlier. The timelines get twisted and it’s obvious that something wicked is emanating from a tunnel leading to a nearby nuclear power plant. Yet if the story sometimes trips itself up the Goonies-meets-Götterdämmerung ambiance keeps you hooked. 625 A Series of Unfortunate EventsThe wry and bleak Lemony Snickett children novels finally get the ghastly adaptation they deserve (let’s all pretend the dreadful 2004 Jim Carrey movie never happened). Neil Patrick Harris gobbles up the scenery as the vain and wicked Count Olaf, desperate to separate the Baudelaire orphans from their considerable inheritance. The look is Tim Burton by way of Wes Anderson, and the dark wit of the books is replicated perfectly (Snickett, aka Daniel Handler, is co-producer). If you’re curious as to how Cary Fukunaga will handle the Bond franchise, his limited series, starring Emma Stone and Jonah Hill, drops some delicious hints. It’s a mind-bending sci-fi story set in an alternative United States where computers still look like Commodore 64s and in which you pay for goods by having a “travel buddy” sit down and read you adverts. The Breaking Bad prequel is starting to outgrow the show that spawned it. Where Breaking Bad delivered a master-class in scorched earth storytelling Saul is gentler and more humane. Years before the rise of Walter White, the future meth overlord’s sleazy lawyer, Saul Goodman, is still plain old Jimmy McGill, a striving every-dude trying to catch a break. But how far will he go to make his name and escape the shadow of his superstar attorney brother Chuck (Michael McKean)? Don’t tell Channel 4 but Charlie Brooker’s dystopian anthology series has arguably got even better since making the jump from British terrestrial TV to the realm of megabucks American streaming. Bigger budgets have given creators Brooker and Annabel Jones license to let their imaginations off the leash – yielding unsurpassable episodes such as virtual reality love story San Junipero and Star Trek parody USS Callister, which has bagged a bunch of Emmys. David Fincher produces this serial killer drama based on the writings of a real-life FBI psychological profiler. It’s the post-Watergate Seventies and two maverick G-Men (Jonathan Groff and Holt McCallany) are going out on a limb by utilising the latest psychological research to get inside the heads of a motley assembly of real-life sociopathic murders – including the notorious “Co-Ed” butcher Ed Kemper, brought chillingly to live in an Emmy-nominated performance by Cameron Britton. A right royal blockbuster from dramatist Peter Morgan (The Queen, Frost  Nixon). Tracing the reign of Elizabeth II from her days as a wide-eyed young woman propelled to the throne after the surprise early death of her father, The Crown humanises the royals even as it paints their private lives as a bodice-ripping soap. Matt Smith is charmingly roguish as Prince Philip and Vanessa Kirby has ascended the Hollywood ranks on the back of her turn as the flawed yet sympathetic Princess Margaret. This drug trafficking caper spells out exactly what kind of series it is with an early scene in which two gangsters zip around a multi-level carpark on a motorbike firing a machine gun. Narcos, in other words, is for people who consider Pacino’s Scarface a touch too understated. Series one and two feature a mesmerising performance by Wagner Moura as Columbian cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar, while season three focuses on the notorious Cali cartel. Reported to be one of Netflix’s biggest hits – the company doesn’t release audience figures – the fourth season turns its attention to Mexico’s interminable drugs wars. A cloud hangs over Aziz Ansari’s future after he was embroiled in the #MeToo scandal. But whatever happens, he has left us with a humane and riveting sitcom about an Ansari-proximate character looking for love and trying to establish himself professionally in contemporary New York. One of Netflix’s early blockbusters, the sprawling soap opera updates Dallas to modern day southern Florida. Against the edge-of-civilisation backdrop of the Florida Keys, Kyle Chandler plays the local detective and favourite son of a well-to-do family. Their idyllic lives are thrown into chaos with the return of the clan’s black sheep (an unnervingly intense Ben Mendelsohn). The story is spectacularly hokey but searing performances by Chandler and Mendelsohn, and by Sissy Spacek and the late Sam Shepard as their imperious parents, make Bloodline compelling – a guilty pleasure that, actually, you shouldn’t feel all that guilty about. You can almost smell the shoddy sanitation and horse-manure in this lavish murder-mystery set in 19th New York. We’re firmly in Martin Scorsese\u0027s Gangs of New York territory, with a serial killer bumping off boy prostitutes across Manhattan. Enter pioneering criminal psychologist Dr Laszlo Kreisler (Daniel Brühl), aided by newspaper man John Moore (Luke Evans) and feisty lady detective Sara Howard (Dakota Fanning). Judd Apatow bring his signature gross-out comedy to the small screen. Love, which Apatow produced, is a masterclass in restraint compared to 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up etc. Paul Rust is Gus, a nerdish movie set tutor, whose develops a crush on Gillian Jacobs’s too-cool-for-school radio producer Mickey. Romance, of a sort, blossoms – but Love’s triumph is to acknowledge the complications of real life and to disabuse its characters of the idea that there’s such a thing as a straightforward happy ending. Hipster LA provides the bustling setting. Who says reality TV has to be nasty and manipulative? This updating of the early 2000s hit Queer Eye for the Straight Guy has five stereotype-challenging gay men sharing lifestyle tips and fashion advice with an engaging cast of All American schlubs (the first two seasons are shot mostly in the state of Georgia). There are laughs – but serious moment too, such as when one of the crew refuses to enter a church because of the still unhealed scars of his strict Christian upbringing. A high-gloss revamping of the traditional TV food show. Each episode profiles a high wattage international chef across its three seasons, the series has featured gastronomic superstars from the US, Argentina, India and Korea. A disastrous group interview in which actor Jason Bateman “mansplained” away the bullying co-star Jessica Walter had suffered at the hands of fellow cast-member Jeffrey Tambor meant season five of Arrested Development was fatally compromised before it even landed. Yet Netflix’s return to the dysfunctional world of the Bluth family stands on its merits and is a worthy addition to the surreal humour of seasons one through three (series four, which had to work around the busy schedules of the cast, is disposable by comparison). Netflix does Bladerunner with this sumptuous adaptation of the cult Richard Morgan novel. The setting is a neon-splashed cyberpunk future in which the super-wealthy live forever by uploading the consciousness into new “skins”. Enter rebel-turned-detective Takeshi Kovacs (Joel Kinnaman), hired to find out who killed a (since resurrected) zillionaire industrialist while dealing with fallout from his own troubled past. Rumoured to be one of Netflix’s most expensive projects yet, for its second run, Anthony Mackie (aka Marvel’s Falcon) replaced Kinnaman as the shape-shifting Kovacs.2125 Rick and MortyDan Harmon, creator of cult sitcom Community (also on Netflix), finds the perfect outlet for zany fanboy imagination with this crazed animated comedy about a Marty McFlyDoc Brown-esque duo of time travellers. Every genre imaginable is parodied with the manic energy and zinging dialogue we have come to expect from Harmon.Mad Men’s Alison Brie is our entry point into this comedy-drama inspired by a real life all-female wrestling league in the Eighties. Ruth Wilder (Brie) is a down-on-her luck actor who, out of desperation, signs up a wrestling competition willed into being by Sam Sylvia (podcast king Marc Maron). Britrock singer Kate Nash is one of her her fellow troupe members: the larger than life Rhonda “Britannica” Richardson.Deadpan animated satire about an idiot super spy with shaken and stirred mother issues. One of the most ambitious modern comedies, animated or otherwise, Archer tries on different varieties of humour for size and even occasionally tugs at the heart strings.Breaking Bad for those with short attention s. The saga of Walter White took years to track the iconic anti-hero’s rise from mild mannered everyman to dead-eyed criminal. Ozark gets there in the first half hour as nebbish Chicago accountant Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman) agrees to serve as lieutenant for the Mexican mob in the hillbilly heartlands of Ozark, Missouri (in return they thoughtfully spare his life). Bateman, usually seen in comedy roles, is a revelation as is Laura Linney as his nasty wife Wendy. There is also a break-out performance by Julia Garner playing the scion of a local redneck crime family.A heavenly comedy with a twist. Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell) is a cynical schlub waved through the Pearly Gates by mistake after dying in a bizarre supermarket accident. There she must remain above the suspicions of seemingly well-meaning but disorganised angel Michael (Ted Danson) whilst also negotiating fractious relationships with do-gooder Chidi (William Jackson Harper), spoiled princess Tahani (former T4 presenter Jameela Jamil) and ex-drug dealer Jason (Manny Jacinto).A cartoon about a talking horse, starring the goofy older brother from Arrested Development… on paper little about BoJack Horseman screams “must watch”.

Don’t tell Channel 4 but Charlie Brooker’s dystopian anthology series has arguably got even better since making the jump from British terrestrial TV to the realm of megabucks American streaming. Bigger budgets have given creators Brooker and Annabel Jones license to let their imaginations off the leash – yielding unsurpassable episodes such as virtual reality love story San Junipero and Star Trek parody USS Callister, which has bagged a bunch of Emmys. David Fincher produces this serial killer drama based on the writings of a real-life FBI psychological profiler. It’s the post-Watergate Seventies and two maverick G-Men (Jonathan Groff and Holt McCallany) are going out on a limb by utilising the latest psychological research to get inside the heads of a motley assembly of real-life sociopathic murders – including the notorious “Co-Ed” butcher Ed Kemper, brought chillingly to live in an Emmy-nominated performance by Cameron Britton. A right royal blockbuster from dramatist Peter Morgan (The Queen, Frost  Nixon). Tracing the reign of Elizabeth II from her days as a wide-eyed young woman propelled to the throne after the surprise early death of her father, The Crown humanises the royals even as it paints their private lives as a bodice-ripping soap. Matt Smith is charmingly roguish as Prince Philip and Vanessa Kirby has ascended the Hollywood ranks on the back of her turn as the flawed yet sympathetic Princess Margaret. This drug trafficking caper spells out exactly what kind of series it is with an early scene in which two gangsters zip around a multi-level carpark on a motorbike firing a machine gun. Narcos, in other words, is for people who consider Pacino’s Scarface a touch too understated. Series one and two feature a mesmerising performance by Wagner Moura as Columbian cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar, while season three focuses on the notorious Cali cartel. Reported to be one of Netflix’s biggest hits – the company doesn’t release audience figures – the fourth season turns its attention to Mexico’s interminable drugs wars. A cloud hangs over Aziz Ansari’s future after he was embroiled in the #MeToo scandal. But whatever happens, he has left us with a humane and riveting sitcom about an Ansari-proximate character looking for love and trying to establish himself professionally in contemporary New York. One of Netflix’s early blockbusters, the sprawling soap opera updates Dallas to modern day southern Florida. Against the edge-of-civilisation backdrop of the Florida Keys, Kyle Chandler plays the local detective and favourite son of a well-to-do family. Their idyllic lives are thrown into chaos with the return of the clan’s black sheep (an unnervingly intense Ben Mendelsohn). The story is spectacularly hokey but searing performances by Chandler and Mendelsohn, and by Sissy Spacek and the late Sam Shepard as their imperious parents, make Bloodline compelling – a guilty pleasure that, actually, you shouldn’t feel all that guilty about. You can almost smell the shoddy sanitation and horse-manure in this lavish murder-mystery set in 19th New York. We’re firmly in Martin Scorsese\u0027s Gangs of New York territory, with a serial killer bumping off boy prostitutes across Manhattan. Enter pioneering criminal psychologist Dr Laszlo Kreisler (Daniel Brühl), aided by newspaper man John Moore (Luke Evans) and feisty lady detective Sara Howard (Dakota Fanning). Judd Apatow bring his signature gross-out comedy to the small screen. Love, which Apatow produced, is a masterclass in restraint compared to 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up etc. Paul Rust is Gus, a nerdish movie set tutor, whose develops a crush on Gillian Jacobs’s too-cool-for-school radio producer Mickey. Romance, of a sort, blossoms – but Love’s triumph is to acknowledge the complications of real life and to disabuse its characters of the idea that there’s such a thing as a straightforward happy ending. Hipster LA provides the bustling setting. Who says reality TV has to be nasty and manipulative? This updating of the early 2000s hit Queer Eye for the Straight Guy has five stereotype-challenging gay men sharing lifestyle tips and fashion advice with an engaging cast of All American schlubs (the first two seasons are shot mostly in the state of Georgia). There are laughs – but serious moment too, such as when one of the crew refuses to enter a church because of the still unhealed scars of his strict Christian upbringing. A high-gloss revamping of the traditional TV food show. Each episode profiles a high wattage international chef across its three seasons, the series has featured gastronomic superstars from the US, Argentina, India and Korea. A disastrous group interview in which actor Jason Bateman “mansplained” away the bullying co-star Jessica Walter had suffered at the hands of fellow cast-member Jeffrey Tambor meant season five of Arrested Development was fatally compromised before it even landed. Yet Netflix’s return to the dysfunctional world of the Bluth family stands on its merits and is a worthy addition to the surreal humour of seasons one through three (series four, which had to work around the busy schedules of the cast, is disposable by comparison). Netflix does Bladerunner with this sumptuous adaptation of the cult Richard Morgan novel. The setting is a neon-splashed cyberpunk future in which the super-wealthy live forever by uploading the consciousness into new “skins”. Enter rebel-turned-detective Takeshi Kovacs (Joel Kinnaman), hired to find out who killed a (since resurrected) zillionaire industrialist while dealing with fallout from his own troubled past. Rumoured to be one of Netflix’s most expensive projects yet, for its second run, Anthony Mackie (aka Marvel’s Falcon) replaced Kinnaman as the shape-shifting Kovacs.2125 Rick and MortyDan Harmon, creator of cult sitcom Community (also on Netflix), finds the perfect outlet for zany fanboy imagination with this crazed animated comedy about a Marty McFlyDoc Brown-esque duo of time travellers. Every genre imaginable is parodied with the manic energy and zinging dialogue we have come to expect from Harmon.Mad Men’s Alison Brie is our entry point into this comedy-drama inspired by a real life all-female wrestling league in the Eighties. Ruth Wilder (Brie) is a down-on-her luck actor who, out of desperation, signs up a wrestling competition willed into being by Sam Sylvia (podcast king Marc Maron). Britrock singer Kate Nash is one of her her fellow troupe members: the larger than life Rhonda “Britannica” Richardson.Deadpan animated satire about an idiot super spy with shaken and stirred mother issues. One of the most ambitious modern comedies, animated or otherwise, Archer tries on different varieties of humour for size and even occasionally tugs at the heart strings.Breaking Bad for those with short attention s. The saga of Walter White took years to track the iconic anti-hero’s rise from mild mannered everyman to dead-eyed criminal. Ozark gets there in the first half hour as nebbish Chicago accountant Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman) agrees to serve as lieutenant for the Mexican mob in the hillbilly heartlands of Ozark, Missouri (in return they thoughtfully spare his life). Bateman, usually seen in comedy roles, is a revelation as is Laura Linney as his nasty wife Wendy. There is also a break-out performance by Julia Garner playing the scion of a local redneck crime family.A heavenly comedy with a twist. Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell) is a cynical schlub waved through the Pearly Gates by mistake after dying in a bizarre supermarket accident. There she must remain above the suspicions of seemingly well-meaning but disorganised angel Michael (Ted Danson) whilst also negotiating fractious relationships with do-gooder Chidi (William Jackson Harper), spoiled princess Tahani (former T4 presenter Jameela Jamil) and ex-drug dealer Jason (Manny Jacinto).As Amber gets ready to become Queen of Aldovia, she experiences some royal pains and struggles to see how some aspects of her life and her personality – such as her activities as a blogger – will fit within her new life.A Christmas Prince\u0026nbspwas a somewhat unexpected success for Netflix.The romantic comedy, which has all the hallmarks of its genre, became a viral hit following its release in November last year.Netflix itself poked fun at the film\u0027s most dedicate viewers in a tweet reading: To the 53 people who\u0027ve watched A Christmas Prince every day for the past 18 days: Who hurt you?Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Pressed into a field in Hampshire, it seemed to mirror the look of the original Arecibo message, which gave a host of information about life on Earth that the originators hoped would be decodable to people anywhere in the universe.Where the original Arecibo\u0026nbspmessage had shown blocks of information including depictions of important chemicals like carbon, an illustration of DNA and a picture of a human being. The hoax reply was probably too perfect: carbon was swapped for silicon, the DNA was altered and the human being was replaced with a big-headed alien of the kind seen in science fiction.Arecibo Message anniversary honoured in Google DoodleIt was of course a hoax: among other questions, sceptics wondered why aliens wouldn\u0027t simply have sent a radio message, as we did, rather than dropping down to Earth to press a picture of themselves into crops and then failing to actually alert anyone. But it was a demonstration of the way the original Arecibo\u0026nbspmessage and the search for alien life that it grew out of continues to occupy the minds of people around the world.Scientists don\u0027t ever expect to actually receive a reply to the Arecibo message: it was powerful but specific, pointed at a galaxy cluster that will actually have moved out of the way by the time it travels the 20,000 light years to its destination. It was probably most useful as a demonstration of the technology and a thought experiment that led people to think about what such a message might actually need to say.Similar efforts have been launched that could have more positive results, however. A new initiative called Breakthrough Message – part of a broader group supported by a Russian billionaire and Stephen Hawking, which aims to find life elsewhere in the universe – has invited people to consider how best to write and send a message out into space, though has cautioned that for the moment it will not send out those messages.But some fear that a response wouldn\u0027t come in the form of a message at all. Instead, it would be something altogether more dangerous – and that\u0027s why they advise that we shouldn\u0027t send further signals like the Arecibo message, for fear that they would only put us in peril.Stephen Hawking, for instance, famously said that we should be wary of sending out messages into the universe for fear that they could be answered by someone looking to wipe us out – or, perhaps worse, someone who might wipe us out purely by accident. ‘If aliens visit us, the outcome would be much as when Columbus landed in America, which didn’t turn out well for the Native Americans, he said in a 2010 documentary.And such criticism was even in place when the Arecibo\u0026nbspmessage was first sent. Just days after the dispatch was shot into space, the Royal Astronomer of England,\u0026nbspMartin Ryle, launched an intense blast of criticism at the idea, arguing that it might only alert aliens who are malevolent or hungry, and asking the\u0026nbspInternational Astronomical Union to ban any future messages.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

By mid-December, one bitcoin was worth close to $20,000 (£15,000), but that was the high water mark before the tide turned.A year later, bitcoin is trading at around a third of its peak value but some cryptocurrency analysts believe the market might be on the verge of mirroring the gains it experienced in late 2017. The only caveat is that it might not be bitcoin that leads the charge this time.Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne, who was behind the online retail giant becoming\u0026nbspone of the first places to accept bitcoin back in 2014, said\u0026nbspthat he still expects\u0026nbspthe mass adoption of cryptocurrency, without specifying\u0026nbspwhich one.Speaking to bitcoin enthusiast Naomi Brockwell on her YouTube channel, Mr Byrne said he remained highly sceptical of the traditional financial system. When asked if he saw bitcoin becoming a worldwide currency, he pointed to countries like Venezuela that have experienced significant financial turmoil in recent years.When people start getting into it is when their own financial systems collapse, he said. Whether bitcoin is the one, whether bitcoin has solved its speed problem, or it\u0027s another cryptocurrency, only time will tell.Created with Sketch.Bitcoin\u0027s volatile history in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.18 Satoshi Nakamoto creates the first bitcoin block in 2009On 3 January, 2009, the genesis block of bitcoin appeared.

It is completely unacceptable to turn a blind eye to children playing gaming machines that are restricted to over-18s, which risks young people becoming addicted to gambling.”On Wednesday, the government made a U-turn over the timing of a cut to maximum stakes on fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) in the face of a revolt by MPs.A reduction in the top wager from £100 to just £2 to combat problem gambling will now come into force in April, after more than 70 MPs set out to sabotage Treasury plans to push it back to October.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It is completely unacceptable to turn a blind eye to children playing gaming machines that are restricted to over-18s, which risks young people becoming addicted to gambling.”On Wednesday, the government made a U-turn over the timing of a cut to maximum stakes on fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) in the face of a revolt by MPs.A reduction in the top wager from £100 to just £2 to combat problem gambling will now come into force in April, after more than 70 MPs set out to sabotage Treasury plans to push it back to October.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Long-form streaming television, with a completely new actor.No replacement has been announced for Cruise yet, but fans have already started discussing possible options on online discussion boards.Here are nine actors who could conceivably play the former US military police major on the small screen.The 6ft 4in, 260-pound wrestling-champion-turned-actor seems like an obvious choice whenever someone is needed to play a beefy\u0026nbspcharacter (the man played Hercules, the mythological poster child of burliness,\u0026nbspin the 2014 film of the same name).With past roles in\u0026nbspGI Joe: Retaliation\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspFast \u0026amp Furious 6, the 46-year-old Johnson\u0026nbsphas the action film experience to boot, too.Kraskinski rose to fame as the personable Jim in the US version of\u0026nbspThe Office, before stunning viewers as the athletic father in his acclaimed horror film\u0026nbspA Quiet Place.The 6ft 3in actor further leaned into\u0026nbspthis pivot by starring as former Marine Jack Ryan in the TV adaptation based on Tom Clancy\u0027s novels.But while the part confirms Krasinski\u0027s ability to credibly play an action hero, it could actually play against him. The part of Ryan has strong similarities with\u0026nbspthat of Reacher and Amazon has confirmed that the TV series based on Ryan\u0027s adventures would be renewed for a second season, meaning Krasinski\u0027s dance card could be full.The 6ft\u0026nbsp5in\u0026nbspSwedish actor rose to fame in 1985 as the brawny Russian boxer Ivan drago, Rocky\u0027s antagonist in\u0026nbspRocky IV –\u0026nbspa role he\u0027s reprising in\u0026nbspCreed II, out next week in the US.Earlier this year, Lundgren\u0026nbspstarred opposite\u0026nbspJean-Claude Van Damme\u0026nbspin the action thriller\u0026nbspBlack Water.His past credits also include the three instalments of\u0026nbspThe Expendables, the action thriller\u0026nbspIcarus, and dozens of additional action flicks.Lundgren had what it takes to play Reacher back in 1985, and he still does now.Standing at six feet tall, McConaughey\u0026nbspis in the ballpark of Reacher\u0027s height.His natural frame does appear slender than that of Reacher, but McConaughey is no stranger to extreme physical transformations in the name of a part.He was muscular in Magic Mike (though his physique was more six-pack-abs stud than strong military vet), partly bald and pudgy in\u0026nbspGold, and rake-thin in\u0026nbspDallas Buyers Club.Surely, he could use his chameleon powers to step into Reacher\u0027s shoes.The 6ft 3in\u0026nbspactor is best known for his part as the godlike superhero Thor in the Marvel Universe.Stan Lee, the late co-creator of Marvel who died on Monday, once described Thor as stronger than the strongest person.While Thor comes from the fictional realm of Asgard, there\u0027s nothing barring\u0026nbspHemsworth ​from taking his superhuman strength to more earthly planes.Standing at 6ft 4in tall, Elliott is certainly fit for a character of Reacher\u0027s dimensions.He\u0027s not blond, but then again, neither was Cruise – and if authenticity must absolutely prevail, it\u0027s nothing a quick bleach job won\u0027t fix.The Canadian actor doesn\u0027t have an extensive action resume, though, having most recently starred as John Wayne in the biographical drama\u0026nbspTrumbo\u0026nbspas well as the sitcom\u0026nbspMom.He\u0027s six feet tall and a\u0026nbspFast \u0026amp Furious\u0026nbspalum who has not only acted in, but also worked as a producer for the action franchise.\u0026nbspDiesel is also famously muscular and frequently documents his weightlifting routine on social media.Sturdy? Check.\u0026nbspSkarsgård\u0026nbspfollowed a strict diet and adhered to a rigid training routine to appear as burly as possible\u0026nbspin David Yates\u0027s\u0026nbspThe Legend of Tarzan.Action credits? Not really, but from his breakout role as vampire Eric Northman in\u0026nbspTrue Blood\u0026nbspto his Emmy-Award-winning as abusive husband Perry Wright in\u0026nbspBig Little Lies,\u0026nbspSkarsgård\u0026nbsphas shown that he certainly has range.Similarly to Krasinski, the 6ft 2in Pratt rose to fame in a slightly cosier role than his current filmography suggests.While he didn\u0027t seem particularly athletic as the hilarious Andy Dwyer in\u0026nbspParks and Recreation, Pratt packed on more muscle to appear as\u0026nbspPeter Quill  Star-Lord in\u0026nbsps of the Galaxy\u0026nbspand other Marvel films.His acting credits are currently dominated by the\u0026nbspsuperhero movies and the science fiction adventure\u0026nbspJurassic World\u0026nbspfranchise, but Pratt could conceivably branch out as Reacher.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Six actors – Cate Blanchett, Heath Ledger, Christian Bale and Ben Whishaw among them – portrayed Dylan at different stages of his career as part of an appropriately freewheelin’ approach to narrative.To convince director Oliver Stone to give him the part of Jim Morrison, Val Kilmer undertook hours of extensive research into his hero, learning 50 songs to mimic his singing voice. When the surviving members of the Doors assembled to hear a recording of Kilmer, none could tell which was the impersonation and which the real Morrison. The Doors was not loved by all but the great Kyle MacLachlan and Meg Ryan were memorable in supporting roles as keyboardist Ray Manzarek and Morrison\u0027s girlfriend Pamela Courson respectively. Gary Oldman was a dead-ringer for the late Sex Pistols guitarist Sid Vicious in director Alex Cox’s appropriately grotty account of the punk star’s pointless death from heroin following the overdose of his girlfriend Nancy Spungen (Chloe Webb) in New York’s Hotel Chelsea.

Todd Haynes followed his glam rock pseudo-biopic Velvet Goldmine (1998) with this inventive exploration of the many sides of Bob Dylan. Six actors – Cate Blanchett, Heath Ledger, Christian Bale and Ben Whishaw among them – portrayed Dylan at different stages of his career as part of an appropriately freewheelin’ approach to narrative.To convince director Oliver Stone to give him the part of Jim Morrison, Val Kilmer undertook hours of extensive research into his hero, learning 50 songs to mimic his singing voice. When the surviving members of the Doors assembled to hear a recording of Kilmer, none could tell which was the impersonation and which the real Morrison. The Doors was not loved by all but the great Kyle MacLachlan and Meg Ryan were memorable in supporting roles as keyboardist Ray Manzarek and Morrison\u0027s girlfriend Pamela Courson respectively.

James Moore considers whether there is any room for social responsibility in the corporate world, or if we should just ditch the spiel on valuesClick to followThe IndependentBusinesses are stakeholders in society, and vice versa“These guys are mad. Call off the invasion. Their system’s going to eat them so we won’t have to. They have these company things that they’re allowing to bust the whole place up. Let’s just sit tight and clean up once they’re done wrecking it.”That’s what an alien might very well say upon looking at the way the titans of the capitalist system have been operating.\u0026nbspYou want examples? Ten years on from the financial crisis that caused a brutal recession and a lost economic decade from which we have still to fully recover and it isn’t hard to find people who’ll tell you that the banks could easily do it again.Tech giants make money from people taking out ads that are designed to corrupt democratic elections, while other companies wreck the environment.\u0026nbspMeanwhile, the carnival of corporate scandal adds a new float every few months. Yet according to the Nobel prize-winning economist Milton Friedman, whose influence permeates through the Anglo-Saxon capitalist world, they’re all only doing what they’re supposed to do: increasing profits by whatever means necessary within the law.\u0026nbspIn his seminal work Capitalism and Freedom,\u0026nbspFriedman baldly stated that “the social responsibility of business is to increase its profits”.\u0026nbspHe had no truck with companies having any regard for\u0026nbspthe societies in which they operate, much less furthering socially useful goals such as\u0026nbsp“providing employment, eliminating discrimination, avoiding pollution and whatever else may be the catchwords of the contemporary crop of reformers”.\u0026nbsp“Businessmen who talk this way are unwitting puppets of the intellectual forces that have been undermining the basis of a free society these past decades,” he opined.\u0026nbspThat view is at odds with what you’ll often hear from modern executives, who like to talk about how important the “values” of the businesses they run are\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspbig up their role as “good corporate citizens”.\u0026nbspFacebook isn’t about making money. It exists to “connect people”. “Don’t be evil”\u0026nbspfamously used to be at the centre of Google’s corporate philosophy until it was quietly removed.\u0026nbspNow it says: “The Google Code of Conduct is one of the ways we put Google’s values into practice. It’s built around the recognition that everything we do in connection with our work at Google will be, and should be, measured against the highest possible standards of ethical business conduct.”Isn’t that nice? Milton must be turning in his grave. You hear similar things on this side of the Atlantic. I once suggested to a very senior executive at a rather famous FTSE 100 company over dinner that his talk about values was basically window dressing, and that cash was king. He became visibly upset.\u0026nbspYet Friedman would have found nothing to take issue with in the investor presentations put out by the aforementioned executive’s employer.\u0026nbspHe might have found today’s fiction of corporate social responsibility frustrating, even infuriating, but he wouldn’t need to scratch too far below the surface to be reassured.The Pew Research Centre recently pointed out that today real\u0026nbspwages\u0026nbspin the US, adjusting for inflation, have about the same purchasing power as they did 40 years ago. Only those at the very top have made real gainsThe majority of western companies and western executives subscribe to and live by his doctrine in nearly every respect, even if they’re sometimes reluctant to admit it.\u0026nbspThat shouldn’t surprise anyone. They are legally required to do so.\u0026nbspBritain’s Companies Act of 2006 –\u0026nbsppassed by a Labour government by the way –\u0026nbsphas the fiduciary duty of directors to shareholders at its core.It states that a director must act “in the way he (sic) considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole”.\u0026nbspIn the case of big public companies, the members are shareholders, who invest in them, as Friedman stated, for the purpose of making money.\u0026nbspCapitalism red in tooth and claw rules, say his fanboys, because it has proved far better at delivering prosperity to those living under it than any of the alternatives (Friedman was writing at a time when the main one was Soviet-style communism).\u0026nbspSo, you corporate executives, it’s time to bin all that fluff about values. Go get yourself some CREAM (Cash Rules Everything Around Me, with apologies to the Wu-Tang Clan).\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThe trouble with that view is it isn’t working so well any more, at least not for the masses, which might explain why extremists of one sort or another are finding such favour, extremists who are mostly bad for business – and yes that includes those on the right, in case you hadn’t noticed Donald Trump’s trade war.\u0026nbspThe Pew Research Centre recently pointed out that today real wages in the US, adjusting for inflation, have about the same purchasing power as they did 40 years ago.\u0026nbspOnly those at the very top have made real gains. Since 2000 their real wages have risen by a cumulative 15.7 per cent, to $2,112 (£1,628) a week – nearly five times the usual weekly earnings of the bottom tenth ($426).\u0026nbspReal wages for the average American worker actually peaked 45 years ago, a couple of years after Friedman published a piece expounding on his profits argument in The New York Times Magazine.\u0026nbspSimilar issues are at work in the UK labour market. Pawel Adrjan, UK economist at Indeed, a job site, recently noted that average pay is still below its 2008 pre-crisis peak.“If real wages had continued growing at their pre-crisis trend, the average person would now be earning £130 more per week than they actually do,” he said.\u0026nbspIn the boardroom it’s a different story. In a 2015 report, the High Pay Centre noted that CEOs in the UK had seen their pay increase by a factor of five since the late 1990s\u0026nbsp– despite no evidence that this resulted in better corporate performance, productivity or economic performance.\u0026nbspThe latter point was eloquently made by Charles Cotton, senior performance and reward advisor at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and\u0026nbspDevelopment, during a hearing of the parliamentary business committee in June.\u0026nbspYet despite the occasional shareholder rebellion, there is scant sign of any real slowdown. A more recent report by the centre found that CEO pay leapt by 11 per cent in 2017, more than four times the pace at which the average worker’s pay increased.\u0026nbspFriedman argued\u0026nbspthat a corporate executive has direct responsibility to his employers “to conduct the business in accordance with their desires, which generally will be to make as much money as possible while conforming to the basic rules of the society”.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Mark Zuckerberg meets world leaders – in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.President Barack Obama talks with Zuckerberg during a town hall style meeting at Facebook headquarters in Palo Alto, California, 20 April 2011David Cameron talks to the Facebook founder during the internet session of the G8 summit in Deauville, France, 26 May 2011German Chancellor Angela Merkel and former French president Nicolas Sarkozy meet Zuckerberg at the G8 summit in Deauville, France, 26 May 2011Zuckerberg talks to Sarkozy at a G8 summit in Deauville, France, 25 May 2011Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe meets the Facebook CEO at the company’s headquarters in Menlo Park, California, 30 April 2015Zuckerberg with former Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda in Tokyo, 29 March 2012Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Zuckerberg at a townhall meeting at Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, California, 27 September 2015Zuckerberg with other business leaders and the Chinese President Xi JinpingPresident Barack Obama talks with Zuckerberg during a town hall style meeting at Facebook headquarters in Palo Alto, California, 20 April 2011David Cameron talks to the Facebook founder during the internet session of the G8 summit in Deauville, France, 26 May 2011German Chancellor Angela Merkel and former French president Nicolas Sarkozy meet Zuckerberg at the G8 summit in Deauville, France, 26 May 2011Zuckerberg talks to Sarkozy at a G8 summit in Deauville, France, 25 May 2011Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe meets the Facebook CEO at the company’s headquarters in Menlo Park, California, 30 April 2015Zuckerberg with former Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda in Tokyo, 29 March 2012Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Zuckerberg at a townhall meeting at Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, California, 27 September 2015Zuckerberg with other business leaders and the Chinese President Xi JinpingBut, while they conform to that for the most part, when it comes to the question of their pay –\u0026nbspthey clearly break the rule. They and the non-executive directors who set it frequently act in ways that are ultimately opposed to shareholders interests.\u0026nbspThe situation reached its nadir in the UK with Persimmon Homes and its potential payment of £600m, slated to be shared among just over 130 executives. CEO Jeff Fairburn was due to receive more than £100m through it, although a public furore eventually saw him agreeing to reduce it to £75m.\u0026nbspThe company had been successful on his watch, it’s true, but that success was largely fuelled by the government-funded help to buy scheme, which underwrites mortgages for the first-time buyers Persimmon targets.\u0026nbspIt thus owed much of its success to a de facto public subsidy.\u0026nbspThe chair, and the chair of the remuneration committee who resigned in the midst of the scandal, admitted that the bonus scheme should have been capped, but this was too late to save the shareholders they were supposed to represent, who ended up handing over nearly 10 per cent of their company to its executives. No wonder one commentator referred to it as an act of “corporate looting”.\u0026nbspFiduciary duty? Forget about it!\u0026nbspPart of the reason for the repeated occurrence of this sort of thing is the way the modern company has become, in effect, ownerless – widely held by erse groups of institutional investment funds which buy and sell electronically, rarely vote on company resolutions and sometimes may only be on the shareholder register for a matter of days, even hours.\u0026nbspRemuneration committees would have you believe that they seek to align the interests of executives with those of shareholders, despite their lack of oversight, by making them shareholders too. CREAM for all!Facebook has had its reputation trashed, and paid fines, while also dealing with new rules. There might be worse to comeThe problem with that analysis is executives get their shares for free, and if something is free you don’t really value it. They rarely put their own money at risk. Perish the thought.\u0026nbspThis too often leads to them throwing caution to the wind in pursuit of potentially huge payouts. Why not?If their employer fails really badly, keels over and dies halfway down the track from an overenthusiastic application of the whip, they may lose their jobs. But corporate executives are rarely out of work for long.\u0026nbspTake a look at the career of Andy Hornby, as an example. The HBOS CEO had his hand on the tiller when the bank fell off a cliff, and the government had to step in and find a rescuer (Lloyds) which it then had to bail out.\u0026nbspMr\u0026nbspHornby, who was sharply criticised in a report by the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards, ought to have been unemployable after that. But it wasn’t long before he found a new role as the chief executive of Alliance Boots, before moving on to bookmaker Coral.\u0026nbsp​RBS’s Fred Goodwin wasn’t so lucky thanks to his status as the bogeyman of British banking. But nearly all of his boardroom colleagues had secured alternative work within a couple of years of that bank’s collapse. One wonders what will now happen to those who spent time in the Carillion boardroom. Its executives also went for the bonus long shot jackpot. Expansion and profits uber alles, until the roulette wheel threw up a double zero.There was no bailout in that case, but the taxpayer was nonetheless left with a hefty bill in the wake of yet another glaring example of the capitalism Friedman advocated eating itself. But there are some companies that have eschewed Friedman’s ideas in another, more laudable respect, and with intriguing results.I’m not talking here about the corporate social responsibility\u0026nbspprogrammes most big businesses like to run. They’re often little more than extensions of the marketing budget, designed to send a message to consumers: “Hey you lot, come spend with us. You can feel good about it because even though we screw up the environment, look we’ve built a well in Senegal and we let our people go and help inner-city kids in their lunch hours.”I am instead thinking of those businesses that have actively sought to promote ersity (a favourite of the current crop of reformers) through their hiring\u0026nbsppractices.\u0026nbspFar from suffering through doing so, they have benefited, and handsomely.\u0026nbspMcKinsey, a management consultant renowned for its hard-headed intellectual rigour, sought to study the impact on the\u0026nbspcorporate profitability of hiring both more women and more staff from a minority ethnic background.\u0026nbspIts report –\u0026nbspDelivering Through Diversity –\u0026nbspshows that companies that do this make more money.\u0026nbspThe firm examined 1,000 companies from 12 countries for the 2017 study.\u0026nbspThose with workforces in the top 25 per cent for ethnic ersity were 33 per cent more likely to see higher than average profits than those in the lowest. When it came to gender ersity the figure was 21 per cent.\u0026nbspThe findings particularly stressed the importance of these groups being hired to both management roles (where they are often hardest to find) and in revenue-generating “line”\u0026nbsppositions from where executives are typically drawn.\u0026nbspCompanies that do so comply with Friedman’s demands that they maximise profits by taking his prescription and doing the opposite. \u0026nbspBut the question of whether the “profit at all costs” aim isn’t still destructive remains.\u0026nbspPutting profits first has left Britain with water companies that impose hosepipe bans while gallons upon gallons of water pours into its streets from leaking pipes.\u0026nbspIt has produced the railway debacles that have shattered the faith of the public in privatisation.\u0026nbspIt was for the purposes of bringing in a few extra dollars that Facebook allowed itself to be used by those seeking to influence the US presidential election and the Brexit referendum.All these demonstrate how self-defeating corporate behaviour that puts profits above society can be. The water industry is now dealing with tougher regulation, while the government is poised to announce a review into how rail services are delivered.\u0026nbspIf Labour comes to power both industries face nationalisation, an idea that is finding increasing favour with the public.\u0026nbspFacebook has had its reputation trashed, and paid fines, while also dealing with new rules. There might be worse to come. There probably should be.\u0026nbspWould all this have happened were these businesses to have taken their “social responsibilities” more seriously?It\u0027s not just in the field of hiring that companies would benefit from thinking a little more carefully about what they do and how they do it.\u0026nbspEco-friendly buildings? That’s your energy bill down.\u0026nbspSocially responsible businesses could serve to benefit shareholders, at least those with a time horizon beyond five minutesAct to cut emissions and curb other environmentally damaging behaviours? The costs of environmental destruction could be reduced, resulting in, for example, lower insurance premiums.\u0026nbspSocially responsible businesses could serve to benefit shareholders, at least those with a time horizon beyond five minutes.\u0026nbspIt’s worth considering the experience of Nationwide and John Lewis, one a member-owned mutual, the other an employee-owned partnership, at this point.\u0026nbspThey aren’t without their failings. Nationwide, for example, is as guilty of overpaying its executives as some banks.But as a rule, they manage to balance both long-term financial success, something their owners are still interested in, with a more enlightened stance towards the society they operate within than some of their peers.John Lewis’s constitution is a particularly worthy example. It sets out employee partners’ rights and responsibilities and defines “how power is shared and our collective responsibilities to others”.Mutuals and partnerships fail just as public companies do. But as often as not it is when they follow the destructive playbook of the latter, with too little oversight brought to bear on over-powerful and overpaid executives seeking to maximise profits above all else and taking silly risks to do so. \u0026nbspPerhaps it’s time to consider a revised Companies Act to better balance shareholders’ interests with those of other stakeholders. A very senior Tory, from the party’s sane (non-Brexiteer) wing, pooh-poohed this notion in conversation with me. They argued that an employee, for example, could never be ranked alongside the shareholder owner. But why not? As I’ve tried to demonstrate, it might ultimately work in their favour.\u0026nbspJohn Lewis, where the employees are the owners, hasn’t been immune from the challenges afflicting the high street. But most of its stock market-listed department store rivals would kill to be in the position it is in.\u0026nbspWorks councils are commonplace in Europe, as is employee representation on boards, something Theresa May briefly talked about before beating a hasty retreat. \u0026nbspJohn Lewis chairman Sir Charlie Mayfield to step down in 2020Diversity makes companies richer says McKinsey. Investors take noteIt is true that they haven’t necessarily\u0026nbspserved to curtail executives’ worst instincts –\u0026nbspit isn’t hard to find examples of excessive pay at German companies for example. But look at Germany\u0026nbspand look at Britain and ask yourself which has the better way of doing things. Would anyone other than a die-hard nationalist say anything other than “Vorsprung Durch Technik”?\u0026nbspBritain, and other western nations, have also given businesses responsibility for functions they never had when Friedman was writing.\u0026nbspSo, yes, society does have a big stake in how they are run, and governed. It is high time that was recognised. Society needs seats on the board, a place in the constitution,\u0026nbspa role in corporate thinking. So do workers.\u0026nbspWhen Tony Blair coined the phrase “stakeholder” it was widely criticised as a buzzword (he was rather fond of them).\u0026nbspBut businesses are stakeholders in society, just as society is a stakeholder in businesses.\u0026nbspThe betterment of one\u0026nbspfavours the other, not least because, as that McKinsey study shows, more society can ultimately lead to more money. More CREAM for everyone.It’s time for us to recognise that and to start looking at ways of reforming the system. It really isn’t serving us very well.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It failed to see it – but that failure puts a limit on how big the rock can be, since if it was large enough it would have been spotted, according to a new paper published in\u0026nbspthe Astronomical Journal and coauthored by scientists at NASA\u0027s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.Asteroid could have been spacecraft sailing past us, say scientistsThat helps to lead credence to the theory that the relatively small object is being pushed along by gas that was being thrown out of the object. That gave the effect of adding thrust as it travelled through the solar system, speeding it up.It was that strange speeding up behaviour that led scientists to suggest that it could be an alien probe, sent past Earth by a distant civilisation. The extra propulsion could be caused by the object working as a lightsail, designed to be carried along by solar radiation, Harvard scientists recently suggested.The alternative and more accepted theory of frozen gases inside the object being expelled and pushing it along was dependent on Oumuamua\u0026nbspbeing smaller than typical comets inside of our solar system. With the determination that it probably is, the research seems to suggest theories about it being an alien spacecraft are less likely.Oumuamua has been full of surprises from day one, so we were eager to see what Spitzer might show, said David Trilling, lead author on the new study and a professor of astronomy at Northern Arizona University. The fact that Oumuamua was too small for Spitzer to detect is actually a very valuable result.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

There\u0027s nothing we know that\u0027s closely related to them,” he added.Created with Sketch.Science news in pictures Show all 18Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.118 Baby mice tears could be used in pest controlA study from the University of Tokyo has found that the tears of baby mice cause female mice to be less interested in the sexual advances of males218 Final warning to limit climate catastropheThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has issued a report which projects the impact of a rise in global temperatures of 1.5 degrees Celsius and warns against a higher increase318 Nobel prize for evolution chemistsThe nobel prize for chemistry has been awarded to three chemists working with evolution.

At this biennial event, the participating companies exhibit their latest service robotic technologies and componentsThe robot developed by Seed Solutions sings and dances to music during the Japan Robot Week 2016 at Tokyo Big SightSocial jet lag is a new phenomenon where people shift their sleeping patterns backwards and forwards during weekends and holidays. It is thought to be exaggerated by disruptive things like phones and social networks that encourage people to stay up and follow the news, and\u0026nbspit is thought to affect a vast proportion of the population.Usually, people are forced to wake up much earlier than their biological clock would suggest, as they get up for work. At the weekends, people will often move back again, going to sleep later and making up for it with lie-ins in the morning.This is the reason you\u0027re not sleeping wellNow a new study has found that appears to be causing social jet lag, where people are disrupting their sleep pattern between the week and the weekend.The new research came from a study that looked at\u0026nbspthe Twitter activity of more than 246,000 users from 2012 to 2013. Those tweets were tagged with geographical location, allowing researchers to use them to understand when people were going to sleep and waking up.It found that people across the US seemed to sleep in and tweet later during times that saw large amounts of holidays. Previously, scientists had suspected that social jet lag might change with the seasons and the amount of daylight – and while it does differ through the year, that appears to be more a consequence of the way people\u0027s social schedules change, rather than anything seasonal in itself.We started the study expecting it to be a solar or seasonal effect – that your internal clock will shift in the summer and that will lead to decreases in social jet lag, said Aaron Dinner, professor of chemistry and one of the study\u0027s senior authors. But in fact, that\u0027s not what we found at all. People get up later on weekdays in the summer because their social constraints are relaxed. Weekend behaviour – and presumably a person\u0027s biological clock – does not change much over the year in most counties.The researchers also found that the data about sleep correlated with obesity rates: places that tweeted until later also saw higher rates of obesity. They also correlated with sleep data taken from more traditional studies.I was impressed that so much could be learned from this purely public data set that was not at all intended to tell you about sleep, said Michael Rust, associate professor of molecular genetics, cell biology and physics and the study\u0027s other senior author. In fact, we could rediscover things like the correlation with obesity or levels of social jet lag based on time zone that were found in other studies where people designed surveys to ask about sleep directly.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We are not elected to do what we want, we are elected to do what’s in the national interest.“Ultimately I hope that across parliament we recognise that a deal is better than no deal. Businesses do require certainty, confidence as they go forward for their planning.“And there are those round the world who are waiting to get certainty also to begin to discuss trade agreements with the United Kingdom. It is in our national interest.”Catherine Stihler, Labour MEP and Best for Britain champion, said the comments served to underline why there is need for new referendum on Brexit.She went on: “This is a rebuke to the hardline Brexiteers who want to push Britain over the cliff-edge. It demonstrates the extent of the civil war engulfing the Tory Party.“A no-deal scenario would undoubtedly be more calamitous than a deal approved by EU member states, costing hundreds of thousands of jobs. But there is no such thing as a good Brexit deal. The only way to protect jobs and grow our economy is as part of the EU.”Ms May’s defacto deputy David\u0026nbspLidington\u0026nbspalso hit the airwaves to tel Tories plotting against her they should instead rally behind the Prime Minister in the “national interest”.Cabinet Office minister \u0026nbsppraised Ms May’s resilience in carrying out the “absolutely back-breaking job” of delivering a\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspdeal for the United Kingdom.Created with Sketch.

I have spoken to colleagues as well and I think we are probably not far off. I think it is probably imminent,” he told BBC2’s Politics Live.He acknowledged he had sent a WhatsApp message to colleagues earlier saying that his count was over 48, with around a dozen probables, but admitted the number was probably inaccurate.He said that only Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee, knew the true figure.Mr Baker added: “My number will be inaccurate because people will withdraw letters, they will tell me they have put letters in when they haven’t, they will take them out and not tell you they have taken them out.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

For these reasons I cannot support the proposed agreement in parliament and would hope that Conservative MPs would do likewise.”The cabinet’s backing, however, means the EU are set to give the green light to a\u0026nbspEuropean Council\u0026nbspsummit at the end of November, which if successful could see a vote on the draft deal in the house of commons in early December.\u0026nbspThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

A third of those who replied were undecided.\u0026nbspThe majority (63.3 per cent) backed a second referendum when asked how the government could give people a say on the terms of Britain’s exit from the bloc, while 10.9 per cent suggested a public consultation.About 10 per cent said they trust the government to do a good job, and 7.4 per cent said the UK should just leave the EU.Kajal Odedra, executive director of change.org UK, said people feel “bombarded but gagged by Brexit”, regardless of whether they voted to leave or remain in the European Union.EU to decide whether Brits will need visas in event of no-deal BrexitVoters in most vulnerable Tory seats \u0027back fresh Brexit vote\u0027Every day takes us closer to giving the people the final say on BrexitThornberry says Labour could still back Final Say Brexit referendumCorbyn rejects calls for Final Say referendum, despite Labour backlashJohnson insists May can be forced into Final Say referendum on BrexitWriting exclusively for The Independent, Ms Odedra said: “The choices the government makes in negotiations are critical.\u0026nbsp“But they are being made far away from the public with no consultation whatsoever.\u0026nbsp“When we asked change.org users, only 7 per cent of those polled felt they have been given a chance for their voices to be heard since the referendum.“And 85 per cent felt they didn’t have any say in shaping the government’s Brexit strategy.”Leave voters were more likely to feel heard by ministers at about 23 per cent, while only 1.4 per cent of Remain voters said they had been listened to, according to the poll.Young people were also more likely to feel ignored than older voters, the findings show, with just 8.3 per cent of 16 to 24-year-olds reporting that they believe their voices are being heard.Around a quarter of over-65s said they felt listened to, compared to 20 per cent of those aged 55 to 64, and 10.5 per cent of 25 to 34-year-olds.It comes after a special parliamentary event heard that\u0026nbspmore people back a fresh referendum than oppose one in all of the 67 most marginal Tory seats.The YouGov survey of 25,000 people\u0026nbspalso found that a majority of voters in the Labour constituencies that voted Leave in 2016 now back a fresh referendum, by an average of 59 per cent in favour compared to 41 per cent against.It also comes as more than 3,000 people were expected to attend a major rally in London to urge\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspto reject a bad Brexit deal.Cross-party MPs have backed the call,\u0026nbspincluding Tory Jo Johnson, who resigned from government last week over Theresa May’s Brexit strategy, Labour’s David Lammy and SNP\u0026nbspWestminster leader Ian Blackford.Liberal Democrat MP\u0026nbspLayla Moran, who backs the Best for Britain campaign,\u0026nbspsaid: “No one voted for this pathetic little deal which actually hands over our sovereignty, making the UK a rule taker rather than a rule maker. It is the opposite of taking back control.”Caroline Lucas, former Green party co-leader,\u0026nbspadded: “The only solution is to take the final decision out of the hands of deadlocked politicians, away from the backroom deals, and give it back to the public with a People’s Vote.“On Brexit, it’s clear we have a parliament in stalemate that can’t deliver a clear choice for the future. So it’s time to let the British public do it instead.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

This is our number one spending priority and we have already committed to spending more money on the NHS over the next five years.“It will mean £394 million more a week going into the NHS.”However, the PM repeatedly refused to condemn former foreign secretary Boris Johnson for campaigning for Brexit in front of the bus that bore the £350m claim.The prime minister was also subjected to repeated calls to stand down, to\u0026nbspmake way for Brexit-supporting politicians, told the Conservative Party’s coalition partners the DUP would withdraw support unless there was a change of leader, and she was compared to former prime minister Neville Chamberlain, who attempted to make peace with Nazi Germany ahead of the Second World War.In the lengthy appearance, Ms May defended her plan, admitted there had been compromises, but maintained her belief the plan was the best deal for the UK.One Conservative-supporting councillor Dan, from Louth, said Ms May should stand down, saying he commended the PM for trying to strike a Brexit deal with the EU, but sadly that has not worked.He said: “Please Prime Minister, tell me why do you think you should stay on as PM when you have failed - despite your no doubt honourable intentions - to (deliver on) the referendum result?If you cannot do that, I respectfully ask you to do the right thing in the national interest and stand down to allow someone from the Brexit camp to take the lead. There is still time to sort this out.Ms May responded by going through details of the draft withdrawal agreement.She said: “You\u0027re absolutely right that for a lot of people who voted Leave, what they wanted to do was make sure that decisions on things like who can come into this country would be taken by us here in the UK, and not by Brussels, and that\u0027s exactly what the deal I\u0027ve negotiated delivers.”During her half-hour appearance on the show, host Nick Ferrari also told the prime minister DUP leader Arlene Foster had said the party was “ready to withdraw support unless there was a change of prime minister”.“They’ve raised some questions with us, they’ve raised some concerns with us”, Ms May conceded, and added she believed she still had the DUP’s support for the Brexit deal.Agencies contributed to this reportThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

They become the first Khmer Rouge leaders to be held to account by an international court for a campaign of genocide against the Vietnamese and Cham minorities in Cambodia in the 1970s.The court found Khieu Samphan not guilty of genocide against the Cham, for lack of evidence, though he was found guilty of genocide against the Vietnamese under the principle of joint command responsibility.From Newcastle and New Zealand to the Killing Fields of CambodiaThe\u0026nbspKhmer\u0026nbspRouge sought to achieve an agrarian utopia by emptying the cities to establish vast rural communes. Instead, their radical policies led to what has been termed “auto-genocide” through starvation, overwork and execution.The crimes against humanity convictions covered activities at work camps and cooperatives established by the\u0026nbspKhmer\u0026nbspRouge.These offences comprised murder, extermination, deportation, enslavement, imprisonment, torture, persecution on political, religious and racial grounds, attacks on human dignity, enforced disappearances, forced transfers, forced marriages and rape.The breaches of the Geneva Convention governing war crimes, included wilful killing, torture and inhumane treatment.Nuon Chea, 92, was brought by ambulance and Khieu Samphan by van from the nearby prison where they are held.Chea Sim: Politician who left the Khmer Rouge and became a key figureSecret Cambodia diary helped to convict two Khmer Rouge ringleadersHow the west is profiting from modern slaveryCambodian opposition leader released to near-house arrest conditionsSpoilt Cambodian ballot papers seen as protest over ‘sham’ electionLawyer for Cambodia tourists says they should be deported not jailedThe prison and the courthouse were custom-built for the use of the tribunal, which is officially called the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia, or ECCC.Both defendants were present, as Judge Nil Nonn opened the proceedings, but Nuon Chea suffers heart problems, so was granted permission to later move from the hearing room to a separate holding room.Khieu Samphan, 87, was present for the entire hearing and with the help of two security guards stood as his sentence was read, showing no obvious emotion.A large crowd of spectators attended Friday’s session, including members of the Cham minority.Lah Sath, a 72-year-old Cham man from the eastern Kampong Cham province, brought his wife and four young granddaughters to Friday’s session.He said he often heard people talking about the trial and sometimes watched it on TV, but decided it was time to see it with his own eyes.Just talking about the Khmer Rouge brought back horrible memories of life during those years, he said.The Cham were treated as enemies and exploited without mercy as they were forced to do intensive farm labour, he recalled.Lah Sath said his younger brother was killed by Khmer Rouge for failing to take good care of a cow.In addition to Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan, the tribunal has carried out one other prosecution, resulting in the 2010 conviction of Kaing Guek Eav – known as Duch – who, as head of the Khmer Rouge prison system, ran the infamous Tuol Sleng torture centre in Phnom Penh.Additional reporting by APShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Or do you think the Prime Minister has broken promises and ultimately left the UK at the mercy of Brussels? The under-pressure Prime Minister cleared the first hurdle when Cabinet ministers finally approved the draft terms of her agreement with Brussels after a marathon five-hour meeting, which stretched on far beyond its expected time. Reports suggested as many as a third of the 28 ministers attending voiced doubts about the draft agreement drawn up by UK and EU negotiators after 19 months of talks in Brussels.

We do not agree on all those choices, but I respect their views.It comes after the Prime Minister stood on the steps of Downing Street last night and warned MPs that if they failed to back it in Parliament, the UK could crash out of the EU without a deal or not leave at all.Offering the nation an ultimatum,\u0026nbspTheresa May\u0026nbspsaid: \u0026ldquoThe choice before us is clear - this deal, which delivers on the vote of the referendum, which brings back control of our money, laws and borders, ends free movement, protects jobs, security and our Union or leave with no deal, or no Brexit at all.\u0026nbspBrexit news: Dominic Raab has resigned over May\u0027s Brexit deal  (Image:  )Following the release of the 585-page agreement document, prominent Tory Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg - the leader of the pro-Brexit European Research Group (ERG) - wrote to all Tory MPs urging them to vote against it.The ERG, led by Mr Rees-Mogg, claims it has 80 MPs ready to vote against what it sees as Mrs May\u0027s capitulation to Brussels.Mr Rees-Mogg yesterday directly raised the spectre of a leadership challenge to Mrs May during a Commons debate.The leading Brexiteer highlighted areas of the deal where he said the honourable Prime Minister had reneged on promises over leaving the customs union, maintaining the internal integrity of the UK and leaving the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.He told MPs: As what my right honourable friend says and what my right honourable friend does no longer match, should I not write to my right honourable friend the member for Altrincham and Sale West?This was a reference to Sir Graham Brady MP, the chairman of the Tory 1922 committee, to whom MPs must write to express no confidence in a leader in order to trigger a challenge.Meanwhile, rumours have continued to swirl at Westminster that the tally of Conservative MPs who have submitted letters of no confidence in Mrs May is about to reach the 48 threshold needed to trigger a vote on her position.Sources said the delivery of letters to the chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee Sir Graham Brady was imminent, with a total of 48 needed to trigger a vote on the Tory leader\u0026rsquos position.Brexit news: EU leaders will agree the Brexit plan on the 25 November  (Image:  )Speaking outside 10 Downing Street minutes after the crunch Cabinet meeting concluded, Mrs May acknowledged she faced difficult days ahead as she prepares to seek the backing of the House of Commons in what is expected to be the toughest vote of her parliamentary career.\u0026nbspShe said: I firmly believe, with my head and my heart, that this is a decision which is in the best interests of the United Kingdom.But with Mrs May\u0026rsquos Cabinet giving the green light to Britain\u0027s Brexit blueprint, it clears the way for the special Brexit summit in Brussels for EU leaders to approve the deal later this month.European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker issued a statement that decisive progress had been made, clearing the way for a special summit for leaders of the remaining 27 EU states to rubber stamp plans.\u0026nbspBrexit news: Theresa May faces the fiercest battle of her political career (Image: EPA )The European Council will hold an extraordinary summit in Brussels on November 25 to finalise the UK\u0027s withdrawal agreement, council president Donald Tusk confirmed.This is when leaders of the remaining 27 EU states will be asked to put their stamp on the document and the agreement will then be sent for ratification to both the Westminster Parliament and the European Parliament.The British Government would hope to stage a vote in the House of Commons before Christmas, and if every obstacle is cleared, the deal would come into effect in time for the UK\u0027s departure on March 29 2019.It is expected the debate will stretch over several days and will end in a meaningful vote, possibly in early December, before the next scheduled European Council summit on December 13.

Then, on August  his Somerset home was vandalised. Heres his story.Jacob Rees-Mogg is a backbench Tory MP for North East Somerset but is better known for his period drama persona which has been winning him fans.He entered parliament during the  General Election after working as a fund manager in London.During the EU referendum, he was a passionate Brexiteer and made many high-profile media appearances arguing for a vote to leave the EU.To say he was born into a privileged position is an understatement - he is the Eton and Oxford-educated son of the long-serving Times editor William Rees-Mogg.During the  General Election Rees-Mogg attracted ridicule.This is because he brought his faithful nanny along with him as he battled to be elected in the working class and staunchly Labour seat of Central Fe.He has batted away speculation that he would challenge Theresa May for the leadership of the party, insisting he was completely loyal to her.Rees-Mogg said he was more likely to become POPE than PM.On October  he also said changing Conservative leader could cause more problems than it solves and the party should back May.He said the Torys lack of a parliamentary majority meant it would be dficult for an alternative leader to push through an ambitious Brexit deal.Outside the political arena, Jacob is a family man with six children.His we is journalist Helena de Chair, daughter of the aristocrat Somerset de Chair.He celebrated the birth of his sixth child with a touching picture on Instagram in September .He wrote: Helena and I announce with great joy that we have a baby Sixtus Dominic Bonace Christopher, a brother for Peter, Mary, Thomas, Anselm and Alfred.In May  it was reported by The Mail on Sunday that he had purchased a new £million house just around the corner from No  Downing Street.The five-storey mansion is just a short walk away from the Parliament and is also close to Tory HQ in the heart of Old Westminster.Rees-Mogg joked he had been priced out of swanky Mayfair and needed a bigger home for his six children.Rees-Mogg named his sixth child Sixtus, which is a Roman name meaning polished.It is also the name of a Pope and Saint.His full name is Sixtus Dominic Bonace Christopher .Sixtus eldest sibling is Peter Theodore Alphege, who was born in .Jacobs only daughter Mary Anne Charlotte Emma came along a year later followed by Thomas Wentworth Somerset Dunstan in  and Anselm Charles Fitzwilliam in .His fth child, Alfred Wulfric Leyson Pius, was featured in a video as his father tried to teach him how to say Brexit.Alfred was born in February .In September , a thug shouted at the children your daddys a horrible person outside their London home.It happened on August , , when the Rees-Mogg family were on holiday in the US.According to the police, graffiti was sprayed on a building and on a car as well as the garden.They managed to write posh scum on windows of the house.The MPs th Century country home, called Gournay Court, is a listed building.He also owns a £.m house in Westminster.Due to his strict Catholic beliefs, Mogg admitted on ITVs Good Morning Britain that he did not support abortion even in the case of rape and incest.I am completely opposed to abortion, le begins at conception, he said.Abortion is morally indefensible.The MP has also repeatedly voted against sex marriage legislation.He defended everyones right to free speech, and insisted thathe ever became Prime Minister, the law is not going to change.Soon after Rees-Mogg made his remarks it emerged the millionaire MP was making money out of an abortion pill despite his strong stance against it.Somerset Capital Management, the investment company he co-founded, owns nearly £million of shares in Indonesian firm Kalbe Farma.Reacting to the story, Rees-Mogg told The Mirror: This is not something I would wish to invest in personally but you have a duty as an investment manager not to impose constraints on investors.He added: This company does not procure the abortion of babies.It’s not my money in these investments and I profit from the total amount of client money we hold, not the investments we make.The Made in Cha star and  Im A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here winner has admitted she has the hots for Rees-Mogg.In an interview with the Sunday Times, Georgia Toff Toffolo revealed the politicians she admired “the standard - Zac Goldsmith, Jacob Rees-Mogg. I fancy them all, adding: Jacob’s a sex god.”The reality star elaborated: “The human mind can be sexy. He’s so clever, I just love him, adding: “I fancy middle-aged politicians, but I’ve never been with one.”Rees-Mogg has responded to news of the -year-olds crush, saying he was “greatly surprised but nonetheless flattered” by the revelation.“I am glad Miss Toffolo won and hope this is the launchpad for a glittering career,” he added.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

but the EU has warned that would render the mechanism pointless.It would ensure that no tarfs, quotas, rules of origin or customs processes would be applied to UK-EU trade.At the same time the UK would be able to strike free trade agreements with other countries.On November , thereported that Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab demanded the right to pull Britain out of the EU’s Irish backstop after just three months.The paper claimed the hardline pitch to the Irish government “stunned” Irish officials.Its claimed Mr Raab’s proposal was put to the Irish deputy prime minister Simon Coveney in a private meeting in London.However, the Irish Prime Minister told Theresa May that he will not accept a Brexit deal which gives the UK the unilateral power to halt backstop arrangements for the border with Northern Ireland.The EU has suggested a backstop that would see Northern Ireland staying in the customs union, the EU VAT system and parts of the single market.This will essentially draw a customs border down the middle of the Irish Sea, potentially damaging the union of the UK.Mrs May has suggested a backstop that will see all of the UK aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time after .Brussels has two issues with Mays plan.The first is that May wants the backstop to come to an end after a certain time period the EU thinks this would be self-defeating as its possible no solution for the Irish border would be found.The EU also thinks this risks leaving Britain benefiting from the customs union and single market for years after Brexit - reaping all the benefits without having any of the obligations that full membership would entail.In June  European leaders said Britain was running out of time to do a deal because of the unsolved border problem.In July Theresa May quoted Shakespeare as she insisted the UK would not be broken up with a border down the Irish Sea. Theresa May has told EU leaders she is looking at ways of keeping Britain under their rules for at least another year as part of efforts to break the Brexit deadlock.Addressing the  national bosses at a tense summit in Brussels on the night of October , the PM said she is “ready to consider” extending the  month transition period after the UK leaves the EU next March.The potentially incendiary move has been drawn up by the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier to try to end a bitter impasse over the Irish border.It would mean abiding by all Brussels rules until December  at the earliest.The news comes after talks on Sunday, October , hit a brick wall once again, as the issue of the Irish border continues to cause a headache for Theresa May.Theresa May has insisted any backstop arrangement must apply to the UK as a whole so not to create a border in the Irish Sea.However, talks broke down after the EU had insisted on a second backstop arrangement - just involving Northern Ireland -the UKs version wasnt ready in time, according to Downing Street sources. Mrs May dubbed the continuing row with Brussels over how to avoid a hard border in Ireland as “the one real sticking point left, but a considerable one”.The Democratic Unionist Party has vowed to oppose any new checks on goods passing between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Irelands Foreign Minister, Simon Coveney, said that EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier indicated that the European Union will allow extra time for talks about the border.Mr Coveney said he was frustrated and disappointed that it was going to take more time than people had hoped.On November , , the PM faced crunch Cabinet showdowns with her ministers where she will set out the details of the agreement she struck with Brussels the previous day.A number of pro-Brexit ministers are feared to be on the brink of walking out over the deal.They believe it would leave Britain tied to the EU customs union for years to come, because of the controversial Irish backstop arrangement.If the Cabinet does block Mrs Mays deal, she could find her position is untenable - leading to a Tory leadership crisis."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT0003730276661-e1541888658682.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"labour mp lives in social housing","story":"Shadow development secretary Kate Osamor has faced intense criticism after it emerged that she promoted her son in his House of Commons job, regardless of his conviction for having £, of Class A drugs with intent to supply at Bestival in Dorset last year.Now the Sun on Sunday can reveal that Ms Osamor and her son Ishmael, , are living in social housing in Tottenham, north London -

And what a mother.They say no one is irreplaceable but I think she is — which must be such a lot of pressure for him. In short, he has spent his entire le waiting for his mum to die before he can start his dream job.And in the meantime his le, in some ways, is on hold. He was not allowed to marry the woman he loved and was instead forced into a loveless marriage.And every time he so much as expresses an opinion about anything, he is denounced as being “meddling”.So it’s no wonder that in Prince, Son And Heir, the BBC documentary this week marking his th birthday, Charles was quick to quell concerns that he would be a “meddling” or activist king, saying: “I’m not that stupid.”Declaring the role of sovereign and heir to be dferent, he said he is aware of the constraints he will encounter as king, and says his behaviour will change.I can see why he is saying that, given the amount of criticism that has come his way over the years. But when you think that he was campaigning about issues such as the environment and single-use plastic long before anyone  got on the bandwagon, it might be better to see him as a trailblazer than a meddler.I admire that he has a voice.And when he is king I think he should use it — not be silenced by the pressure of the role.He has a very broad range of knowledge and he is absolutely passionate. We live in a society where everyone has their say — so why shouldn’t he In fact, I thinkhe visited Europe he might help with Brexit.There is no doubt the Queen is a hard act to follow — when the time comes, that is. Now Charles is  he is the longest serving heir to the throne in history. And he may have years to go, as the Queen looks and sounds fantastic .But we should stop maligning Charles and start supporting him.He is a good man and there is no doubt he is dedicated to the job. He is mature enough to know how to do the job well and he certainly knows what is expected of him.He has brought up two fantastic sons that any parent would be proud of.And he really is passionate about changing the world for the better.It has been more than  years since he set up his Prince’s Trust charity.Last year alone it helped nearly , young people get into education, training and jobs. It is simply fantastic.He is deeply committed to his fantastic we, who is very down-to-earth and great fun .He is also passionate about promoting women’s issues, so whatever you think of him you must give him credit for that.I believe very strongly in the monarchy. I would do anything the Queen asked me to do.The Royal Family are a great thing for our country and something to be very proud of.In a world of increasing uncertainty, they are this country’s rock and foundation. We should all get behind Charles and celebrate him as our future king.Apart from anything , we need all the stability we can get. ANYONE living in London will be unsurprised to hear that there are now a record number of people sleeping rough there.Figures show there were , rough sleepers in the capital between July and September – the first time the total has exceeded , in a three-month period.It’s awful and it’s shocking to see people sitting in the cold begging for money.And it’s hard to know how to help. Of course, the temptation is to give money but obviously that’s just a short-term fix.Night shelters are a good short-term solution. Buthomeless people don’t get involved with a network that can really help them, it’s unlikely their circumstances will ever change.My husband Paul volunteers with the fantastic charity West London Mission . It offers homeless people a hot shower, new clothes, a meal and a decent night’s sleep.But it also offers access to project workers who will help people change their circumstances.Its aim is to empower and help homeless people become part of a community, because that’s the start of them getting off the streets, into accommodation, then into work.There are so many reasons that people become homeless. Some have lost their job and can’t afford rent, or they’ve fallen out with family and turn to drink and drugs.They might have mental or physical health problems, a history of abuse or a dficult childhood moving between foster homes.But where there is le, there is hope. Paul has been working with one guy who was homeless and hopelessly addicted to drugs.But, over time, he has got clean, found a place to live and, last week, got a job at a restaurant, which is what he was doing before he got involved in drugs.He’s got his le back, basically. It does happen.Soyou are worried about homelessness, think about donating to an organisation such as WLM. Better yet, volunteer your time and skills.Even just helping someone to fill out a form, which can be incredibly dficult for some people, can make a huge dference and is so rewarding.TODAY is Remembrance Day and I wear my poppy with pride. This year I will particularly recognise all the true heroes from World War One. I thank them for their service, and remember we are always in their debt.It is so important we never forget the sacrice they made and the bravery they showed.I doubt there will ever be another generation like them. AS a rule, I like to live and let live. But I really had to roll my eyes at the story of -year-old Dutch pensioner Emile Ratelband, “who identies as a -year-old” and is fighting to legally change his age by  years so he can get more work and attract more women on Tinder.Emile, above, was born on March , , but says he feels at least  years younger and wants to change his birth date to March , .His argument is thattransgender people are allowed to change sex, he should be allowed to change his date of birth because doctors said he has the body of a -year-old.So does that meanI feel like a supermodel inside, I can I get my job title legally amended Or maybe at  I could identy as  so I can have access to my pension SO the six men arrested for burning an effigy of Grenfell Tower are in hiding and relying on friends and relatives to bring in food and drink. Still, they are yet to speak out – or apologise.What beggars belief is not just that these sick men thought that no one would notice nor care when this footage emerged on social media – but really that they are unhinged enough to do it in the first place.I’m pretty sure about one thing, though. No matter what consequences they will face for their actions from the law, they will never, ever live this down in the eyes of the world – and nor should they.I’m talking about Michael Douglas, . When he was awarded with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for more than  years in the entertainment industry, he gave his father, Kirk, a kiss on the lips to celebrate.In my experience there comes an age when your kids don’t want to kiss you – particularly on the lips and particularly your dad.It’s part and parcel of growing up that your kids don’t even want you to breathe, let alone kiss them.In fact, everything you do embarrasses them. But, given that Kirk Douglas is , maybe it’s just a reminder that things come full circle.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I sense, like the recently axed Big Brother and The X Factor, it’s been living off its reputation for a couple of years.Enjoyable as it’s been, the basic issue with this run has been the lack of a central figure in the mould of Syed Ahmed, Katie Hopkins or the late, great Stuart Baggs to take the series by the scruff of the neck.Some have shown vague promise but the closest thing it’s had to an alpha bell-end is Captain Pangea himself, Kurran Pooni, who was marked out less by his all-round uselessness than by the wrist he broke arm-wrestling back at the house, and his insistence he was “ per cent stepping up as project manager” just before he  per cent stepped down.There was no dodging the bullet, though, last week, when Lord Sugar demanded he PM a marketing campaign “for a noo airline” with accompanying adverts “and a noo unorm as well”.Kurran wasn’t underselling the sense of destiny he felt at this responsibility. “Everything in my le has led to this moment,” he claimed, presumably ’cos he hadn’t done anything  up until that moment.The great thing about this task, though — like all the best Apprentice episodes — was that the laughs were shared round equally.So while advert director Kurran was recreating the Club Tropicana video on Southend seafront, Camilla and Jackie were designing a stewardess’s unorm for the party-themed Jet Pop that wouldn’t see the light of day eveneasyJet suddenly opened a brothel chain in Amsterdam.A horrible thought occurred, though, as she was market-researching at Heathrow.She’s not going to wear that thing pitching to  industry experts at BA HQ, is she  She bloody is, you know.She gave it the full doors-to-manual flirtation as well. So everyone’s mind was already in the gutter before Jackie finished the audience off with the news: “It’s very easy to wipe down, as well.”In the normal course of events, reducing Claude Littner to a helpless giggling wreck would be enough to lose any task.The other team, though, Typhoon, had contrived to come up with something almost as bad, Manage Air, a business-targeted operation whose corporate logo looked like a satanic pentangle and theme tune was AC DC’s Highway To Hell.There was a genuine sense of tension in the boardroom then, which would’ve been ruinedSugar had played it all for laughs.He didn’t, though. He let the contestants hang themselves with their own words before firing Kurran, who could leave with a sense of “job done”.He’s created a bit of Apprentice folklore, after all, and hopefully reminded everyone this show is far from dead.Naturally, in the final taxi scene, he also remained convinced of his genius, boldly declaring: “My advert was gold.”The first and possibly last time in his le where he’s not just  per cent wrong, he’s  per cent right as well.Glorious television.Dianne: “Stephen Fry.”The Time It Takes, Joe Lycett: “Sesame Street’s Big Bird lives in what street ”Oliver: “I don’t know.”Joe Lycett: “A bird in the hand is worth two in the what ”Jon: “Foot.”And Bradley Walsh: “Which former EastEnders star presents the Sky One series Extreme World ”Zoe: “Barbara Windsor.”CELEBRITY Hunted contestant and former Commando Johnny Mercer MP has faced a stark choice this past month.The eternal humiliation of being beaten by Chris and Kem, off Love Island, on the Channel  hide ’n’ seek game.Or two weeks in a confined space with a clearly smitten Kay Burley.Heroically, he chose the latter, enduring her attention and pet namewith the same sort of grit that probably saw him through three tours of Afghanistan.Then, last week, he sneaked off for an unscheduled visit to his we, Felicity, and Burley completely lost her s***.Lost it so badly, in fact, that she threw herself at the mercy of a passing bread truck driver, which led to the best update of the series: “Kay Burley is currently in a -ton lorry, on the M, between junction  and .”She was quickly grassed up, of course, then apprehended at the Warburton’s depot, without the need for a vet or a tranquilliser dart.But while it’s a poorer show without the old mad-whack, there’s still plenty of mileage left in this gripping series.AJ Pritchard is cornered in Shropshire, Olympic silver medallist Louis Smith has just been found hiding in his mate’s Jacuzzi showroomand Baldrick-brained duo Chris  Kemhave somehow given everyone the slip.But as for Johnny Mercer  He’s probably smuggling himself back to the Mouth of Hell fort, in southern Helmand, just for the relative peace and quiet. Paul Merson: “For me it’s six and a half of one and a dozen of the other.”Graeme Souness: “The only one with potential is Martial and Pogba.”Dion Dublin: “Liverpool are in second and a half gear.”And Charlie Nicholas: “Pogba’s either brilliant or a showpony. He played OK last week.”THIS week’s Doctor Who episode introduced us to the Demons Of The Punjab, who turned out to be nothing of the sort.They were just morbid sods who mope around the universe “honouring those who die alone”, like soldiers, holy men and Brendan O’Carroll on For Facts Sakes.No actual science-fiction storyline to speak of then.But that’s not really the point of this viewer-shedding series, which has already got on its high horse about sexism, Donald Trump, American segregationist racism, men giving birth and gun control.Kind of inevitable, then, that the BBC would eventually pour a bucket of its self-loathing sick all over the British Empire, via the partition of India in , with an episode that was every bit as historically powerful as Carry On Up The Khyber.The key dference, of course, was that Bungdit Din and his Burpers weren’t actually being used as a means of brainwashing children.Because If you were expecting Doctor Who to present the flip side of Britain’s relatively benign rule in India , then you’ll also be waiting for the episode where Jodie Whittaker lands in a Soviet gulag and starts teaching children about the brutal idiocy of Marxism.The BBC just doesn’t do anything other than its own left-of-centre view, these days – or irony by the sounds of things.As it’s just been revealed there’ll be no festive episode of Doctor Whobecause it’s “run out” of storylines.Run out  RUN OUT How the hell can a series run out of ideas when it hasn’t had any yet This Morning, Thursday: “Coming up, at quarter to , the rise of the penis filler, Doctor Ranj is here to answer your questions.”The show’s other penis filler, Martin Lewis, will answer them on Monday.IT seems almost wrong to single out just one programme from Sunday’s beautul Armistice Day coverage, but the year’s most meaningful TV awards should probably all go to BBC’s They Shall Not Grow Old, made by Peter Jackson, whose astonishing film gave a voice, laughter, tears and colour to some of the extraordinary men who survived the - trenches.Those of us who watched it, on Sunday, are unlikely ever to forget the experience. Those of you who didn’t, must catch up with it on the BBC iPlayer.Be sure, though, to watch it right through to the credits’ last chorus of Mademoiselle From Armentières, where it names the veterans who have all long since passed but whose memories and souls have never seemed more alive and unforgettable.“It’s quite hard to put your finger on it.”I’ll bet.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s quite unusual in a politician.But then I suppose Trumpo isn’t your usual politician.The US President was at it again in France.The idiotic French President Macron has dug up that idea about a European army, run by those genius minds at the EU.Those of us not keen on the EU always worried about this ridiculous notion — but we were told by pro-EU politicians that it would never happen. Another lie.Macron said Europe should have its own armed forces to guard against interference from Russia, China and — the USA.What a rude and stupid statement to make in the run up to Armistice Day.When French people would do well to remember that it was us — and the Yanks — that saved their benighted country.Sometimes I wonderit was worth it.Trump was right on the case, with one of his famous tweets.He des­cribed Macron’s comments as insulting.And he added thatit wasn’t for the Americans, the French would be speaking German by now. Quite right.And he’s right, too, that the EU nations do not pull their weight when it comes to funding the real alliance against our real enemies, Nato.They all like to snipe from the sidelines at the USA.And resent the Americans for their power, influence and success.And for bailing them out of the last war.But then they expect the yanks to spend vast amounts of money protecting them all.Germany, one of the richest countries in the world, spends only . per cent of its GDP on forces for Nato. That is as pathetic as it is typical.The French themselves spend only . per cent.We’re second only to the Americans in our spending — but even then I would argue that it’s not enough.Our Armed Forces have been cut to the bone over the past two decades.Would we be able to retake the Falkland Islands now,Argentina invaded  I doubt it.The truth is that Nato is the one alliance of which we should be glad to be a member.It is an alliance of largely civilised, largely democratic countries which has held fast against tyrants, despots and warmongers for  years.Most notably, of course, the Cold War, in which the Soviet Union was defeated without a shot being fired.But now Trump is getting a bit tired of Nato because the US always has to spend, spend, spend.And with the Europeans thinking again of having an EU army there are many who think the days of Nato are numbered.That would be a terrible mistake.An EU army to replace Nato It would be bureau­cratic, incompetent and short-funded.And it would surrender before you could say “Macron”.THE Lord Mayor of Sheffield is a ludicrous dingbat called Magid Magid who has been coughed up from somewhere deep in the bowels of the Green Party.Shortly before Remembrance Day he posted a publicity shot of himself online wearing a white poppy and a T-shirt saying “never again!”A good moment, then, to ask the vital question: Have you ever met someone wearing a white poppy who wasn’t a complete and utter moron We wear red poppies to commemorate the terrible loss of le in battle.People wear white poppies to commemorate themselves and their fatuous sensibilities.It’s called showing off.WAGES have risen at the fastest rate for almost a decade.They went up by nearly three per cent in the three months to September, compared to a year earlier – and about time, too. This has been the real problem with our economy.But it looks like we’re on the right track.UH-OH – the Beast from the East is said to be on its way back.You remember late last winter.

She makes £k a year by whispering to people over the internet.Usually stuff like: “Hello sweetheart.”She says it stimulates the listener’s “autonomous sensory meridian response”.Which is perhaps the longest phrase for “penis” I have ever heard.MONICA LEWIN­SKY was the young intern who had an affair with President Clinton, back in the s.Come on – you remember. According to reports a cigar was involved.And Monica had a revealing stain on the front of her dress.She’s been talking about the whole episode again.And she says she thought the stuff on her dress was “spinach dip”.Really  If it looked like spinach dip I think Bill should have got himself off to a doctor, pronto.Are you sure it wasn’t cock-a-leekie ASIA BIBI is the Pakistani Christian woman who was sentenced to death for alleged “blasphemy” against the Prophet Muhammad.She then had her sentence commuted and some Pakistani Muslims are going bonkers, as usual.Demanding she have her head cut off.

Suppose we had to submit to a trade and tarf regime designed solely to benefit the other .I hope both sides could agree that such an outcome would be the worst of all possible worlds. And yet, that is where we appear to have ended up.First, under the transition, we shall explicitly be non-voting members for two years.As Brussels has spelt out with brutal clarity, the only change will be that Britain loses its Commissioner, its MEPs and its vote in Council.Then, under the backstop, that status, or something very like it, will be imposed on us in semi-perpetuity.Surely no one — Remain or Leave — can favour such an outcome.I have been arguing since polling day for moderation.I was prepared to accept any compromise, including European Free Trade Association and including Chequers, provided it restored the supremacy of our laws.But the purgatory that now beckons is surely, by any definition, worse than either staying or leaving.From the start, our objective was simply to reach a deal — any deal.Our negotiators, shell-shocked by the referendum result, approached the talks in a spirit of damage limitation.They never seriously contemplated walking away, and the other side smelt their desperation.To be fair, our officials were not helped by the noises coming out of Westminster.How would you expect EU negotiators to react when senior British politicians urge them to hang tough and force a second referendum We might view Tony Blair, John Major and Nick Clegg as has-beens but, believe me, they are seen in Brussels as men of influence.So we fell into a pattern. Britain would make some new concession in the hope of unlocking a deal.Then Brussels would pocket the concession and demand more and — incredibly — British Remainers would cheer.The UK agreed to hand over more money than was due accepted the EU’s absurd and illogical sequencing made an unconditional security guarantee offered to copy EU standards and promised not to be more competitive than its neighbours.Each time, the EU brusquely demanded “more movement”. Each time, Britain rushed to comply.Which brings us to where we are — facing colonial rule from Brussels, of the sort the EU imposed on Bosnia following the Yugoslav war.I am not one of those Brexiteers who half-favoured no deal all along.On the contrary, I was proposing moderation even before the vote, and have repeated that call many times since.But, paradoxically, our reluctance to countenance no deal has made such an outcome likelier.We have reached the point where the terms on offer are less attractive than either a World Trade Organization-based Brexit or a second referendum. This last point is critical.I suspect that two contradictory arguments will now be wheeled out before wavering MPs.Europhiles will be told that the deal, backstop and all, is better than “crashing out” on WTO terms.Conversely, Eurosceptics will be told thatthey don’t approve the deal, Parliament might vote to extend Article , thus imperilling Brexit.These two lines of argument can’t both be true, of course and, in reality, neither of them is.We’re invited to believe thatBoris Johnson and Jo Johnson, from opposite ends of the Brexit spectrum, both oppose the deal, it can’t be too bad. In fact, both Johnsons oppose it because it is a lamentable failure of statecraft.Boris was no Brexit headbanger: He came out for Leave only after the EU refused to give David Cameron any powers back.And Jo is no Remoaner: He has spent two years in Government trying to deliver a reasonable Brexit. If neither of them will back the deal, that tells us something.There is still time — just — to recover our position.As things stand, the backstop has no legal force.The moment it finds its way into a treaty, it will be binding. If any MPs oppose the current approach, now is their chance to act. There won’t be another.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The public was reassured our sovereignty would not be surrendered to any meaningful degree.The Tory and Labour leaders both knew this was a lie. But they kept quiet when signing us up in  and when holding the first referendum in .Voters were betrayed from the start. And the pattern was set.In  John Major signed the Maastricht Treaty, creating the EU, without risking the public vote that saw it initially rejected by the Danes and Irish.In  Tony Blair — who now shamelessly praises fork-tongued civil ­servants for hoodwinking eurosceptic ministers — feared he would lose a referendum on handing new powers to the EU. So he refused to hold it.His successor Gordon Brown, never big on honesty when a lie served him better, pretended this Lisbon Treaty was too insignicant to bother voters with.The EU is founded on deceit. “When it becomes serious, you have to lie,” says President Jean-Claude Juncker. Voters are bullied into reversing inconvenient referendums or denied a say at all.And so to Mrs May, the Brexit deal her Cabinet agreed last night and the revealing EU leak yesterday which makes crystal-clear Brussels’ intentions to keep us in its vice-like grip for ever.That plan being to lock us into its Customs Union for all time, unable to make our own trade deals, powerlessly swallowing its orders and obeying its rules.Our Government knows we cannot legally escape this central pillar of the EU — which we voted to “leave”, remember — without consent from Brussels that it will never give.This is not some minor afterthought, to be bargained away, which is why MPs rejected it in July. It is crucial to the reclaiming of our sovereignty which a .million majority including many Sun readers, voted for in .It is crucial to our post-Brexit prosperity. It looks crucial, too, to whether the deal lives or dies. Yet, knowing exactly what the EU intends for us, the PM still brazenly insisted yesterday that we WILL make our own trade deals.How, Mrs May  We cannot.

We weren’t egoists.“Our idea was to let others take the credit and keep our heads down. The DEA were looking for glory. This is the first time the British story has been told.”Chandler, who grew up in Seaham, Co Durham, was sent on a perilous assignment.According to publicity on his book: “The cartel bosses operated like a lethal multi-national organisation, with armies of hitmen and myriad spies in ports, airports, police stations and government offices.“Their intelligence systems flushed out turncoats and traitors, and they ruthlessly exterminated their enemies.“Yet Chandler, an HM Customs investigator fluent in Spanish, knew he could only succeed by recruiting local informants, and went out into the field to find them.”Among those informants was a prostitute who provided details to Chandler while they were together.Within four years he had a network of  agents buried deep inside the trafficking organisations.And the result was “unprecedented”, says the publicity.“Their intel led to the arrest of hundreds of narcos and to the seizure of  tonnes of drugs worth a staggering billion .“Chandlers web disrupted the Bogotá mafia who controlled the main airport and boasted they could put anything on a plane, from drugs to bombs.”The team also penetrated the drug crews who raced coke-laden speedboats to the transit station of Jamaica.And, they dismantled teams who smuggled narcotics through coastal ports and identied the so-called motherships, the largest method of bulk transit ever discovered.But, Chandler and his team “faced appalling risks”.There were “treacherous stool pigeons” working for both sides.Some of his Colombian law-enforcement colleagues were abducted, tortured and killed.Chandler, too, faced a grave threat when the crime lords learned he was responsible for a string of interdictions.He admitted to The Mirror that he felt guilty when a key informant – who was married with kids – was fatally shot by hitmen after a mate betrayed him, saying, “he didn’t deserve to die. To some extent I was to blame.”But Chandler continued securing drug seizures, until he finally burned out and his tour of duty came to an end.Two of his best sources were subsequently murdered, and his bosses dropped the entire overseas informant programme.The National Crime Agency is now responsible for stemming the tide of drugs into the UK.Chandler told The Mirror that although alleged Mexican drug lord Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman is on trial in America, he believes the war on drugs has failed.In hindsight, he said, the team’s efforts weren’t worth “a lot of friends” dying as “we are no better off”.Narcos season four, titled Mexico, premieres on Netflix today, with all  episodes available immediately. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Britain should be able to make its own FTA with America, opening that largest of all national markets to free access for British companies.And a free trade agreement with the US would also allow the UK to import American goods at the best available prices.The same applies to China. If Australia can negotiate a free trade agreement with China which gives  per cent of Australian exports to China tarf and quota-free access, then Britain can do the same.Countries such as Japan and Australia are also keen to make free trade agreements with the UK.More than that, both those countries have said they would be delighted to have the UK in the great Asia-Pacic trade arrangement, known as the Trans-Pacic Partnership.That includes  countries from Canada to Australia to Mexico to Singapore.So when you stop to think about it, there is a wealth of opportunities Britain could seize outside the EU, whereasthe UK were to stay in the EU, the EU would negotiate trade agreements on Britain’s behalf.Those agreements,they could be concluded at all, wouldn’t be designed just for the UK they would have to suit all the other  countries of the EU, and we know their interests are often very dferent from Britain’s.The EU sees Brexit as a threat.It fears a liberated Britain would steal a competitive advantage over the EU and that investment, as well as trade, would flow more to Britain’s shores than the EU’s.That, ultimately, is why the EU wants to keep Britain in the customs union.If it does, then Brexit will be no threat the EU will make trade policy for the UK and it will also write Britain’s regulatory requirements.The danger of Theresa May’s agreement with the EU is that it runs the risk of locking Britain into the EU regulatory arrangements and denying Britain the opportunity to negotiate trade agreements.In other words, the UK would gain almost nothing from leaving the EU.On the contrary, it would lose one important thing — the right to have a say over regulations and trade policy.So that’s what all the fuss is about.It would be better to crash out of the EU than be locked indefinitely in the single market and the customs union.Indeed, it would be better to stay in the EU and participate in decision-making than leave but let the EU decide the destiny of British regulations and trade policy. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Britain must retain the power to leave the Customs Union when WE say. Not when Brussels grants us permission — which it has no intention ever of doing.This is fundamental to Brexit, to reclaiming our sovereignty, including the crucial right to make our own trade deals and open up our markets to the wider world. That has always been central to The Sun’s outward-looking vision of Brexit.Yes, this paper wants our Government to control immigration, just like all non-EU nations, but we DO want skilled migrants coming here to boost our economy and better their lives. And, unlike some, we are entirely relaxed about new blue British passports being printed in France.Our Brexit priority is to trade independently beyond the Brussels club. Locked inside its customs union we cannot. And the PM’s “backstop” agreement would give us LESS power to leave this central institution of the EU than ever before. No one can call that taking back control.This is too valuable a prize to barter away. It is vital for our future prosperity and the EU knows it — which is why it was so desperate to prevent it.Michel Barnier now knows this agreement he has extracted from No and wants the EU to sign off faces a heavy defeat here. Mrs May should go back to him, as her ex-Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab suggests, and try again.Fix that sticking point and her deal might just have a prayer.THE Government’s super-soft deal, as it stands, is not a viable or stable future for Britain. Nor is a second referendum that hands Remainers victory.Britain was already staunchly eurosceptic two years ago when we voted Leave despite the onslaught of state-funded pro-Brussels propaganda. The animosity towards Brussels is tenfold now. Even many Remainers are disgusted at the EU’s behaviour — and the capitulation inherent in our deal.How would the nation respondit went ahead  With rage, at the Tories and the EU whose arrogance enforced it.  The beneficiaries would be Ukip, or a party even more extreme, committed to Brexit in full. The deal would not last.Nor would Remain winning a second vote solely through fear of a no-deal.  It would solve nothing and heal nothing. It would cause mayhem and unrest.The anger of million cheated Leavers, and others who recognise a democratic outrage when they see one, would explode.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Mr Dimbleby made a grumbling noise, drawing laughter from the audience in Milford Haven in Pembrokeshire, Wales, as Ms Perry smiled and said: I know you hate it when women talk. As the audience reacted, the Tory MP turned to Mr Dimbleby, who was seated directly to her right, and laughed. Mr Dimbleby told her That’s outrageous, that is outrageous as she continued to chuckle. She then told him I love you, really as she tried to carry on. But Mr Dimbleby stopped her and, drawing applause from the audience, said: “I don’t want you to love me.

Ms Perry appeared on the programme just hours after seven MPs quit ministerial roles amid the fallout from Mrs Mays draft Brexit agreement.

Watching a besieged woman Prime Minister vow to stay in the game despite having more sharp metal chucked at her than a kne-throwers’ assistant, took us back to the steps of the British Embassy in Paris in November  and Margaret Thatcher pledging to “fight on and fight to win”. Like Thatcher, May was facing a potentially fatal revolt from her own MPs due to the party’s deep split on Europe.And once again, as Oscar Wilde said about the death of Little Nell, you had to have a heart of stone not to laugh. It was pure comedy gold.  There was Raab C. Exit, the man charged with coming up with a Brexit deal, resigning over the deal he came up with, Cruella McVey doing what she has sanctioned thousands of workers for doing by walking out on her job, and Jacob Rees-Mogg, like Postman Pat in a Lord Snooty suit, delivering a no-confidence letter in his leader. We waited for Penny Mordaunt to reprise her exit from TV’s Splash! by belly-flopping out of the Cabinet, and played Where’s Govey as the absent Environment Secretary was being touted as the gallant knight to rescue Downing Street’s damsel in distress. Some felt pity for May, on the grounds she has tried to make the best of the impossible hand she’s been served. But not me. She’d called an opportunistic general election nobody had wanted, convinced it would win her overwhelming backing for whatever Brexit she chose.  But she failed abysmally and instead of resigning honourably she crawled to the DUP, writing them a blank cheque which they were always going to cash but honour only on their terms. She promised us strong and stable leadership in the toughest of times, then ruled with less backbone than a tapeworm, her every move governed by fear of upsetting the Jurassic element of her party who, to borrow David Cameron’s description of their soul-mates in UKIP, are “fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists”. The only pity any of us should be feeling, as we survey the wreckage of this drawn-out Tory civil war, is for the country’s youth. They’ve been let down by an older generation whose obsession with the past and fears about the wider world, have saddled them with a poorer future than they deserve. I don’t even blame the majority of Leave voters who were duped into believing this Utopian fantasy called Brexit.I blame the devious liars, dressed up as heavyweight politicians, who conned them.  Never forget that David Davis promised a “no-downside” Brexit with “the exact same benefits” of EU membership, Michael Gove assured us that when it came to deal-making “the UK holds most of the cards” and Liam Fox boasted that getting a free trade agreement with Brussels would be “one of the easiest in history”. How’s that going  In the midst of yesterday’s shambles, Tory Alan Duncan accused “absurd” Brexiteers of helping make Britain “ungovernable”. He’s right. They won’t be happy until they’re doing Vera Lynn impressions in their baths singing “there’ll be huge queues over the side roads of Dover”. But a better description of May’s rabble came last month from Army officer-turned-Tory MP Johnny Mercer, who described his party as a “sh*t-show”. Looking at them sacricing the future of a country they claim a superior love for,I’d say that never in the field of political conflict has such a sh*t-show been so deserved by such a shower of treacherous sh*ts.Enjoy their well-deserved disintegration.

The wound has not healed. Every time we come together briefly, be it Royal weddings, bad weather, strikes or other reasons to rekindle the Blitz spirit, someone comes along to rip the sutures out. Any medic will tell you that an injury left untended for two years will attract flies and disease. The patient will pick at it, and people will be repelled by the odour. And so the schism in the British soul - and Brexit makes us all wonder what being British means, what it is for, andit will last longer than our letimes - has drawn opaquely-funded think tanks, millionaires of questionable finances, friends of Boris and organisms who would have long ago witheredthey did not have this flesh to feast on. John Redwood, a man we thought destroyed in  by his inability to sing the Welsh national anthem, lurched to le yesterday to claim Britain should ignore all legal obligations and debts owed to foreign states and spend the money on itself, with no thought for what that might mean for the debts we are owed by others. Alongside him were other backbench leforms often scratched at but rarely bothered with - Kate Hoey, Peter Bone, Andrew Bridgen, Dennis Skinner, Philip Davies. These are the ones who can be relied on to denounce pretty much anything.  Its the ones who think about what theyre doing, though, who are the biggest worry. Boris Johnson, who broods and plots and composes manestos that are all about Boris. Michael Gove, who wants the world to know hes spent  hours considering his position as though hes the real power behind any throne. And Jacob Rees-Mogg, who clutches his cufflinks while delivering the verdict of medieval autocracy on abortion, incest, and why the Irish need to be put in their place. They appear to actively seek a chaos which will destroy those poorer and less shouty than they are. These are the men who demanded a cake called Brexit, insisted the ingredients were available and method quite clear, but saw no need to check the cupboards or the cookbook. They tied the Prime Ministers hands, stuck a kne in her face and then demanded she ice it, too.  On the Opposition benches are  MPs supposed to offer an alternative to this Tory cannibalism but instead concentrating on how to get a Labour government. Plan A appears to be do nothing, which has the merit of not being dficult but has not, in the  years since they began it, achieved anything beyond nothing. All of these people are prepared to go on TV, into Prime Ministers Questions, and call press conferences to denounce, demand and decry a -page document many of them have not bothered to properly read. If they had, they would not act so surprised, as it is in essence the same draft agreement presented at Chequers four months ago. This threatens the union of our four nations! they complain. This is not what people voted for!  Well, precisely. The fact Brexit heralds the break-up of the United Kingdom, renews the threat of terrorism in Northern Ireland and that the ballot paper was lacking in detail is sort of the problem.And of course this is not what people voted for - because THIS IS NOT THE DEAL. Its just a proposed agreement with the EU to allow us to talk about a deal for another decade, while pretending weve left the EU quicker than is logically possible. But these people who think carefully about their position, who take to the airwaves and send out their friends talking about vassal states and betrayals and a botched deal know this. They know its not the deal, they know it is temporary, and more importantly they know YOU didnt read the  pages either.And it is not as though, for all their talk of changing the Prime Minister, anyone  wants the job.  The Tories want to depose their leader, but have no one who wants to succeed her. They talk about letters that arent written and threats that are never fulfilled, and theyve been performing the same psychodrama for  years without ever once reaching the third act. Labour want to gain power because they believe theyre the good guys, but actually dont because they have no idea what to do about the Brexit cake someone  promised to bake. Corbyns current plan is to tell the EU, which is ready to negotiate a deal, that he doesnt want to, and go back and re-negotiate the transition instead. Meanwhile, the people are wondering where the cake is. They are told the recipes been botched, that the chefs hopeless, half the kitchen assistants have resigned, and the waiting staff are all militant communists. And theres an Irishman sitting in the corner getting angry. What should the British do, in such a restaurant  Half of us sit quietly and hope some sort of cake will arrive eventually, and that it wont kill us outright. And the other half huff, say they never wanted any bloody cake anyway, and vow never to be seduced by such offers again.  And nothings fixed. Families are arguing, the Tories are dying, Labour is withering, businesses are leaving, the pound is crashing. Theresa May has no power, but no escape route either - she has no choice but to limp on, like Jesus carrying his own cross to Caly, and will no doubt have to nail herself to it before anyone decides to end her misery. With her or without her, there is no Brexit agreement the Tories could agree on. There is no alternative Labour is prepared to offer. There is no way to overturn a democratic referendum, yet without a resolution it is inevitable this festering injury will kill us. Were like a couple whose most boring, habitual bicker has propelled them to the brink of orce, and are now wishing theyd never made such a thing of it. Whatever way we look, there is nothing but consequences. If we are to heal there is only one logical, British alternative. We must put politics, teams, tribes, Leave, Remain, his, hers, yours and mine, completely aside.  We need what we always do in times of crisis, a government of national unity to rule in Britains best interest, which is to never talk about any of this ever again. No-one gets to call anyone  a loser. Everyone can say they won. We just decide wed rather be together, and that were all going to be on our best behaviour from now on because harmony is not something to be reckless with. No-one voted to lose Northern Ireland. No-one voted for more Tory warfare. No-one wanted a useless Opposition, people resigning after not doing their job properly and blaming someone  for it, a female PM being beaten up every day by public schoolboys, or an EU that appeared to be more sane and reasonable than us. I love you. Lets never mention Brexit again.

By lunchtime, there’s already a buzz around the tiny Essex village. Unlike generations of politicians, a United Nations investigator, Philip Alston, is making time to visit during a tour of the UK to shyinvestigate the emergence of ‘extreme poverty’. Today, he will report to a disintegrating UK government what he’s made of the harrowing stories he has been hearing across the country. I hope Alston will tell ministers about Rob, a nurse, who developed a serious health condition and found himself assessed by “people who barely have a health qualication” and was found ‘fit for work’.  “In January I applied for ESA,” Rob told the UN man. “It took them seven weeks to tell me they had never received the form.I had to live on handouts. Going to a foodbank, it really does make you feel worthless.” And I hope Alston will tell them about a young disabled woman called Mollie who described “watching poverty crippling my mother”.And Rebecca who spoke about the “hostile environment” of zero-hours work.  And a young woman called Raven who spoke up about “girls with toilet paper Sellotaped into their underwear” during their period. Jaywick, which regularly tops the list of ‘most deprived’ parts of the UK, is well used to being the poster child for poverty. A few days ago, a picture of one of its streets – Austin Avenue – was used on an attack advert by the Republican party in the United States. “They’ve no right,” Doris Telford, , a retired advocate for elderly people says. “They’ve never even been here.” Scott Michael, , nods. “We’re fed up of people saying we’re a shanty town,” he says. “We’re a community.”  A tenant of one of the houses in the picture asks not to be identied. “I didn’t have a choice about moving here,” she says.“The council moved me out of London because of the benefit cap. It’s a good enough place but the houses are falling down.” Built when motoring was in its infancy, Jaywick’s streets are named after cars, and the street plan was designed to look like a car grille. In the s, newly mobile families were able to get to the seaside at weekends, and a shyproperty developer had the idea of selling them land to build chalets on.  During the postwar housing crisis people started moving to Jaywick permanently.Now, decades on, many of these originally shytemporary homes are desperately patched up, or in dereliction, but local spirit remains strong. Even the village’s one pub is called the Never Say Die.  Today, at the Community Centre, built on what was once the boating lake, most of Jaywick has squeezed in to see Mr Alston, the man from the UN, and to hear searing testimonies organised by Unite Community. One man, called Steve, tells Alston he and his we had both been made redundant by the job centre.“The debts just kept racking up,” he says. “We were relying on foodbanks. We could just about afford to feed the kids, but we were missing meals. I felt I needed to provide, as a man, and I couldn’t do it. I didn’t realise how bad it had affected me. “In January , I contemplated taking my own le. I thought no one will miss me, I’m useless. I’m just going to end it.”  When he tried to get help he was told he could only have telephone counselling. Another speaker, Trisha, tried to take her own le after getting pound, into debt. She’d worked her whole le for the NHS but left with spinal problems.Help from Christians Against Poverty made her realise “I’ve got a lot to live for and a lot to offer”.  But she adds: “Now, my area has gone to Universal Credit and I’m struggling again.All the clothes I’ve got on now are from the British Heart Foundation. I was six weeks with no money coming in, living off baked beans.” She finishes sadly: “It’s a lonely world out there.” Wheelchair-user Erin’s family went from “a comfortable middle-class two-income household” to near destitution after she had a brain haemorrhage.The family have found themselves excluded from the rental market because of insidious ‘no DSS’ rules. “So I am to be made homeless,” Erin says. “I don’t where I am going to be putting our -year-old child to bed.This is the hostility faced by disabled people under austerity. We’ve even lost the very human right of a home.” Alston is clearly moved by what he’s heard, and he reassures people their testimonies “are not going to be for nothing”. At the end of the meeting, in carefully chosen words, he echoes one of the final speakers.“Mike says that ‘Austerity is a political choice not an economic necessity’. That’s right. Poverty is a choice. You can choose not to make people poor.” Outside, night has fallen, and opposite the Community Centre the boarded-up Mermaid Inn and the derelict Dolphin Diner are a reminder of what Jaywick once was and could be again, given a fair chance. Today, the world will hear from Alston.How bitterly ironic that while he’s been here one of the politicians most responsible for these stories – Esther McVey, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions – has resigned. Not from shame, but because she now hopes to become Prime Minister.

Instead, it has turned into a national humiliation. All the promises of greater sovereignty and a swashbuckling UK negotiating new trade deals have turned to dust. And one by one the advocates of those promises have resigned and walked away. With the publication of the withdrawal agreement we can now see more clearly the reality of Brexit. Instead of taking back control it turns out to be the biggest voluntary surrender of sovereignty in living memory.  The UK – the fth biggest economy in the world – is faced with signing up to the rules which govern our economy with no say over them - and paying tens of billions of pounds for the privilege. The only argument the Prime Minister can come up with for the Agreement is that it was the best we could get and the alternative of no deal is worse. The Government has tried to tell parliament and the country that this agreement must be accepted because no deal would be an economic disaster and would mean a hard border in Northern Ireland. No deal certainly would be a disaster but the idea that it has to be this agreement or no deal at all is a  choice. Parliament would have the opportunity to halt a slide into a no deal departure and, indeed, the Prime Minister herself has admitted this when she said outside Downing St that “no Brexit” is now an option too. She knows this deal satisfies neither Remainers nor Leavers. For two years this has been a theoretical argument with ious models being pitted against one another. It’s not theory anymore. Now we have an agreement which shows the reality of Brexit and exposes just how distant it is from the promises of its leading advocates. I have never believed the measure of our country’s power is just about our degree of sovereignty. Instead, I believe Britain’s power is magnied by the alliances we have with other countries. But even on its own terms this agreement fails to meet the promises of sovereignty made by those who championed Brexit. I know that many of my constituents voted for Brexit and I understand their anger at lack of opportunity and the sense that the economy was not working for them. I passionately believe that areas like the one I represent need a better deal, with more educational opportunities, better jobs, higher pay, more housing and a bigger stake in the future of the country. This agreement gives them none of that and I do not believe many of them voted for an outcome like this.

But the very first caller challenged her to step down. The man, who identied himself as Daniel from Louth, said he commended the PM for trying to strike a Brexit deal with the EU but sadly that has not worked. And he asked her: Please Prime Minister, tell me why do you think you should stay on as PM when you have failed - despite your no doubt honourable intentions - tothe referendum result  If you cannot do that, I respectfully ask you to do the right thing in the national interest and stand down to allow someone from the Brexit camp to take the lead. There is still time to sort this out.  Mrs May responded by going through details of the draft withdrawal agreement. Youre absolutely right that for a lot of people who voted Leave, what they wanted to do was make sure that decisions on things like who can come into this country would be taken by us here in the UK, and not by Brussels, and thats exactly what the deal Ive negotiated delivers, she said. Later in the programme, another caller thanked her for everything youve done for this country - before telling the Prime Minister shed let Brussels get the better end of the deal, and suggested arch-Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Moggg should take over. Asked whether she had spoken to Environment Secretary Michael Gove about his future in the Government, Mrs May said: I had a very good conversation with Michael yesterday actually. Mrs May said she had discussed the fishing industry with Mr Gove but, asked whether she had offered him the job of Brexit Secretary, she replied: I dont talk about things to do with the Cabinet reshuffle. I havent appointed a new Brexit Secretary yet, but obviously I will be doing that over the course of the next day or so.  Askedpeople would be wise to put bets on Mr Gove getting the job, she told presenter Nick Ferrari: Ive always made it a sort of rule in my le that I dont bet on anything to do with politics. I would advise you not to either. Mrs May explained her comparison of her approach to Brexit to the cricketing style of her sporting hero Geoffrey Boycott. The thing about Geoff Boycott is he was absolutely steady, he kept there at the crease, he carried on and relentlessly went about his goal, and I think thats important, she said. Mr Ferrari said that Boycott had ended his career by being run out by one of his own team, Jim Love of Yorkshire, and asked whether Michael Gove might play the same role in her career.

Its his big moment - the pinnacle of months of campaigning for a hard Brexit he knew the Prime Minister wouldnt deliver. The famously plummy-voiced Old Etonian chairs the European Research Group, a forum for the Tories extreme Eurosceptic backbenchers. Today he wrote to Graham Brady, the chair of the influential  committee of Tory MPs calling for a vote of no confidence in Mrs Mays leadership - and his group urged others to follow suit. Its likely to start an avalanche of similar letters to Brady, andhe gets  therell be a vote. If Mrs May loses the vote, shes out.  So who is Jacob Rees-Mogg - and more importantly, what are his views on issues that arent all about Brexit  Heres a quick reminder. Who is Jacob Rees-Mogg   Parliamentary history geek Mr Rees-Mogg, who even wears a double-breasted suit in family snaps, is the son of a former Times newspaper editor and amassed a vast fortune through his City firm Somerset Capital Management. He has six eccentrically-named children with his aristocrat we Helena, whose ancestors include Charles I advisor Thomas Wentworth and former Prime Minister Charles Watson-Wentworth. A painting of his horse hangs in the National Gallery. Her family inherited the sumptuous stately home Wentworth Woodhouse, which was given a pound.million repair grant by the Tory government last year despite soaring homelessness. Mr Rees-Moggs quirky mannerisms have given him a cult status among Tory activists with one, Ross Atkinson, getting a tattoo of the word Moggmentum on his chest. The Mirror later revealed Facebook rants in which Mr Atkinson complained sex assaults were a cultural norm for refugees.  He sparked fury last year by claiming the huge rise of food banks is uplting. The free marketeer insisted the state cant do everything adding: I think there is a need for some private charity on top of what the state provides. The MP told LBC radio: I dont think the state can do everything that it tries. It provides a base of welfare that should allow people to make ends meet during the course of the week but on some occasions that will not work. And to have charitable support given by people voluntarily to support their fellow citizens I think is rather uplting and shows what a good compassionate country we are. There are two Trussell Trust food banks alone in the MPs North East Somerset constituency, while he lives in a Grade II-listed manor house with Helena, the children and a nanny.  Committed Catholic Mr Rees-Mogg said last year he is opposed to abortion, even for women who have been raped. The traditionalist backbencher said he was “completely opposed” to abortion, adding: “Le begins at the point of conception.” Askedhis opposition was so absolute it included cases of rape and incest, he told ITV’s Good Morning Britain: “I’m afraid so. Le is sacrosanct. It begins at the point of conception, and I think it is wrong.” Labours Yvette Cooper said the idea that the Conservative Party would consider someone with Mr Rees-Moggs views as a potential leader was an appalling thought. She added: Eveybody’s entitled to their own personal views and their own personal views and their own conscience views about an issue like abortion, but for somebody who the Conservative Party seem to be suggesting could be the next Prime Minister to want to control women’s bodies in this way, even in cases like rape and incest, I personally find quite shocking.  Speaking at a fringe event at Conservative Party Conference, he said: “I loathe this idea that we’ve got to give baubles to young people. I think it is so desperately condescending. Young people are not some alien species that we have to treat dferently from other voters.” Of Labour he added: “Of course they want to give everyone free tuition. because they’re socialists. They like spending other people’s money. That’s what socialists do.”  In a  article he said zero-hour contracts were an excellent way for students to find work in the university holiday. People find these contracts could be an important stepping stone from unemployment and welfare dependency to employment, he declared. They benefit business, consumers and taxpayers by keeping costs down. And he claimed Labours campaign against the exploitative measures was the standard response of the left to market forces. And he opposes gay marriage  Last year Mr Rees-Mogg said he supported the teachings of the Catholic church, which opposes same sex marriage, because marriage is a “sacrament.” He added: “The teaching of the Catholic church is completely clear.

This agreement does that.Protect the integrity of the United Kingdom and the peaceful settlement in Northern Ireland by leaving the EU as one United Kingdom, and having no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.This agreement does that as well.Yes, dficult and sometimes uncomfortable decisions have had to be made.I understand fully that there are some who are unhappy with those compromises.But this deal delivers what people voted for and it is in the national interest.And we can only secure itwe unite behind the agreement reached in Cabinet yesterday.If we do not move forward with that agreement, nobody can know for sure the consequences that will follow.It would be to take a path of deep and grave uncertainty when the British people just want us to get on with it.They are looking to the Conservative Party to deliver.To deliver a Brexit that works for the whole UK a strong economy that keeps jobs safe and wages rising and first-class public services we can rely on #x an NHS there for all of us, great schools for every child and the homes that families need.That is what the people we serve expect and that is what we owe it to them to deliver. \",\"author\":[,,,],\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"mainEntityOfPage\":\"https:www.mirror news politics tory-brexit-resignations-live-theresa-\",,,,],\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"mainEntityOfPage\":\"https:www.mirror news politics tory-brexit-resignations-live-theresa-\",,,,],\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"mainEntityOfPage\":\"https:www.mirror news politics tory-brexit-resignations-live-theresa-\",,,,],\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"mainEntityOfPage\":\"https:www.mirror news politics tory-brexit-resignations-live-theresa-\",,,,],\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"mainEntityOfPage\":\"https:www.mirror news politics tory-brexit-resignations-live-theresa-\",,,,],\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"mainEntityOfPage\":\"https:www.mirror news politics tory-brexit-resignations-live-theresa-\",,,,],\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"mainEntityOfPage\":\"https:www.mirror news politics tory-brexit-resignations-live-theresa-\",,,,],\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"mainEntityOfPage\":\"https:www.mirror news politics tory-brexit-resignations-live-theresa-\", say that the Brexit campaigns offered something that #xCwas not on the menu...some of the things you were promised were never there.#xD May says she thinks people recognise that after  years in the EU most of the public recognise it is not going to be an easy negotiation.

He singled out the failures of the Universal Credit as one of the main reasons why people were being pushed into deprivation.  “British compassion for those who are suffering has been replaced by a punitive, mean-spirited, and often callous approach apparently designed to instill discipline where it is least useful, to impose a rigid order on the lives of those least capable of coping with today’s world, and elevating the goal of enforcing blind compliance over a genuine concern to improve the well-being of those at the lowest levels of British society,” he concluded after his -day visit to the UK. Mr Alston said the roll out of the Universal Credit treated “claimants like guinea pigs” and threatened to “wreak havoc in real peoples’ lives.” “I have heard countless stories from people who told me of the severe hardships they have suffered under Universal Credit.  “When asked about these problems, Government ministers were almost entirely dismissive, blaming political opponents for wanting to sabotage their work, or suggesting that the media didn’t really understand the system and that Universal Credit was unfairly blamed for problems rooted in the old legacy system of benefits,” he said. The report draws a bleak picture of austerity Britain.  Mr Alston said during his visit he has spoken to people who “depend on food banks and charities for their next meal, who are sleeping on friends’ couches because they are homeless and don’t have a safe place for their children to sleep, who have sold sex for money or shelter, children who are growing up in poverty unsure of their future.” He continued: “I’ve also met young people who feel gangs are the only way out of destitution, and people with disabilities who are being told they need to go back to work or lose benefits, against their doctor’s orders. The UN report noted that cuts to local government had seen hundreds of libraries closed, community and youth centres shrunk and underfunded, and public spaces and buildings including parks and recreation centres sold off. “I was told time and again about important public services being pared down, the loss of institutions that would have previously protected vulnerable people, social care services that are at a breaking point, and local government and devolved administrations stretched far too thin. “The Government has remained in a state of denial, and ministers insisted to me that all is well and running according to plan.”  When it was announced the UN was investigating poverty in the UK, the Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg said: “Surely the UN has better ways of wasting money ” A Government spokesman said: “We completely disagree with this analysis. With this Government’s changes, household incomes have never been higher, income inequality has fallen, the number of children living in workless households is at a record low and there are now one million fewer people living in absolute poverty compared with . “Universal Credit is supporting people into work faster, but we are listening to feedback and have made numerous improvements to the system including ensuring . million households will be up to pound better off a year as a result of raising the work allowance.“We are absolutely committed to helping people improve their lives while providing the right support for those who need it.” "},{"url":null,"title":"single mum shares devastating moment","story":"NewsMum shares devastating photos of stillborn baby boy to warn women to listen to their bodiesWARNING: Distressing images.

Kristy Watson, from Victoria in Australia, made the decision to post the photos on Facebook in the hope that no mother, no family ever has to go through the pain, heartbreak and loss she has suffered. The -year-old cafe worker said it was dficult to come to terms with being pregnant as a single mum, following three dficult miscarriages, but calls it the most beautul experience. She praised her body for being strong enough to carry a baby when she didnt believe she could, but  weeks into the pregnancy she had an inkling something was wrong. I knew something wasn’t right, she explained. From the horrible swelling in my feet hands and face, the headaches that lasted weeks on end, the blurry vision, my blood pressure going up and down I knew that this weren’tjust normal ‘pregnancy symptoms’.  But after numerous amounts of doctors visits, in and out of hospital, even trying to contact another hospital for a second opinion I was told it was just normal. Kristy claims that for the next six weeks she was repeatedly sent home after sharing her concerns with doctors. It was not until a nurse sat down on the end of her bed,  weeks and five days into the pregnancy, that she found out she had pre-eclamspia, a condition that causes high blood pressure and protein in the urine. The nurse also told Kristy that her baby no longer had a heartbeat. Three days later, she was induced and endured a -hour labour before finally getting to hold her leless baby boy, who she named Kaycen. She bathed him, dressed him in his baby clothes and lay him in a cot surrounded by teddies.  She warned women to listen to their gut, fight for answers and make sure theyre listened to. I felt my sons last movements on the th of July around . to then not be able to find a heart beat the next morning at am, Kristy said. I had to go from having my whole le line, my world move around and be healthy in my belly to then be induced to deliver my sleeping baby. I had lost my gorgeous little boy due to the system letting me down and not listening to me when I knew something was wrong. I had to watch my family be so heartbroken over the loss of their nephew, grandson and cousin and myself because no one cared enough to help when I needed it. I want people to know my story so they know when their gut is telling them that something is not right to fight for answers, to travel back and forth until they know what is going on, to make sure they are listened to. Because I now have to go home to a nursery full of everything I needed to raise my little boy.  To an empty cot that my son never got to lay in, to books I never got to read him, to his favourite outfit I never got to dress him in all because I was not heard. I now go home empty handed with a heart so broken that it’s going to take a long time to heal. She ended her heartbreaking post with an appeal to other women to listen to what their bodies are trying to tell them - and insist that doctors check them over until they have an answer. Please listen to your bodies, I know some people don’t have to go through the stress I had to go through weeks leading up to my sons death. We have to look after ourselves just as much and I couldn’t imagine any other mother having to feel like they failed their child like I’ve had to. She added: Please feel free to share, I don’t want this post to be looked at as a blame on anyone. I want people to know what I went through and in any way help prevent such a thing happening to someone !

Having had the misfortune to be born a woman in a world dominated by male writers such as Proust and Gide, Colette was France’s most famous novelist they’d never heard of until she finally revealed her secret identity as author of the period’s best-selling books – along with her breasts. Played by Keira Knightly in the new bodice-ripper Colette, the th century IT girl’s journey from innocent provincial child bride to gender-bending Moulin Rouge showgirl wouldn’t look out of place in today’s celebrity gossip columns. She loved to eat sushi, went to an acupuncturist, and even famously had a facelt in the s when she was in her mid s. At a time when th century French ladies were constrained by corsets and edicts of etiquette and decorum, the beautul and searingly-clever Colette courted controversy with her freethinking and debauched lestyle, throwing caution – and often her clothes – to the wind.  Born the youngest of four in  to a well-heeled bohemian family in Burgundy, France, the actress, writer and journalist was no lover of society’s rules, breaking most of them – and plenty of both male and female hearts – along the way. “You will do foolish things but do them with enthusiasm,” Colette is quoted as saying. Taking a leaf out of her own book, she had three husbands, many lesbian affairs, and when she retired from cavorting around half naked on stage in the name of art, turned her cougar attentions to younger men, including her teenage stepson. Her full names was Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette and she is probably best known for her  book Gigi, which was turned into a Hollywood stage and screen musical and starred Maurice Chevalier’s decidedly dodgy song “Thank ’eavan for leeetle girls” in the  film version. But in a case of art imitating le, Colette’s first series of semi-autobiographical erotic novels about the awakening desires of a country girl called Claudine were published under her charlatan husband’s name – and became an instant hit in turn-of-the-century France.  Unworldly village girl Colette was just  years old when she met -year-old Henry Gauthier-Villars in Burgundy – and was seduced by the notorious Parisien playboy. The couple were married four years later in  before the dashing cad, played by Dominic West in the film, whisked her back to his Paris lair. Plunging his new young bride into the city’s louche literary scene, it wasn’t long before Henry spotted Colette’s writing talent and put her to work along with his team of ghostwriters. Despite Henry’s dubious claims to be an author, the unfaithful rake suffered from permanent writer’s block and took all the credit for his young we’s work under his rather apt pen name Willy. The erotic bonkbuster Claudine was an overnight success, and over the next few years the couple enjoyed a wild hedonistic lestyle financed by the proceeds of Colette’s bestselling series of novels about the young heroine’s exotic sexual adventures.  After one meacutenage agrave trois too many and finding out she and her husband shared the same woman lover, Colette insisted on being outed as the real author of the books. When she refused to continue writing, Henry reverted to Victorian husband and locked her in a room until she put pen to paper again. Eventually she left him and they orced in , but Colette still didn’t see a penny of the royalties from her Claudine books. Refusing to let a little thing like lack of money stand in her way, Colette took off with her beautul aristocratic lesbian lover – known as Missy – and made ends meet by embarking on a flamboyant stage career in the French music hall scene. If baring a breast during her act didn’t quite make her famous enough, Colette’s notoriety was sealed when riots broke out outside the Moulin Rouge after she kissed Missy on stage. It was a publicity stunt that has been copied often since then by many modern day female celebrities, including Madonna and Britney Spears, who recognise a sapphic short-cut to promote an album when they see one.  By this time Colette had published her first successful book The Vagabond under her own name but it wasn’t until she was married to her second husband Henry de Jouvenel, the editor of French newspaper Le Matin, in  that she started writing again in earnest. She was also surprised to find herself pregnant at  with her first and only child, Colette de Jouvenel, whom she nicknamed Bel-Gazou. Little Bel-Gazou often spent time alone in her father’s chateau while her parents were working in Paris during World War I – Colette writing for newspapers and Henry on diplomatic missions.  The marriage eventually failed when Bel-Gazou was  years old, not because of the couple’s long-distance relationship, but because Colette had seduced her -year-old stepson Bertrand de Jouvenel. In his memoirs, Bertrand later enthusiastically describes the night he lost his virginity to his stepmother. Accidentally on purpose meeting him on the stairs on the way to bed, the lustful -year-old told the teenager: “It’s time for you to become a man.”  It’s just as well that Colette led such a colourful le, as much of her work was based on her own sexploits. In  she published Cheacuteri, a tale about love between an aging woman and – funnily enough – a very young man. The fabulous La Belle Epoque period in Paris set the scene for much of Colette’s novels throughout the s and s, and she finally achieved critical acclaim for her writing. However, despite being known for her love affairs and outrageous bed-hopping, cat lover Colette was perhaps at her happiest with her feline pets, once saying, “Our perfect companions never have fewer than four feet.” Not one to be put off by the temporary nature of her marriages, in , aged , Colette wed her third and final husband Maurice Goudeket, who at  was  years her junior.

Watership Down changed the way a generation of children saw their fluffy pets, after getting to know, among others, psychic ‘seer’ Fiver, super smart Blackberry and the brutal and merciless General Woundwort. And it left millions with nightmares after witnessing bunny blood and gore from the start, including rabbits buried alive by bulldozers, bleeding in snares and tearing each other’s throats out. The terror was so much that scenes have reportedly been deliberately toned down in the new BBC Netflix adaptation, starring James McAvoy, Gemma Arterton and Sir Ben Kingsley, which is released next month.  For those who still shiver at the mention of Watership Down, it may come as a surprise to know that Richard Adams’ novel, later made into a film and TV series, was actually based on his own real le experiences. Many of the animals, he later revealed, were modelled on officers from the C Platoon in  Company’s Seaborn Echelon, which the writer commanded as a lieutenant in the Second World War. And many of the gruesome stories in Watership Down also came straight from real le, and specically the Battle of Arnhem, fought over nine days in September  and in which nearly , Allied soldiers were killed, including in Adams’ company.  In his autobiography published in  the author revealed for the first time the real-le identities of two of the rabbits. Hazel, the leader of the band of rabbits who leave their home to found a new warren, was inspired by Adams’ commanding officer, Major John Gford, who he described as “brave in the most self-effacing way” and an “excellent organiser” who rarely raised his voice, just like his novel’s leading character. Gford survived the war, as did Hazel in Adams’ adventure. Warrior rabbit Bigwig, meanwhile, was based on Captain Desmond “Paddy” Kavanagh, who Adams said was “afraid of nothing”, a “sensationalist” and “by nature entirely the public’s image of a parachute officer.  Kavanagh was killed in action aged just  while providing covering fire for his platoon in a battle outside Oosterbeek, according to the author. In the novel, Bigwig was seriously wounded in a final battle with the terrying monster rabbit General Woundwort, but survived his injuries to become the warren leader - perhaps Adams’ way of honouring his brave real-le friend. Adams also hinted that Fiver, whose frightening vision of impending doom inspires the group’s perilous adventure, is actually based no himself. He said in  that he “identied more” with Fiver, saying he was “rather timid and not much of a fighter… but able to contribute something in the way of intuitive knowledge”.  Today regarded as a modern day classic, Watership Down actually started le as a spontaneous tale he made up to keep his two daughters happy on a long car ride to Stratford-on-Avon. The family was going to see Judi Dench in a production of Shakespeare’s Twelfth Night. After his eldest demanded a story to pass the time, he remembered: “I just began off the top of my head. “‘Once upon a time there were two rabbits, called eh, let me see, Hazel and Fiver, and I’m going to tell you about some of their adventures’. What followed we really the essence of Watership Down.” The story continued over the next few months during the school run, with Adams forming the narrative in his mind as he lay in bed, ready to tell the girls the next morning.  On his daughter’s request, Adams, then  and a civil servant, eventually put pen to paper  months later. Even back then, the story of Hazel, Fiver and the other bunnies sometimes left his daughters scared and unable to sleep, while his we Elizabeth even tried to get him to take out the scene in which Bigwig gets caught in a snare. But Adams later said he wanted the novel to be frightening, explaining to a fan: “Good stories ought to be exciting andthey are exciting they are inevitably scary in parts”. But the novel almost didn’t make it into print after Adams’ manuscript was rejected by at least seven dferent publishers. It was finally picked up by Rex Collings, a one-man publishing outfit in London. Collins wrote to a friend at the time: “I’ve just taken on a novel about rabbits, one of them with extra-sensory perception. Do you think I’m mad ” Originally entitled Hazel and Fiver, Collings who was the first to suggest the name Watership Down. In , Collings printed as many books as he could afford, a run of , - and they sold out immediately. The book went on to win the Carnegie Medal and theChildren’s Prize, before being adapted into an animated feature film in , and a television series which ran from  to .  Today, the book has been translated into  languages and sold more than  million copies worldwide. And who can forget Bright Eyes, Simon and Garfunkel’s folky theme song, which stayed at No in the UK for six weeks in , selling over a million copies  The song, however, has not proved to be so enduring, and will be replaced by a new song performed by Sam Smith for the new remake. Perhaps less well known is that the book also spurned a Dungeons and Dragons-type role-playing game. In Bunnies  Burrows, participants pretended to be “intelligent rabbits” trying to survive food shortages and outsmart humans. The success of Watership Down allowed Adams to live comfortably on the royalties, first as a tax exile at Lhergy-Dhoo on the Isle of Man, then in Whitchurch, Hampshire, until his death in  aged .

Little William Weir told his mum Carrie, , he wanted to write to the burger chain after she told him how bad the toys were for the planet. After mentioning his pledge to teachers and friends, William was invited to read his letter during assembly to Dunchurch Infant Schools  pupils - many of whom are now joining him in taking a stand. The youngsters articulate and thoughtful comments prompted McDonalds to invite William and his sister Francesca, four, to a feedback group to get their thoughts on restaurants environmental innovations.  Carrie and husband Neil, , filmed a heart-warming video of their son explaining why he had written the letter in which he said he likes seeing the beautul fish in the sea and doesnt want it to end. The family are calling on others to join them in taking a stand against the toys, which Carrie says are just plastic rubbish and usually go unused by most children. Carrie, from Rugby, Warks, said: He sat at the table to write it. I helped him construct it but it is all his writing and all his thoughts. I said I would send it to McDonalds and share it on some sites online to seeit made any dference. He was quite excited about this and went into school to tell everyone about it. Everyone thought it was really good, even the teachers. I asked himanyone asked him why he feels this way, what he would say. He said well I am seven and I would like to live until Im  and have children. And I would like for there to still be a planet for those children.  Those are his words and thoughts. It is quite profound. The parents I’ve spoken to said their children are now starting to ask to not have the toys after hearing about Williams letter. I thinklots of children did what William and Francesca are doing then McDonalds would get rid of the plastic in the Happy Meals. That is how things change these days. Things change because of public perception so it would changeit was highlighted as something bad that McDonalds is providing these toys that no one cares about. Happy Meals had previously been William and Francescas go-to choice when visiting McDonalds but last week Carrie noticed their plastic toys remained untouched.  So Carrie decided to explain to the children how damaging the plastic toys are for the environment and suggested they no longer buy themthey didnt want to play with them. Carrie, a financial project lead, said: When we got home from school William said he wanted to write a letter to them about it. For a seven-year-old to say that this is what he wants to do when he comes home from school, I thought was quite profound. They are very environmentally conscious around the house. They use re-usable bags, re-usable bottles and we avoid buying products that are covered in plastic. After hearing about how milk was produced, William has drank oat milk since and even only has milk-free gelato. They make their own decisions based on the facts. We allow them to choose things themselves. If they say they want chicken or meat instead of vegetarian dish, thats their choice.  Carrie believes children only like the idea of the toys and in reality wouldnt miss themthey were no longer included, or were not made from plastic. Carrie said: The toys often dont work. The kids might look at them for  seconds but that would be it. Kids only like the idea of them, but then they realise they are plastic rubbish and they dont matter. There is not any use or value to them at all. McDonalds could choose to say thatyou choose not to have the toy, then p from every Happy Meal you buy without the toy will go towards cleaning up the oceans. People would still buy the Happy Meals but not end up having to throw out a plastic toy that no one cares about.  Ian Dewes, executive headteacher at Dunchurch Infant school and Nursery, was so impressed by the way William spoke to the school that he believes he could have a future as a politician. Mr Dewes said: William came in with his letter and explained, very articulately considering his age, what hed written and the reasons behind it. Clearly hes very well-informed about environmental matters. I spoke to William and asked himhe would like to speak to the children in assembly about it. Speaking in assembly itself is a fairly daunting thing to do in front of  children, but he was very happy to do that. Children can learn a lot from his letter So he read out his letter and then we asked him some questions about it and he explained it all. It was quite statesman-like really - hes perhaps a budding politician. He had a really good grasp of the issues and could explain it really clearly and concisely and the children were really interested in it. The children straight away were very interested in the subject. It certainly got the children all thinking about [the issue]. Although they all love McDonalds and Happy Meals, they did all admit that the toys are not the sort of things that they keep or used for a very long time. They can learn from Williams talk quite a lot I think.  A McDonald’s spokesperson said: “We really appreciate William and Francesca getting in contact. We would like to assure them that the reduction and use of plastics is a hugely important issue for our business. We are committed to reducing our environmental impact and we can, and want to, be part of the solution – for example with our move from recyclable plastic straws to paper ones. “Happy Meal toys provide fun for children and families playing in our restaurants, but also provide many more fun filled hours at home for a long time too. When families are finished playing with them, they can also be recycled. At points in the year we also offer book promotions swapping out toys for books. Parents can also use the vouchers printed on their child’s Happy Meal box to purchase a book for pound or download an eBook for free. “Sometimes we invite people that have contacted us to come in to discuss our latest ideas and innovations and share their thoughts and feedback, so we will be contacting William and Francesca’s family shortly to seethey would like to participate in one of these sessions.” "},{"url":null,"title":"dad spent 10 000 accidentally","story":"NewsDad who spent £, accidentally transferred into his bank account thought it was ChristmasBailey Waltons account received an unexpected bonus when his girlfriends boss accidentally added an extra  on to her wages, a court heardShareCommentsByHayley Sewell:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsBailey Walton spent £, wrongly sent by his girlfriend Lauren Woods boss in a bungled bank transfer \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA father of two gave away pound, after he was mistakenly sent the money by his girlfriends boss in a bungled bank transaction. Security guard Bailey Walton, , had been struggling to pay back money he blew on betting machines until he discovered the windfall. The father of two thought it was Christmas and over the next month used the forbidden cash to pay off his debts before Lauren Woods boss Joanne Harvey realised the error. It is thought Miss Harvey, who runs a care services firm accidentally put an extra nought on the amount when paying wage money to Miss Wood by BACS. Miss Wood, , knew nothing of the windfall. At Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester, Walton, of Little Hulton near Salford admitted theft and was ordered to pay back all the cash.  He was also sentenced to  months jail suspended for two years and and complete  unpaid work hours. Miss Wood was initially charged with theft alongside Walton but the case against her was dropped. The court heard the botched transaction occurred on July  whilst Miss Wood was employed by Miss Harvey. Walton had control of the account as Miss Wood was unable to open one and when he saw the money had been deposited he made no contact with Miss Harvey and instead secretly spent the lot. The error was discovered the following month.  Judge Bernard Lever said: The employer made a mistake and he took advantage of this. He got a bank payment and thinks it’s Christmas. He didn’t intend to steal from her - it was her error that caused the problem. The judge told Walton: Your partner was working for a small firm and therefore vulnerable to financial loss. Miss Harvey said her and the company have been caused great problems and inconvenience due to your dishonesty. Your partner didn’t have the stable conduct to have her own account so it was paid into yours. She accidentally made a bank error and gave you  times as much as you should have got, being pound,. Miss Harvey has said the actions caused by the loss to the company has caused upset as a result of your dishonesty. You were not in a position of trust but in responsibility. You have a gambling problem and money issues and you took advantage of the mistake that was made. You could have ed the money, but you dissipated it. Now you will have to pay the money back.  The court heard Walton and Miss Wood have two children, one aged six and the other a baby in need of an operation. Miss Wood currently suffers with post natal depression. Defence lawyer Adam Brown said in mitigation: They have another baby on the way and an eight week old baby currently. They are now living together whilst he works in security at night. Their son has health issues in his stomach and is due to go through chemo surgery and they are combating this together. She is battling with depression. The money has now been dissipated as he had signicant gambling debts. He had control over the account so his partner was not involved. He gave it to people who he owed money to and he regrets doing it.  He had demonstrated that he can remain out of trouble. He attended the police station to admit to what he did. A reference from his employer said he has worked on door security for  years and he is a credit to security. I also have a reference from a man who he helped outside of a bar he helped him.

Stoke-on-Trent City Council has targeted  dferent streets in the towns of Fenton, Hanley and Cobridge in the clampdown. More than  wheelie bins have been taken in the clampdown - angering some residents. Families have been told they must call the council to get their wheelie bins back. Council bosses wrote to affected residents to warn them that their bins would be seized, StokeonTrentLive reported . Existing rules mean residents must put their rubbish out the day before collection and then collect their bin by the end of the collection day. The letter stated: During a recent walkabout it was noted that there are a large amount of abandoned wheelie bins being left in alleyways. This is adding to the existing issues such as litter and fly-tipping. Everyone has a responsibility to ensure their waste is being disposed of correctly. Please ensure that your bin is retrieved from the collection point alleyway after collection as it may be removed.  The decision has ided residents, with some slamming the move and others praising it.Linda Beasley, aged , of Lowther Street, said: The council should give everyone a key to their alleyway and a new bin and make them sign for it so then they have no excuse for leaving their bin in the street. “Seeing all the rubbish everywhere I feel like I have to go and pick it up. I saw a fox snfing around it the other day. There’s rubbish everywhere now and I’m picking it up. “Taking the bins away has just made everything worse. I’d rather have the bins in the street because taking them away is causing rubbish in the street, there’s glass everywhere and it will attract rats.  Neighbour Rob Unwin, aged , said: “Taking away the bins has just caused a mess because bin bags have been left out with rubbish spilling everywhere. I’d rather have the bins left out in the street than this mess everywhere.” The council has received , complaints from residents about bins being left out too long in the past two years.Anyone whose bin has been seized risks being fined or taken to court in the future. Resident Sarah Horton lives on the Portland Street estate and has backed the council crackdown. She said: “I support the action taken by the council, and people are already commenting how much bigger and better the streets look. It’s a situation with no easy solution but doing nothing would have been infinitely worse. Even just being able to walk on the pavement with a pushchair makes a huge dference.If the pavement was blocked by a car being parked on it there would be a public outcry, so why should it be any dferent with bins ” Councillor Randy Conteh, cabinet member for housing, said: “We’ve received numerous complaints about bins being left out in Fenton, Cobridge and Hanley. At the start of the month we committed a huge amount of resources into two action days in both areas, which saw a deep clean and tidy up.Abandoned bins were also taken away. These are all things that residents had complained to us about. Prior to this, we had delivered letters to every house, which made it clear bins would be taken awaythey were left out. “It’s unfortunate, when the solution was so simple, that we had to take this action but faced with an ongoing problem – and the impact it was having on responsible households in the communities – we were left with no other option.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mum claims airport parking firm","story":"NewsMum claims airport parking firm drove her car  MILES while on holidayZoe Parr, , was sent a £ fine after her car was allegedly parked outside an Asda in ManchesterShareCommentsByRichard PercivalNeil Murphy:,  NOV NewsZoe Parr has expressed her anger over the incident \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA mum discovered her car had been driven  MILES while she was on holiday after she was sent a fine - with a photo of someone  at the wheel. Zoe Parr, , was furious when she noticed her BMW d M Sport was used while she was on honeymoon in Jamaica - including being taken on a shopping trip to Asda. She arrived home to a fine for overstaying in the supermarket car park - and claims someone drove the vehicle for nearly  miles when it was supposed to be in the companys care. It included a CCTV camera snapshot of what looks like a man driving into Asda in her car - taken on day two of her holiday. Stunned Zoe claims the car clocked up nearly  miles while she was away - and alleges it was driven by staff at the firm. However, while the supermarket dropped the fine, four months on she claims the meet and greet parking company is still refusing to apologise or refund her over the alleged incident. The company was last month dubbed the worlds worst airport parking meet and greet and accused of losing cars and damaging a Range Rover in a collision with a bus. Mum-of-two Zoe, from Wolverhampton, said: I think that its completely unacceptable. They have been using it as a freebie because the petrol tank was empty when it ed to us.  Its was absolutely appalling behaviour from a professional meet and greet car parking firm. For them to have taken the car out for their own personal use whilst we were on holiday is quite cheeky really. Zoe and her new husband jetted off from Manchester Airport on a two-week honeymoon break to Montego Bay in Jamaica, on July . They paid for a meet and greet service with Manchester Airport Parking Services Ltd, and Zoe made a note there was , miles on the clock. They chose the firm because the website boasted customers get a park happy experience with every stay, she said. But when she landed back in Manchester a fortnight later, she says there was an extra  miles on the clock, leaving the petrol tank virtually empty.  When the man came to drop it off it suddenly, he just dropped the keys in my hand and dashed away rapidly, she said. That was when we got into the car and released that something isnt quite right. There were crumbs all over the back seat and the petrol light was on so I knew then that the car had been driven. But when the couple got home they had a fine for overstaying at an Asda store in Oldham. The pound fine from Parking Eye said the vehicle arrived at .am before leaving one hour and twenty minutes at .am - and included a photo of the car being driven. Zoe said: We were simply gobsmacked. We immediately called Asda and explained the situation and they agreed to drop the charge. We called Manchester Airport Parking Services Limited and demanded answers.  We complained that the company had been driving our vehicle but they just simply ignored us and said someone will get back to you. This is clearly not the professional service you expect from an airport car service. In August, pound appeared in her bank account from the company - which Zoe assumes was to cover the fine. This was extremely odd, Zoe said. We then phoned Greater Manchester Police to report what had happened with the car.  However after a few weeks of investigation, we were told that we could not prosecute because they dont know who the driver was at the time of it being in Asda. Zoe claims she has contacted the company seven times but said she has not had an explanation. Zoe said: Every time I rang the company, I was just told that someone would get back to me but I never heard anything back. I have gone through hell trying to find out what happened to our car, its actually spoiled our honeymoon completely. I feel like I have been burgled because the police cannot do anything in taking action against this firm. The whole experience has been absolutely disgusting. Manchester Airport Car Parking Services has not responded to a request for comment.

He said: “Its the grave of my auntie and uncle and their two daughters. I come over every now and again to visit the grave and friends who knew them. They rang me up a while ago to tell me someone was taking the flowers and decorations. I was horried. “The love that family had between them was incredible and the fact that someone could be doing that to their grave is a farce.  “I was upset about it. They were a lovely family. They are not resting in peace because of this.” Friends of the family became concerned back in April with the missing flowers and decided that it was time to figure out what was going on. They placed a camera in a tree looking over the grave. One person, who did not wish to be named, said: “My we and her friends all visit the grave every week or so to put down flowers and other decorative items to make the grave look nice.  “We started to notice back in April that things were going missing and rang each other to figure out what was going on.

So I purchased one and hid it in a nearby tree.” On September  the camera had recorded footage of a man no one could recognise visiting the grave. He can be seen standing in front of the plot with his bicycle before picking up a bunch of flowers and tipping the water on the ground. Pictures taken by the camera also show the flowers missing from the grave two minutes after he arrived. The footage was reported to Humberside Police. The same man was seen again visiting the grave on the evening of November , and shortly after his arrival the flowers were no longer there.

Hes the longest-reigning heir apparent ever and for  years the British public - and people all over the world - called him Charles.But when he ascends the throne, he might not be known as King Charles. In fact, we might have to call him by a completely dferent name. Its thought the Prince of Wales might not want to keep his name to reign as monarch thanks to negative connotations with former kings bearing the name Charles.  Its not unusual for a royal to change their given name once theyre on the throne. When Queen Victorias son, Prince Albert Edward, became king in  he took the name Edward VII. And in  another Albert, Duke of York - the Queens father - ascended the throne with the name King George VI.Both used one of their given names, just not their first name. So Prince Charles could choose Philip, Arthur or George as his regnal name. In  multiple reports circulated that Charles had held private talks with “trusted friends” about the possibility of using his third middle name, George.  Should he do this, he would reign as King George VII. A former Buckingham Palace spokesperson, Dickie Arbiter, said this decision would also be a lovely tribute to Charles grandparents. It would not just be a tribute to his grandfather [King George VI], but a sort of loving memory to his late grandmother, whom he absolutely adored, he told the BBC. But Clarence House quickly rubbished the claims, saying no decision had been made and it would be decided at the time Charles became king.  Given the luck of two former monarchs named King Charles, its likely the Prince of Wales wont adopt this when he ascends the throne. Charles I, who became king in , dismissed parliament three times and resolved to rule alone four years later.He reigned without a Parliament for more than a decade, a period which was dubbed eleven years tyranny. Following two civil wars, Charles was tried and convicted of being a tyrant, traitor, murderer and public enemy to the good people of the nation and was beheaded for treason on January , . His son, Charles II, lived in exile until he was crowned King of England, Ireland and Scotland in . He was popular and dubbed the Merry Monarch, changing laws brought in by Oliver Cromwell and allowing people more freedom to enjoy themselves."},{"url":null,"title":"teen claims school told him","story":"NewsTeenage boy claims school told him to man up after his dads deathJacob Belsham, , has accused Sandbach High School, in Cheshire, of discriminating against students with mental health problemsShareCommentsByKathie McInnes:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsGrieving Jacob Belsham has accused the school of acting in an over-the-top and insensitive manner \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA teenager claims he was expelled after criticising school staff on Facebook for allegedly telling him to man up after his dad died. Grief-stricken sixth-former Jacob Belsham has accused Sandbach High School, in Cheshire, of discriminating against people with mental health problems. He was expelled in June after posting the accusation on Facebook and sending an angry message to another student. Now the Education and Skills Funding Agencyhas found the top-performing school breached exclusion procedures by not informing him of his right to an independent review. The -year-old told StokeonTrentLive: “The school has behaved in a completely over the top, insensitive and heavy-handed manner.” Jacob had watched his father, Lee, die in May last year after a four-year battle with oesophagal cancer. At the time, he had been studying at a dferent college and he sat his first-year exams while his dad was in a hospice.  After getting disappointing grades, he decided to have a fresh start and retake his A-levels at Sandbach High. He says the school was supportive at first and offered him counselling in response to another issue he was facing.Then Jacob, who also has Asperger’s, began to miss lessons. Mum Marie, aged , said: “He was having nightmares. He was getting up in the mornings, throwing up and going out of the front door.He said he needed to get to school or he would get in trouble. They pulled him up about his lateness and his absences.” Jacob says he confided in a member of staff that he was experiencing the nightmares. “I told them it was a physical challenge to just get up and face the day,” he said.But he claims the person responded by telling him to simply ‘man up’. Then on May  - two days before the first anniversary of his dad’s death - he went home part-way through the day. The school later told the ESFA it was for ‘pastoral reasons’, but Jacob maintained a teacher instructed him to go home to ‘cool off’.  The ESFA said it was unclear what actually happened, but has since reminded the school that ‘unofficial exclusions’ are not allowed. The problems culminated in Jacob writing the Facebook post, which led to a formal seven-day suspension. “From that point on, everything was about my attendance and ‘how could you criticise the school’,” added Jacob. He claims that friends who ‘liked’ the comment were also called in to see the headteacher. In a letter to Jacob, ESFA complaint co-ordinator Michelle Lawrence confirmed the Middlewich Road school was ‘in breach of statutory guidance’. She said: “The governing body should have advised that you were entitled to an independent review hearing to review the decision they had reached.” Ms Lawrence added: “Any further breaches may result in the ESFA taking intervention action.” Jacob has now been offered a review hearing on November , when he hopes to have the exclusion wiped from his records. But he is not looking to be reinstated as he has moved on to Cheshire College – South and West, where he’s taking an access course. Marie added: “The issue is the way the school treated him. It just wasn’t fair.” In a statement, Sandbach High said “The school is unable to comment as the case is ongoing.” Although classed as a girls school, Sandbach has run a mixed sixth form for a number of years.

But his small British team had remarkable success against the murderous drug cartels in Colombia. The ex-VAT inspector’s unit could not compete in terms of size with the US authorities fighting the same battle. Yet the Brits masterminded the seizure of a record poundbillion worth of drugs. And while the gung-ho American narcotics agents publicly bragged about triumphs, Tom and his team went about things in a typically understated British way by keeping their exploits quiet. Only now is he lting the lid on his time in capital Bogota, starting in .  Speaking to the Mirror in a London pub, Tom said: “We were the British equivalent of Narcos. Everyone’s heard of the DEA [the US Drug Enforcement Administration] and the US agencies doing their stuff in Colombia, and the reason is because they talk about it. “They would say after a seizure that it was down to the DEA in Bogota and straight away the bad guys would go looking for the informant. “We never claimed a single result. No one even knew the Brits were there, because we didn’t want them to. We weren’t egotists. “Our idea was to let others take the credit and keep our heads down. The DEA were looking for glory. This is the first time the British story has been told.”  Now in his s, Tom grew up in Seaham, Co Durham. He joined HM Customs and Excise after studying languages, in the hope of finding adventure abroad. But he was sent to be a VAT inspector in Birmingham. When bosses gave him the job as a drug liaison officer in Bogota  years ago, it was in violent chaos. Weeks earlier Medellin Cartel boss Pablo Escobar – responsible for an estimated , to , deaths during a reign of terror that included the bombing of Avianca Flight , which claimed  lives in  – had been killed by police in a rooftop shootout. The Cali Cartel then took over as the dominant cocaine gang. The Americans, who had dozens of DEA officers there, aimed to take out the top brass of the cartels, one by one.  Tom could not replicate this because the UK did not have the resources there – he had just a handful of staff. Instead he wooed informants – including a prostitute who gleaned information during pillow talk – and found out about shipments before they left. Targeting the ports was something that had never been done. Based in the British embassy, Tom and his network penetrated the crews who raced coke-laden speed boats across the Caribbean sea and identied “motherships” carrying tonnes of the drug to Europe.  Tom – not his real name – developed a network of  informants who helped to intercept  tonnes of drugs. No investigator in history is thought to have been behind more seizures. Corruption was re. Workers were being offered – as Escobarsays in the hit Netflix drama series Narcos, “plata o plomo” – meaning, silver or lead. Most took the money rather than the bullet, so Tom had to offer cash. He added: “The Cali and North Valley cartels were the biggest organised crime groups in history. “Their intelligence services were so far ahead of anything that any other country had in that region, let alone crime organisation. The capabilities of the bad guys was terrying.  Tom, who has revealed his story in his new book Narco Wars, arranged customs training courses as a cover for meeting port staff, and urged them to work for the British government. After spending months grooming a customs inspector in the port of Cartagena, Tom asked the man for information and got a chilling reply. The man said: “If you repeat what you have said to me to anyone  around here, it will get you killed. “You are a nice guy. So I’m going to forget what you said and pretend that I never heard it... I think you are going to get yourself killed.”  While Tom survived, others did not. A key informant was shot dead by hitmen after a friend betrayed him. Tom said: “He had a we and kids, and he didn’t deserve to die. To some extent I was to blame.” Drug lords vowed to hunt down “the Brit” as he became known, but Tom rejected calls toto the UK. He said: “London said come home for six months... but I had invested so much work building up the sources. If I went home I might lose them. I had to plead with London to let me carry on.” It all ended in the early s, when new laws made handling informants impossible abroad. Stopping the flow of drugs into the UK is now down to the National Crime Agency. Recent figures show drug seizures are down to the lowest level in  years. And while alleged Mexican drug lord Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman is on trial in the US, Tom believes the war on drugs has failed. He added: “A lot of [my] friends have died. Was it worth it  No, because we are no better off... The war will not be won with bullets. It can only be won through education and mass media and social media campaigns. These are our most powerful weapons.”Narco Wars is published by Milo Books, priced pound.."},{"url":null,"title":"woman bullied being ugly spends","story":"NewsWoman bullied for being ugly spends £k on plastic surgery to feel happyWARNING - CONTAINS NUDITY: Celine Centino, who has had three boob jobs, a nose job and cheek, lip and chin fillers said men go crazy for her lookShareCommentsByLiana Jacob:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsCeline is now a lot more confident and happy \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA woman who was severely bullied for her looks has spent more than pound, on plastic surgery and says she now feels confident and happy.Instagram star, Celine Centino, was called ugly or told that her ass is too fat when she was a teenager.The now -year-old from Zurich, Switzerland, says she was taunted daily and would call in sick at school to avoid being judged.Her constant insecurities motivated her to save up money by working shts as a hairdresser to afford plastic surgery so she could finally feel happy in her own skin. Over four years from September , she ended up having three boob jobs, a nose job and cheek, lip and chin fillers that cost a whopping pound.K . Celine, who said she always wanted big boobs like Pamela Anderson, had three boob jobs which increased her bra size from a A to a FF.  With over K followers on Instagram, she has received positive comments from strangers about her new look.I was always a happy person, but I didnt feel good in my skin. So many people judged me because I was ugly, and I turned into a sad person, Celine said. I wanted to be happy again, so I changed my look and everything I didnt like about myself. We live in a time when we can change somethingwe like it, so I took this chance. I was bullied daily, and it was always about something new, either I looked like a guy because I had no boobs, or my ass was too fat . Kids would tell me my face looked like rubbish, my style was ugly, this part of me was not good, that part of me was not good, I couldnt get it right according to them, they were all mean. They would say Im ugly, push me and ignore me. I had no chance to show that Im a great person, they only saw the ugly Celine.  Celine continued: After that I was beaten up and all I could do was run away. I never told anyone about this because I felt ashamed. But everyone in school knew that I didnt want to go back to school. I would constantly say I was sick, or I had a cold to avoid going into school. I always wanted big boobs, my natural boob size was zero, so I finally wanted to be beautul and have a normal le, without getting judged.  She told how shed saved up a lot of money while she was young by working hard - and then she spent all her money on her surgeries.Now I feel so good about myself and Im finally happy again that I can live the le I always wanted, she adds. Also, it makes me feel stronger than I was before. If someone says anything bad about me, I dont care. Nobody can hurt me anymore.  Her surgeries include three boob jobs, fillers in her lips, cheeks, chin and jawline as well as a nose job. When I got my first boob job, it was an amazing feeling. I wanted more because I wanted to be more beautul. Luckily, I had no complications, Celine said. As a child I loved Pamela Anderson in Baywatch. I always wanted big boobs like her. I always was a strong person, so I needed a strong look. Like something mystical a woman who cant be hurt because she is so strong. She needs no man, but all the men want her.  I get dferent reactions some people say that I look good and others say that its all plastic. But the reactions are more positive than negative, and the men go crazy for my look.

Ekaterina Tirskaya, , told police that she believed she was Elena Gilbert, a fictional character in US television fantasy drama The Vampire Diaries. She and her lover had slept together for the first time after meeting on social media, a court was told. The victim told her that he didn’t believe in the supernatural, and urged her to go home. But she grabbed a kne and attacked him as he was getting out of the bath, according to reports.  Tirskaya, from Novosibirsk, Russia, has been jailed for the kne attack. Psychological assessments ahead of her trial in Siberia found the hair treatment specialist to be sane, it was reported. The morning after sleeping with the man, the woman suddenly “changed”, telling him she was a vampire and like Elena Gilbert, played by Canadian actress Nina Dobrev, she had a mission to kill werewolves.  One report said: “She grabbed a kne in the kitchen and suddenly attacked him when he was getting out of the bath. “He managed to get hold of the kne. “But she grabbed another one and stabbed him in the chest.”  He staggered out of his flat and banged on neighbours doors pleading for help. They called an ambulance and police. The man was gravely wounded but survived the February attack. Prosecutor Felix Kuznetsov said Tirskaya was sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison after being found guilty of inflicting grievous bodily harm. She was also ordered to pay pound, in “moral damages” to her stabbed lover.

first international goal","story":"After opening his international goal account last time out, Glen Kamara is “buzzing” to have the chance to help Finland qualy for the Nations League play-offs.The -year-old fired in his first-ever senior goal as his country saw off Greece - last month in Tampere to keep up their % record in League C Group Two.The Finns head to Athens tonight needing just a point to confirm their promotion to League B after a superb run that’s seen them yet to concede a goal in their four matches that’s also seen a home-and-away double over Estonia.The team’s successes over the past few months are in complete contrast to his club season at Dundee this campaign.With the Dark Blues languishing at the foot of the Premiership table and goals few and far between, manager Jim McIntyre has urged his midfield to provide more goal threat.And Kamara, who has been pushed further forward by his new boss lately, says he has ambitions to add some club goals to his single international effort.“I’d say I’ve had about one shot in my time at Dundee!” the former Arsenal man said.“I definitely need to shoot more and try to help out the team with goals, it is something I’m working on.”And despite firing in a goal for his country that sealed victory over the Greeks, Kamara wasn’t overly proud by the quality of his first touch.He said: “What was the goal like  Don’t watch it!“I made a really bad touch into a good touch and a finish.“It was great, something I didn’t expect but I was buzzing after it.“It’s a great feeling to score for your country and we got a - win over Greece as well.“They are coming up again so we’ll have to be ready again.”Ranked th in the world and below upcoming opponents Greece and Hungary in the world rankings, the Finns’ record of four wins from their first four Nations League games have surprised onlookers.However, Kamara insists nobody within the camp is surprised at how well they’ve fared.Under manager Markku Kanerva, the Eagle Owls as they are nicknamed, have spread their wings and begun to fly after years in the international wilderness following the retirement of former Ajax great and Liverpool forward Jari Litmanen.That’s despite a lack of household names with Norwich striker Teemu Pukki most likely to be known to football fans on these shores after an unsuccessful spell at Celtic.Momentum is building, however, and the Finns will be hopeful of finding a backdoor route to Euro  through winning their Nations League group.That needs at least one point from tonight’s trip to Athens or the game against Hungary in Budapest on Sunday.Kamara said: “The team is in a good place, the manager is doing well and they are a good group of boys.“Things are going well in the Nations League and we have a good chance of winning our group.“We have Greece and Hungary up this week and with a win I’d say we’ll top the group.“That’s maybe surprised a few people but the team knew we were good enough after playing a few games together and,you watch us, you can see we are at a good level right now.”Kamara’s Dundee team-mate Benjamin Kallman has also featured for the full national side this year, though is more often involved with the U  squad.He remains at Dens Park this week as the young Finns don’t have any fixtures scheduled."},{"url":null,"title":"wetherspoons-bans-dogs-from-all-pubs","story":"POPULAR pub

How you come back from that type of injury is normally how much you put into your rehab.“Mark has given absolutely everything. He is out running, he is out doing the warm-ups with the other players.“Mark is out running with physios when we are training. It is great to see him with his boots on and getting that step closer.“There might be some set-backs along the way with that type of injury but it is all systems go. Mark has been fantastic and the physios could not be more pleased with him.”Reynolds limped off just  minutes into the friendly with Cove Rangers. A scan revealed the extent of the damage and he subsequently underwent surgery in Glasgow.That friendly was abandoned as Cove’s Jordon Brown, , suffered a serious head injury in an accidental collision with Dons defender Considine in the second half.An ambulance was called, with spectators asked to leave, and Brown received treatment for more than  minutes.The ex-Aberdeen youngster has gone on to make regular appearances for Cove this season.“If Mark gets close round about January, in the winter break, to coming back then he has done extremely well,” said McInnes.“It can be a seven to eight-month injury.“Considering he did it in July, as good as Mark is doing and encouraged as we are, we still have to be careful.“It is a serious injury and we have to treat it that way.”Reynolds’ serious knee problem was the first set-back in what would become an injury crisis for Aberdeen in the early throes of this season. At one point, McInnes had eight players out injured.Reynolds and on-loan Watford defender Tommie Hoban, who is recovering from shoulder surgery, are the only two long-term absentees for the Dons now.Aberdeen are to assess the extent of the injury to Devlin that forced him tofrom the Scotland squad.McInnes said: “We did not have our troubles to seek with injuries. It was the worst injury situation since I have been at Aberdeen.“With Mark, he had done all the pre-season work so to then get injured in a pre-season game sticks in the throat a wee bit.“But that is the nature of the game and with injuries you can never foresee when they come.“Thankfully we have dealt with them as a squad and Mark is dealing with his injury.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dons sweating on devs foot injury","story":"Aberdeen face a nervous sweat over the fitness of defender Mikey Devlin for the Betfred Cup final.The centre-back was forced to withdraw from Scotland international duty having sustained a foot injury training with Alex McLeish’s squad.Devlin was in contention to earn a debut cap, and start, in the Nations League tie away to Albania tomorrow.However, the Reds now face an edgy wait to discoverthe -year-old will be fit to face Celtic in the final at Hampden on Sunday December .Aberdeen are keen to investigate the problem further but it could be as late as next week before they know for certainDevlin will make the Hampden clash.It is understood the Reds will have to wait for the swelling to subside before the defender’s foot can be scanned to ascertain the extent of the injury.Devlin has played all but one game for Aberdeen this season and that solitary absence was due to a one-game suspension.His centre-back partner Scott McKenna is set to start for Scotland in the League C, Group  clash at the Loro Borici Stadium in Shkoder.McKenna has forged a strong partnership with Devlin and boss Derek McInnes will be desperate to field that duo at Hampden.The centre-back partnership of Devlin and McKenna have secured five clean sheets in the previous seven games.The only other senior defender who can play at centre-back is Andy Considine, who has operated at left-back in recent seasons.Centre-backs Mark Reynoldsand Tommie Hobanare both out until the winter break through injury.Devlin met up with the Scotland squad at the start of this week fully fit having produced an impressive sht at the back as the Dons secured a shut-out in the - defeat of Hibs last Friday.He was replaced in McLeish’s squad by Celtic’s Jack Hendry.It was a blow for Devlin who had broken into the international set-up this season after recovering from a serious injury.Devlin was ruled out for the whole of last season with a cruciate ligament injury.That injury was sustained in May  while at Hamilton. However, he signed on at Aberdeen in January this year and continued his rehabilitation under the guidance of the Pittodrie medical staff.He ed from injury in pre-season and made his Dons debut in the - Europa League qualication tie with Burnley.Devlin has been a first-team starter ever since and has not had any injury concerns – until hurting a foot with Scotland.Fellow Aberdeen players Graeme Shinnie and Gary Mackay-Steven are also in the Scotland squad that today jetted out to Albania. The Scots also face Israel at Hampden on Tuesday in the Nations League.Shinnie stressed that the Scotland squad are every bit as keen as the Tartan Army to get to Euro . The Scots have not qualied for the finals of a major tournament since the  World Cup in France.Scots’ hopes of topping the group suffered a setback when losing - to Israel in Haa in their last Group C game.In contention to win his fth cap, Aberdonian Shinnie is under no illusions as to the importance of both Nations League ties.Shinnie said: “The squad is desperate to qualy, like the whole nation is, and yes, we know the importance of it.“We are all determined to do that as a squad. It is something that we are working hard for.”Some pressure descended on McLeish and his players after the dismal display against Israel. Shinnie said: “Football is always pressure.“We know that everyone in the squad can handle it, they prove it at club level and it is about going out and proving it on the day.“These two games are massive for us andwe can win both of them you will get the plaudits so you take the good and the bad.”"},{"url":null,"title":"win 10 copies of our aberdeen memories 2019 calendar1","story":"We have  copies of our best-selling Aberdeen Memories Calendar  to give away!Its beautul archive pictures will take you around the silver city as it was during the s, s and s # you can find out more hereFor your chance to be one of ten lucky winners all you have to do is answer the question below.Good luck everyone!

So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute. It is our country’s most pressing public health issue – one we must address now, collectively.Scotland has made a lot of progress over the past  years, including a guarantee of a year’s post-diagnostic support, better education and training for staff in health and social care and better standards of care for people with dementia in hospitals.There is still, however, an unacceptable gap between national policy and dementia care and support in our communities. Alzheimer Scotland wants to make sure that people with dementia and their carers can work with local decision makers, helping to influence important decisions about how vital care and support is delivered in their area.We need your help to ensure people with dementia and carers get the best possible standard of care and support, anywhere in Scotland.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Star lost possession in midfield and Connor Crawford’s clearance was closed down by the Kings Park forward whose shot beat Kalache from the edge of the box and the hosts took a - lead on the hour mark.This visibly knocked the confidence of the Star team and Kings added a second goal when poor play again from Star trying to break gted possession to the hosts and once again their striker was on hand to make it - and give Star a mountain to climb in the last twenty minutes.Star didn’t give up however and could have been back in the game when the ball fell to Gregor Peacock in the box, the ing striker hit the shot and the ball was saved by the Kings Park goalkeeper.Kyle Selfridge went close to claiming a late leline but his free kick from twenty yards cannoned off the bar and the game finished - to the home side.The Star management team were disappointed as that’s the first time the Lochgilphead side have failed to score in the league in more than two years.On Saturday November  Red Star play host to Campbeltown pupils in what looks like another tough league match.

Sherf John Montgomery commented the theft attempt was “rather pathetic”. Defending Thomson, of Elba Gardens in Ayr, solicitor Ian Gillies said: “Mr Thomson and Miss Coughtrie were living together but they’ve decided to part – and I don’t think that’s a bad thing.

Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.

Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.

Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13594714.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_ayr-u.jpg","title":"ayr united appear itv show","story":"NewsAyr United appear on ITV show The Chase as Bradley Walsh asks questionsThe Honest Men appeared as an answer on hit ITV show The Chase yesterday .Share.\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"facebook|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"messenger|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"twitter|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"whatsapp|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"linkedin|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"flipboard|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"email|share|\"ByLochlin Highet:,  NOV NewsThe Chasers \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr United have been flying high at the top of the Championship - and now theyve made prime time national TV.

more than , bin collections each year.Figures released through a freedom of information request show that over the last five years, council bin crews have failed to empty more than , bins from around , households.Furthermore, the number of bins missed each year has been rising since , when , bins collections were missed.Three years later, in , that number had risen to ,, and already this year , bins have been missed.Opposition councillors have lined up to criticise the figures, particularly in the wake of allegations that Scottish Borders Council is considering moving to three-weekly bin collections when the budget is proposed in February of next year.Hawick and Denholm councillor Clair Ramage said: ldquoBin collection is a very emotive subject and as councillors we receive many complaints over this very issue.ldquoTo see that there has been a rise in the number of missed bin collections is extremely alarming and has to be investigated as a matter of urgency but this is only the tip of the iceberg.ldquoIn the last month we have been informed that Scottish Borders Council is considering tri-weekly uplts, a change that I am completely opposed to.ldquoAt the moment Scottish Borders Council is struggling as we have seen householders use their recycling bins for general waste when their general waste bins are full.ldquoThis creates other problems, the recycling vehicles are then contaminated with general waste and have to pay penalties to the processing company.ldquoIf bi-weekly lts are not working then tri weekly lts will create even more problems, for example fly tipping.ldquoI realise that budgets are tight but the combination of missed bin collections resulting in rubbish spilling over encouraging vermin is not something that as a community we should accept.Hawick and Hermitage councillor Watson McAteer also commented: \"I do not recall missed bin collections being a statistic that is regularly shared with councillors. Perhaps the fact that for whatever reason , bins have failed to be collected explains why this is not on public record.ldquoI am regularly receiving complaints from constituents who find their bins still full on the pavement after the collection date.ldquoWhile of course there will always be occasions when the council have no control of the situation the figures being produced certainly challenge the current collection policy.ldquoCan you imagine the problems this would causethree-weekly collection was to be introduced  I for one will not support such a move and would ask the council to explain to council tax payers why this problem exists and what they are doing to resolve it.According to data collected by the Local Government Benchmarking Framework, which is a comparison network for Scottish councils, . per cent of Scottish Borders are satisfied with their local refuse collection.However, this is below the Scottish average of . per cent and is the second lowest of the rural and island councils that Scottish Borders Council is grouped with.The council also spends pound. per premises on waste disposal, which is below the Scottish average of pound..Leader of the opposition and Tweeddale East councillor Stuart Bell said that Scottish Borders Council officers work hard to recty issues, but residents need to be aware of how to report missed bin collections.He said: ldquoI will be interested in the councilrsquos conclusions on the long term trend. As I recall there has been a gradual introduction of food waste collections into the larger communities in the last few years, so the number of total collections may have increased at the same time as the number of missed collections has increased.ldquoBut I am concerned to see the detail of missed bin collections. I had expected, and can see, that the number of missed collections is higher in the winter months when the teams can have dficulty getting round in the snow, but it is worrying that the level of missed collections never drops below  in any one month. ldquoThe public needs to know that there is a very easy mechanism of reporting missed collections on the councilrsquos website and, in my experience, refuse and recycling staff at Scottish Borders Council do follow-up on issuesthere is a systematic cause.A spokesperson for Scottish Borders Council said that the number of bins left unemptied each year is actually very small compared to the number the council collection.The authorityrsquos waste management service says it collects around .m bins each year, meaning the number of missed bins equates to less than half a per cent.The spokesperson said: ldquoThe number of missed bin collections over the last five years will be dependent on a number of factors including: the provision of a new weekly food waste service to around , households in  access issues due to obstruction and road closures vehicle breakdowns adverse weather service error an increase in the number of new homes which bins are collected from each year and bins not being presented by householders by am on scheduled collection days and incorrectly reported as missed.ldquoIt is not possible to determine the exact cause of any increase in missed collections but the increasingly challenging winters experienced across the Borders will be having an impact.ldquoThat was the case this year, when the extreme winter conditions experienced in January, February and March caused signicant disruption, with three full days where collections were unable to be carried out across the Borders.ldquoHouseholders reporting a missed collection over this period will have contributed signicantly to the increase this

four-fold in the space of a year.According to figures just released by the Trussell Trust, foodbank use in the Borders has risen by  percent in  months - the highest percentage rise of any local authority area in Scotland.The Trussell Trust, which support a network of  foodbanks operating out of more than  centres across the UK, have reported that between April and September , a total of  emergency food parcels were issued in the Scottish Borders  to adults and  to children.And many other locally-organised foodbank services arent even included in the figures.In comparison, the same period in  saw just  being issued.Despite the percentage increase, the number of parcels issued this year in the Borders remain the lowest in Scotland over the same period.The figures also report a UK-wide increase of  percent in providing emergency supplies to people in crisis.The charity claims the rise in reliance on foodbanks coincides with the UK Governmentrsquos Universal Credit rollout, which was introduced in the Borders during the summer.The charity says the inability of benefit levels to cover essential living costs and issues with payments remains the most common reasons for referral to a foodbank.They said: ldquoUniversal Credit is not the only benefit people at foodbanks are experiencing problems with, but the new system is increasingly driving referrals due to benefit delays, which include waiting for a first payment or having problems with a new claim.The charity is calling for the five week minimum wait for a first Universal Credit payment to be reduced.Emma Revie, Chief Executive of The Trussell Trust explained: ldquoWersquore seeing soaring levels of need at foodbanks. The time to act is now. If the five week wait isnrsquot reduced, the only way to stop even more people being forced to foodbanks this winter will be to pause all new claims to Universal Credit, until funding is in place to reduce the five week wait. Foodbanks cannot continue to pick up the pieces ndash we have to make sure our benefits system can protect people from hunger.Commenting on the figures, Tweeddale MSP Christine Grahame said: ldquoThese are truly heart-breaking figures for the Borders, which bring into sharp focus the devastating impact the Tory government is having on our local community.ldquoThe fact that people cannot afford to eat is a disgrace in any circumstances, but we can see from the statistics that in the previous year there have been  incidences where emergency food has been given to children specically ndash this is an abomination in a developed country such as ours.ldquoWhile sustained Tory cuts have created this problem, we can see that where Universal Credit has rolled out, which is the case in the Borders, it has made things worse.ldquoMichelle Ballantyne MSP who is the Toryrsquos Social Security spokesperson, represents the South of Scotland which covers the Borders ndash despite her ardent defence of Universal Credit in parliament recently, she must see now how devastating this roll out has been.\"I call on her to review her position and urgently press her colleagues at Westminster to halt the roll out of UC, so the fundamental flaws can be addressed.In response Michelle Ballantyne MSP said: ldquoWhile Ms Grahame might be correct that foodbank usage has risen across the UK, she might want to look closer before placing all the blame with the UK Government.\"We should also remember that, despite this increase, foodbank usage in the Borders is still at the lowest number in Scotland.ldquoI would consider it narrow-minded to attribute the entire increase with Universal Credit there are many other factors contributing to foodbank usage across the country.\"Aberdeen City Council and Perth and Kinross have also implemented Universal Credit around the same time as the Borders and the same report notes that foodbank usage has actually decreased in these areas.ldquoHer assertion that Universal Credit is the sole reason that foodbank usage is rising in the Borders just doesnrsquot add up.ldquoI appreciate there are issues with Universal Credit and the UK Government has said they will address them.

Perhaps a little too early for the jumpers, I attended the Memorial Hall eager to feast upon the much-anticipated performance of these young thespians.Could they really deliver this magical Christmas story and live up to the incredible reputation set by their mentors, Innerleithen  District Amateur Operatic Society  You bet your bottom dollar they did!From the moment the music started and the curtain opened on this stunning production, I along with the audiences were captivated.Playing the hopeful orphan was Freya Wilson. She already looked the part with red hair and freckles, and with stunning vocals she belted out classics lsquoTomorrowrsquo and lsquoMaybersquo, which I have no doubt produced a few tears from the audience. She embraced the character with her cheeky charm and wit, and carried out the role of the ever-optimistic character beautully.Hatching a plan to escape the orphanage and find her parents, Annie is helped by her urchin friends, who had the crowdrsquos toes-tapping and knees bouncing to a fantastically choreographed lsquoHard Knock Lersquo. Credit where itrsquos due, this incredible young cast, who reprised their roles as servants and New Yorkers, were amazing, bringing le to the entire show.But Anniersquos cunning plan to escape fails, and it isnrsquot long before she is dragged back to the evil clutches of the vile Miss Hannigan, played by Lizzie Bell. What was in the champagne bottle, I do not know, but the teenager stumbled about the stage, and conveyed the child-hating orphanage boss to comic perfection. Hanniganrsquos flirtatious manner with Officer Ward , who brings Annie back after running away, had the audience chuckling, and truly convinced us of her distaste for the girls in her care with a jaw-dropping performance of lsquoLittle Girlsrsquo.Anniersquos capture isnrsquot the end of her adventure, itrsquos only just begun, as she s in perfect time to meet Grace Farrell.Miss Farrell is gracefully played by the suave and sophisticated Ava Church, dressed impeccably as the rsquos private secretary to Oliver Warbucks. Annie cheekily seizes a golden opportunity to spend Christmas with Mr Warbucks, and is swept off to live the le of royalty at his mansion.Annie soon melts the heart of wealthy businessman Oliver Warbuckswho gave an endearing performance as the billionaire. The two gave a heart-warming rendition of lsquoI Donrsquot Need Anything But Yoursquo. This will be Thomasrsquos first and last performance with KIYT, but Irsquom sure it wonrsquot be last wersquoll see of this talented young man.After promising to help Annie find her parents, in step the villains of the show ndash scheming Rooster Hannigan and his ditzy blonde girlfriend Lily St Regis.Together with Miss Hannigan, the three plot to swindle Mr Warbucks out of a , dollar reward by posing as Anniersquos parents.Alex Paterson pulls off the flashy self-assured gangster brilliantly, and with his money-grabbing side-kick Lily St Regis, the two are perfectly paired bringing not only the comic element to the show, but impeccable American accents, which polished off their characters.Now at this point I must declare my motherly interest, as Lily was played by my daughter Neve Scott. It is very dficult for one to critic her own child. However, I am very proud to call her a vain, blonde bimbo, red-lipstick wearing, smoking, winey voiced, floozy!The three baddies gave a show-stopping performance of lsquoEasy Streetrsquo which had the audiences in stitches.True to the classic, their evil plotting is foiled and Annie has her happy ending after being adopted by Mr Warbucks. The whole cast came out in glorious chorus for the finale of lsquoTomorrowrsquo.There is one furry four-legged actor who deserves a mention for his tail-wagging performance, the adorable Harry who is no stranger to the spotlight after his dog debut as Toto in the Operarsquos lsquoThe Wizard of Ozrsquo. Stardom beckons for the pooch, whom Irsquom sure could be crowned a Peeblesshire Pet Idol in the future!Praise swept over social media for the young cast last week, leaving many hoping this will be the first of many shows by the talented KIYT cast.

She is originally from another European country but has made Haddington her home, with her husband and two wonderful children.Her explorations of nearby woods led her to discover an unusual grave amongst the trees. It is a grave of a horse, buried in the th century. It was this grave she had offered to show me. To get there we had a beautul walk along a secluded section of the banks of the Tyne. It was the trees I noticed first, of course, which were dotted along the banks of the river.Autumn was just then beginning to brush the trees with its colour, and it was one of those evenings when the setting sun seemed to take its time, bathing the land in bright streaks of orange light. Along the way, Marije paused and said: ldquoThis is my tree.It was a beech tree of signicant age, its branches arching over the Tyne, asfishing. She showed me her sitting place, underneath its embracing canopy. Here the roots curved to make a natural seat. Her older son spoke of seeing kingfishers, and sure enough, this was a perfect place to absorb the majesty of the Tyne as it flowed towards Haddington. Another beech of similar age grew close by. Their branches entwined, making it look like they were sisters holding hands.But I sensed then there was more to Marijersquos connection to this place, although I then had no idea just how powerful her story was.When we finally got to our destination in the woods further upriver, the light was too weak to penetrate the trees. The old grave of the horse was shrouded in darkness.Yet with the help of mobile torches we could view it, and for sure the grave was interesting and worth a story in its own right. I vowed to find out more about its background as we headed back to Marijersquos house in the dying embers of a sunset.When we reached her house we were treated to wonderful hospitality. It was then that Marije told her story of the beech tree.Not long ago she had been diagnosed with cancer. She faced the possibility of being taken by this cruel disease. Numbness and disbelief at first overcame her, then there was the realisation that le might be very short and she would have to leave her two young children.She walked to the beech tree soon after her diagnosis and sat cradled by its roots. Despite having family and friends whose love and support was invaluable, Marije explained it can also be a desperately lonely feeling. ldquoWe all know we canrsquot live forever, she told me, ldquobut to face the reality of my end at such a young age and with children was unbearable.ldquoI went on that walk to the tree in the most dire situation, she told me. ldquoI felt a connection as I sat under the tree, I really felt her old wisdom and energy.Her love for her young children is what gave her strength in the worst of times. The tree seemed to symbolise this powerful bond, its roots deeply holding it safe.ldquoPeople talk about mother nature, Marije said, ldquoand I understand why. When my hair fell out, I lsquogave it backrsquo to nature, underneath the beech. I know it makes me sound weird, but it really helped me.It is not weird, of course. Trees are full of wisdom, not in the sense of actual words but in the spiritual sense. Beech is said to be the matriarch of the wood, sometimes called the mother of the forest. It is a good listener. Our best ideas and inner reflections can come when we sit under the embrace of an old tree even science tells us this now.Sadly not everyone wins the fight against cancer, but thankfully Marije recovered after treatment. The experience has left her treasuring every single day and taking no sunrise for granted. And she is thankful to her beech tree, which was her companion and confidant in those times of emotional agony. It remains for her a place of contemplation and peace, where she can give thanks and absorb the joy of being alive.ldquoI cherish every day now in ways I didnrsquot before, she told me. ldquoI think it is important to allow our kids to feel the connection with nature. That means being in nature, and respecting it. After all, we are all part of it.This was the real story of that walk on that day a story of incredible bravery, pain, love and determination by a young mum I now have the privilege to call a friend."},{"url":null,"title":"labour-ties-bring-meeting-to-a-halt","story":"Prestonpans businessman Ferhan Ashiq had applied to increase the size of an alcohol display ndashand for a name change ndash at one of his stores.But Councillor Jim Goodfellowimmediately recused himself from the application because of his friendship with Mr Ashiq, who is a member of East Lothian Labour Party.After a short adjournment, Councillor Fiona Dugdale , convenor, also declared an interest.Remaining Labour councillor John McMillan, however, said he did not believe his relationship with Mr Ashiq, who has shops in Musselburgh and Prestonpans, could have an impact on his ability to make a decision, while Conservative councillor Jane Henderson said she did not know him.The boardrsquos legal adviser described the situation as ldquounusual but said the board was no longer quorate and Mr Ashiqrsquos application would have to be continued to the next licensing board for a decision.But a bemused Mr Ashiq noted: ldquoWhen it comes to the next meeting I will know most of the board members there.Legal adviser Carlo Grilli advised Mr Ashiq to send his father, whose name was on the application, and an agent instead.The application was to change the name of Mr Ashiqrsquos Prestonpans store on Redburn Road from Day-Today to Day Todayand increase the alcohol display from . square metres to . square metres."},{"url":null,"title":"rare-bottle-of-whisky-to-be-auctioned-for-combat-stress-charity","story":"It is one of only , matured in an American bourbon barrel for eight years, with a cask strength of  per cent alcohol.The auction is part of a fundraiser for Combat Stress, the veteransrsquo mental health charity, and is being organised by the music group the Flying Aspidistras ahead of their concert of remembrance, Now the Guns are Silent, at Gosford House on Sunday.The occasion will be a reflection on the harsh reality of war and the suffering felt beyond the battlefield.Kilchoman distillery on Islay has bottled this special single cask to coincide with the centenary of the end of the First World War.More poignantly, it is also to commemorate the sinking of two troopships, the SS Tuscania and the HMS Otranto, with the loss of nearly  men, in the waters around Islay in .Ailsa Fortune, the events organiser, said: \"The war affected every community in Scotland, from Islay to East Lothian.\"The end of any war leaves many broken lives.

This is a direct result of the Scottish Government slashing council funding over this period, with East Lothian Council having suffered cuts of around pound million in the last five years.ldquoEast Lothian Council has done its utmost to protect the budget.ldquoThe Scottish Government needs to recognise the impact its cuts are having and give local authorities the funding they need to protect services, including road maintenance.The county is currently covered by km of roads, ranging from class A routes to unclassied lanes.And an Annual Status and Options Report, produced on behalf of East Lothian Council, has revealed that  per cent are currently in need of repair.The report, which looks at the impact of future funding on network maintenance in the long term, warns that the current level of investment of pound.million a year will mean that more than  per cent of the roads will be in a state of disrepair in  yearsrsquo time.And it reveals that, as an asset, East Lothian Councilrsquos carriageways depreciate in value by poundmillion every year.It also found that nearly km of rural public roads in the county were in poor condition and needed immediate investigation and possible treatment.The report said: ldquoThe level of investment on public roads in East Lothian has not been sufficient to limit the decline in the overall condition of the network.It revealed that additional investment of pound.million over the next  years could signicantlyimprove the state of the roads, with fewer than  per cent likely to need repairs by the end of the decade.Peter Forsyth, asset manager for East Lothian Council, said that the recommendation for operating the carriageways following the report was to continue with the current level of investment.In a report to the councilrsquos policy and performance review committee, he said the costs of corrective treatments, in particular carriageway reconstruction, were ldquoprohibitive and a preventative treatment approach should ldquomitigate the need to invest signicantly.But he warned: ldquoShort-term under-investment could result in major long-term expenditure necessary to recty major defects which could have been addressed earlier.Councillor Jane Henderson , leader of the opposition, said: ldquoOur road infrastructure assets are vital and dficult decisions will need to be made.ldquoWithout investment now the amount of money needed in the future will be a greater problem the old expression of lsquoa stitch in time saves ninersquo was never so apt.ldquoThe decision on how much to spend on roads now will inevitably mean choices.

Visitors will be able to access it via a walkway.The plans were originally turned down after an objection from Transport Scotland, which felt it would ldquoresult in inappropriate parking which would interfere with the safety and free flow of traffic on the A.However, at the local review body meeting, three councillors disagreed and gave it the go-ahead.Among those approving the plans was ward councillor Norman Hampshire.

It is a collection of stories and anecdotes mainly relating to sporting le and animals.The following tale is inspired from one of the anecdotal stories in Eganrsquos book:ONE autumn evening in the early th century, a storm descended on the county. Dark clouds opened their dreich souls and drenched the land with a torrent of rain. The wind and downpour kept people awake for the whole night, and but by sunrise the tempest was over.Yet all the sudden rain had caused the River Tyne to flood. The folk of Haddington gathered by its banks to witness a strange sight. For the surface of the water was laid with huge masses of hay. The storm had obviously caused the hay recently cut and stacked in the fields upriver to be blown into the flood water, or swept away by it.They watched as small mountains of hay floated by. It was an intriguing sight but of course for farmers it was their winter feed for their animals going waste to the sea.Then someone spotted a swan. It seemed to be attempting to find a place to land. The river was in a torrent and at times the majestic creature seemed to give in to the current and glide on its course until once again it found the strength and motivation to make for the river bank. It was in no imminent danger, but clearly desired to get out of the fast-moving water.As people watched the swan it was noticed that a strange black spot could be seen amidst its white feathers. As the swan drted closer to the bank, people realised what the black spot was: a rat!The rat was clearly alive, at times peeping over the plumage asto see where they were. The swan seemed unperturbed by the ratrsquos presence on its back. In fact, as people watched more closely there seemed to be a connection between the swan and the rat which was most unusual.The royal bird was clearly giving the rat a collie-buckie, or piggy back. How the rat came to be on the swanrsquos back in the first place nobody could tell. The wee creature was very likely at home in one of the bales of hay when it was swept away by the river. In the swirling water it must have struggled to survive.Then rescue came with the swan. Could the creature have scrambled onto the swan without its permission  Surely not! Did the swan actively help the rat  If so, the moment of rescue had been a compassionate act unseen by human eyes. As people followed the drama they realised that the swan was looking for a place to land, not for itself but for its passenger.A crowd had soon gathered to witness the swanrsquos progress. The power of the flood water meant it had real dficulty in finding a place to get close to the river bank. But finally the swan found the strength and opportunity to swim close to the riverrsquos edge.The rat, recognising the opportunity, leaped from the swanrsquos plumage and landed safely on dry land. For an instant the rat turned and looked at the swan, then scampered away. The swan, its mission accomplished, majestically glided back into the main flow of the river.If the rat had thought itself safe then it soon realised this not to be the case. The people watching the spectacle had motivations very dferent to the swan. As soon as the rat landed, dozens of young men, urged on by their elders, chased it with sticks and set their dogs upon it.The animal, having survived naturersquos tempest, now faced an even greater danger his le was sport for humans. The creature zigzagged as people, yelling and howling with delight, chased it this way, then that. The rat, being cornered by a group of about  lads armed with stones and sticks, turned and headed back towards the water.But it didnrsquot make it. The creature was given a deadly blow by a lsquomerciless fellowrsquo. A cheer rang out and people came to view the dead rat. Then a strange silence descended as people reflected, now too late, on what had happened. In the frenzy of the chase it had been so easy to see the rat as merely vermin, rather than a living creature who had struggled to survive and so earned the right to le.People dispersed, no longer cheering.The whole scene had been witnessed by the swan from its vantage point on the river. What its thoughts were on the human behaviour it saw we can only guess.Humans can be made to do this to each other as well, of course. In the frenzy of war, people are encouraged to see others as no more worthy of le than that rat. And the insidious power of this is that both sides are encouraged to think the same way.But deep down, when we touch our humanity, we know how wrong this is. Old soldiers themselves are the first to understand the tragedy of it and see the humanity in those who had been on the lsquoother sidersquo. While there are undoubtedly people who commit evil and need to be stopped, it is the conditions which allow hate to flourish which give rise to their power and influence in the first place.In our remembrance of those who have fallen, let us do so with the reflection and not the frenzy. Let us not forget that the real enemy of us all is hate."},{"url":null,"title":"inspectors-impressed-on-visit-to-elphinstone-primary-school","story":"Parents of youngsters at Elphinstone Primary School and Nursery Class received a letter this week from Education Scotland and the Care Inspectorate following an inspection visit in September.The letter outlined a number of strengths at the school, as well as areas to improve.Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, told the Courier: ldquoWe are pleased that inspectors from both agencies recognise the positive dference that nursery and primary school staff are making for the children and their families in Elphinstone.ldquoThey considered leadership, learning, attainment and wellbeing amongst other areas and concluded that the school was good across these quality indicators.ldquoIrsquom especially pleased to see Alison Cameron receive recognition for her leadership and direction so early in her time as headteacher of the school.ldquoI know that she and the staff team will continue to put pupilsrsquo learning at the heart of all they do.ldquoIrsquod also like to recognise Heather Williamsrsquo work in laying the foundations for this positive outcome during her time at Elphinstone.The letter noted strengths in the schoolrsquos work, including kind and articulate children who make the most of their learning, and the warm, inclusive ethos that creates a family feel.No further inspections are planned, with the school urged to ldquodevelop a strategic, joined-up approach to self-evaluation to ensure that all children can achieve the best possible outcomes and to continue to develop the curriculum.Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet spokeswoman for education, echoed the comments of Mrs Robertson regarding the schoolrsquos former and current headteacher.She said: ldquoThe inspection recognised a number of areas such as the positive relationships across the nursery and school which are making a dference for children and families.ldquoThey also commented that children were making the most of their learning and were provided with real leadership opportunities at the school."},{"url":null,"title":"austerity-over-in-the-county-definitely-not","story":"Jim Lamond, head of East Lothian Council resources, dismissed claims austerity was coming to an end as a report warned of uncertainty about the future of farming, food and drink, and tourism after the UK left the European Union .Audit Scotland identied the potential problems facing East Lothian as the key sectors of its economy came under risk.

This yearrsquos calendar, which is now on sale, features two excellent shots of his ndash Buachaille Etive Mograver on the cover, and the railway bridge at Loch Awe as the illustration for August.Mr Stokes, , who lives in Dunoon, has been retired for  years. For  years ndash  with his own business ndash he designed and carved gravestones.ldquoWe covered the islands and up north, we had agents all over the place, he said this week. ldquoI took up photography in , because my we was getting fed up looking at me, and it has given me more of an artistic look at le than when I had all the design work I was doing with the gravestones for all these years.He was taken under the wing of Archie Reid, a Dunoon photographer, and a friend of his when they were younger.ldquoEverything is kept simple and basic. Compose your image, donrsquot just go running at it. Walk around. I try to do that so that when I get to the screen, therersquos very little left to do.ldquoMy camera is a Canon D that I bought from Archie. Itrsquos not like the huge cameras you can get nowadays. I use a couple of filters [attached to the front of the lens to enhance the final shot] and my favourite lens is a Sigma mm-mm. Archie put me onto it, and I can do everything with it. I also have a mm-m Canon, which is a great lens but I havenrsquot used it as often as I thought I would.ldquoI always use a tripod and a remote control when Irsquom doing serious pictures ndash I prefer not to hand-hold the camera in that sort of situation, involving long exposures. If yoursquore shooting a waterfall you might need an exposure of three or four seconds, for example.At first, Mr Stokes did wildle photography, ldquobut there is so much time involved in it, he says. ldquoItrsquos heartbreaking, trying to get a bird to land in a specic place or a squirrel to do your bidding. But landscape photography has its own heartache as well. You can run down to a scene where there are perfect reflections in the water but by the time you get down to the loch, it is full of ripples hellip and it drives it nuts, but that is all part of the fun.His shot of Buachaille Etive Mograver was taken from the frozen river at Kingshouse Hotel, in Glencoe. And at Loch Awe his eye was caught by the ldquototal flat calm of the reflection.ldquoThe two shots were bonus pictures, as I call them. Irsquom usually up at four in the morning when I leave Dunoon and Irsquom up north in pitch darkness, waiting for sunrise. Then I work my way through til about pm and I think, thatrsquoll do me.ldquoI shot both Buachaille and Loch Awe on my way home, though I donrsquot think they were on the same day. But it was nice to look at them once I got home.His work in The Heraldrsquos daily picture slot certainly has its fans. One woman has a file of all of his images that have been printed since , and she uses them as picture cards to send to family and friends. Other people have asked him for copies of his images. He is only too happy to oblige.ldquoI donrsquot make any charge, he adds. ldquoIrsquom just happy, getting back into le, and being nice to people. A lot of people, after all, canrsquot get out and about.TO ORDER YOUR CALENDARGo to https:heraldandtimes.myshopy collections the-herald or call   to order your calendar and pay by debit credit card.

I noticed it one day when I went to collect my son. This would have been around .I mentioned it to a friend. She and I were in the same womens group and a friend of hers had died from breast cancer. The brass plaque beside the tree was mottled and not very well looked after.One day I saw my friend cleaning it. She told me that her friend who died had been active in the feminist economic movement and she was cleaning the plaque in her memory. The Glasgow Womens Library got involved and they campaigned for it to be Tree of the Year in .The Suffragette Oak makes me think about the forgotten history of these women: the hard work and striving that went unnoticed. Thanks to these women who went that extra mile, we now have the vote ndash we have a voice.The tree was badly damaged in a storm last year and the council had to make it safe. The bits cut off were given to Glasgow Womens Library and they are making it into things to sell to raise funds. Isnt that lovely Another special tree was one I saw at a holiday place we rented at Achnacloich, near Oban.The gardens there have this amazing redwood that looks like a gigantic hand.The reason it looks like a hand was that when it was planted a rabbit kept nibbling the bud in the middle. Every time this rabbit nibbled it, another shoot would come out the side. It was one of the first redwoods to be grown in Scotland.We were staying there with loads of kids and it was the best climbing tree in the world ndash they would get lost in it.You would be sitting outside having a cup of tea in the morning and suddenly hear a wee voice from up in the tree asking: \"Whats your favourite flavour of crisps \"Carole Baxter, Beechgrove Garden presenterI LOVE rowan trees. All the species are beautul. There is such a range of colourful berries and they are a hardy plant. In my garden in Aberdeenshire I have eight ieties including cashmiriana, Joseph Rock and the native rowan.I have enjoyed the rowan for its berries as long as I can remember, certainly from a young age. It is a value-for-money plant: you have the blossom and fruits, lovely foliage and great autumn colour.People perhaps arent aware of the range of species and named ieties. You dont need to have the one that has the orange-red berries you can get white, yellow and pink berries.There are some small ones as well, such as Sorbus reducta which is ideal for a rock garden. We have that one at Beechgrove as well as vilmorinii, which has pink berries with almost blueish foliage. Those were my plant choices.What is interesting is that birds tend to home in on the red and orange berries to start off with so,you have cashmiriana with its white berries, it tends to hold the berries a bit longer.This year has been particularly good for the fruits because we had a cold spring and it gradually got warmer, so we didnt have the frost and the blossoms werent damaged, which was then followed by a nice hot summer.It is nothing to do with the fact we are going to have a hard winter as people often say ndash thats an old wives tale ndash it is the fact that we have had a good season.Episodes of Beechgrove Garden are available on BBC iPlayer until November Gordon Buchanan, wildle filmmakerSCOTS pine has been my favourite tree from a young age. I grew up on Mull and I have always loved woodland. I spent a lot of time as a kid walking through the woods.One walk we did took us a mile or so out of Tobermory. When you are eight or nine, even just going a couple of miles out of town feels like you are exploring the other side of the planet.It was while out walking that I first saw a Scots pine. It was one of those classic old \"granny\" pines with so much character, the limbs were all twisted ndash there was one that came out at a right angle and shot skywards.This Scots pine stood among mixed birch and there was no other tree around it that looked the same. It seemed so exotic and out of place. Your eye was drawn to it.As I got older and spent time in the Cairngorms and Abernethy Forest, I learned that much of Scotland was covered in forests filled with these trees. I thought it was the most magical habitat.The tree then became a symbol for all the wildle that you find living in those forests. I have spent time filming capercaillie as well as red deer, red squirrels and pine martens among the trees.Weirdly, now I have travelled further than just a couple of miles out of town, whenever I see Scots pine, they dont look exotic to me. I have recently been working in Russia where there is mixed birch woodland and what I call \"Caledonian Forest\" ndash this reminder of home.My love of Scots pine is undiminished but they have gone from being a symbol of the exotic to something very familiar.A couple of years ago I was working in a mountainous region of Turkey and you could almost have been in the Cairngorms. It was very similar. I felt at home.Animal Families and Me with Gordon Buchanan is at Kirkintilloch Town Hall on November , Brunton Theatre in Musselburgh on November  and Rothes Halls in Glenrothes on November Kirsty Wark, broadcasterA TREE is a marker, something you look out for at a particular time of year. My Japanese maple in the garden, for example, you just know when the leaves are going to turn, be vivid and then flutter to the ground.The yellow-berried rowan is one of my favourite trees. I love lime trees because I think they are so vivid in the landscape.Trees represent a constancy. Planting trees is entirely altruistic because, unless they are fast-growing, you are never in your letime going to get the real benefit of them. I love the fact that parks were laid out by the Victorians ndash and even much earlier with Lancelot \"Capability\" Brown.After my father died, we planted a rowan where he loved to fish most, which was Kendoon Loch in Galloway. That was in . It is beside the water and Im not sure it is the most fertile place for it, but it is hanging on in there. I went to see it last week.In Celtic mythology the rowan symbolises courage and protection. That is why you will often see old houses with rowans planted in the front garden by the gate. We planted a red rowan for Dad, but I really like a yellow rowan too.I used to know the names of all the trees because I was in the Brownies. I dont know them all now. I love walking in the forest up to Glenashdale Falls and Whiting Bay on Arran, those specic spaces where you are surrounded by flora and fauna.Sir John Lister-Kaye, author and naturalistTHERE is an ash tree that is one of the biggest trees in the garden here at House of Aigas near Beauly and almost certainly the oldest ndash it is possibly  years old. It is right beside the house.Ashwas a very valuable timber throughout the th and th centuries. It was used for all sorts of things ndash implement handles, cart frames, furniture.It is a very good, close-grained hardwood. Very few ash trees ever survived more than  or  years, perhaps  years, because they were too valuable. Highlanders were not well off and it was a good way of making money.There are very few old ash trees in the Highlands. This one has survived simply because it is so close to an th-century house and I think the owners must have said many times: \"Dont fell that tree, we like it\". And so it survived.What is wonderful about it is that it has survived for so long and that means it has seen so much. For instance, it will have seen Bonnie Prince Charlie come through raising the clans which, of course, culminated in the Battle of Culloden.It saw the folk mourning after the loss of Culloden and it saw Cholmondeleys regiment come and camp here and then burn the tacksmans house down right beside it. The tree must have been scorched by that fire. The Frasers who were living here at the time were all murdered in May .It has witnessed some real horrors. Later, it will have witnessed the Highland Clearances, people pulling out and leaving for the New World. It will have witnessed the Victorians arriving with their grand ideas and turning the place into a sporting estate.This \"loftier ash\", as I call it ndash because that is what Fraxinus excelsior means ndash has seen a lot of history and for that reason alone it is a very valuable tree. In my book Song of the Rolling Earth: A Highland Odyssey, I dedicated a whole chapter to it.Let me read you a bit from it: \"The ash tree has witnessed it all. I stand at its foot. Great roots have corrugated the ground around it with broad woody thongs undulating outwards in a circular plate of tangle and deep grip, roots that trail far across the lawns in every direction.\"It is solid, purposeful, locked in. Its trunk writhes with power. It is all heart. My fullest reach, both arms stretched, extends to less than a third of its circumference an inconsequential hug leaving me in awe of its rigid grandeur.\"Its bark is deeply grooved with long vertical ripples of hardness like a throng of ribbed buttresses all heading upward, shoring up its might, shedding veils of green dust at my touch.\"The bark fissures draw in treecreepers: those tiny mouse-like birds that dash upwards in little jerky pulses, defying gravity. Then, giving in to the earths pull, they flick down again, back to start, like a game of snakes and ladders never won.\"I am enthralled by this tree, rapt. Every time I stand here, I shrink it grows. I age it shrugs off such foibles and just goes on expanding into a thousand shaded alleys. What is  minutes or a week when you are  years old \"Song of the Rolling Earth: A Highland Odyssey by Sir John Lister-Kaye is published by Abacus, priced pound.. Visit aigasPaul Murton, Grand Tours of Scotland presenterA TREE that I have always admired is a rowan that grows from a huge boulder. It is one that everyone will have seen as they are driving north up the A to Fort William.Just as you get to Rannoch Moor and are climbing up above Loch Tulla, there on the left-hand side of the road is a massive boulder left over from the Ice Age.There is a crack in it where, for many years, this amazing little rowan tree has been growing.It has been blasted by the elements and cant be getting many nutrients from the rock, so I dont know how it survives.There is something quite symbolic about it. I have filmed it several times for programmes over the years. It also appears in one of my favourite books, Mountaineering in Scotland by WH Murray.In fact, the first time I saw this rowan tree was in WH Murrays book when I was  or .I hitchhiked from Dunoon to Glencoe to go climbing and I remember seeing it in the flesh and thinking: \"Oh, thats the one in the book\".That was exciting because I felt I was on the trail of real mountaineers. Any mountaineer who had been up to Glencoe going back decades will have seen that wee tree.How did it end up there  Perhaps a crow or a raven carried a berry, dropped it and it then got stuck in a crack where there was enough nutrients for roots to grow. It must be at least  years old.Im a bit of a secret tree hugger. I planted a lot of trees at my mothers place in Argyll years ago and it is nice to admire how much they have grown. There are a couple of chestnut trees, beech trees and Scots pine.Episodes of Grand Tours of Scotlands Lochs are available on BBC iPlayer until November . The series will be repeated on BBC in Greg McHugh, actorI GREW up in Morningside in Edinburgh and at the bottom of the garden were steps down to a wood. There was a mud road with a wall and trees behind it. I loved spending time there.All the kids in my street would go down and play. It was an incredible place. I know people think of Morningside as being posh, but this wasnt a kept space. It was completely wild and overgrown. My mum would always shout as I went out the door: \"Dont go near the giant hogweed!\"It was this little hidden spot in the city. When I was in third year at school, I did a history project on it and learned that this was the old \"poorhouse\" road that had grown over.To think of the families that would have walked up and down there, the trees have been witness to all of that.We would gather conkers, climb and make rope swings among the trees and put old doors down over the stream. On fireworks night there would be a big bonfire and all the families in the street went along.One of my brothers mates stood on a wasps nest and was incredibly badly stung. Afterwards it gave spending time among the trees a new element of risk. The thing that sticks in my mind is that, while during the day it was our playground, we would never dare go down there at night.The inaugural Scottish Tree Festival organised by Discover Scottish Gardens features more than  tree-themed events and runs until December .

To find a location, he followed instructions said to have come to him in a dream and loaded panniers of gold on the back of a donkey.William followed the animal as it roamed across his lands. When night fell, it rested under a tree on a higher and rockier site close to the steep-sided Allt Dearg.The castle was built on that spot with the unique quirk that it was constructed around the tree. This subsequently became a feature of part of the cellar, known since as ldquoThe Hawthorn Room.Legend has it that the tree has magical qualities which have on more than one occasion saved the castle from disaster.Modern scientic analysis has revealed that the tree died in approximately , most likely as a result of being deprived of light because the castle had been built around it.

Starting out as orange in the spring, they become a pinkish-brown and then yellow, before finally turning deep green.By late autumn, the leaves have taken on a deep red hue, complementing its peeling, coppery bark.

The people of the UK deserve better.\"Mr Vara, a former Conservative vice chairman who has served as a whip and on the frontbenches for the bulk of his career since entering Parliament in , backed Remain in the  referendum.In Brussels, Mr Tusk was handed a copy of the -page withdrawal agreement by EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier.Ministers and ambassadors of the remaining  EU states will work to finalise by next Tuesday the political declaration on future relations with the UK, published in outline form on Wednesday, he said.Welcoming the UK Cabinets collective agreement to accept the withdrawal document, Mr Tusk said: \"Of course, I do not share the Prime Ministers enthusiasm about Brexit as such.\"Since the very beginning, we have had no doubt that Brexit is a lose-lose situation and our negotiations are only about damage control.\"And he sent a message to the British people: \"As much as I am sad to see you leave, I will do everything to make this farewell the least painful possible, both for you and for us.\"Mr Barnier had \"ensured the limitation of the damage caused by Brexit and ... secured the vital interests and principles of the  member states and of the European Union as a whole,\" said Mr Tusk.As Mrs May prepared to make a statement on the Brexit agreement to the House of Commons on Thursday, the precariousness of her position was underlined as a Brexit-backing Tory claimed that the chairman of the backbench  Committee Sir Graham Brady may already have received the  MPs letters needed to trigger a vote of no confidence in the leader.Anne Marie Morris told BBCs Newsnight: \"My belief - but it is a belief without evidence, because Graham keeps it close to his chest - is that we do have the .\"What depends on whether or not they can be used is whether or not those members who have put them in give him the go-ahead.

Indeed, it doesnrsquot meet the tests you set from the outset of your premiership.Repeatedly you have said that we must regain control of our money, our borders and our laws and develop our own independent trade policy. I have always supported you to deliver on those objectives. Even after Chequers when you knew I shared the concerns of a very signicant number of colleagues, I believed that we could still work collectively to honour the will of the British people and secure the right outcome for the future of our country. This deal fails to do this.The proposals put before Cabinet, which will soon be judged by the entire country, means handing over around poundbn to the EU without anything in . It will trap us in a customs union, despite you specically promising the British people we would not be. It will bind the hands of not only this, but future Governments in pursuing genuine free trade policies. We wouldnrsquot be taking back control, we would be handing over control to the EU and even to a third country for arbitration.It also threatens the integrity of the United Kingdom, which as a Unionist is a risk I cannot be party to.The British people have always been ahead of politicians on this issue, and it will be no good trying to pretend to them that this deal honours the result of the referendum when it is obvious to everyone it doesnrsquot.We have gone from no deal is better than a bad deal, to any deal is better than no deal.I cannot defend this, and I cannot vote for this deal. I could not look my constituents in the eye were I to do that.

But it was Mrs May that ruled out freedom of movement, so that meant outside the single market, and so on.In Strasbourg this week Ive done a tonne of media and had meetings with fellow MEPs to re-emphasise Scotlands view on Brexit. Across the board the response of our European friends is \"what the hell is the UK *doing* \"They respect the process that has led us to the result, but they do not understand why the UK has behaved as it has since. In attempting to square an impossible circle Mrs May has produced the worst of all worlds to both Remain and Leave voters.Several have privately expressed sympathy for Scotlands plight, and had a specic status for Scotland been proposed by the UK it would have been examined honestly.But it wasnt, and as long as we remain a part of the UK they cant solve our problems for us. And, frankly, Im not encouraging anyone to get involved in our domestic debate, yet.For the moment, we are part of a member state and for the moment the UK can call on the solidarity of members.

Some estimates say more than , ethnic Tamils were massacred.These wartime atrocities and allegations of corruption and nepotism consistently marred Mr Rajapaksarsquos presidency.Last month however on October , the alliance between Mr Sirisena and Mr Wickremesinghe formally crumbled, with Mr Sirisena naming Mr Rajapaksa the new prime minister and suspending Parliament.After a week of upheaval that included street protests, Mr Sirisena announced he was dissolving Parliament and calling snap elections due on January .Since then Mr Wickremesinghe has been holed up in the prime ministerrsquos official residence in the Sri Lankan capital, Colombo, maintaining he is the countryrsquos rightful leader and repeatedly calling for Parliament to be reconvened so that he could prove his majority support among the countryrsquos  politicians.This week the crisis deepened even further after Sri Lankarsquos politicians passed a no-confidence motion against purported Prime Minister MrRajapaksa.His allies however have now refused to recognise the legitimacy of this weekrsquos vote, further fuelling the uncertainty of the past weeks and leaving it unclear who,anyone, is currently Sri Lankarsquos lawful prime minister.It would be wrong to underestimate just how signicant this crisis is, given that its outcome will likely determine the future course of democracy in Sri Lanka, a country still struggling with the legacy of its bitter -year civil war that ended in .Already a number of international human rights groups and conflict monitors have flagged up the dangers in President Sirisenarsquos efforts to impose Mr Rajapaksa as prime minister.According to Alan Keenan an analyst at the conflict monitoring think-tank International Crisis Group , Mr Sirisenarsquos actions were ldquoillegal, with the result that ldquoSri Lankarsquos democracy is at stake.ldquoRajapaksa appears to be in a strong position. He has the backing of the president and the sympathy of the police and army. The longer he controls the state, the more likely it is for him to win the vote when parliament convenes, Mr Keenan said recently.While this weeksrsquos motion aimed at removing Mr Rajapaksa and his cabinet from their posts is a boost to sacked incumbent Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, few expect Mr Rajapaksa will take such a move lying down and many fear the worst may yet be about come in this bitter contest between the two men. For his part Mr Wickremesinghe remains undaunted.ldquoIf anyone wants to challenge the speakerrsquos decision they can put it to a vote, he insisted yesterday.ldquoWe will now take steps to ensure that the government in place before Oct  will continue, he later posted on Twitter.Just who precisely is prime minister though still remains unclear, adding to confusion over who controls the army and other state bodies. As the stand-off continues and tensions rise itrsquos not just Sri Lankans that are looking on nervously.The US, UK, and other powers have raised concerns over the crisis in this strategically important island nation of  million people. For behind the struggle for power inside the country a bigger tussle for economic power between India and China is going on.The big fear for India is that Sri Lanka, just off its southern coast and on one of the worldrsquos busiest maritime routes, could become a Chinese military outpost.ldquoIndia can ill-afford to ignore the strategic advantage China has gained in Sri Lanka so close to peninsular India, was how Colonel R. Hariharan, a retired Indian Army intelligence officer summed up the threat recently.In Colombo, Chinese companies are constructing a . billion new commercial district, including hotels, marinas and a motor racing track, and have already built a giant container terminal nearby and a huge port in the south.This economic backdrop has only exacerbated the current leadership crisis in Sri Lanka where the issue of how far to accommodate Indian interests has been a signicant factor.While Mr Wickremesinghe is seen to lean more towards New Delhi Mr Rajapaksa has long been regarded as more pro-China. For the moment both giant countries have remained comparatively quiet on the current crisis.Earlier this week, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres offered to moderate in discussions, urging the Sri Lankan government to respect ldquodemocratic processes and institutions.So far his offer has fallen on deaf ears."},{"url":null,"title":"third-of-eu-doctors-look-at-moving-out-due-to-brexit","story":"Doctorsrsquo leaders at the British Medical Associationwarned such an exodus ldquowould be a disaster for the health service.The BMA survey also found  per cent of European doctors working in Scotland are ldquounconvinced promises made about their rights would be protectedthe UK quits the European Union without a deal.That proportion was higher than the % who were not convinced by this across the UK as a whole.BMA Scotland chairman Dr Lewis Morrison said: ldquoAs Brexit creeps ever closer, it is appalling that so many of our colleagues are living with such uncertainty over what their future will be.ldquoThe results of this survey clearly show a deep distrust in the promises that have been made to date.More than , doctors working in the UK who had been trained in Europe completed the survey, including  currently working in Scotland.But more than a thirdof these doctors north of the Border said they were not aware of the UKrsquos settled status scheme for European citizens currently living and working in the UK, while % said they are considering moving abroad.Dr Morrison said: ldquoWe should be absolutely clear that losing the contribution to our NHS of doctors from where in Europe would be a disaster for our health service.ldquoThese are our friends and our colleagues and with just a handful of months to go, too many of them do not know what their future will be afterBrexit.The survey was carried out between the end of September and the beginning of November, before Theresa Mayrsquos Government agreed a Brexit deal with the EU.

The Spice Girls approach to feminism was always at pains to be palatable but it doesnt do to overthink them, for ones own equilibrium.Carrying on the tradition, Emma Bunton says the band is, rather than all about Girl Power, now about \"people power.\"Opining on the most serious situation Britain has faced in my letime, the Spice Girls are calling for unity. \"Wersquore about equality and bringing everyone together, she says. And thus, the band is concerned about Brexit. Fortunately, Ms Horner, using the skills honed during her -plus years as international ambassador for the UNs population fund, is on hand to help out.\"Britain,\" she says, digging out a replica Union flag dress and standing tall, \"Come together, whatever it is. We donrsquot have to agree on politics, itrsquos bigger than that.\"You can just support a woman doing the best she can and thatrsquos it. Not an easy position.\"Its not an easy position, Geri, is it. Nor a position entirely without its problems.Horner is somewhat famed for her admiration of Britains first female Prime Minister, \"the first Spice Girl, the pioneer of our ideology\". There is much about the Spice Girls message that is conservative: inidualism not co-operation a focus on making money pro-British, anti-EU the pursuit of capitalism.At the death of Margaret Thatcher, Horner tweeted in her praise, was lambasted and deleted the tweet. She later publicly chided herself for doing so, saying she had failed to show the same strength of character as her heroine.Unlike Mrs Thatcher, the lady was - altogether now - for turning.Ms Horners latest trite pseudo-profound warbling is that high-achieving women are automatically positive role models, regardless of the impact of their achievements on women collectively. But not all female success is by default feminist.Its the logic supporting former American Secretary of State Madeleine Albrights famous \"theres a special place in hell for women who dont support other women.\" I see Ms Albrights stance and raise her Katie Hopkins.The logical end to that would be that I am compelled to support the Janus-faced Horner - she who has both pinched the bum of Prince Charlesand acted as UN Goodwill Ambassador - and Im afraid I do not.Mrs Albright used her catchphrase in relation to Presidential candidate Hilary Clinton during the US elections of .Mrs Clinton herself refused to heed this advice when she criticised Monica Lewinsky recently, denying her husbands affair while in office constituted an abuse of power. An intern, lest we need reminded, and the President of the United States.Mrs Clinton also chose to back the incumbent Andrew M Cuomo over his challenger Cynthia Nixon in New Yorkrsquos Democratic gubernatorial primary. What would Ms Horner make of it all In a way, she is correct. Feminism is an obligation to support and help other women. It is a willingness to lt other women up, mentor women, promote them, evenit means putting oneself out.It is not, though, a case of unquestioningly promoting other women at any cost.It is desperately patronising to suggest that the simple fact of being female is a bridge that should cross any political isions, any ideological ide, between women. It does, in fact, do far more harm to not contest or contradict women who are doing great damage to other women.The Spice Girls turned heads for being unabashedly bombastic. Mel B once compared the bands musical petition for girl power with Nelson Mandelas decades-long anti-apartheid fight. Whats the opposite of imposter syndrome Tthe bands great power came from their insistence of friendships taking priority over romantic relationships.During the interview praising Theresa May, Melanie C chips in to compliment the politicians dance techniques. This is a position I can back. There was a distinct whf of bullying in the response to the Prime Ministers attempts to move to the music. We all cringed but they who who wouldnt cut some mad shapes while under pressure to be rhythmic may cast the first stone.The message of friendship is perhaps one Ms Horner could apply to her relationship with the questionable Mrs May. Harriet Harmans verdict on Mrs May was that, \"Shes a woman - but no sister.\"It is possible to be friends and disagree, it is possible to be sisters and disagree. We can, say, vehemently oppose a womans politics while not mocking her dancing.A woman in power is not necessarily a positive force and it is distinctly unfeminist to suggest women shouldnt speak out to say so."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-branded-modern-day-chamberlain-during-radio-phone-in","story":"Appearing on LBCs Nick Ferrari Show, Mrs May was told to quit, make way for Jacob Rees-Mogg and even compared to former premier Neville Chamberlain, notorious for his policy of appeasement towards Hitler.Caller John, from Gillingham, labelled Mrs May a \"modern-day Chamberlain\", the prime minister who famously claimed to have secured \"peace for our time\" in negotiations with Hitler, only for the Second World War to break out the following year.John asked the Prime Minister: \"Do you consider yourself the modern-day Chamberlain, who also went to Europe and negotiated with a foreign power and came back having appeased that foreign power and not stood up for our country \"I would like you to stand up for our country and stand up for whats best for our country.

Drinks giant Diageo was one of the official supporters of International Womenrsquos Day .Ms Emslie now hopes that women will see through these ploys and use the #dontpinkmydrink hashtag on Twitter to call out the alcohol industryrsquos ldquopatronising marketing.Meanwhile, Alcohol Focus Scotland is calling for more protection from alcohol advertising, including a phased removal of alcohol sponsorship of sports, music and cultural events, and for an independent body to regulate alcohol marketing.Their chief executive, Alison Douglas, said: ldquoThere have been many positives to come out of increased gender equality but the alcohol industry has seen it as an opportunity to expand their market base and create products that appeal to women, such as prosecco and gin.The statistics are sobering ndash one in fourof Scots drink at harmful levels of more than  units a week, according to the Scottish Health Survey of , and figures from the National Records of Scotland show there were , alcohol-related deaths in  ndash an increase of % compared with the previous year.We are certainly drinking far more than previous generations ndash the total consumption of alcohol rose by % between  and , according to the Scottish Government.There has been a nine per cent decrease in alcohol consumption per adult since , but the levels are still high with a fth more alcohol sold per adult in Scotland than in England and Wales.Around  people a week die from alcohol-related deaths in Scotland ndash more than  per cent higher than south of the border.However, womenrsquos part in the national sport of drinking to excess is hugely overplayed in the media, according to Professor Emslie, and shows how women face double standards.ldquoAlthough womenrsquos drinking has increased over the last  years, men drink far more and have more alcohol related deaths. Women are judged more harshly on their drinking and risk being viewed with contempt and sexual assault when they drink too much, she said.The figures bear out her argument: in , According to the Scottish Health Survey, % of men in Scotland drink more than  units a week compared with % of women.Men in Scotland drink an average of . units of alcohol a week, and women an average of . units. Deaths related to alcohol stood at  for men in  and  for women.

think anybody who works closely with the Prime Minister, as I do, learns what an absolutely backbreaking job that is.ldquoWith each day that passes, even more this week, I am so impressed with the Prime Ministerrsquos resilience and her strength of character.ldquoI sometimes wonder what it is that makes her get up in the morning and come in and face the disobliging headlines and cartoons.ldquoAnd actually what it is, I know her down to sitting in meetings with her and talking to her, itrsquos a very old fashioned sense of public service and public duty.ldquoShersquos not somebody who goes in for grandstanding, showboating for media opportunities, shersquos there for very decent, old-fashioned sense of public duty.ldquoAnd I would say to people who are plotting against her ndash this is a woman who is intensely patriotic, intensely dutul who is doing her utmost for families and businesses in every corner of this country.ldquoThey havenrsquot got a better alternative plan available to the one that she has worked on, and they should rally behind her because thatrsquos what the national interest asks of them.The Prime Minister has faced mounting speculation about her future after key figures, including Brexit secretary Dominic Raab, dramatically quit her Cabinet because they could not support the proposed withdrawal deal.Meanwhile, several Tory MPs have submitted letters of no confidence in Mrs May, with sources now indicating the number sent to Sir Graham Brady, the chair of the backbench  Committee, may be nearing the  needed to trigger a leadership challenge.Mr Lidington laughed off suggestions he is being lined up as a ldquocaretaker Prime MinisterMrs May is forced out, adding: ldquoI think that anyone who has seen what being Prime Minister involved is quickly cured of any ambition in that direction.The Cabinet Office Minister also moved to reassure Scottish Tory MPs concerned about plans to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson and Scottish Secretary David Mundell previously threatened to resignNorthern Ireland was treated dferently to the rest of the UK ndash fearing it could undermine the Union and boost Scottish independence.Mr Lidington said ldquobackstop proposals which would see Northern Ireland more closely aligned with EU rules had ldquoalways been conceived as an insurance policy only and there was a determination they wouldnrsquot be implemented.But he rebuffed SNP calls for Scotland to receive similar treatment, adding: ldquoI think that the history of Northern Ireland ndash the fact that there is still a fragile peace building process after decades of bitter and bloodthirsty conflict, means that there is a special circumstance that applies in Northern Ireland.ldquoAnd that land border ndash the only land border the UK has with any other country in the EU ndash has both an economic but also a real political and talismanic signicance that doesnrsquot apply anywhere .ldquoItrsquos a mixture of the practical and the political that is at work here.Mr Lidington called on the First Minister to support Mrs Mayrsquos deal to protect jobs and the economy.He said: ldquoI think there will be an important choice for the Scottish Government and for Scottish members of parliament at Westminster.ldquoEmployers in all sectors want a deal, and they want the stability and the certainty and the clarity that that will bring.ldquoAnd I hope very much that, despite the political dferences that do exist, and which I respect, that the First Minister will in the end decide to put the interests of Scottish business and living standards and prosperity in Scotland first and support this deal.ldquoWe, for our part, will continue to listen to the views of the Scottish and Welsh governments, to engage with them as we have been doing in recent days, weeks and months and to ensure that their interests are represented and defended in negotiations.He said Ms Sturgeon had refused to meet him during his visit to Edinburgh ndash a claim the First Minister branded ldquooutrageous.She said her office was given short notice and she ldquowasnrsquot prepared to cancel my constituency commitments at such short notice for the Scottish Government to yet again have to hear empty platitudes rather than be listened

Jim therefore tried to find historical accuracy as far as possible by researching contemporary documents and manuscripts that held vital evidence.\"There are certain liberties you can take, like for example the drumming used by the armies preparing for battle and that is often for dramatic effect.\"The film is billed as a \"true David versus Goliath story\" of how the great th-century \"outlaw king\" Robert the Bruce used cunning and bravery to defeat the larger and better-equipped occupying English army.At the films debut during the Toronto Film Festival last year there were a few raised eyebrows when American actor Chris Pine, who plays Bruce, appeared full-frontal naked in one scene.Directed by Oscar-nominated film-maker David Mackenzie the epic was shot in ious Scottish locations throughout  and Jim spent six months working on the diegetic soundtrack.Jim said: \"I had a meeting with David Mackenzie just a few weeks before the shoot and none of this particular aspect was planned. David calls himself a jazz film-maker and doesnt really like to spend too much time planning it all out. Its very much part of his style.\"Jims mother, Beryl, still lives in Thurso and said she is \"immensely proud\" of her sons achievements.Friday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118144.jpg","title":"Writings on the wall for Graffito","story":"THURSO has embraced an artistic legacy stretching back to the s with a vibrant mural in the town centre created last Wednesday by an artist from the Black Isle.Unlike the earlier work on Tollemache House by Polish artist Caziel Zielenkiewicz ndash a student of Picasso ndash the latest piece of public art has so far achieved great praise from the majority of people commenting on social media.The Facebook page for Caithness Horizons Museum and Art Galleryndash who commissioned the work by Marc Delaye ndash has attracted many comments about the colourful artwork gracing a wall of their carpark.Lora Dillon said: \"Went down to see it today. We all love it.\"Gill Arrowsmith and Shirley Sinclair both thought the painting was \"fantastic\" while Annemarie Simpson thought that a similar venture in Wick would help tackle the \"towns eyesore\" buildings.While on that subject, one dissenting voice condemned the piece and said there was a \"masterpiece eyesore now in Wilson Street thanks to Caithness Horizons\".Beauty is, of course, in the eye of the beholder.The mural depicts a portrait of Thursos renowned botanist and geologist Robert Dick surrounded by a kaleidoscopic representation of the CHMAG facade and the scientists specimen collection.The bold use of line and colour based on modern urban graffiti cannot fail to be noticed just like the mural on nearby Tollemache House but is sited in a much less conspicuous space ndash the gallerys car park.CHMAGs curator Merran Gunn, who was instrumental in commissioning Delaye to create the work, said the artist had also spray painted a wall within the building as part of a show running called Graffito.His earlier piece has an explosive anime style figure punching out of the wall toward the viewer.\"Marcs work is bold and vibrant, electric colours jostle for dominance, and the new outside mural is no exception with tangerine skies set behind the historic Thurso of Robert Dick,\" said Gunn.Thursos illustrious scientist had his herbarium collection feature in an earlier work by the artist Joanne Carr which in turn is featured within Delayes mural ndash a clear case of one artist paying homage to another.\"Graffiti and street art is more relevant than ever whether it be in the art world ndash with the recent record sale of Banksys girl with a balloon ndash or here in the Highlands where graffiti has made its way onto the syllabus at Farr High School through art teacher Tracy Wilkinson,\" she said.After garnering great positive feedback from the current show Merran decided to \"have a moment of spontaneity\" and raised funds through a crowdfunding website and the Dounreay Communities Fund to commission Marc Delaye to breath some le into a fairly drab corner of the town.Tracy Dodson, commercial manager of CHMAG, said that the gallery was \"breaking boundaries\" with Graffito.\"It questions what actually constitutes art and what gets shown in a gallery. Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Friday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"November ,  at : amThe nomination period for the  Orkney Sports Awards remains open.

Descendants of both Vice Admiral Fremantle and Rear Admiral von Reuter will be attending the conference.The conference will cover not only the scuttle, but also the history and impact of that fateful day.Speakers will explore the American navy#s vital role in the war, how the scuttle was interpreted in Germany and how the legacy still lives on today.Six months before the centenary itself, this will be a wonderful opportunity to share Scapa#s history, stimulate ideas for  and build a lasting knowledge of what happened and why.Nick Jellicoe will publish two books next year: The Last Days of the High Seas Fleet and, in partnership with the Orcadian, Scuttle to Salvage, a book about in photographs. He is shortly launching a website to support the centenary, Scapaflow and will be producing another animation The Scapa Flow Naval History Conference will take place at Kirkwall Grammar School, Friday and Saturday, November  and .Details on the conference can be found on https:shop.scapaflow copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We are pleased to confirm we have made some changes to the substation design at Finstown, which we hope will go some way to address concerns raised. We are also pleased to confirm that we will underground the proposed infrastructure at Hoxa Head.#In the coming weeks, SSEN’s project team will continue to assess the responses received as it further refines the project design.SSEN plans to submit its planning applications for the proposed substation at Finstown, the subsea cable and the underground land cable that will connect Finstown to the subsea cable later this year, while a final round of public consultation will be held in Spring  on the onshore infrastructure required to connect the ious renewable projects looking to connect on Orkney to Finstown substation.For more information on the project, including the latest visualisations of the proposed substation at Finstown, please visit: https:www.ssen-transmission projects orkney copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Buses will be the initial target of the pollution crackdown, with an increasing proportion having to have the cleanest diesel engines to use the zone.For First Glasgow, clean diesel, rather than electric, is the “only show in town” when electrics can only manage  miles before having being charged for four hours, when a typical route involves  miles a day.: Alastair Dalton: Failure to curb cars in cities is throttling busesIt said electric buses were three times the price of diesel ones, at about £, each, and you would never recoup the dference in lower running costs.But the worry must be that while the technology is evolving, there could be repeats of the situation in Glasgow, where the city’s only electric service was threatened with the closure because operator Garelochhead Coaches said the cost of running it had become prohibitive because the four-year-old vehicles’ warranty had run out.Electric buses are smoother and will cut pollution where it matters, such as around passengers waiting at bus stops.But there are likely to be a number of jolts to come on the road to buses becoming greener as well as more attractive to passengers.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4830460.1542310923!/image/image.jpg","title":"kevan christie tv bosses discover formula to make us all get netflix anxiety disorder","story":"Netflix Anxiety Disorder # the social pressure to watch TV box sets # has replaced obsessional interest in music and trainers as the way to define whether you are cool or not, writes Kevan Christie.“Have you seen Killing Eve yet  You should watch it - you’ll love it.

You fall into the category of ... perfectly normal human being and who might even spend time outdoors.If, however, you’re cancelling social engagements, gym appointments and the flu jab in the hope of getting ill, so as to make time for ‘box-setting’ then you’ve got a problem and are showing the first symptoms of a fledgling illness, let’s call it Netflix Anxiety Disorder .This obsession with television in the form of box sets is the new cool for those of us who care about such things.In my day, it was what music you were into and what trainers you wore to stand outside the chippy that mattered and woe betide anyone who turned up in the school playground wearing Adidas Kicks instead of Samba. The Face magazine was our bible and everyone dressed like a golfer on acid.: The most exciting TV dramas still to come this yearGo back to the s and it was the album under your arm that defined you – Roxy Music, Bowie or Steely Dan good, anything by The Wurzels bad.But now, the all-consuming television or ‘idiot box’ as it was once known is calling the shots and heaven forbid that you’re one of those relics who still watches terrestrial TV in chronological order – Bic Biro pen at the ready waiting to circle preferred programmes in the paper.At this point, I have to admit to I’m exhibiting the classic symptoms of NAD. I’ve found myself getting anxiousmy TV planner has less than  per cent capacity left for recording programmes. It’s the same feeling I get when running low on milk or sticking the last piece of bread in the toaster. I also worry that I’ve not got enough Maltesers in my chocolate stash to see me through a marathon box set sesh.To compound the problem, my planner is full of stuff I’ve taped – yes, I still say taped – but know I’ll never watch.This is made up of programmes I watched as a child and still feel nostalgic about – The World at War and the Rockford Files being two examples, although I reckon this is down to the theme tunes.: Dani Garavelli: Killing Eve heralds new lease of leThere’s also a fair chunk of pretentious stuff that I know I’ll never watch but I have taped in the faint hope it might improve me as a person.This includes the Art of France, Germany and Scandinavia, Jean-Luc Godard’s classic  French New Wave drama Vivre sa Vie, starring Anna Karina and the sublime  film noir Crime Wave, starring Sterling Hayden and Charles Bronson, directed by Andre De Toth. This was referenced by the great Stanley Kubrick in his film The Killing. I know all of this useless information because it comes up in blue every time I scroll through my TV planner to see what I’ve taped – before scrolling back to watch Ballers starring Dwayne The Rock Johnson. To my knowledge, Ballers hasn’t been referenced in any classic film noirs but it’s early days.Such is my TV planner anxiety, I’m thinking of putting a note in a will telling my we to delete the  episodes of the Rockford Files that I’ve taped in the event of my passing.The last thing I’d want is for a grieving widow to run out of TV planner space.Don’t get me wrong – I totally understand the benefits of being able to pause the telly while you nip to the loo or make a cup of tea.But there’s definitely a formula to these types of shows, an alchemy that draws us in and keeps us coming back series after series. I know it involves the unexpected death of a main character having learnt that from The Sopranos and The Wire but the rest is as yet a mystery.At this point, I have to ask, does anyone go the pictures anymore Could it be that we’re going through one of those dark periods for cinema, much like  years ago when television was king and movies took a backseat as picture houses started to close  If so, this is a shame.I cherish the memory of Friday,  October,  – the date Goodfellas had its UK cinema release. I remember that day like it was yesterday. I took a half day from my job as a Visual Display Unitoperator with Standard Le to head up to the Dominion  on my own to watch the Scorsese classic. I bought my box – it has to be a box of fruit gums – and sat through two hours  minutes of sheer unadulterated psychopathic joy. Just me and one other person in that tiny art deco theatre, watching Joe Pesci ask menacingly: “I’m funny how, I mean funny like a clown ” At the last count I’ve watched it  times ... it was on TCM again last week – and I’ve now added it to my TV planner.Oh, and just in case, Netflix Anxiety Disorder is not a real illness.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4830696.1542317589!/image/image.jpg","title":"brexit michael gove decides not to resign in boost for theresa may","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Michael Gove will not resign from the cabinet, sources close to the Environment Secretary have said.There had been speculation overnight that Mr Gove would quit on Friday morning, after it was reported that he had refused an offer to become Brexit Secretary.He left a meeting at Downing Street on Thursday night without making comment.

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests. Hopefully he can make an eye-catching debut to match his name.: : : : : : : :Family, friends, work colleagues and a good number of former footballers gathered on Friday to say farewell to Alastair Johnston from Cunningsburgh.When I first met him in the early s he was still an excellent player. He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

SIC has a poor record of flag flying in my opinion from the senior flagstaff. It#s the UK government#sand Scottish Parliaments policy to encourage councils to fly the Union Flagon a regular daily basis. It#s very rare to see a flag flying any time except on the Lord Lieutenants flag flying days list ofwhich is out of date.It is troubling to hear where the British media still blame German militarism and nationalism for WW, asnationalism and militarism were ever missing from the British national outlook. All major European powers fought to gain advantage over neighbours.It is refreshing though to hear the French President tell world leaders, including Putin and Trump, that nationalism is a #betrayal of patriotism#.#By saying #our interests first and never mind the others#, you stamp out the most precious thing a nation has # its moral values,# he said, thereby insisting these sometimes exist.The European Union used to be widely regarded as a moral endeavour. It seems most of our neighbours still see it that way, as something worthwhile which tempers selfish instincts and secures peace.If Brexit goes ahead the prospect of Britain forgetting its responsibilities as a victor, as Churchill put it in, #for the immediate future of the world# looms large. Let us hope some lessons can be recalled.#Patriotism is when the love of your own people comes first nationalism, when hate for people other than your own comes first.# # Charles de GaulleSadly we see Donald Trump, #America First!, Let#s make America great again#.

Remember #The Only Thing Necessary for the Triumph of Evil is that Good Men Do Nothing#,It is a sad reflection of the many, many people which has died due to war and conflict.There is one institute which promotes, encourages and sanctions war and conflict more so than any other establishment within a modern society.We have probably killed and maimed more people in the last  years than at any other time in  years. What has brought this to the fore is technology but also the institutes which have remained silent on such atrocities, this being the backbone of modern societies driven by economics, our banking systems.Never has there been so much money spent on war and conflict, never have so many countries been destroyed by war and conflict, and who stands by the sideline reaping in massive profits as a result, our banks.The Bible says # For the Love of Money is the Root to All Evils # never a truer word said with our modern banking systems.Rather sad that at a time when we remember those that saw the horror of so many European conflicts, we also saw the French and German leaders announce they want to create a #real# EU Army. I presume by #real# they mean, #the ability to kill people#. Not only was it tactless of Merkel and Macron, we surely have enough standing armed forces already in the world. Do we really need another Jane , I feel sure that Merkel and Macron were not thinking along the same lines as yourself .They stated the need for a ‘ real army’without any references to the huge revenues that could be gained from the manufacture of arms.It’s all very well trying to pass their claim off as being for the strength and safety of Europe but with no reference whatsoever to the economic   financial benefits which would bolster the banking strengths of Germany and France.

A lot of visitor experiences are going to be marred.\"Adam Gough, CairnGorm Mountain representative, who had told of the need for the slopes aimed at beginners and intermediates, was clearly stunned by the rejection.Asked immediately after the decisionan appeal was likely, he said that a statement would be issued later.CNPA head planner Gavin Miles had stressed from the outset the application had to be determined on planning issues ndash landscaping impacts in particular ndash and not on its commercial merits, which had generated much argument.He said the business case was a matter for Natural Retreats.Mr Miles told the committee the articial slope would not extend the ski area in any signicant way but the footprint of obvious development would increase.He commented: \"Initially the team were very concerned about the landscaping but as more information was given to us by the applicants it was considered that in the long term planting would mitigate against that. There would be an impact in the short term of the dry ski slope.\"Whether it will ever be an attraction in its own right and generate signicant income, who knows, but that is not a consideration of the planning process.\"In effect it is a ersication of business in this area and therefore acceptable andit was to strengthen the stability of CairnGorm Mountain then thats a good thing.\"He said there were some hefty planning conditions attached to control the development.CairnGorm Mountains representative said some  per cent of total visits to the resort were in just three winter months of the year.Mr Gough had told the committee Natural Retreats had explored several options in depth to remove the reliance on winter income including mountain biking and zip-wiring but this plan was the most viable at this time.He said it was imperative the attraction can provide year-round employment in order to retain its best staff. This site was the most sheltered for the ski slope and close to other facilities without impacting on other slopes, he said. It could also be used for tubing and other activities.Mr Gough acknowledged the clamour for better ski uplt at CairnGorm which has been overtaken as Scotlands most popular ski resort.He said: \"We would like nothing more than to be able to upgrade ski infrastructure to improve the snowsports experience for everyone but this has to be a long term process built on solid commercial foundations.\"He said the slope could be in operation for  per cent of the year outwith winter and ice would not be a problem as it was easy practice to break it up.ABA secretary Alan Brattey said history showed articial slopes at Scottish resorts including the Lecht, Glenshee and Glencoe had not worked.He also said a bright green Snowflex slope would stand out like a sore thumb and no consideration had been given by the operator to an alternative by market leader, Neveplast, which could be camouflaged.He said that of just over  votes on Facebook on the application,  per cent were against it.Tessa Jones, of the Badenoch and Strathspey Conservation Group, asked the committee: \"What are you going to say to the world about this peatland destruction \"Committee member Dave Fallows moved the application be refused and he was seconded by Carolyn Caddick.He said he appreciated the efforts to mitigate against the ski slope but said: \"It cant possibly soften in the long term the impact that this makes on the area.\"Mrs Caddick said: \"We are going to see it for miles and miles around.\"Peter Argyle had moved in favour of the application saying he had faith in the planning officers conditions but was not supported.Mr Brattey said after the vote: \"This was very much the right decision and wed like to congratulate the planning committee for deciding to reject this planning application against the advice of their planning officials.\"We very much hope that common sense will now prevail and that the plans for the Ptarmigan Building will be dropped.\"We are left to wonder just exactly why HIE allowed their tenant to take such a madcap plan all the way to the CNPAs planning committee who were very decisive in their rejection of it.\"He said HIE should ert the pound million to new uplt. \"The hill business requires to be funicular proofed as soon as possible,\" said Mr Brattey.Friday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118338.jpg","title":"Helping mountain to reach its peak","story":"Gavin MusgroveA pound MILLION vision to revive CairnGorm Mountain has been laid out to release the resorts immense unlocked potential over the next five to  years.US-based consultancy SE Group believes the resort can attract in the region of , winter visitors per year ndash more in seasons when there are peak snow conditions ndash with the right targeted investments.But controversially they appear to have written-off any future for Coire na Ciste which accounts for one-third of the ski area and boasts the best terrain for skiers and boarders at intermediate level and beyond.Instead the report proposes that all the focus for snowsports is on Coire Cas and two state-of-the art six person chairlts should be installed.There is also a role for the funicular which is currently not running at the resort because of safety fears.However, it is seen as having a subsidiary role as snowsports uplt and to be used and maintained more for non-skiers and ski school customers.Vermont-based SE Group carried out its independent review of uplt infrastructure at the resort between February and September, earlier this year.No funding has been allocated. Highlands and Islands Enterprise who commissioned the report have described the findings as a starting point.But it appears that there would have to be very persuasive arguments to now veer from this set course.HIEs head of business development Susan Smith told the Strathy: \"This is the start of a long journey but at the centre of this needs to be the buy-in from stakeholders and the local community.\"Naturally an element of funding has to come from the public purse.\"There are large infrastructure funds for which this project may be eligible.\"Intriguingly she continued: \"Without setting hares racing it is prudent that we look at what alternative funding mechanisms might be available.\"I would put the option forward there may be a number of philanthropic investors out there who are passionate about Cairngorm who may with a sensible model and plan consider some form of philanthropic investment.\"Ms Smith would only add when pressed: \"We have a very loose expression of interest which suggest to us there may be the opportunity to do a bit more work to tease out whether this is an alternative strategy but there is absolutely no guarantee.\"On Coire na Ciste, she said the consultants found there was no business case to develop the area as campaigners and many ski visitors would like to see.The HIE boss said: \"They have come back quite unequivocally saying that it would not stack.\"They have looked at the two sites and said it is unsustainable as a second site until there is a capacity of  peopleor more using CairnGorm Mountain because facilities would have to be doubled up.\"This is the view of the experts and they have consulted widely and I have to take confidence in that... to deviate from these findings there would have to be a signicant rationale to do so.\"Ms Smith said the two new chairlts would replace some of the surface lts but was unable to say which ones.She said that their partners Highland Council, Cairngorms National Park Authority, Scottish Natural Heritage and Forestry Enterprise Scotland were enthused and excited by the vision.She said: \"They believe that for the first time in many years this is a sensible approach for the way forward.\"She also said HIE wants to be much more inclusive working with the right community representatives.Ms Smith explained: \"It can not be a free for all. It has to be through proper and proportionate channels that we bring this forward.\"She said Natural Retreats is the operator and part of the journey and had bought into it.

in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe Armadale to Mallaig crossing is among the most popular ferry routes in Scotland according to new figures obtained by Kate Forbes MSP.According to  statistics, Ardrossan to Brodick had the highest number of passengers with ,, followed by Largs to Millport , Wemyss Bay to Rothesay , Oban to Craignureand Mallaig to Armadale .Skye, Lochaber and, Badenoch MSP, Kate Forbes said she was surprised that Mallaig to Armadale crossing proved more popular than Ullapool to Stornoway .The statistics also showed that the Skye to Mallaig route was the most popular crossing for coaches across Scotland.Kate Forbes MSP said: “Since RET was introduced by the SNP Government, it’s great to see the rise in passengers.“RET is vitally important to the islands and has arguably done more than anything  to level the playing field for island communities who need to travel.“Mallaig to Armadale figures were up by  per cent compared to the fateful summer of . Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another.

As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service.

This motion was agreed. earlier this week, the chair of the EDI committee, Councillor Allan Henderson said that the council was putting pressure on the Scottish Government to have the route classed as a trunk road. However, during Thursday’s meeting Councillor Cockburn was quick to dismiss the likelihood of this happening: “Who in their right mind would take  miles of the worst road in the Highlands” He said. “After six and a half years we still only have two options… and the delays and the consequences for the wider community have been absolutely shocking.”The SNP member for Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh also went on to question the tendering process behind the work at the bypass, saying: “Was it necessary to shut the road during the day  I believe there was a tender on the table that would have allowed the road to open during the day.”He went on to argue that the council needed to release money straight away to enable design work on the replacement options for the current bypass to begin, adding that it was a matter of urgency due to the risks identied in the  annual sloping report which detailed four very high-risk rock slopes at the Stromeferry bypass.In response to Councillor Cockburn, the council’s head of infrastructure Colin Howell said that the council did receive an alternative tender from a contractor who said they could carry out the required works at night, however, Mr Howell said the cost was signicant and due to concerns about these plans it was decided it would be wise for some of the work to be undertaken during the day.Mr Howell said that while there were ongoing issues with rockfalls and managing slopes, he believed that the council had done a good job. He went on to add that the council were prioritising the high-risk slopes and currently working on the cost and details in relation to stabilising those areas which would be delivered at the next EDI committee meeting. He added that there were “three optimum solutions” in respect to replacement options and said that the committee had “decided to leave those three on the table# and seek dialogue with Scottish Government for funding. He said: “The administration is looking for feedback, we are working on slopes with high risks and will come back to the next EDI with the costing.”Councillor Derek MacLeod described the current situation as “one episode in a long, long history of problems with the route#, and in contrast to his fellow ward member, Councillor Cockburn, he argued that the route should be “trunked between Auchtertyre and Garve” as he believed it to be strategic in linking the ferry points of Uig and UllapoolCouncil Leader Margaret Davidson told the committee that she would be meeting with the Transport Secretary Michael Matheson and would report back “what options have been put on the table.” Councillor Davidson said that the council were “acutely aware of what’s needed” and were working towards a long-term sustainable option for Stromeferry.

For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27484  ","story":"• RUC unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons Mícheál Mac DonnchaCivil Rights campaigners in Derry had been pressing for a march in their city which had long been a byword for unionist sectarianism and discrimination.Using gerrymandered electoral boundaries and a corrupt voting system which allowed wealthier citizens to have multiple votes in local elections, the unionists maintained a majority of members on the council in a city with a nationalist majority.Nationalists lived in very poor housing conditions and were affected disproportionately by the % unemployment rate in the city.Unionists had long regarded the old walled town as a citadel that could never be surrendered and their dominance was symbolised by the walls towering over the crumbling th century terraced streets of the nationalist Bogside. The last time nationalists had attempted to hold a parade inside the walls was on St Patrick’s Day  – when they were batoned by the RUC.Housing was a massive issue in Derry and the Derry Housing Action Committeeprovided the focus for leadership as the Civil Rights campaign took off. The DHAC had organised a James Connolly commemoration in the city in July  which was banned by the unionist government.The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Associationagreed to hold a march in Derry on  October. The loyalist Apprentice Boys organisation immediately announced a counter-demonstration with the purpose of forcing the unionist government’s hand to ban the Civil Rights march. But the regime at Stormont did not require forcing because the Home Affairs Minister was ultra-unionist William Craig, who promptly imposed the ban.NICRA held an emergency meeting with the DHAC. Many on the NICRA Executive and some Derry nationalist figures, including John Hume, wanted to cancel the march, but the majority of Derry activists were determined to defy the ban. They won out and the march was to proceed as planned.It was a relatively small march, beginning on Craigavon Bridge with several hundred people. The objective was the Diamond in the city centre.The march was stopped in Duke Street by the RUC. A meeting was held with speakers including Gerry Fitt, Betty Sinclair, Eddie McAteer, Ivan Cooper, Austin Currie and Eamonn McCann. Three Westminster Labour MPs were also present.After the meeting, the marchers found themselves hemmed in on all sides by the RUC. They could not disperse and after a tense stand-off the RUC, oblivious to the presence of TV cameras and photographers, unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons, boots and fists. Water cannons were then used.Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, then a young People’s Democracy activist, recalled:“Quite deliberately, they hosed in the upstairs windows and shopfronts, and they went right across Craigavon Bridge, hosing all the onlookers. The police just went mad.”The RUC attack in Duke Street brought the Civil Rights struggle in Ireland to a world audience for the first time. It was a complete eye-opener to many people in the  Counties and in Britain. But most profound was its effect on young nationalists.Derry man Mickey Devine , the last of the ten Hunger Strikers to die in the H-Blocks of Long Kesh in , recalled:“Like every young person in Derry, my whole way of thinking was tossed upside down by the events of  October . I didn’t even know there was a Civil Rights march I saw it on television.“But that night I was down the town smashing shop windows and stoning the RUC. I developed an intense hatred of the RUC. As a child I had always known not to talk to them or to have anything to do with them, but this was dferent.The RUC attacked the Civil Rights march in Duke Street, Derry, on  October .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27485  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering and pain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contested narratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.- Declan KearneyThis week the NIO consultation on dealing with the legacy of thepast in the north of Ireland closed.It will inform a legislative process and bringforward future legacy legislation.Failure to deal with the past remains one of the most signicantimpediments to political progress here.It is a barrier to the development of a comprehensivereconciliation and healing process in this society.British state policy has been the primary factor in preventinglegacy issues from being addressed or resolved.Powerful sections of the British military and intelligence systemhave never embraced the peace process. They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past. There isno single narrative despite the attempts of the British state and politicalunionism to assert otherwise.The past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering andpain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future.

permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster.

Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism.

A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism.

Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27491  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe writer, newspaper editor and Irish republican Seumas O’Kelly was a native of Loughrea, County Galway. Author of short stories, plays, poems and a novel, The Weaver’s Grave which was his masterpiece, O’Kelly’s le was cut short because of his commitment to Irish freedom. The O’Kelly family of Loughrea were flour millers and merchants and Seumas received a good education. He was a fellow student of James Joyce in University College Dublin. There is a remarkable photograph of the BA degree class of  including Joyce, O’Kelly and George Clancy. Like O’Kelly, George Clancy, a close friend of Joyce, was to die a tragic death. He was Sinn Féin Mayor of Limerick when on  March  he was murdered in his home by the Black and Tans, on the same night as former Mayor Michael O’Callaghan. Seumas O’Kelly was a committed republican from an early age. He is recorded as one of those to the fore in the centenary commemorations of the  Rising in . He was writing for Arthur Grfith’s Irish Republican Brotherhood-funded newspaper The United Irishman from  and for its successor Sinn Féin from . While a full list of attendees is not available it is probable that he was at the founding meeting of Sinn Féin in November . In  O’Kelly was appointed editor of the Leinster Leader in Naas, County Kildare. He founded a branch of Conradh na Gaeilge in the town and was active in Sinn Féin locally. He welcomed republicans to his home during the annual Wolfe Tone commemorations in nearby Bodenstown. O’Kelly’s first book of stories was published in  and his first play was produced the following year. Several of his plays were produced at the Abbey Theatre. Constantly busy with literary and journalistic work, O’Kelly was subject to poor health. He joined Óglaigh na hÉireann when they were founded in  but was unable to play an active military role. His brother was a Volunteer and was jailed in England after the  Rising. The paper Nationality, edited by Grfith, was established in  and O’Kelly was one of its writers. It was the main organ of Sinn Féin during the  and  by-elections. In May  Grfith was arrested and jailed in England and O’Kelly took over as editor of Nationality. Following the  November  Armistice which ended the First World War, British soldiers and loyalists ran riot through the streets of Dublin, attacking suspected Sinn Féin supporters. On the night of  November a crowd of drunken soldiers invaded the Sinn Féin Ard Oig at  Harcourt Street . Seumas O’Kelly was at his desk in the Nationality office and tried to defend himself with his walking stick. The office was wrecked and O’Kelly collapsed. He was brought to Jervis Street Hospital where he died of a brain haemorrhage. Seumas O’Kelly was honoured with a republican funeral to Glasnevin Cemetery, attended by huge crowds. He died on  November ,  years ago this week.  test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27492  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaAt the start of the th century women began to campaign actively against the denial of their right to vote. In  the Women’s Social and Political Union was founded in England and the militant feminists commenced the battle for the vote. In Ireland there had been groups working for women’s suffrage but the campaign really began here on the instigation of Hanna Sheehy Skeffington and Margaret Cousins. Margaret Cousins came from a unionist family in Dublin but she later wrote: “I belonged in my heart from the beginning to the fighters for freedom.” Her husband James Cousins also rejected the unionism of his background and became involved in the Gaelic revival. Margaret came into contact with the women’s movement in England in . On herto Ireland she co-operated with a remarkable young woman who was to make her mark on Irish history. Hanna Sheehy was the daughter of a Fenian, David Sheehy, who took part in the  Rising and was elected as a Parnellite MP in . Hanna was an exceptional student and excelled academically despite the restrictions on women’s access to education she achieved a first class honours MA in . She became a teacher and married Francis Skeffington. In line with their shared feminist principles they adopted each other’s surnames. Francis resigned his post as registrar of University College because the authorities refused to register women on the same basis as men. In  Hanna and Margaret founded the Irish Women’s Franchise League , with the active support of both Francis Sheehy Skeffington and James Cousins. From the beginning they stressed that the IWFL would address the specic needs of Irish women in “a subject country seeking freedom from England” and would “work on independent Irish lines”. Margaret Cousins described the IWFL’s position: “Its policy was to educate by all forms of propaganda the men, women and children of Ireland to understand and support the members of the League in their demand for votes for women, and to obtain pledges from every Irish Member of Parliament to vote for Women’s Suffrage Bills introduced in the British Houses of Parliament, and to include Women’s Suffrage in any Irish Home Rule Bill.” The IWFL campaigned throughout the country and made an impact beyond their numbers of about  activists. Not all militant women agreed with the IWFL’s tactics the republican group Inghinidhe na hÉireann refused to join in lobbying the British parliament, preferring to “organise a women’s movement on Sinn Féin lines, or on lines even broader still”. Despite this dference, republican women such as Constance Markievicz played an active role in the IWFL’s work and Hanna Sheehy Skeffington herself was strongly republican. Markievicz urged young Irishwomen to prepare to fight: “Arm yourselves with weapons to fight your nation’s cause. Arm your souls with noble and free ideas. Arm your minds with the histories and memories of your country and her martyrs, her language, and a knowledge of her arts and industries. Andin your day the call should come for your body to arm, do not shirk from that either.” Markievicz said Irishwomen were “doubly enslaved with a double battle to fight”. Following the  general election the Irish Party at Westminster was in a position to press the Liberal government to publish a Home Rule Bill. But Redmond and his party still refused to support women’s right to vote. The IWFL became more militant and Hanna and Francis founded the Irish Citizen newspaper to further the cause of women’s rights as well as Irish independence, social justice and pacism. When British politicians visited Ireland they were challenged by the IWFL. Margaret ‘Meg’ Connery confronted British Tory leader Andrew Bonar Law and Unionist leader Edward Carson when they came to Dublin. In Belfast Hanna Sheehy Skeffington challenged Winston Churchill. Margaret Cousins joined protests in England in  and was jailed for a month. In June  eight women from the IWFL smashed windows in Dublin Castle and other prominent buildings. Hanna was arrested at the Castle and she and the seven others were imprisoned in Mountjoy. The following month British Prime Minister Asquith visited Dublin and there were more protests. Three English feminists had followed Asquith to Ireland and they were also jailed for their protests. After a hunger strike in Mountjoy by the English suffragists and the IWFL women, all were released except two of the Englishwomen who were subjected to forced feeding. Many meetings of the IWFL were physically attacked at this time by Redmondites who saw the campaign for women’s suffrage as a threat to their political dominance and their relationship with the British Liberal government. In contrast, republicans such as Pádraig Mac Piarais and Thomas MacDonagh were supporters of the IWFL. The IWFL also won the support of prominent trade unionists James Larkin and James Connolly. They were closely allied with the Irish Women Workers Union in Liberty Hall and in  Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed after a confrontation with the Dublin politan Police during the Great Lockout. She was released after a six-day hunger strike. That year also saw the death in England of feminist Emily Davison who ran on to the course at the Epsom Derby and was trampled by a race horse. Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed again in  for campaigning against recruitment to the British Army. Her influence and that of the IWFL was seen in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic of  which enshrined women’s right to vote. Her friend James Connolly told her: “You will be glad to know that in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic we are including equal citizenship for women.” Hanna replied that she knew who was responsible, meaning Connolly himself. “We were practically unanimous, Only one questioned it,” replied Connolly. Francis Sheehy Skeffington was murdered in Portobello Barracks by a British Army officer during the Easter Rising. Hanna embarked on a tour of the United States to expose the truth about the murder and other British atrocities. She continued to play a leading role in the struggle for Irish freedom, as did many of the pioneering feminists of the IWFL. In  the IWFL saw its central aim achieved when women voted for the first time in the general election which resulted in a massive Sinn Féin victory, although women under  were still excluded. The IWFL actively opposed British rule and supported Dáil Éireann. For example in August  Hanna was badly beaten by the RIC who attacked a Sinn Féin meeting at which she spoke in Kilbeggan, Co. Westmeath. IWFL women went on to champion women’s rights in the decades following the Treaty when they faced the very dferent challenges of a partitioned Ireland with conservative anti-women governments North and South. The Irish Women’s Franchise League was founded  years ago on  November .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27493  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonA wreckers’ agenda is being driven by the DUP and Tory government.

They must not be allowed to destroy the democratic option formaking change in the north.It is these circumstances which bring sharply into focus theIrish governments responsibilities.Those who courageously signed this letter to the Irish government are saying the negative position of the DUP and British governmentmust not be tolerated.These are citizens who want the political institutionsre-established but only on the basis of democracy and equality.They are assertive in their resolve to see a rights basedsociety created, which guarantees rights, respect, and parity of esteem, in ashared, inclusive future.But they are not prepared to be treated as second-classcitizens in this part of Ireland.Those days are over.It is time for the Irish Government to indeed redouble itsefforts to step up to the mark by absolutely opposing the imposition ofBrexit, and guaranteeing equality and rights for all citizens in the north.An Taoiseach and the Irish Government needs to reflect verycarefully about the signicance and timing of this intervention, respondpositively and act decisively, in cooperation with the politicalrepresentatives of Irish citizens, and others in the north, to ensure thattheir democratic rights are delivered upon.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27494  ","story":"• th NOVEMBER  - Newly elected Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams Mícheál Mac DonnchaTHE Ard Fheis of  marked a signicant stage in the political development of Sinn Féin. The historic gathering came in the wake of the campaign in support of the H-Block and Armagh prisoners, the epic Hunger Strikes, the intervention of prisoner candidates, North and South, in  and Sinn Féin’s electoral rise in the Six Counties in  and .The party’s performance in the October  Assembly elections – when five republicans were elected to the body set up by British direct ruler Jim Prior – caused alarm to the SDLP and their supporters in the Establishment parties in the  Counties. Sinn Féin’s lead in boycotting the Assembly was followed by the SDLP for fear of losing further support to republicans. The Fine Gael Labour Government, led by Garret FitzGerald, set up the New Ireland Forum in Dublin mainly as a  for the SDLP. In June , the political establishment in Ireland and Britain was rocked by the election of Sinn Féin Vice-President Gerry Adams as MP for his native west Belfast. For long a leading republican activist, Adams advocated the deeper politicisation and popularisation of the republican struggle and the building of Sinn Féin across the  Counties.The British Tory government of Margaret Thatcher was also concerned at the rise of Sinn Féin. In the week before the Ard Fheis in November , Prior told Tory MPs that Ireland could become a “Cuba off Britain’s west coast”. He said he feared Sinn Féin could overtake the SDLP electorally and “we must do all we can to strengthen constitutional nationalism”. When the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis gathered in the Mansion House in Dublin on  and  November, it was set to elect a new leadership. Ruairí Ó Brádaigh had been president since  and he announced that he would not be seeking re-election. He said the four-province federal Ireland plan, of which he had been a strong advocate, had been rejected at the  Ard Fheis and his approach on other issues, including electoral strategy, had been rejected by the Ard Chomhairle.In his address, the new party president, Gerry Adams, dismissed media claims of a ‘Northern takeover’ and said:“We are not a Northern, nor a Southern party – we are an Irish republican party organised throughout Ireland.”The main theme of his speech was the need for republicans to break out of political isolation and “get among the people in the basic ways which the people accept”. In line with this approach, the Ard Fheis voted to contest European Parliament elections with the intention of taking seatsthey were won. This followed the expansion of party electoral strategy the previous year. The Ard Fheis coincided with a by-election campaign for the Dáil seat of Dublin Central, which was contested by Sinn Féin candidate Christy Burke, turning in a creditable performance. There was further controversy after the Ard Fheis, and discomfort for Fianna Fáil leaders in particular, when Gerry Adams was confirmed as the main speaker at the annual Kilmichael commemoration in west Cork. Gerry Adams was elected president of Sinn Féin at the Ard Fheis of November ,  years ago.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27495  ","story":" Robbie SmythOver the last  years Irishsociety has evolved and transformed in many ways.

It is not a reflection of politics or religion and it is not red to reflect the colour of blood.The full motion read: That this Council was disappointed to learn of the decision by Cambridge Universitys Student Union to vote down a motion to promote Remembrance Sunday and therefore records its objection to this decision to ignore such a signicant event in our history.Cllr Henry continued, saying: If this is the way our young people have been taught, what hope do we have We as a nation look to our students in the hope that one day they will be our leaders in many walks of le.He also said: When the young people of Cambridge University voted overwhelmingly to de-emphasise the sacrice of the armed forces, thereby striking out any reference to the British war veterans, remembrance day and the poppy they brought untold hurt and suffering to many families who lost loved ones during the wars.What a despicable way to show gratitude to many hundreds of thousands who gave their all so as those students and indeed everyone of us can enjoy the freedom of democracy that we have today.Our freedoms cost many everything they had.It is easy to judge from a distance when you have the luxury of a safe and comfortable democracy.Cllr Henry requested that the council write to Cambridge University to: express their disgust and revulsion at the decision made by the Students Union. Speaking to second the motion, DUP Councillor Paul Reid said: The poppy is an emblem of remembrance used since .The poppy is not a political symbol, it is not a religions symbol but a reminder of those who fought for freedom.TUV Councillor Brian Collins thanked Cllrs Henry and Reid for bringing this matter to the attention of Mid and East Antrim Council.He said: This is a very emotive subject.To Cambridge Universitys Student Union, shame on you. Many a young man and women left the university and interrupted their studies to go a serve their nation, and many of them never ed to their studies.We have to remember the families. This is just disgraceful.The TUV fully support this important motion.UUP Councillor AP Wilson also supported the motion.He said: We share the disappointment with Cambridge Universitys student union.Cllr Wilson, however said he didnt think Council should get involved in: undergraduate student union politics, saying that: Sometimes there are lots of brains and not necessarily much common sense.He said that Council should do all they can to make sure remembrance was respectful and not party political.Alliance Councillor Paul Sinclair was also concerned about getting involved in student politics.He said: We should reaffirm our support for Remembrance Sunday.After a recorded vote, Sinn Fein Councillors Hardy and McKeown voted against the motion while Councillor Paul Maguire, Alliance Councillor Paul Sinclair and SDLP Councillor Declan OLoan abstained from voting. Every other resent councillor voted for the motion, therefore it was carried.Speaking afterwards, DUP Councillor Beth Clyde said: I think it is a disgrace that people wont support the memory of all that have fallen.

Boyle, Chief Executive of Ballymena Business Centre. The project is part funded by Invest Northern Ireland and the European Regional Development Fund under the Investment for Growth  Jobs Northern IrelandProgramme.I used to be a childminder and had two young children and didnrsquot think it was possible for me to get into the beauty business - but then I went back to college and studied beauty at the Roberta Mechan College, she said.I have a real interest in health and well-being and wanted to offer these services to others. I opened in April this year and I currently offer specialist skincare, nails, massage and waxing.Helen turned her dream into a reality after taking part in the Go For It Programme which is delivered free of charge by a team of experienced business mentors through Northern Irelandrsquos wide network of enterprise agencies.It provides expert advice and help with developing a robust business plan to help turn ideas into a commercial enterprise.Commenting on the success of the programme, Helen said: Often it is hard to know where to start that was my experience before starting the Go For It Programme. The support and guidance offered through it helped me fine tune my business idea from concept to working reality.They helped me with practical things in the early stages like setting out a business plan and doing a detailed analysis. It was great for helping me to budget and forward plan.ldquoI would urge anyone who has ever had the idea of starting up their own business, or evenyou have just started operating your own business to apply for a place on the Go For It Programme. The skills and knowledge imparted is beyond the realms of what you could achieve on your own.Melanie Christie Boyle, Chief Executive of Ballymena Business Centre, on behalf of Mid and East Antrim and Borough Council, added: ldquoHelen joined the Go For It Programme driven by a desire to launch her very own beauty business, driven by a passion to help women improve their skin and help them feel good about themselves.Helen undertook an intensive beauty course under tutelage of an industry expert with a clear vision and motivation to open her own salon as soon as she completed her examinations.We worked with Helen to develop a business plan, focusing on key areas such as defining her service provision, marketing and financial forecasting, as well as helping her secure commercial premises at Ballee and Harryville Community Enterprise Centre.It is great to see how Helen has progressed her business in such as short space of time, building a loyal customer base and a excellent reputation for her quality customer service and using only the very best range of products.If you have a business idea yoursquod like to develop oryou are thinking about starting a business call    or visit: visit www.goforitni.

With a limited number of tickets still available, ‘Em Two Balloons duo Gerard Jordan and Ciarán Nolan told Daily Belfast how audiences can expect all their favourite characters from previous stage outings with a wedding bringing together the West and North of the city for its fairytale finale.“This is the fourth year we have brought ‘Em Two Balloons and their Christmas show to the Roddy’s,” explained Ciarán, “we had great success last year with the Terrible Tragedy of the Twinbrook Turkey and we are back again to tell all about the Fairytale of New Lodge. We had Deck the Falls back in , Turkey last year and now this feels like the completion of part of a trilogy.”“The demand for the shows is growing each year,” said Gerard, “audiences have really taken the characters Ciarán and I play and given us such great support. At the start of November we learned that there are only  per cent of the tickets left at the Mac and people are coming in every day to get their tickets early for the Roddy’s. If there were more days in December we would put on more shows as the demand is there.”“Audiences can expect pretty much what they have experienced before, especially in terms of laughter,” said Ciarán. “There are wedding bells in the air in the production, North Belfast is meeting West Belfast and the introduction of the Glider is bringing our characters East. I mean, what’s the most exotic thing for a Westie  It’s’ getting on the Glider and heading East, seeing Stormont in real le,” he laughed. “The characters Gerard and I have created Jean and Joan, Tablets and Muttley and our two doormen Feargal and Maxi are all there as well. Countess and Winalot, the two dogs, are woofing all the way towards Christmas too. Our bride is played by me and called Mini Driver who is from the Oldpark, Feargal is our groom and the all important wedding prep forms part of the story too.”Gerard spoke of how the hard work has been going on behind the scenes since .“It’s been great how much the audiences have backed us. The real compliment is that the audiences keep growing and this year we’ve added matinees into the Mac, we want to branch out to new audiences each year and will be taking the show to Naomh Éanna on December  as well.”Ciarán said that due to overwhelming demand a handful of dates will be performed after Christmas at Fruithill Bowling Club, Gort Na Mona and St Paul’s GAC on the ,  and  of December. “We will be working on new material for  and ‘Em Two Balloons will be bringing out a new production.

An opinion poll showed more than % distrust of Mrs May, a figure which spanned Protestants and Catholics, unionists and nationalists.Still, just as an earlier unionist leader, James Molyneaux, found to his cost with another Tory leader, Margaret Thatcher, in November , perfidious Albion works in deviously unpredictable ways.Ulster Says No was the unionist mantra then, but the question now is to what extent Ulster will say No in . The answer to that among unionists is far from as clear-cut as it was in .In the House of Commons yesterday, the DUPs Nigel Dodds delivered a menacing glare across the chamber in the Prime Ministers direction. He could point to the claims of her resigning ministers that the Brexit deal undermined the Union. He could warn her directly: \"The choice is now clear: stand up for the United Kingdom, or vote for a vassal state and the break-up of the Union.\"But beyond the bitter words of betrayal, where does that leave the DUP and the general unionist public back home  Whether the constitutional future is at stake, as unionist leaders and anti-deal Conservatives are claiming, there is no stomach for the level of protest which accompanied the Ulster Says No campaign three decades ago.Nor do the arguments for and against the current deal ide on simple constitutional lines, as evident from the Brexit referendum in , which showed % in favour of staying in the European Union. For the first time in the history of Northern Ireland, the leadership of unionism cannot claim to represent majority opinion on such a fundamental issue as the Brexit deal.It may be that the % Yes vote for staying in the EU is actually enhanced now by people who are relieved there will be noto a hard border, or who are actually pleased that, in future, Northern Ireland business and agriculture will have unique access to the UK and European markets.Certainly, on the evidence of statements and reports from the commercial community, the DUPs wrath at Westminster is not reflected in the broader mood of people, some of whom see new opportunity in Mrs Mays deal and are also influenced by envy expressed by the Scottish Nationalist leader, Nicola Sturgeon, who thinks Northern Ireland will have an unfair advantage.All of this may be immaterial, of course,Theresa May cannot survive the Conservative rebellion,her Government falls,a general election, or a new referendum, is called, orno deal can be brokered with Brussels. The imponderables are everywhere and no one has a clue how it will all end, not least the people of Northern Ireland.Our future is centre stage in the battle for power and influence, but we find ourselves watching the last act at Westminster from the wings. What we do know is that for all its pro-Brexit bluster, the DUP did not have the influence in London, or in Brussels, that its supporters may have believed it had.Just like James Molyneaux in  and Brian Faulkner in , Arlene Foster has been wrong-footed and misled into a  sense of political comfort by a Conservative Prime Minister. It is not asMrs Foster was not warned of this possibility, or that it could not have been foreseen.Meanwhile, in Dublin, there is subdued delight that virtually everything Leo Varadkar asked of Brussels and of this Brexit deal has been granted. For all the unionist criticism of Mr Varadkar, he has won a signicant victory in the Brexit negotiations and can even condescendingly ask the Dail to show understanding of the unionists dficulties.The Irish government has a huge advantage in Brussels and undoubtedly brought all its diplomatic pressure to bear on the negotiations. In contrast, hampered by no Assembly at Stormont and cut out of the UK negotiating team, the local politicians effectively sidelined themselves and the unionists, in particular, are now paying the price and trying to pick up the pieces belatedly.By aligning itself so trenchantly with the hardline Brexiteers at Westminster, it was always going to be dficult for the DUP to back a moderate deal to exit Europe, such as the one now on the table.Evennew regulatory checks had not been proposed for Northern Ireland, could the DUP have supported wholeheartedly Theresa Mays deal any more than Boris Johnson, or Jacob Rees-Mogg, or Nigel Farage  Hardly.Having shored up Mrs Mays premiership for so long, the DUP now finds itself in a Brexit no-mans land at Westminster: loved by the Brexiteers, unloved by Remainers, in danger of detachment from the mainstream of the Conservative Party and a long-standing critic of Jeremy Corbyn, a potential Prime Minister,Theresa May falls.How the DUP plays its cards in the coming days may determine not only the future of Mrs May and her Brexit deal, but also who remains a friend of unionism at Westminster and in Europe."},{"url":null,"title":"may says she wants all ministers to feel they can stay in their posts","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

My verdict. pic ZGaqzEedO— Keir StarmerNovember , He was speaking at the Sage Gateshead ahead of an address to the North East Economic Forum.Asked about the latest developments, Sir Keir said: “It’s very dficult to know what is going to happen next – yesterday in Parliament was an extraordinary day because for months we have been waiting for the Prime Minister to come back with her deal.“She did so and what we saw were Cabinet resignations and Tory MP after Tory MP standing up and saying they would not support her. “Obviously next week is all about whether the Prime Minister herself survives.“If she does survive, I think she will persist with her deal and I don’t think it’s going to get through Parliament – so we’re in for some very, very choppy times next week.” When asked whether this was the best possible deal she could have put forward, Sir Keir disagreed, saying: “I think the Prime Minister started in the wrong place and she has ended in the wrong place.“I think we should have said from the outset we want a close economic relationship that really will protect manufacturing and really will protect our service sector and that means a long-term customs union and a single market deal for the UK. “The Prime Minister says she is not prepared to negotiate that so she has come back with something that is, in my view, unacceptable.”He added: “I have never accepted the argument that we must accept whatever Theresa May has cobbled together or face the prospect of No Deal.”He believed Mrs May was effectively saying “I’ve got a deal, it’s not very good”, and he added: “She’s not even selling it as good now, she’s just saying ‘it’s better than leaving without one, I have brought back something pretty inadequate,you don’t like that, you get even worse’.”He said: “That is not a good enough choice and it’s not just Labour and the Opposition who is saying that, there are plenty of Conservative MPs who would not countenance us leaving without a deal and I thinkit’s necessary, we will work together to stop No Deal happening.” Asked how the EU will have viewed the last  hours of British politics, he replied: “I don’t think they can be very confident about what’s going on in the United Kingdom.“They don’t want No Deal, that’s absolutely clear, I’ve been over to Brussels to the EU  on very many occasions in the last in the last two years and everybody wants a deal, but I think seeing what happened yesterday would’ve caused them huge concerns about where all this is heading.”"},{"url":null,"title":"russian fisherman shares pics of nightmare creatures from the depths","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The #SIRedefinition is official! Watch representatives from measurement science institutions around the world celebrate! pic waisiAy— NISTNovember , It has been the world’s one true kilo, against which all others were measured, since .It is now being retired and replaced by a new definition based on a scientic formula.In their vote, countries also unanimously approved updates to three other key units: the kelvin for temperature, the ampere for electrical current and the mole for the amount of a substance.The vote was greeted by sustained applause and cheers after the -plus countries in attendance said yes, or “oui”, when asked one by one for their decision. Kilogramme for massKelvin for temperatureAmpere for electrical currentMole for the amount of a substance  Nobel prize winner William Phillips called it “the greatest revolution in measurement since the French revolution”, which ushered in the metric system of metres and kilogrammes.Scientists for whom the update represented decades of work clapped, cheered and even wept as the -plus nations approved the update. Some even sported tattoos on their forearms to mark the moment.The change will have no discernable impact for most people. Their bathroom scales will not get kinder and kilos and grammes will not change in supermarkets.But it will mean redundancy for the Grand K and its six official copies. The new formula-based definition of the kilogramme will have multiple advantages over the precision-crafted metal lump.Unlike a physical object, the formula cannot pick up particles of dust, decay with time or be dropped and damaged. It also is expected to be more accurate when measuring very small or very large masses.Even in retirement, the Grand K and its official copies — collectively known as “the heir and the spares” — will still be kept in the high-security vault where they are stored, because scientists want to keep studying them to see whether their masses gradually change over time.Only exceedingly rarely have they seen the light of day since , when they were taken out on a very few occasions to check whether other master kilogrammes around the world were still accurately calibrated, give or take the mass of a dust particle or two.The metal kilo is being replaced by a definition based on Planck’s constant, which is part of one of the most celebrated equations in physics but also devilishly dficult to explain.Suffice to say that the updated definition will, in time, spare nations the need to occasionally send their kilos back to France for calibration against the Grand K.

been given to Carryduff girl Cara Mailey.The nine-year-old has a form of dwarfism which means that living in a standard-sized world can present challenges for her.Born with achonlasia, Cara dared to dream big and applied last year to have a special den created for her by the team from the popular CBBC programme The Dengineers.The plucky and determined child is now the proud owner of a colourful sweet-themed garden den that is ideally sized to suit her height mdash and her sweet tooth.Despite the production team swamping the Mailey family home in June to carry out the work, the show was only broadcast on Sunday morning.Cara found herself a star attraction at St Josephrsquos Primary School, in Carryduff on Monday.ldquoA lot of people have been telling me I saw you in the newspaper, I saw you on TV, giggled Cara.She has made great use of her den since then.ldquoI play in it most of the time, I sometimes do my homework there and bring in my friends to play or go in just get some sweets and bring them into the house, she told the Recorder.ldquoHaving the den makes me feel a lot happier and safer as usually I would be climbing up stuff to reach things but now I can pick them up and donrsquot have to climb up to get them.Cararsquos infectious personality shone through in the programme as did her determinism to try out everything despite her stature.Her love of sweets are shown in the denrsquos decor which has Gummy Bear windows, a roof made of strawberry laces, a Coca-Cola-shaped door, a lolly-pop-themed dance floor so Cara can show off her moves and several sweet dispensers that are positioned at reaching height for her.One of the highlights is a height-adjustable desk that Cara can change to suit as she gets older.Cara lives with her mum Trish, a P teacher at Cedar Tree

It is also impacting on residents being able to park outside their homes, particularly in the Irish Street, Fountain Street and Saul Street areas.Cllr Sharvin believes the combined voices of the business community and residents can see the charges reduced to their previous level to ldquosupport the economical sustainability of Downpatrick town centre.He is also encouraging people to complete the online survey or pick up a paper copy from the council offices at the Downshire Civic Centre.Cllr Sharvin confirmed he has also asked council officials to survey the condition of its three car parks in Downpatrick, suggesting the surface in Irish Street is ldquoparticularly poor.Downpatrick councillor, Dermot Curran, has also expressed concern about the impact of the increased charges and believes the increasing concern is exactly the kind of issue a tradersrsquo group in the town should be addressing.He added: ldquoThe town needs a thriving business organisation to help with its continued economic regeneration and to discuss issues like increased parking charges.

worlds brexit","story":"The author of a report, \"Brexit at the Border\", has said that the ldquopressure is on our political parties especially those with the influence of the DUPa \"best of both worlds\" brexit is to become a reality.Dr Katy Hayward, who is a Reader of Sociology at Queens and who has  years research experience on the impact of the EU on the Irish border and peace process, was responding to an article penned by DUP leader Arlene Foster in last weekrsquos Impartial Reporter.In that article Mrs Foster laid out what the ldquobest of both worlds would be for Northern Ireland, which included full access to UK single market, full access to the EU single market, and full access to future UK and EU trade deals.Mrs Foster said that no-one has offered this ldquobest of both worlds to Northern Ireland but Dr Hayward claims that it is possible but onlythe ldquoUK remains closely aligned to the EUrsquos single market andit stays in a customs union with the EU.Dr Hayward does not see a smooth path to any such scenario however.ldquoBut, as Mrs Foster is well aware, the most vocalMPs in the Tory party want the UK to have a far more remote relationship with the EU after Brexit. If they succeed, this would automatically mean more barriers to trade with the EU, including across the Irish border, she stated.Dr Hayward agreed that the Mrs Fosterrsquos argument against any sort of backstop was ldquoperfectly reasonable as it is not ldquothe intended destination. But she still argues that it is of ldquocritical importance.. It is the issue over which the whole Withdrawal Agreement could collapse, leaving all of us in the mire of a lsquoNo Dealrsquo outcome.ldquoIt is therefore very important that all judgements of the backstop are based on a clear and accurate understanding of what it actually means, unclouded by hyperbole.And it is in relation to the backstop where Dr Hayward, who is a Fellow in the Senator George J. Mitchell Institute for Global Peace, Security and Justice, took most issue with Mrs Foster analysis:ldquoFoster claims that Northern Irelandrsquos access to the UK single market would be restricted. In actual fact this is entirely in the hands of the British government ndash it is a domestic issue unrelated to UK-EU negotiations, the Queens Reader asserted, before adding:ldquoSecondly, Foster says that lsquoEU access, comes with the requirement for Northern Ireland to fully adopt and implement EU regulations with no changesrsquo. But it is not necessary to have full regulatory alignment with the EU in order to have tarf free access to its market. That would be like saying wed have to have all our laws imposed by Beijingwe are to get tarf-free access to China.Dr Hayward does however admit that major ergence would require an operational backstop:ldquoThat said,the UK erges widely from the lsquocommon rulebookrsquo of the EUrsquos single market, it would not be possible for goods produced in Northern Ireland to have free movement around the single market as is currently the case. It would be in just such an instance that the backstop could come into play. This would not mean that all EU laws would apply in Northern Ireland but rather that goods produced here could be considered to be of EU standardcertain procedures are followed.In her opinion piece last week Mrs Foster stated that:ldquoFree Trade Agreements donrsquot just cover regulation but tarfs too. This would require not just being in the single market but in the customs union. In other words, a total sea Border descending between Northern Ireland and its largest market, Great Britain.Dr Hayward does not agree however and says ldquothere is absolutely no prospect of a total sea border under any scenario.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

That is the most immediate priority.”He continued: “And part of our agreement with the Conservative Party is the Brexit situation. So yes,the Conservative Party decided and were successful in getting this deal through the House of Commons then, absolutely, we will have to review our position with regard to the confidence and supply agreement.”His comments follow intense criticism of the draft Brexit withdrawal agreement in the House of Commons yesterday.DUP Westminster leader Nigel Dodds told the Prime Minister that despite numerous private meetings she had not listened to concerns.Theresa May was told her draft EU withdrawal agreement threatened the integrity of the UK and risked isolating Northern Ireland from the rest of the country.Mr Dodds said: “I could today stand here and take the Prime Minister through the list of promises and pledges that she made to this House and to us privately about the future of Northern Ireland and the future relationship with the EU but I fear it would be a waste of time since she clearly doesn’t listen.”Mr Dodds congratulated the Cabinet ministers who had so far resigned over the deal, adding: “The choice is now clear, we stand up for the United Kingdom, the whole of the United Kingdom, the integrity of the United Kingdom or we vote for a vassal state.”The DUP’s Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson said the deal was a case of “Northern Ireland being put on a platter as an object to surrender to the EU”.Ulster Rugby players to undergo Women’s Aid NI classes Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch     .               ..

Brexit, of course. I’ve had my fill. My brain is tired trying to understand all its nuances. But worse than that, it is distracting me from what is the most important time of the year – Christmas. I have always loved the run-down to Christmas. It’s a time when we begin to think of others, and shop for the loved ones around us. But Brexit has come between me and the festive season making me feel ill towards anyone raising the subject when all I want to be bothered about is what size the turkey should be this year. Politicians  Do we really care tuppence for them just now  Haven’t we seen and heard enough of them spitting venom over the ‘disaster’ ahead  Surely Brexit cannot be more important than the children in Yemen, dying daily in a ghastly war which shows no sign of abating, a war which like the one in Syria could go on for years  In the middle of the Christmas preparations we are faced with many such tragedies. But Brexit is dferent. It’s a war of bickering, a war destined to open up all our political weaknesses, a war which for the Irish and Northern Irish in particular is alarming in its bitterness and the need to settle old scores.Brexit is a drawn out battle we could have done without and I for one never imagined it would put a ‘damper’ on Christmas, a time of year when the charitable gene in us is thinking of other things and people. But politicians have hard hearts. Do they know it’s Christmas and do they care At this time each year we have Children in Need, which the UK as a whole continues to generously support. Going back much further to the s we had Band Aid, an event which really did capture the imagination thanks to the efforts of a pop star Bob Geldof Ben Lowry: Theresa May has ruthlessly but reluctantly felt she had to jettison unionism in Northern IrelandThe defeat of the EU withdrawal deal is the first imperative Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Yet, despite all our efforts children in many parts of the world continue to endure war and famine and what more can we do about it Regularly we put our hands in our purses in response to television and newspaper appeals but still it doesn’t appear to make much of a dference.Charities target us especially in the run-down to Christmas and I have no problem with that. In fact giving to charity is part of Christmas. Appeals are what we expect at this time of the year and people give generously. Our charity shops are full of beautul festive cards and gts to buy and many of us contribute in this way.But Brexit is getting in the way of all the festive spirit which can do so much good for those who need help. The politics of it all has me sapped, fed up, angry and vowing, at one stage, never to vote for a politician ever again. Did we get our fingers bitten back in the s when we signed up for the Common Market  Did we ever think when we signed then that we would end up being bossed around by a cabal of politicians speaking with foreign accents who dare us to withdraw from the ghastly behemoth they created due to our own politicians not reading the fine print or having the brains to see the problems that might arise in our attempt to extricate ourselves.Here I am in the midst of wondering what height my Christmas tree should be, distracted by the possibility that Sinn Fein could well be celebrating that their wildest dream of a united Ireland may be that bit closer come December. My mind is also distracted by the worry that the DUP, their reputation as kingmakers long gone, will be outwitted by the English politicians who really don’t give a toss about us and would gladly see us unhooked and driven into the Irish sea leaving them to become little England again.Soon I will dispatch Himself into the roof space to unearth the Christmas decorations an event I usually celebrate with a glass of my home made sloe gin. But Brexit is well and truly knocking the Christmas spirit out of me. try catch     .               ..

Francois. Picture: Sarah Standing Mr Francois quoted the DUP’s Nigel Dodds saying of the Prime Minister: “She just won’t listen.”In his letter of no-confidence, which has been widely circulated online, Mr Francois wrote: “As I tried to say respectfully to the Prime Minister in the House of Commons yesterday, there is absolutely no way that thisdeal will pass through the House. “The Labour Party are now pledged to vote against it with perhaps a handful of exceptions the SNP will vote against it the Liberal Democrats will vote against it crucially the Democratic Unionist Party will vote against it and over  Conservative MPs are pledged to vote against it as well.”He continued: “As I said yesterday this makes it mathematically impossible for the deal to pass. I pleaded with the Prime Minister to accept the political reality of this situation but still she continues to believe, against all evidence to the contrary, that she will get it through. She is, in short, in complete denial.”Referring specically to Northern Ireland and its place within the Union, the MP for Rayleigh and Wickford wrote: “Like many colleagues, I am also deeply worried that Chequers would treat Northern Ireland dferently from the rest of the United Kingdom. Not only is this a betrayal of the Province but it would give succour to our opponents in the SNP and assist them in renewing their calls for the breakup of the United Kingdom. “As members of the Conservative and Unionist Party we cannot and must not allow this to happen.”He continued: “In raw political terms there is also the fact that the Prime Minister has appallingly treated and now alienated our strategic allies in the Democratic Unionist Party. We rely on these MPs for a working majority in the House of Commons, given the disastrous General Election of  which she called and in which we lost over  valued colleagues. As ever, this was a decision she took with a very small coterie of advisors and without seeking opinion or advice from her experienced colleagues.“The DUP can speak for themselves but from what I have seen over the last few days, and given Nigel Dodds’ words in the House yesterday when he said ‘she just doesn’t listen’ it seems to me that not only will the DUP resist Chequers but they have effectively now lost all faith in the Prime Minister. This means that it will be practically impossible for us to continue to rely on them to prop up the Government while the Prime Minister remains in Office.“I therefore believe that in order for our party to survive in Government it is imperative we find a new leader who can command the respect of the DUP and therefore maintain the working majority in Parliament. This is, to coin a phrase, an inconvenient truth but it is there nonetheless.”DUP to ‘review position’ with ToriesBrexit deal passes Parliament Programme Awards were announced at a glittering awards ceremony in The Mac Belfast, hosted by Actress Bronagh Waugh.Interactive - sponsored by Flint StudiosBBC NI:  Berlin Blitz - Warren Bell and David Whelan from BBC NI are presented with their award by Jeremy Biggerstaff fromFlint Studios.Also pictured is actress Bronagh Waugh.Photo by Kelvin Boyes   Press Eye.\"   Programme Awards were announced at a glittering awards ceremony in The Mac Belfast, hosted by Actress Bronagh Waugh.Interactive - sponsored by Flint StudiosBBC NI:  Berlin Blitz - Warren Bell and David Whelan from BBC NI are presented with their award by Jeremy Biggerstaff fromFlint Studios.Also pictured is actress Bronagh Waugh.Photo by Kelvin Boyes   Press Eye.\"  Royal Television Society Northern IrelandProgramme Awards Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch     .               ..

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business chats to Danske Bank’s Vicky Davies and Richard Caldwell about the bank’s new Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub and ‘Making more possible’ for Northern Ireland businesses When you are already leading the technology and digital race in Northern Ireland banking, where do you go from there  For Danske Bank, its sights were set on something hugely ambitious, and something philanthropic which it believes can help cultivate, boost and grow the next generation of technology and fintech business start-ups in Northern Ireland. Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub, run in partnership with Catalyst Inc, is a stunning, modern incubator and hub which will see dozens of entrepreneurs and start-up businesses shape and craft their ideas in the heart of Danske Bank’s own Belfast city centre headquarters. The partnership with Catalyst Inc makes a lot of sense, as it already plays host to dozens of knowledge-based businesses across  acres in the Titanic Quarter, and the Innovation Centre in Londonderry. Vicky Davies is managing director of strategy and corporate development at Danske Bank. “We have a clear ambition to be the best bank in Northern Ireland, and we plan to do that by making more possible for our customers, employees, stakeholders and society”, she says. It’s that message, ‘Making more possible’, that adorns the wall of one of the main meeting rooms in the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub. “Banking is changing so fast. It’s relentless in terms of new entrants, innovation and the level of new fintech money coming into the industry.” “We know we need to change at pace, or face being left behind.” “We needed a partner in this venture, and we were looking for someone with reach and expertise,” she said. Following an initial meeting last year with senior management at Catalyst Inc, Vicky says there was an immediate mutual connection, and they went from there. “They have the expertise in running a space like this, and we have access to banking and business expertise – with both of us having great experience in helping businesses to grow. So, every dimension we looked at – it was a really good fit.” The hub is an impressive space, awash with splashes of colour, connectivity, co-working spaces and meeting rooms – including a nod to Princess Leia with an image on a wall – and it is able to play host to around - entrepreneurs and business start-up professionals, with top end cable and fibre internet connections. It’s further evidence of Danske Bank ensuring it’s well ahead of the pack and out in front. It’s about bringing a business from an embryonic start-up, to a thriving company, helping lead the way in its sector. But for Danske, this isn’t all about the bottom line. It’s about creating a thriving hub for the future stars of Northern Ireland’s burgeoning tech sector. And it’s a two-way street – with the bank aiming to learn as much from the start-up businesses nestled in the top-end spacious ground-floor hub, as the other way around. So, what does this mean for Danske Bank in terms of business banking and as an institution further bolstering its credentials in the digital space. Richard Caldwell is managing director of personal banking and small business. “We want to be part of the local fintech journey. We want to help influence and develop ideas,” he says. “There are more than , businesses in Northern Ireland, and we want to continue to support start-ups in general – by putting expertise and support into this partnership, we will help this particular set of small businesses to grow in what is a burgeoning sector.” “Ultimately, real success for us would be seeing products brought to market, and helping businesses grow from an embryonic idea, through to start-up, growth and expansion. With the business maybe ending up as one of our loyal corporate customers in the future.” Richard says research showed that many of Danske Bank’s existing bigger business customers wanted the bank to provide “something more tangible” for start-ups, to grow companies for the future. Although tenants in the new fintech space don’t necessarily have to bank with Danske, the Bank does offer banking support, including everything from a current account, to receiving assistance from a growth adviser to support them with their banking needs. gt “This is a major investment for us,” Richard says. “This is one of the most expensive ground-floor retail premises in Belfast, and we have devoted it to this hub. This is front and centre in the heart of Belfast.” The location of the new hub couldn’t be better – with the new Glider bus linking the hub to Catalyst Inc headquarters in Titanic Quarter. And, as modern tech businesses evolve and reach out to new markets and time zones across the globe, there is also  hour access to the Fintech Hub. The hub has a team of four, two from Danske Bank and two newly recruited by Catalyst Inc. Together Danske Bank and Catalyst Inc have also launched a new online  to help the wider growing number of start-up businesses across Northern Ireland to connect with investors, peers and potential new recruits across Europe - thehub.io helps connect start-ups to relevant resources, such as talent, networks, financing, tools and advice from experts which will help them overcome some of the challenges of scaling up. It is clear that strategically this is a big push by both organisations to play a key supporting role through the provision of both physical and online resources. Digitalisation Richard is keen to point out support for the hubs is just part of a bank-wide digital transformation agenda at Danske. “For example, we want to change the nature of traditional relationship management at the Bank. In addition to managing traditional banking needs as we have always done so well, we are now moving into the added value space. As well as the human touch, customers increasingly want top notch digital solutions to make their lives easier, to give them ease of access and quicker credit decisions.” The digitally-savvy way of thinking is giving Danske Bank competitive advantage, and that is from an already well-established position in the market. Last year they appointed a chief digital officer, who is a member of the Bank’s executive committee. “Our people are still our best asset and will remain so,” Richard said. “We have great people. And customers still highly value that human touch and expert advice. But what the journey looks like for transactions, well we have digital solutions for everything. For your payments, wages, drawing direct debits or paying suppliers. “Right now we are piloting and rolling out digital credit decisions for business customers. This is transforming the credit journey for both our customers and our business relationship managers. For example, one customer recently applied for an overdraft through the digital credit solution and got approval and the funds in their account in  minutes.” Danske Bank was the first of the local Northern Ireland banks to bring in app banking, and solutions such as Samsung Pay, Fitbit Pay and Garmin Pay. And this new Fintech Hub is very much another stride forward. The bank is also leading the pack when it comes to customer satisfaction, right across businesses of all shapes and sizes. “For some time now we have been the market leader in business banking. Research continues to show that our customer satisfaction scores are first for large business, and first for small business,” Richard said. Both Vicky and Richard are keen to see what they predict will be short and long-term benefits from the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub. There’s an organic osmosis, allowing ideas to flow freely between the Danske Bank people visiting from upstairs and those entrepreneurs which it hosts on the ground floor. “The entrepreneurs in the hub bring a fresh mindset, one we can learn from as we continue our own digital journey throughout the bank,” Vicky says. Richard added: “The fintech sector is seen in many quarters as a challenger to traditional banks, but we are embracing it and feel we can grow with it, to the benefit of our customers.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Stud-1.jpg","title":"plans to build  new homes in co antrim","story":"Posted on Wednesday  November  by John Mulgrew Around , new homes could be built in Co Antrim in one of the largest developments to take place here in the last few years, it can be revealed. Plans have now been submitted to construct the homes close to Sprucefield, outside Lisburn. It would also involve a new link road on the M motorway. An initial pre-application notice was issued for the scheme last year, but now the developer behind the scheme – Neptune Carleton – has submitted an outline planning application for the ambitious project. If the plans, which could include , homes on the large site at Blaris, get the go-ahead, it would be one of the largest residential property developments to be built in Northern Ireland in recent years. Elsewhere, this week a major £m housing development in Larne was awarded outline planning permission. Nuport Developments has been given the early go-ahead for  houses on the -acre site at Ballyboley in the town. The Ballyclare-based developer is now expected to progress to a more detailed plan for the housing scheme.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/may_1.jpg","title":"the brexit draft agreement business reaction","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by John Mulgrew The publication of a draft agreement between the Prime Minister and Brussels over the UK’s exit has caused a huge stir among the political institutions. Since Wednesday evening, several cabinet members have resigned, opposed to what they see is a softening of Theresa May’s position on leaving the EU. Essentially, for Northern Ireland’s business community in particular, it would remain part of the same customs territory as the rest of the UK and the entire area would be subject to \"level playing field\" commitments requiring the UK to follow EU rules in areas like animal welfare, environmental and workplace protections. Northern Ireland would be in a deeper customs relationship with the EU than where in the UK, and more closely tied to EU market rules. But what do Northern Ireland business groups think   Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “While it will take some time to go through the  plus pages of the agreement, on the face of it this document provides some reassurance to our industry and the NI consumer. “It provides solutions to customs, tarfs, an innovative solution on VAT, support for the Peace Process and a possible longer transition period. There certainly is some work to be done by both the Westminster Government and  the EU on the checks and administration for goods coming in to Northern Ireland from GB. “That will need to be light touch and be mitigated in further agreements, hopefully to an absolute bare minimum. However this agreement must pass through Parliament. We have always said the backstop is better than no deal.”   Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director-general “After  months of debate, this agreement by Cabinet is progress. It moves the UK one step away from the nightmare precipice of no deal and the harm it would cause to communities across the country. Securing a transition period has long been firms’ top priority and every day that passes without one means lost investment and jobs, hitting the most vulnerable hardest. “Time is now up. This deal is a compromise, including for business, but it offers that essential transitional period as a step back from the clf-edge. \"More clarity on the final relationship is needed, and uncertainty remains high, but this is an important step forward. “Transition and the backstop are not the intended permanent solutions for either side, but should pave the way for more work on the future deal. This must secure frictionless trade, ambitious access for our world-beating services, and a say over future rules. “The UK has had many months of discussion and ision. A long journey still lies ahead but now is the time for decisions. And the first decision is to avoid no deal.”  Retail NI chief executive, Glyn Roberts and Hospitality Ulster, Colin Neill  “This is a complex and detailed document which needs considerable analysis and further clarication from the UK Government. “We will be consulting our respective memberships on this document and we will set out in greater detail our views when we have completed this process. “Both our organisations have always sought a deal that ensures no delays in the supply chain, which promotes bridges rather than borders and above all , ensures that Northern Ireland businesses have full and free access to the EU and UK single markets. “Retail and Hospitality are two of Northern Ireland’s leading sectors of industry and our voice needs to be heard as this draft deal moves toward a vote in the House of Commons”  Michael Hall, managing partner, EY Northern Ireland “Business will clearly welcome last night’s announcement in that there is now better clarity on the terms of a deal however many will also be reluctant to put contingency plans on hold until there is a stronger signal on whether this will hold politically in the UK and Europe. “The backstop guarantee is a positive development for NI firms operating on an all-island basis, not least the restatement that both sides intend to work towards a free trade agreement longer term, which should not be overlooked. “The scale of political uncertainty and the volatility which this creates can be seen in the signicant currency fluctuations we have witnessed in the past  hours. Firms should not take this lightly and as such, factor these continued unknowns into their scenario planning. “On the positive side, Northern Ireland businesses have continued to expand and employ more people in the period since the Brexit referendum, which we remain hopeful they will continue to do as we look towards a further period of uncertainty. “By focusing on business fundamentals and contingency planning, firms will arm themselves so that they are ready to act when the road ahead becomes clearer.”  FSB NI policy chairman, Tina McKenzie “Businesses have been calling for months for agreement to be reached between the UK and EU negotiators, so it can only be welcome that a text has been agreed and approved by the Cabinet. “We are acutely aware of the political machinations which are ongoing, however it must be remembered that without an agreed withdrawal agreement, the UK will crash out in March , without a transition period, nor agreement on citizens’ rights, nor any plan to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. “While the exact nature of the backstop is being robustly debated, it must be remembered that the backstop will only take effectthe future relationship fails to deliver a frictionless border, after December . “We believe that the Withdrawal Agreement is a signicant step back from the clf edge which would result in a chaotic no deal Brexit that would be deeply damaging and dangerous for our small firms. “We would encourage all political actors to keep this in mind as we move forward.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
