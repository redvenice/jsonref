N is similar to r I is close to l.’Chelsea Sanker of Brown University agrees, saying that the sound is ‘between’ the two – and is ‘not prototypical’ of either one.While ‘auditory illusions’ are less well-known than optical illusions, there are plenty of ways to fool the brain using sound.Here, ASAPScience runs down a few of the famous ones."},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/sec_12582360.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"secret dirty jokes discovered anne franks diary","story":"The text discovered underneath two taped off pages from Anne Frank’s diary (Picture: AP)Researchers have discovered ‘dirty jokes’ and entries about sex in previously unseen pages in Anne frank’s diary.The 13-year-old had hidden two pages in her diary by covering them in brown masking paper and it has now been revealed what was written underneath.Frank van Vree, director of the Netherlands Institute for War Holocaust and Genocide Studies, said: ‘Anyone who reads the passages that have now been discovered will be unable to suppress a smile.‘The “dirty” jokes are classics among growing children. They make it clear that Anne, with all her gifts, was above all also an ordinary girl.’The two pages were dated September 28, 1942, when Anne would have been 13, less than three months after she, her family and another Jewish family went into hiding from the Nazis in a secret annex in a house in Amsterdam.She had covered the pages with brown paper fearing they might be found – and the contents of the entries had remained a mystery ever since.A reproduction of a picture of Anne Frank from 1941 released by the Anne Frank Fonds in Frankfurt Main, Germany (picture: PA)Anne herself described the four jokes about sex as ‘dirty’ and she had written an explanation of women’s sexual development, sex, contraception and prostitution.On sex, Anne described how a young woman gets her period around age 14, saying that it is ‘a sign that she is ripe to have relations with a man but one doesn’t do that of course before one is married’.On prostitution, she wrote: ‘All men, if they are normal, go with women, women like that accost them on the street and then they go together. In Paris they have big houses for that.She also wrote in Dutch about being asked to describe sex, saying: ‘I sometimes imagine that someone might come to me and ask me to inform him about sexual matters.‘How would I go about it?’She is said to have answered her own question, mentioning ‘rhythmical movements’ to describe sex and ‘internal medicament’ when talking about contraception.Experts said the newly discovered text, when studied together with the rest of her diary, reveals more about Anne’s development as a writer than it does about her interest in sex.The house where Anne hid during the Second World War is now a museum in Amsterdam (Picture: Reuters)Mr Leopold said the words are similar to other passages dealing with sex that already have been published in the multimillion-selling diary.He said it provides an early example of how Anne ‘creates a fictional situation that makes it easier for her to address the sensitive topics that she writes about’.Meet Tamara de Lempicka, the Polish art deco painter honoured in today\u0027s Google DoodleShe often addressed her diary entries to a fictional friend named Kitty.The deciphering was done by researchers from the Anne Frank museum, the Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies and the Huygens Institute of Netherlands History.They photographed the pages, backlit by a flash, and then used image-processing software to decipher the words, which were hard to read because they were jumbled up with the writing on the reverse sides of the pages.Anne and her family hid for more than two years during the Second World War, going into hiding in July 1942 until August 4 1944, when they were discovered and ultimately deported to Auschwitz.Only Anne’s father, Otto Frank, survived the war. Anne and her sister died in Bergen-Belsen camp when Anne was 15."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/15/19/4C1CF62300000578-5717935-image-a-2_1526408761889.jpg","title":"Royal Mail postwoman appears urinate garden","story":"    Andy Watson (pictured) discovered the culprit was wearing Royal Mail uniform after checking his CCTV  The postwoman knocks on the door of a property in Horton, Gloucestershire, at lunchtime on May 5  She makes her way down the steps leading up to the front door after delivering the package   She then squats down next to the steps and appears to relieve herself on the ground          The female employee, wearing a fluorescent orange Royal Mail bib, pulls up her trousers"},{"url":null,"title":"Who Tiger Woodss girlfriend Erica Herman revealed","story":"Who is Rami Malek?

The Ex On The Beach star was returning from a Las Vegas holiday when she found her flat ransackedEx On The Beach star Nicole Bass returned home from partying in Las Vegas to find burglars had ransacked her home - and chopped the heads off her stuffed animals.The former TOWIE star  was distraught when she came home from holiday last June only to find her flat trashed - and her valuables and car stolen.Maidstone Crown Court heard on Tuesday that heads were cut off the 26-year-old\u0027s teddy bears, and paint and food were thrown around the flat in Dartford, Kent.The reality star said she believed the burglars were tipped off that she wasn\u0027t home after posting several photos of herself partying in Sin City.The court heard that the stunning brunette arrived at her rented flat only to find there had been \u0027gratuitous ransacking\u0027.Nicole told the court: \u0027I was just completely baffled. I was thinking: Where has my car gone? \u0027My flat was trashed. It wasn\u0027t just as if they burgled my flat, they had absolutely violated it.\u0027There was paint everywhere and all my teddies had their heads chopped off or ripped off.\u0027My whole flat was vandalised. It wasn\u0027t like someone had burgled it and left. They had completely ruined everything I had worked hard for for seven years.\u0027            The court heard Nicole posted a photo of herself in Las Vegas on her Instagram page, which at that time she estimated the number of followers being about 320,000. Pictured: Nicole on vacation in Las Vegas last JuneNicholas Cato, 31, of Brockley, south London, and Jayd Gordon, 30, of Catford, south east London, deny burglary and theft of the car. The jury was told by Judge Philip St John-Stevens at the start of the trial that they should disregard anything they had read or seen.He said: \u0027It is right that the inidual is to some extent in the public limelight. There will be some public interest in it.\u0027I am not going to describe how that inidual is in public life. It may well be you will read something about it later on in the press.\u0027Maidstone Crown Court was told after finding her car missing, Nicole saw her door was smashed in. She went to get help as she feared the intruders might still be inside.A neighbour went with her into the flat and Nicole found it was \u0027a complete mess\u0027.Property including designer clothes, a Rolex watch and Pandora jewellery were also missing.          Maidstone Crown Court heard on Tuesday that Nicole had her valuables and car stolen. Jayd Gordon, 30, (pictured) of south east London, denied burglary and theft of the car. Nicholas Cato, 31, of  south London, also denied the chargesProsecutor Nina Ellin said: \u0027Clothes were strewn everywhere. Paint had been thrown all over the bedroom, including the bed, walls and dressing room. On the bed, the heads of soft toys had been cut off.\u0027 Miss Ellin continued: \u0027In the kitchen, all the cupboards had been emptied and food was thrown all over the floor.\u0027The sofa had been turned over in the living room and things had been thrown about.\u0027Nicole claims she had several items stolen, including Valentino heels, and expensive jackets from Stone Island, Canada Goose and Moncler.Earrings, watches and other jewellery were also missing, including a cross necklace given to her by her mother when she was a baby.The court heard Nicole posted a photo of herself in Las Vegas on her Instagram page, which at that time she estimated the number of followers was 320,000.Nicole\u0027s trip was due to be longer but it was cut short when she hurt her knee and returned home.

I managed to grab his wrist and take the knife from him. I had to explain: \u0027Once you\u0027re dead, you don\u0027t come back. You\u0027re not invincible.\u0027But Riley is only just beginning to grasp the fact that actions have consequences and recognise the effects of his reckless behaviour.When Shelley caught him holding a lit match to the safety netting of their trampoline — with all four children sitting inside it — she showed him graphic pictures of burn victims.  Riley has autism and, though a sweet-natured child, he has no sense of danger, nor awareness of his own strengthShelley says: \u0027I had to try to get him to understand the danger of fire, to show him exactly what would happen to him and his brother and sisters if he started fires.\u0027Shelley\u0027s partner Max adds: \u0027We adopt shock tactics. All the children have fallen down stairs because he has chased or pushed them. We\u0027re constantly rationalising: \u0027If you do that, they could break an arm, a leg, their neck. They could be killed.\u0027 \u0027Shelley and Max are also parents to Brooke, six, Skyla, four, and 20-month-old Mikey, who suffers from a reflux disorder, is fed through a tube and often spends time in hospital. The demands on the adults\u0027 time and attention are ceaseless.Riley, however, is not a monster — though he does behave monstrously at times — and he is not wilfully delinquent. For his behaviour is the result of the autism with which he was diagnosed a year ago.It accounts for his boisterousness, his attention-seeking, his outbursts of violence and frequent meltdowns. He also has a raft of other labels and conditions, from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) to learning difficulties and oppositional defiant disorder (hostile, defiant and disobedient behaviour).Another condition, called sensory processing disorder, means that Riley\u0027s brain has difficulty responding to information that comes through his senses.\u0027He will cry if the seams of his socks aren\u0027t aligned properly,\u0027 says Shelley. \u0027Sometimes, we can go through five pairs that don\u0027t feel right before he\u0027s happy to wear them.\u0027But he can also be sweet-natured and protective, kind and endearing.  Then and now: Riley has been a handful for his Hertfordshire parents but he knows he is different and already worries about his future\u0027He is a mass of contradictions,\u0027 says his mum. \u0027He\u0027ll be the first to climb on the shed roof or to the top of a tree. Once, he broke his collarbone falling off a wardrobe. He\u0027d climbed up it to get a pack of cards.\u0027He doesn\u0027t feel pain, either. The next day, with his arm in a sling, he was scaling the kitchen units.\u0027But, in some ways, he\u0027s mature about safety. He panics and is over-protective of his siblings. He worries that the girls might be bullied — he focuses on it obsessively.\u0027If we go to the station, he\u0027ll say: \u0027Hold the pushchair in case it gets sucked under a train.\u0027\u0027If I go above level one in the car park, he\u0027ll have a meltdown. He hates glass lifts, the noise of hand-dryers, and roller coasters.\u0027          Shelley has had to quit work to look after her son with autism. Now, they hope they can get a dog for him which will guide him through lifeMax adds: \u0027Yet he thinks he can fly and leap across ravines. And, although he throws punches at his sisters and kicks them in the face, he can also be caring.\u0027When Mikey had to go into hospital, he stroked his head so gently. He was crying. One to one, he can be the most wonderful, comical little boy.\u0027He has multiple personalities. Sometimes, he demands our constant, unided attention. At others, he retreats to his bedroom and wants to be alone.\u0027Woman takes fight to court as doctors try to remove autistic...Boy, 11, who was suspended for \u0027tapping his pen\u0027 hasn\u0027t been...Share this articleThe family\u0027s warm, but chaotic, home near St Albans, Hertfordshire, bears evidence of Riley\u0027s volatility. Doors have been removed as he has kicked holes through them. A sardonic sign in the sitting room reads: \u0027Remember: as far as anyone knows we are a nice, normal family.\u0027The Riley I meet bursts into the room after school, sweet-faced and charming, fizzing with energy and eager to chat about his day, from the roast lunch he ate in its entirety (\u0027except the fat bits on the meat\u0027) to the sponge pudding he didn\u0027t finish because he wanted to rush out and play with his friends.          Riley has kicked holes in doors and threatened to throw knives-  but his mum says he is not a monster as he tries to understand his conditionThere is little to distinguish him from other boys his age — his gelled hair and cheeky grin signal mischief — except that he wears the collar of his polo shirt tucked inside to stop his obsessive habit of chewing it and he grasps a small American football as if it were a priceless treasure. The ball is carried everywhere — he even takes it into the bath and to bed.This compulsive attachment to one object was an early indication to Shelley that Riley had traits that set him apart. As she works with young children, she was alert to his differences. At first, she remembers, he seemed precociously advanced.\u0027We\u0027d go somewhere and he\u0027d remember how to get back there from that single visit,\u0027 she recalls. \u0027And he spoke in complete sentences from 18 months. He was good at problem-solving, too: if he wanted to reach something, he\u0027d build a tower and climb up it.\u0027He was also endlessly, exhaustingly, active: somersaulting off the sofa or hanging off it upside down while watching his favourite wildlife programmes on television. He would absorb information like a sponge, constantly reciting facts.Shelley\u0027s relationship with Riley\u0027s father broke down when he was a baby but, when he was 16 months old, she met pub manager Max, who has raised her son with the same love and care he gives their other three children.          Riley has autism and, though a sweet-natured child, he has no sense of danger, nor awareness of his own strength. Pictured with Brooke age 6, Skyla age 4 and Mikey (20 months)Yet Riley\u0027s behaviour continued to tax and baffle them. It was, Shelley says, a \u0027supreme relief\u0027 when he was diagnosed, aged seven, with autism.It meant there was a reason for his quirks, his flare-ups, his failure to make eye contact and his adherence to ritual. Importantly, there were also ways to help him.But, although he now takes anti-psychotic medication, there are still times when Riley tries his parents\u0027 patience to its limits.One day, Max caught Riley with his hands round Brooke\u0027s neck. \u0027They were arguing because she\u0027d gone into his bedroom — his sanctuary — and Riley had grabbed her round the throat,\u0027 says Max.\u0027I was so angry and scared that I shouted to Shelley: \u0027Keep your son away from my children.\u0027 It\u0027s the first and only time I\u0027ve said it — I make a huge effort not to treat Riley differently from the others and, in my heart, he\u0027s my son — but I felt he\u0027d crossed a boundary and that Shelley wasn\u0027t doing enough to discipline him.\u0027However, conventional forms of chastisement do not work with Riley. He doesn\u0027t respond to sanctions, restraint or withdrawal of privileges.  Shelley with Mikey (20 months) and daughters Brooke age six, Skyla age four, as well as son Riley, aged eightThe pressures on the family are immense and relentless. For the past 18 months, neither Shelley nor Max has worked, as it is a full-time job for both of them to look after the children.\u0027I don\u0027t like Riley sometimes, but I never stop loving him,\u0027 says Shelley. And she fears for him, too. Her elder son is heart-breakingly self-aware, acutely conscious that his brain is differently wired from most people\u0027s — and it causes him intense pain.\u0027It makes me so sad,\u0027 says Shelley. \u0027Sometimes, he\u0027ll say: \u0027I\u0027m an ugly, stupid boy,\u0027 and punch himself in the face and not seem to feel it.\u0027He gets upset about his behaviour and sobs. He says: \u0027Why do I have to have a brain like this?\u0027\u0027We\u0027ve always told him he has a \u0027special\u0027 brain. We\u0027ve built a story round it and told him not to be so hard on himself. We\u0027ve explained that he isn\u0027t \u0027bad\u0027. His brain just works differently.\u0027But Shelley worries about his future. Although he attends a mainstream junior school now, she knows he will need to go to a secondary school that caters for his special needs. What will happen in the future?She says: \u0027I have really down days sometimes, thinking: \u0027Is he going to cope? Where is his life leading? Will he ever have a relationship?\u0027\u0027My nan and granddad used to say: \u0027He\u0027ll grow out of it,\u0027 but, of course, he won\u0027t. Sometimes, he says he wishes he was dead — and that is the most painful thing for a mother to hear.\u0027Max adds: \u0027He says he doesn\u0027t know how to earn money or buy food and, even at his age, it worries him. Sometimes, he cries and says: \u0027What will I do when I\u0027m older?\u0027 But we tell him we\u0027ll always be here, that he can stay with us.\u0027          Riley once held his sister\u0027s head down in the bath and told his mum he was teaching her to breathe under waterOne glimmer of hope buoys them. When Shelley\u0027s sister, Jade, brought her border collie, Keiko, to stay with the family for a week, Riley was thrilled to be entrusted with the task of caring for the dog.\u0027His job was to get Keiko\u0027s food and water and he loved the procedure, the routine and the responsibility,\u0027 recalls Shelley.\u0027He precisely weighed out the food and he liked the fact that the dog gave him full-on attention.\u0027She loves chasing a ball — she never tires of it — and Riley spent hours outside throwing the ball for her to catch. He loved that she\u0027d sit when he asked her to and give him her paw. She slept on the floor in his bedroom and, all week, he didn\u0027t have a meltdown. It was as if the whole house gave a sigh of relief.\u0027\u0027That\u0027s what Riley needs. A dog,\u0027 Shelley said to Max after Keiko had gone back home.So she searched the internet and discovered Autism Life Dogs, a charity providing specially trained dogs for autistic people.          Shelley wants to try and raise enough money to buy a companion dog for her son who cries about being different to the other childrenSuch a dog costs £8,500, beyond the slender means of the family, so they are raising money for one.The dogs sense anxiety, hesitation, fear — all possible precursors to a meltdown — and signal before it happens. They are also wonderful companions.At present, Shelley and Max dare not let Riley out of their sight. \u0027He would run into the road chasing a ball without thinking about the traffic,\u0027 says Shelley. \u0027And he wouldn\u0027t realise the danger of getting into a car with a stranger.\u0027With a dog at his side, however, he could take the first small steps towards independence. \u0027A dog wouldn\u0027t just change Riley\u0027s life,\u0027 says Shelley. \u0027It could save it, too.\u0027 Shelley\u0027s JustGiving page can be found here.Crowdfunding to Fund an Autism Life Dog for my son.

The EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier said on Monday there had been ‘little progress’ since March. The new document, which ministers hope to publish before the next Brussels summit at the end of June, will also try to tackle the vexed issue of future customs arrangements, which has split the Cabinet.Members of Mrs May’s Brexit ‘war Cabinet’ again failed to resolve the customs issue during a 90-minute meeting yesterday.More than a quarter of shops are selling knives illegally to...Bullying, catfights and fraudulent entries: Inside the...Share this articleMr Davis and Mrs May’s deputy David Lidington gave brief presentations on work to tackle problems with the Government’s two customs options.

It comes amid a row over the role of grammars in Britain’s educational landscape.Mr Heller-Sahlgren said that although his study did not examine the effects of selective schools – many of which are academies – they were likely to add to the phenomenon he had described. ‘One could make the argument that it increases choice and competition in the same way,’ he said.‘If grammar schools promote more choice and competition, you could argue in a roundabout way that the results might be relevant for that as well.’The study, which was based on data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, was published in the Economics of Education Review.          Tee study said the positive effects on academic achievement appear to outweigh the negative impacts on pupil wellbeing (file picture)The findings are a boost for Conservative education policies. Since coming to power, the party has been encouraging all schools to leave council control – and failing schools have been forced to do so.Last week it emerged that thousands more places are to be created at selective schools. Education Secretary Damian Hinds has approved a £50million fund to build extra classrooms. However, grammars bidding for the money must be able to prove that they are taking action to increase admissions of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds.It is thought that between 1,000 and 2,000 places could be created in areas where there is high demand from parents.The Department for Education said the move would give parents more choice and give more children of all backgrounds access to a good school place.But union leaders said ministers had no evidence that ‘shows strong educational benefit of this misguided policy’. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/16/02/4C44AC5800000578-5734013-image-a-2_1526433058218.jpg","title":"Nature works magic time year wisteria blooms make purple envy","story":"    The climbing plant was already mature when the owners moved into the house near Wells, Somerset, 35 years ago          Wisteria growing on the Castle Hotel in Taunton, SomersetBut now the entire property is drenched in purple splendour, with this year’s display even more stunning than usual.

I managed to grab his wrist and take the knife from him. I had to explain: \u0027Once you\u0027re dead, you don\u0027t come back. You\u0027re not invincible.\u0027But Riley is only just beginning to grasp the fact that actions have consequences and recognise the effects of his reckless behaviour.When Shelley caught him holding a lit match to the safety netting of their trampoline — with all four children sitting inside it — she showed him graphic pictures of burn victims.  Riley has autism and, though a sweet-natured child, he has no sense of danger, nor awareness of his own strengthShelley says: \u0027I had to try to get him to understand the danger of fire, to show him exactly what would happen to him and his brother and sisters if he started fires.\u0027Shelley\u0027s partner Max adds: \u0027We adopt shock tactics. All the children have fallen down stairs because he has chased or pushed them. We\u0027re constantly rationalising: \u0027If you do that, they could break an arm, a leg, their neck. They could be killed.\u0027 \u0027Shelley and Max are also parents to Brooke, six, Skyla, four, and 20-month-old Mikey, who suffers from a reflux disorder, is fed through a tube and often spends time in hospital. The demands on the adults\u0027 time and attention are ceaseless.Riley, however, is not a monster — though he does behave monstrously at times — and he is not wilfully delinquent. For his behaviour is the result of the autism with which he was diagnosed a year ago.It accounts for his boisterousness, his attention-seeking, his outbursts of violence and frequent meltdowns. He also has a raft of other labels and conditions, from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) to learning difficulties and oppositional defiant disorder (hostile, defiant and disobedient behaviour).Another condition, called sensory processing disorder, means that Riley\u0027s brain has difficulty responding to information that comes through his senses.\u0027He will cry if the seams of his socks aren\u0027t aligned properly,\u0027 says Shelley. \u0027Sometimes, we can go through five pairs that don\u0027t feel right before he\u0027s happy to wear them.\u0027But he can also be sweet-natured and protective, kind and endearing.  Then and now: Riley has been a handful for his Hertfordshire parents but he knows he is different and already worries about his future\u0027He is a mass of contradictions,\u0027 says his mum. \u0027He\u0027ll be the first to climb on the shed roof or to the top of a tree. Once, he broke his collarbone falling off a wardrobe. He\u0027d climbed up it to get a pack of cards.\u0027He doesn\u0027t feel pain, either. The next day, with his arm in a sling, he was scaling the kitchen units.\u0027But, in some ways, he\u0027s mature about safety. He panics and is over-protective of his siblings. He worries that the girls might be bullied — he focuses on it obsessively.\u0027If we go to the station, he\u0027ll say: \u0027Hold the pushchair in case it gets sucked under a train.\u0027\u0027If I go above level one in the car park, he\u0027ll have a meltdown. He hates glass lifts, the noise of hand-dryers, and roller coasters.\u0027          Shelley has had to quit work to look after her son with autism. Now, they hope they can get a dog for him which will guide him through lifeMax adds: \u0027Yet he thinks he can fly and leap across ravines. And, although he throws punches at his sisters and kicks them in the face, he can also be caring.\u0027When Mikey had to go into hospital, he stroked his head so gently. He was crying. One to one, he can be the most wonderful, comical little boy.\u0027He has multiple personalities. Sometimes, he demands our constant, unided attention. At others, he retreats to his bedroom and wants to be alone.\u0027Woman takes fight to court as doctors try to remove autistic...Boy, 11, who was suspended for \u0027tapping his pen\u0027 hasn\u0027t been...Share this articleThe family\u0027s warm, but chaotic, home near St Albans, Hertfordshire, bears evidence of Riley\u0027s volatility. Doors have been removed as he has kicked holes through them. A sardonic sign in the sitting room reads: \u0027Remember: as far as anyone knows we are a nice, normal family.\u0027The Riley I meet bursts into the room after school, sweet-faced and charming, fizzing with energy and eager to chat about his day, from the roast lunch he ate in its entirety (\u0027except the fat bits on the meat\u0027) to the sponge pudding he didn\u0027t finish because he wanted to rush out and play with his friends.          Riley has kicked holes in doors and threatened to throw knives-  but his mum says he is not a monster as he tries to understand his conditionThere is little to distinguish him from other boys his age — his gelled hair and cheeky grin signal mischief — except that he wears the collar of his polo shirt tucked inside to stop his obsessive habit of chewing it and he grasps a small American football as if it were a priceless treasure. The ball is carried everywhere — he even takes it into the bath and to bed.This compulsive attachment to one object was an early indication to Shelley that Riley had traits that set him apart. As she works with young children, she was alert to his differences. At first, she remembers, he seemed precociously advanced.\u0027We\u0027d go somewhere and he\u0027d remember how to get back there from that single visit,\u0027 she recalls. \u0027And he spoke in complete sentences from 18 months. He was good at problem-solving, too: if he wanted to reach something, he\u0027d build a tower and climb up it.\u0027He was also endlessly, exhaustingly, active: somersaulting off the sofa or hanging off it upside down while watching his favourite wildlife programmes on television. He would absorb information like a sponge, constantly reciting facts.Shelley\u0027s relationship with Riley\u0027s father broke down when he was a baby but, when he was 16 months old, she met pub manager Max, who has raised her son with the same love and care he gives their other three children.          Riley has autism and, though a sweet-natured child, he has no sense of danger, nor awareness of his own strength. Pictured with Brooke age 6, Skyla age 4 and Mikey (20 months)Yet Riley\u0027s behaviour continued to tax and baffle them. It was, Shelley says, a \u0027supreme relief\u0027 when he was diagnosed, aged seven, with autism.It meant there was a reason for his quirks, his flare-ups, his failure to make eye contact and his adherence to ritual. Importantly, there were also ways to help him.But, although he now takes anti-psychotic medication, there are still times when Riley tries his parents\u0027 patience to its limits.One day, Max caught Riley with his hands round Brooke\u0027s neck. \u0027They were arguing because she\u0027d gone into his bedroom — his sanctuary — and Riley had grabbed her round the throat,\u0027 says Max.\u0027I was so angry and scared that I shouted to Shelley: \u0027Keep your son away from my children.\u0027 It\u0027s the first and only time I\u0027ve said it — I make a huge effort not to treat Riley differently from the others and, in my heart, he\u0027s my son — but I felt he\u0027d crossed a boundary and that Shelley wasn\u0027t doing enough to discipline him.\u0027However, conventional forms of chastisement do not work with Riley. He doesn\u0027t respond to sanctions, restraint or withdrawal of privileges.  Shelley with Mikey (20 months) and daughters Brooke age six, Skyla age four, as well as son Riley, aged eightThe pressures on the family are immense and relentless. For the past 18 months, neither Shelley nor Max has worked, as it is a full-time job for both of them to look after the children.\u0027I don\u0027t like Riley sometimes, but I never stop loving him,\u0027 says Shelley. And she fears for him, too. Her elder son is heart-breakingly self-aware, acutely conscious that his brain is differently wired from most people\u0027s — and it causes him intense pain.\u0027It makes me so sad,\u0027 says Shelley. \u0027Sometimes, he\u0027ll say: \u0027I\u0027m an ugly, stupid boy,\u0027 and punch himself in the face and not seem to feel it.\u0027He gets upset about his behaviour and sobs. He says: \u0027Why do I have to have a brain like this?\u0027\u0027We\u0027ve always told him he has a \u0027special\u0027 brain. We\u0027ve built a story round it and told him not to be so hard on himself. We\u0027ve explained that he isn\u0027t \u0027bad\u0027. His brain just works differently.\u0027But Shelley worries about his future. Although he attends a mainstream junior school now, she knows he will need to go to a secondary school that caters for his special needs. What will happen in the future?She says: \u0027I have really down days sometimes, thinking: \u0027Is he going to cope? Where is his life leading? Will he ever have a relationship?\u0027\u0027My nan and granddad used to say: \u0027He\u0027ll grow out of it,\u0027 but, of course, he won\u0027t. Sometimes, he says he wishes he was dead — and that is the most painful thing for a mother to hear.\u0027Max adds: \u0027He says he doesn\u0027t know how to earn money or buy food and, even at his age, it worries him. Sometimes, he cries and says: \u0027What will I do when I\u0027m older?\u0027 But we tell him we\u0027ll always be here, that he can stay with us.\u0027          Riley once held his sister\u0027s head down in the bath and told his mum he was teaching her to breathe under waterOne glimmer of hope buoys them. When Shelley\u0027s sister, Jade, brought her border collie, Keiko, to stay with the family for a week, Riley was thrilled to be entrusted with the task of caring for the dog.\u0027His job was to get Keiko\u0027s food and water and he loved the procedure, the routine and the responsibility,\u0027 recalls Shelley.\u0027He precisely weighed out the food and he liked the fact that the dog gave him full-on attention.\u0027She loves chasing a ball — she never tires of it — and Riley spent hours outside throwing the ball for her to catch. He loved that she\u0027d sit when he asked her to and give him her paw. She slept on the floor in his bedroom and, all week, he didn\u0027t have a meltdown. It was as if the whole house gave a sigh of relief.\u0027\u0027That\u0027s what Riley needs. A dog,\u0027 Shelley said to Max after Keiko had gone back home.So she searched the internet and discovered Autism Life Dogs, a charity providing specially trained dogs for autistic people.          Shelley wants to try and raise enough money to buy a companion dog for her son who cries about being different to the other childrenSuch a dog costs £8,500, beyond the slender means of the family, so they are raising money for one.The dogs sense anxiety, hesitation, fear — all possible precursors to a meltdown — and signal before it happens. They are also wonderful companions.At present, Shelley and Max dare not let Riley out of their sight. \u0027He would run into the road chasing a ball without thinking about the traffic,\u0027 says Shelley. \u0027And he wouldn\u0027t realise the danger of getting into a car with a stranger.\u0027With a dog at his side, however, he could take the first small steps towards independence. \u0027A dog wouldn\u0027t just change Riley\u0027s life,\u0027 says Shelley. \u0027It could save it, too.\u0027 Shelley\u0027s JustGiving page can be found here.Crowdfunding to Fund an Autism Life Dog for my son.

As each stop triggered another mortifying conversation about seats, the book explained what was going on in our brains to make the situation feel so painful, why that matters so much to us and what we can learn from it.Melissa Dahl is an American science journalist who has been writing about psychology for 10 years, and her book, about the very specific phenomenon of awkwardness, “began as an attempt to permanently banish the feeling from my life with science!” Like all good scientists, though, she has changed her opinion based on the evidence she collected. Dahl now seeks out and embraces awkwardness, and she thinks that we all should, too.Babies become self-conscious at the age of about two (scientists learned by sticking Post-it notes on their foreheads and showing them mirrors). And embarrassment – even watching other people embarrass themselves – seems to trigger some of the same processes in the brain as physical pain. We’d be forgiven for avoiding embarrassment at any cost – and some people, with social anxiety disorders, do. But Dahl argues that awkwardness can teach us all sorts of lessons.She offers several convincing examples. Couples who drift into relationship markers such as marriage are less happy than those who discuss each step carefully, for instance: “Having the awkward conversation you’re dreading is often worthwhile.” When job adverts do not specifically state that pay is negotiable, women are far less likely than men to bite the bullet and negotiate a better salary. A 2014 campaign by the charity Scope found that “about two thirds of Britons surveyed said that they felt awkward or uncomfortable around disabled people”. One-fifth of 18 to 34-year-olds “said that they’d purposely avoided interacting with a disabled person because it made them feel so uncomfortable”. This avoidance is clearly a form of discrimination. And, as Dahl notes, some people do not have the privilege of avoiding awkward conversations about race, for example.She writes about the “irreconcilable gap” between the version of us we think we project and the version that other people see, and describes how sometimes it is useful to have a critical friend to point this out. “When those two yous collide in a Skype video chat, revealing that you are having a weirder hair day than you thought, it’s disappointing. When these yous collide in the context of discussing something like racism, it’s sickening … But wouldn’t you rather know when there’s a little racism stuck in your teeth?” She talks to the comedian W Kamau Bell, whose good friend called him out on a joke he had made about Condoleezza Rice that seemed to her racist and sexist. Instead of reacting defensively, he “sort of sat in the awkwardness and leaned into it, and then eventually could very clearly hear that she was right …” If only more people could respond as he did.Dahl and Bell agree about “the power of awkward conversations”. She takes up improv, appears in a show called Mortified, investigates a Reddit channel all about “cringe”, and pays a stranger for a hug. Through this, she learns about the psychological benefits of the bonding qualities of embarrassment the difference between cognitive and compassionate empathy and that some situations are too cringeworthy to bear.Dahl is exceptionally good at describing emotions and the visceral physical sensations that often accompany them, and on the whole her personal anecdotes and her more scientific investigations are pertinent and penetrating. Cringeworthy offers several sensible pointers for readers, perhaps on trains, who would like to overcome awkwardness. But the most passionate advice is to be “grateful for this odd little emotion and the power it has to connect us … There will always be awkwardness, and the only way to keep it from isolating us is if we start cringing together.”• Cringeworthy: A Theory of Awkwardness is published by Bantam.

Everyone wants it. But what is happiness, really? What’s going on in our brains when we experience the much-sought-after emotion? That’s what I wanted to find out when writing my new book, The Happy Brain. What did I find out? Essentially, that it’s very complicated, as is typically the case when looking at anything produced by the brain. One of the only firm conclusions I arrived at is that anyone offering a simple “secret” or “key” or “five easy tips” for happiness that work for everyone is either hopelessly naive or actively misleading.In truth there are so many things that influence our happiness our environment, our age, our relationships and community, our jobs and ambitions, our health, our wealth, our past, our future and so on. All these things can – and often do – play a part in our overall happiness. The following books provide excellent examples of the importance, complexity and unpredictability of happiness, and the numerous ways it can be achieved.1. Adolf Hitler: My Part in his Downfall by Spike MilliganWhen we think about what makes us happy, it often involves modern-day luxuries, such as expensive possessions, travelling, entertainments etc. But it’s possible to be happy without these things, even in the direst circumstances, as Spike’s collected war diaries demonstrate. Even amid a war zone, it seems the human brain can still find joy, laughter and pleasure.Of course, this isn’t a given, and bleak situations will grind you down eventually. Milligan’s diaries grow more sombre and tragic as they progress. But even so, there are persistent happy moments throughout, which provide an amazing example of just how durable and persistent happiness can be.2. Cringeworthy by Melissa DahlHumans are an incredibly social species, so our brains are often affected by, or geared towards, interpersonal interaction. Consequently, much of what we feel and experience is heavily influenced by other people. This has consequences for our happiness and how we go about achieving it.In her first book, New York magazine’s Melissa Dahl focuses largely on the nature of embarrassment, in exquisite but accessible detail, providing a brilliantly insightful look at what the perceptions of others do to us on a fundamental level. Having it on your shelves would be nothing to be embarrassed about.3. Girl on the Net: How a Bad Girl Fell in LovePeople talk of falling in love, marriage and living “happily ever after”, but nothing’s ever that simple. Human love, sex and relationships are complicated we expect them to fix everything, but both our underlying biology and general societal attitudes often make them baffling and stressful, which leads to unhappiness.The acclaimed sex writer Girl on the Net does stellar work in highlighting the benefits and pitfalls of balancing a long-term monogamous relationship with an overactive libido, and the various ways to find happiness while doing so.4. How Not to Grow Up by Richard HerringWhat makes us happy now won’t necessarily make us happy a year later. We grow, we mature, we change. Here stand-up comedy workhorse and self-described “big kid” Herring illustrates this phenomenon brilliantly, by describing how pursuing his own immature needs (in this case, a threesome) conflicted with his impending 40th birthday. It’s an excellent example of how what you think will make you happy is worlds away from what eventually does. A refreshing and life-affirming take on the traditional comedy memoir.5. How to Survive the End of the World (When It’s All in Your Head) by Aaron GillesMost references to the workings of happiness focus on the reward pathways, or neurotransmitters such as endorphins or serotonin. But it’s more than that a lot depends on quieting the brain’s threat detection mechanism, so we don’t experience as much fear and stress.Unfortunately, the mechanism can become ridiculously active, leading to depression and chronic anxiety. Finding happiness in such a scenario is harder, but it can be done, as this new book by Gilles (aka Twitter maestro @Technicallyron) demonstrates with aplomb. A fast-paced, amusing and insightful read, particularly for anyone dealing with similar problems.6. Inventing Ourselves: The Secret Life of the Teenage Brain by Sarah-Jayne Blakemore As already mentioned, our brains change over time. Sometimes these changes can be drastic, and governed by our internal biology. The most obvious example of this is adolescence, when our brains suddenly go into huge upheaval, and our behaviours, desires and moods, all of which feed into our happiness, become very different. I tried to cover this briefly in my own book, but this is a thorough, informative read across the whole subject.7. It’s All in Your Head by Suzanne O’SullivanHappiness is often regarded as an optional extra in life, something you can have if you work hard or are lucky enough. But a lack of happiness or abundance of stress can be genuinely damaging for your physical health. The moods and emotions we feel have complex consequences for our underlying biology, and appreciating that is an important step in understanding happiness.This link between mind and body is superbly demonstrated in O’Sullivan’s award-winning book, where the experienced neurologist describes in detail her patients with the most remarkable psychosomatic disorders.8. Mr Shaha’s Recipes for Wonder by Alom ShahaMany things stimulate the brain in just the right way to increase the odds of being happy: positive interactions with our parents or children, reducing uncertainty through obtaining information, new experiences, creating things. All provoke a subtle but positive response in the typical human brain.As a parent of young children, I found all these things covered by Shaha’s science-based discovery book, which is filled with beautifully illustrated experiments that adults can lead youngsters through.9. Night Watch by Terry PratchettPratchett’s Discworld books have made millions of people happy, and in Night Watch Sam Vimes, commander of the Ankh-Morpork Watch, inadvertently returns to the “old days” when he was but a lowly street copper.In Pratchett’s inimitable style, this beautifully exemplifies an important aspect of happiness: nostalgia. Long thought to be a cognitive defect, it’s now considered beneficial, providing motivation and enhancing wellbeing and happiness. But this happiness often depends on filtering out the (many) unpleasant aspects of the past. Whether or not you can reconcile the then with the now will determine how happy you are.10. 100 Best Video Games (That Never Existed) by Nate CrowleyI like video games. I enjoy humour. I’m fascinated by technological progress. However, I never expected a book that combined them. And yet, here it is. There’s no real reason for 100BVG(TNE) to exist. And yet it does, because sometimes being happy involves doing something just for the joy of it. And it’s important to not lose sight of that amid all the analysis and introspection.

It’s a perfect fit for a literate nation taking public learning to the next levelHelsinki’s state-of-the-art Oodi library will stand opposite parliament and boast a cinema, recording studio and makerspace. It’s a perfect fit for a literate nation taking public learning to the next level“A library card was the first thing that was mine, that I had ever owned,” says Nasima Razmyar. The daughter of a former Afghan diplomat, Razmyar arrived in Finland with her family in 1992 as a refugee fleeing political unrest. Unable to speak the language, with scant resources, and trying to make sense of the strange new city she found herself in, she was stunned to discover she was entitled to a library card that would grant her books – for free. Her appreciation of the privilege has not faded: “I still have that library card in my wallet today,” she says proudly.Today, Razmyar is deputy mayor of Helsinki, and ready to champion the institution that has given her so much – starting with the construction of Oodi, the city’s new central library, due to open in December. She is not alone in her passion for libraries. “Finland is a country of readers,” declared the country’s UK ambassador Päivi Luostarinen recently, and it’s hard to argue with her. In 2016 the UN named Finland the world’s most literate nation, and Finns are among the world’s most enthusiastic users of public libraries – the country’s 5.5m million people borrow close to 68m books a year.Oodi – Ode in English – is more than a sober monument to civic pride. Commissioned as part of Finland’s celebration of a century of independence, the library is no mere book repository. “I think Finland could not have given a better gift to the people. It symbolises the significance of learning and education, which have been fundamental factors for Finland’s development and success,” says Razmyar. Libraries are seen as the visible face of the Finnish belief in education, equality and good citizenship. “There’s strong belief in education for all,” says Hanna Harris, director of Archinfo Finland and Mind-building’s commissioner. “There is an appreciation of active citizenship – the idea that it is something that everyone is entitled to. Libraries embody that strongly,” she adds.Those feelings of pride in the equality of opportunity offered by the city’s new library are echoed by the site chosen for Oodi: directly opposite parliament. “I think there is no other actor that could stand in front of the grounds of democracy like the public library does,” says Razmyar. “It’s remarkable that when standing on the open balcony of the library people are looking straight into the parliament and standing on the same level.”But Oodi isn’t the only Helsinki library to cause excitement. “Töölö library is one of my favourites,” says Harris. “It’s set in a park and has a rooftop balcony. Recently my colleagues and I went down there and there was a queue outside the doors – on a regular weekday morning, there was a queue at 9am to get in.”Perhaps a clue to the Finnish enthusiasm for libraries comes from the fact that they offer far more than books. While many libraries worldwide provide internet access and other services, libraries in cities and towns across Finland have expanded their brief to include lending e-publications, sports equipment, power tools and other “items of occasional use”. One library in Vantaa even offers karaoke.These spaces are not designed to be dusty temples to literacy. They are vibrant, well-thought-out spaces actively trying to engage the urban communities who use them. The library in Maunula, a northern Helsinki suburb, has a doorway that leads directly to a supermarket – a striking and functional decision which, along with its adult education centre and youth services section, was partly down to the fact that it was designed with input from locals. Oodi, however, will go even further: in addition to its core function as a library, it will boast a cafe, restaurant, public balcony, cinema, audiovisual recording studios and a makerspace with 3D printers. A sauna was apparently considered, but seems not to have made the final cut.This ersity is key, argues Razmyar. “Libraries must reach out to the new generations.

But as Prince Harry marries Meghan Markle, is it goodbye Royal Variety Show and hello Royal Reprezent FM?The marriage of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle means many things to many people, but, while loyalists are bagging their picnic spots and unpacking the union-jack party plates, some hard-pressed arts organisations will be taking a longer view.Once the party is over, reality strikes: a royal wedding means the admittance of a new member into “the firm” – and for them, a lifetime of public patronage. It has already been announced that Markle will become a partner in the Royal Foundation, set up by Princes William and Harry in 2009 as an umbrella for a clutch of charities. Besides youth work, the foundation’s portfolio is dominated by the princes’ preoccupations with the armed forces and conservation, while the charities that will be picked for Markle’s inidual support will – in Palace parlance – “reflect Miss Markle’s own interests”.The National Portrait Gallery and the art therapy organisation, Art Room, were among the first four charities to be chosen for her future sister-in-law, Kate. A clue as to where Markle’s interests might lead her – as a cosmopolitan mixed-race TV actor, with avowedly feminist views – lies in the couple’s second official engagement in January. It took them (on their own request) to the “youth-led” radio station Reprezent FM, in Brixton, south London, which is credited with launching the careers of a galaxy of DJs and grime stars, including this year’s Brit award-winner Stormzy.But what does royal patronage actually mean for the arts? For Reprezent, which was saved from closure three years ago by a crowd-funding appeal, even a one-off visit has been an overwhelming experience. “To be honest, we’re hunkered down. We’ve been inundated with requests, and there’s been a three-line whip across the board not to talk to the press about anything at all,” said their phone operator.Over the next four years, the specialist graduate college – whose alumni include Sylvia Pankhurst, Ian Dury, David Hockney and Tracey Emin – will expand to a new campus in Battersea and increase its student numbers from 1,900 to 3,000. It already recruits from 74 countries and the rapid growth both in numbers and costs will increasingly involve looking overseas, where the word “royal” is an invaluable calling card.“The royal connection has always been hugely beneficial when being seen on the international stage,” said a spokeswoman, “so we are no different from other great institutions such as the Royal College of Music, Royal Academy of Music, Rada, Royal Opera House or Royal Shakespeare Company.” As Andy Hillier, editor of the charity sector magazine Third Sector, points out, the two great advantages of a royal association are publicity and trust. “For smaller organisations, the biggest advantage is publicity because it can be very difficult to draw attention to yourself. For larger organisations, the publicity benefit might not be so obvious unless you’re staging a big event, but trust is a big issue at the moment, and if you have a royal patron there is an assumption that there’s a royal stamp of approval and that you will have been thoroughly vetted.”The twists and turns of royal support are as bewildering as the Hampton Court maze. Presidencies and patronships come with varying, and not always consistent, levels of commitment. As a “royal visitor” Prince Charles is unlikely to visit the RCA much, though it hopes to profit from a hook-up with the Royal Drawing School, which he co-founded in 2000 as the Prince’s Drawing School, but which only went on to earn its “Royal” appellation in 2014. The announcement of this upgrade, by an institution that could be seen as the result of a hobbyist’s anachronistic obsession with “observational drawing”, is revealing: “With this name change, the Royal Drawing School joins the Royal Academy (1768), the Royal College of Music (1882), the Royal College of Art (1896) the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (1920) and the Royal Ballet School (1956), as a member of the small circle of prestigious, world-renowned arts education institutions to bear the Royal title. It is the first such institution to be granted the name since the Royal Ballet School, which received its title in 1956 – the fourth year of the reign of HM Queen Elizabeth II.”The Royal College of Art’s headquarters – along with the Royal College of Music – are in an area of London once known as Albertopolis, in memory of the royal spouse who played a bigger role than others in the development of the UK’s enduring cultural capital.Prince Albert was the driving force behind the Great Exhibition, staged in a custom-built Crystal Palace in Hyde Park in 1851 with the not inconsiderable ambition, according to Queen Victoria, “to promote among nations the cultivation of all those arts which are fostered by peace, and which in their turn contribute to maintain the peace of the world”.Despite the disapproval of critics including Karl Marx, who deplored it as an “emblem of the capitalist fetishism of commodities”, the self-financing extravaganza, which is said to have been visited by six million people, turned in a profit big enough to buy a swath of land in South Kensington for a new cultural quarter that would include the three great national museums on Exhibition Road and the Royal Albert Hall.It’s a mark of the decline of royal power that, while Albert could influence the shape of a city, Prince Charles has had to content himself with a model village, incarnating his ardent architectural philosophy in the Beatrix Potter cottages and Disneyland castles of Poundbury, a new town that was planned and developed at his command on 400 acres of Dorset land from 1989.But, though the capacities of this century’s royal patrons might be reduced, their credibility has greatly improved since the late 1980s, when National Theatre director Richard Eyre fought a valiant rearguard action against being landed with a royal charter. “The ‘Royal National’ nonsense has burst like a fat blister,” he wrote in his diary in June 1988. “I haven’t yet had to publicly defend it, and am not looking forward to having to lie in public … Neal Ascherson writes to me that ‘everyone is looking to you to stop this royal nonsense’.”Thirty years on, Ascherson – a leading Scottish author and academic – feels just as strongly. “I’m not a fanatical anti-monarchist,” he says. “What I fancy is a country with republican institutions which, if people wanted, could have an ornamental bobble-king on top, like the royal republic of Norway.” Ironically, given her propaganda wars with “the firm”, the change in public opinion was partly due to Princess Diana’s touchy-feely support of charities working in previously stigmatised fields such as support for people with Aids and leprosy. Hillier points out that the younger generation have continued that tradition by extending royal patronage into mental health, “which is not an area the royal family has supported in the past”. He cites their support for the Heads Together campaign – encouraging people to be more open about mental illness – which involves a partnership with existing charities to challenge this social taboo. In today’s celebrity culture, part of their value is their ability to pull in showbiz stars – as Prince William did for Heads Together with Lady Gaga last year. Their four-minute Facetime chat, filmed in Kensington Palace and Lady Gaga’s Hollywood kitchen, was part of a series of celebrity heart-to-hearts that are now on YouTube.But to what extent do these enthusiasms extend beyond celebrity to the arts themselves? Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, has concentrated on reading charities, with patronages including the National Literacy Trust and Book Trust. At the more glitzy end she’s become a regular at the Man Booker prize dinner, and will be hosting its 50th anniversary celebrations in July with a champagne reception at Buckingham Palace. Prince Charles – who has never sold himself as a great reader, though he’s known to love a spot of Shakespeare – discreetly backs (and personally attends) the Boswell book festival in the Scottish countryside. The boutique fiesta of biography and memoir takes place in Dumfries House – a Palladian mansion in Ayrshire that he rescued and restored, and which recently joined his School of Traditional Arts as part of the Prince’s Foundation.Prince Charles has never been one for public displays of emotion, but it won’t have escaped fans of Markle’s best-known TV role – paralegal Rachel in the series Suits – that one of her strongest suits is a capacity to emote to order. Social deprivation is likely to feature in her charity choices, with the arts as enablers. While Dumfries House is at the Chippendale end of royal patronages, it’s a fair bet that Markle’s furnishings will be more street than five-star suite.

The company paid £100m in 2017 for curtailment. This year payments are already down by two-thirds.Emma Pinchbeck, the executive director at industry group RenewableUK, said: “It is great news for everyone that rather than turning turbines off to manage our ageing grid, the new cable instead will make best use of wind energy.”Mary Creagh, Labour MP and chair of the environmental audit committee, said: “Billions of pounds of investment is needed in clean energy, transport, heating and industry to meet our carbon targets. But a dramatic fall in investment is threatening the government’s ability to meet legally binding climate change targets.”Separately, the spending watchdog concluded that £23bn spent on a government subsidy scheme for low-carbon heating had been poor value for money and did not deliver its aims. The public accounts committee said the renewable heat incentive had “wildly optimistic” goals and that the government failed to understand what consumers wanted."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/534c3c048403084c5418cb1258f9758be8d8cc31/0_0_1957_1174/master/1957.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7bf2b54300d21873e536deff92773e81","title":"timor lestes incredible marine life in pictures","story":"Situated in the heart of the ‘coral triangle’, this young nation boasts some of the most bioerse waters in the world.

Both players went on to play in the calamitous defeat against Iceland in Nice that signalled the end of England’s Euro 2016 campaign and prompted Hodgson’s resignation, though neither is particularly tainted by the sort of tournament failure that has come to haunt teams from this country.Wilshere’s career has been bedevilled by injury, which is how he came to lose his place at Arsenal after an impressive climb through the youth ranks, and the season he spent on loan at Bournemouth after Euro 2016 could be regarded only as a qualified success. Once he was no longer integral to Arsenal plans he was no longer guaranteed an England call-up either and, if he does drop out of the reckoning for the World Cup in Russia, it will simply be the culmination of several seasons of disappointment.When Wilshere first broke through he looked so cultured and comfortable that people were talking in terms of a century of caps, or at least being a fixture on the international stage for a decade or more, which amounts to more or less the same thing.At 26, with 34 caps, it is now beginning to look as if he may not reach 50. He has undoubtedly been unlucky with the timing of some of his injuries, though it could also be said he has not always made the most of his opportunities.He has seen players such as Dele Alli, Eric Dier, Raheem Sterling and Jordan Henderson establish themselves through being more forceful on the pitch. In all probability Wilshere would have made it to Russia only as a squad player in any case and in that capacity his claims are now being challenged by Jesse Lingard and Ruben Loftus-Cheek.Hart’s is a completely different story. Though occasionally error‑prone with England, just as with Manchester City, the goalkeeper might still be clocking up appearances for both had not Pep Guardiola arrived and decided his distribution was not up to scratch – not just his ability with the ball at his feet inside and outside the box, but his accuracy with goalkicks and long clearances.Guardiola sets high standards for goalkeepers he wants the complete package. Claudio Bravo, Hart’s immediate replacement at City, was hardly that – the Chilean was not in the England player’s league as a shot‑stopper – though now Ederson has been brought in with an immaculate range of goalkeeping attributes there are far fewer people arguing Hart has been harshly treated.Nonetheless the goalkeeper is at the moment looking for a club after failing to win a regular place at West Ham and not quite answering his critics when on loan at Turin the previous season.Hart has 75 caps and has just turned 31 – no age at all for a goalkeeper – yet more doors seem to be closing than opening and after very publicly failing to live up to the standards required by a succession of managers there must now be question marks over his confidence.Doubtless he could find a berth almost anywhere as a reserve goalkeeper, which is in effect what he became when on loan at West Ham, though the role does not suit everyone.If Hart wishes to continue in a first team, he may have to consider dropping down the league a little and finding a club who would be glad of his considerable experience.That might be hard to swallow for a player whose two league titles are still fresh in the memory, along with four golden glove awards from his time as No 1 at the Etihad Stadium, though it is already clear City have moved on. If Hart is to do the same, he needs to find regular football. With a bit of luck and the right club there may still be time left for a comeback."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a15f9496aab341b4a6d700239efc65ec59c512f/0_0_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63ac723a99a2b069f2e558130d79e43a","title":"sam allardyce sacked everton manager","story":"• Allardyce loses job amid supporter discontent• Former England manager had year left on contractSam Allardyce has been sacked by Everton after six months amid fan discontent. The manager had a further season on his contract.Allardyce was brought in last November with Everton on the fringes of a relegation battle and the team finished eighth. He failed to win over the fans, not least because of the style of play, and it comes as little surprise the major shareholder, Farhad Moshiri, has chosen to dismiss him.Marco Silva, the former Watford manager whom Everton targeted after sacking Ronald Koeman, is a leading contender to become the club’s new manager. “On behalf of the chairman, board of directors and Mr Moshiri, I’d like to thank Sam for the job he has done at Everton over the last seven months,” read a statement from the club’s soon-to-be new chief executive, Professor Denise Barrett-Baxendale. “Sam was brought in at a challenging time last season to provide us with some stability and we are grateful to him for doing that.“However, we have made the decision that, as part of our longer-term plan, we will be appointing a new manager this summer and will be commencing this process immediately. Again, we’d like to place on record our sincere thanks to Sam for his work with us over the last few months and wish him well for the future.”Allardyce was appointed after a dismal start to the season under Ronald Koeman and the caretaker David Unsworth, who won his final match to lift some of the pressure off Everton. The former England manager began with a promising sequence of results but problems began to mount after Christmas.His final match was a 3-1 defeat at West Ham, after which he did not sound optimistic regarding his chances of keeping his job. “I can’t quite say I’m confident,” he said.• More details to follow …"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37ed91d72db715495aa6427ca191eef3784d550e/823_27_2943_1766/master/2943.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dd6ae81ff84b97520a3b77452905fe04","title":"swansea relegation lament ownership ideal","story":"Swansea’s cooperative, supporter-led ownership ideal once admired in the game has also fallen through the trapdoor in resentful circumstancesA wider sadness surrounds Swansea’s relegation from the Premier League after an acrimonious couple of years than just the end of a romantic football flight. The “Swansea way” had more to it than the elegant style of passing football shaped through promotions by the managers Roberto Martínez and Brendan Rodgers.The cooperative, supporter-led ownership structure of the club was greatly admired and envied through the rise up the isions but it was fractured by the majority shareholders’ sale in 2016 to the US investors Jason Levien and Stephen Kaplan.That idealism and unity was shattered after the inidual partners made millions personally by selling their shares to Levien and Kaplan, while not including the supporters in negotiations.Swansea fans were not slow to understand the deal and, as Jenkins remained the chairman with the team struggling, home matches have been played to a regular accusatory chorus of “you greedy bastards”.Jenkins is considering stepping down from his position this summer. A possibility is that he will stay on for some weeks to help appoint a manager to replace Carlos Carvalhal then stand down. Levien and Kaplan are not putting Jenkins under pressure to leave but are considering the need for more structure to the recruitment of players than having Jenkins in effect running the whole football operation.After promotion to the Premier League in 2011, Jenkins and other directors began to be paid significantly for the first time and the shareholders were each paid idends totalling £4m from 2012‑15. They began to look at selling their shares but after the trust decided against selling to the US investors John Moores and Charles Noell, who eventually invested in Crystal Palace, Jenkins did not include the trust in his negotiations with Levien and Kaplan.Jenkins is now in conciliatory mood. “If, with the other shareholders, we could have done things differently, ensured the trust were on board with the sale, for the good of the club which would have benefited from a better atmosphere, I wish we had done that,” he said.Kaplan and Levien have not been criticised as vehemently as the former shareholders who sold to them, although some fans have voiced discontent at a lack of spending, after Levien and Kaplan paid so much to buy the club. When they took over, Levien said they would develop the club but never promised they would put their own money in to sign more players or expand the stadium.In February they did agree a new lease with the council, which they said would enable them to consider expanding the stadium. As part of the deal the club have committed to funding the construction of two new training pitches in Swansea for community use every five years.Swansea will look to make use of the £76m relegated clubs receive in parachute payments to try to bounce back to the Premier League but the club’s embodiment of an ideal is finished and there is plenty in that for football at large to lament."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b679df8a2b63c9a2dd0b8dd3b976d3e83517c4a5/34_212_5682_3409/master/5682.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=88763aaf548fd02a8c93af3e6a644f50","title":"its time for universities to make race equality a priority","story":"Universities say they are taking steps to promote BAME staff and address the attainment gap, but progress is far too slowWhen I was appointed director of Soas University of London in 2015, I was astounded to discover that I was the first person of African-Caribbean descent to head a UK university. Ever since, I find myself frequently asked why there is such a lack of black, Asian and minority ethnic representation in senior management in higher education.The problem lies in the fact that, despite university leaders’ rhetoric, there is a complacency within the sector which has led to a slow pace of change. There is a striking ergence between higher education positioning itself as inclusive and internationalist, and the limited progress on racial equality domestically. We need to admit that the problem is real. Most universities, in line with other sectors, have action plans and training programmes in place, but the figures show that whatever it is we are doing – or think we are doing – is not working. I know from my own experience that culture change is hard and takes time, but we cannot afford to carry on letting down future generations of BAME students, academics and staff. Achieving race equality is not an add-on. It must be a key part of our agenda going forward.Leaders in higher education today are busy navigating their way through a complex set of policy changes. We are dealing with the transition to the new Office for Students the impact of leaving the EU on student recruitment, staff retention, collaboration and research new measures to assess teaching quality a framework to score knowledge transfer and a review of HE funding and the impact of government anti-terrorism legislation. But amid the backdrop of these changes, where does the challenge of addressing BAME representation sit? What priority does it have? Is racial equality in universities seen as a fundamental business, ethical and moral necessity – or just as a nice-to-have? For me it has to be part of the core of what we do.In Britain we find it hard to talk about race and the impact that racism has on all of us. That’s because the conversation often immediately leaps into the territory of whether iniduals are racist – and it degenerates from there. Socially and institutionally we find it hard to acknowledge the historical legacy and the insidious, invidious impact of racism because it quickly descends into a blame game. As a black person I know how hard it is to explain the pernicious and debilitating impact of day-to-day racism. Many of us don’t talk about it but that doesn’t mean it‘s not there. We all experience and deal with it differently. We need to find a way to open up conversation and discussion about difficult, contentious and controversial issues.I am proud of the way Soas students and staff have engaged in conversations around decolonising knowledge. It is not an easy agenda to grapple with as we see from the derogatory headlines which sometimes follow this work. But it’s crucial that we do. For too long, knowledge, experience and expertise have been seen through a narrow lens. Yet knowledge is all about pushing the boundaries. The best scholarship reflects the range of experiences of people inside and outside of the UK.The term “decolonising knowledge” has provoked intellectual interest and curiosity as well as outrage. That’s partly because we find it uncomfortable to look deep into our national psyche and identity, questioning versions of our history. But the deep-seated and structural nature of race inequality needs to be tackled at a societal, institutional as well as inidual level. It’s about culture and relationships as well as about policy and process. The important thing is to have the debate, and though we won’t all agree, I see that as a good thing.There are deep-seated prejudices and stereotypes which need to be overcome. University leaders need to acknowledge that we are not doing enough. The UK has some of the best universities in the world – but what is the point of that if we are not offering real equality of opportunity?Join the higher education network for more comment, analysis and job opportunities, direct to your inbox.

Swap the bresaola for thin slices of smoked trout, which will work beautifully with the peas, and include a little thinly sliced cucumber, too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27ce2e03e5459af8e82f19568e2e5490324c6e1e/0_0_4984_2989/master/4984.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2a9c590cf33da62ef642adb20b23ead3","title":"acupuncture doesnt improve likelihood of ivf success study finds","story":"• Sign up to receive the top stories from  Australia every morningAcupuncture doesn’t improve the chances of women undergoing IVF having a baby, according to a study of hundreds of Australian and New Zealand women.The treatment is widely used but researchers for the latest fertility study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association on Wednesday, have cast doubt on its effectiveness.A total of 848 women across 16 IVF centres in Australia and New Zealand were given either acupuncture or sham acupuncture, administered prior to a fresh embryo transfer and also on the day of it, between June 2011 and October 2015.• Sign up to receive the top stories from  Australia every morningThe sham treatment involved placing a non-invasive needle with a blunt tip away from true acupuncture points.“These findings do not support the use of acupuncture to improve the rate of live births among women undergoing IVF,” the paper concludes.“The likelihood of a live birth was not statistically different between the two groups after adjusting for age, number of previous IVF cycles and participating IVF centre.”But the chief investigator, Caroline Smith, professor of clinical research at the National Institute of Complementary Medicine, said acupuncture might still be worthwhile.“Some studies suggest reproductive outcomes may be improved when acupuncture is compared with no treatment,” she said.According to the research, a “psycho-social benefit” from acupuncture was reported by women undergoing IVF.University of New South Wales Professor Michael Chapman, study co-author and president of the Fertility Society of Australia, said such benefits would be reported on in a future paper.“Feeling relaxed and reporting relief from stress and women feeling good about themselves is to be welcomed for women as they undergo an IVF cycle,” he said.Comment was being sought from the Australian Acupuncture and Chinese Medicine Association."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fec24107310c77f0e63c4aff9a0145a5721b1830/134_558_2155_1293/master/2155.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d3ebc9560b55ac84f9b0f9393ef873a8","title":"six of the best party cakes prince harry meghan wedding claire ptak","story":"Whether you’re celebrating Harry and Meghan’s wedding or a birthday, do it with this selection of festive cakes by royal wedding baker Claire Ptak125g unsalted butter, softened, plus more for greasing200g caster sugar3 eggs1 tsp vanilla extract1 tsp salt300g plain flour2 tsp baking powder160g whole milk6 tbsp raspberry jamFor the icing120g fresh raspberries500g icing sugar, sifted, plus 2 tbsp extra1 tbsp milk190g unsalted butter, softened½ tsp kirsch½ tsp lemon juiceYou will need a piping bag with a large round nozzle for this recipe. Heat the oven to 150C300Fgas 2. Grease and line a deep 20cm cake tin.Cream the butter and sugar until fluffy. Gradually add the eggs, vanilla and salt, and mix.In a separate bowl, whisk the flour and baking powder, then fold half into the butter. Add in the milk, then the remaining flour. Scrape the bottom of the bowl and mix once more. Pour into the prepared tin and smooth the top with a palette knife or spatula. Bake for 50-60 minutes. Leave to cool for 15-20 minutes, then remove from its tin by running a small paring knife along the inside of the tin to release the cake. Or, if you have used a loose-bottomed tin, set the base of the cake tin on top of a tin of tomatoes, or similar, and gently push the sides of the cake tin down.To make the icing, puree the raspberries with the two tablespoons of icing sugar, then strain. Transfer to an electric mixer. Add the milk, butter and 250g of the icing sugar, and beat on low for three minutes. Add the rest of the sugar and beat until the icing is light but holds its shape. Mix in the kirsch and lemon juice.Wash and dry the cake tin, and line with clingfilm with plenty lapping over the sides and set aside. Using a serrated bread knife (the longest one you have), score a horizontal line a third of the way up the side of the cake and then slowly cut the cake into thirds horizontally. Trim the top layer slightly if it is domed. Slide a tart tin base or cardboard disc between the bottom and middle layers of the cake, and lift off the top two layers on to a large plate. Slide the bottom layer of sponge into the lined cake tin and pipe a border of icing around the edge. Don’t worry if the icing touches the sides of the tin, as you are essentially creating a dam for the filling.Smooth half the jam over, and pipe a few stripes of icing on top. This acts as a glue to adhere one cake to another and it also creates delicious pockets of jam and icing between the layers.Put the middle sponge on top and repeat the above process. Top with the third sponge, pull up the sides of clingfilm and wrap up the cake. Chill for at least two hours, or overnight before removing from the tin to ice the top and sides.

Mix in the lemon zest, then beat in the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition.In a large bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder and salt. Mix half of this into the creamed butter mixture, scraping down the sides, until barely combined.With the mixer still going, beat in all the milk, then add the rest of the flour and mix until just combined. Scrape the bowl and give it one last mix.Scoop the mixture into the prepared tin and smooth the top with a palette knife or spatula. Bake for 50-60 minutes, until the top of the cake is springy and a skewer comes out clean.Meanwhile, make the lemon drizzle: in a small pan, heat the sugar, water and lemon juice until the sugar is just melted. Do not let it boil or it will lose its fresh flavour. While the cake is still in the tin, use a skewer to poke holes evenly throughout the baked loaf. Pour over the drizzle.To make the icing, in a small bowl, whisk the icing sugar and lemon juice until smooth. Take the cake out of the tin: run a small paring knife along the inside of the tin, then tilt the tin on its side and coax the loaf out, using the parchment as a handle. Peel off the paper and turn the loaf on your cooling rack or worktop. Drizzle with the icing and let it drip down the sides, then use a spatula or a cake or tart tin base to lift the loaf on to a serving dish.175g butter, softened, plus more for greasing175g light brown sugar2 eggsSeeds of 1 vanilla pod125g ground almonds175g wholemeal spelt flour2 tsp baking powder1 tsp salt200g halved cherries, or whole berries200g peaches or nectarines, sliced2 tbsp caster sugar, for sprinklingRose petals, for scattering (optional)For the icing (optional) 200g icing sugar1-2 tbsp rose waterHeat the oven to 160C325Fgas 3. Grease a 23cm cake tin with butter and line with parchment paper.First make the sponge. In an electric mixer, cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Add the vanilla and almonds, and mix to combine.In another bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder and salt, then gently beat the dry ingredients into the butter mixture.Spread the batter into the prepared tin and smooth the top with a palette knife or spatula. Scatter the cherries over the batter, then press the slices of peach into the top.Sprinkle with the caster sugar and bake for 60-70 minutes, until a skewer comes out clean and the top of the cake springs back to the touch. Let the cake cool in its tin for about 15 minutes before turning it out on to a serving plate.If using the icing, whisk the rose water into the icing sugar until smooth and runny. Drizzle this over the cooled cake, then scatter with garden rose petals, if you have them. This is best eaten on the day you bake it.100g unsalted butter, plus more for greasing 100g plain flour, plus more for dusting 1 tbsp honey2 tsp rose water100g caster sugar2 eggs 1 tsp baking powderFor the icing2-3 tbsp rose syrup 200g icing sugarYou will need a 12-hole madeleine tin to make these. First, prepare the tin. Melt a good amount of butter and leave to cool slightly, then brush it into the tin and dust with flour. Put the tin in your freezer for five minutes or so, then repeat the process – if you are using a silicone mould, you can omit this second step. Keep the tin in the freezer until you are ready to use it.Heat the oven to 160C325Fgas 3. In a heatproof bowl set over a pan of barely simmering water, carefully melt the butter, then take off the heat and leave to cool slightly. Add the honey to the butter to dissolve it, then add the rose water.In a bowl, whisk the caster sugar and eggs until smooth, then whisk in the melted butter mix. In another bowl, whisk the flour and baking powder, then whisk these dry ingredients into the egg and butter mix until smooth. Spoon the batter into the prepared tin.Bake for 10-12 minutes, until the madeleines have formed a peak in their middles and the tops spring back to the touch. Take out of the oven and leave to cool in the tin for a minute or two.Meanwhile, make the icing: whisk the rose syrup into the icing sugar until smooth and runny.Turn the madeleines out of the mould and dip them in the icing or drizzle over the top. Serve right away – they are best eaten within the hour. (Remember, you can make the madeleine mixture in advance and bake it just before you want to serve.)Butter, for greasing350g dates, pitted and chopped150g hazelnuts, toasted and chopped finely3 eggs1 tsp vanilla extract 50g caster sugar50g brown sugar200g oil140g plain flour2 tsp baking powder 1 tsp salt100g plain yoghurtFor the praline topping50g hazelnuts, toasted and skins removed50g water200g caster sugarFor the icing4 tbsp water 300g icing sugarHeat the oven to 160C325Fgas 3. Grease two 18cm cake tins with butter and line with parchment. Mix the dates and hazelnuts in a bowl and set aside.Using an electric mixer, whisk together the eggs, vanilla and sugars until light and fluffy. Keep whisking and slowly drizzle in the oil.In another bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder and salt. Add this to the egg mixture and whisk for a few seconds to combine. Whisk in the yoghurt, then fold in the dates and hazelnuts.Divide the mixture between the prepared tins and bake for 35-45 minutes, until the cakes are baked but not dry. The tops of the cakes will not spring back as much as other cakes do because the dates make the mixture moist and dense in the best possible way. Leave the cakes to cool in the tins while you make the topping.To make the topping, line a baking tray with parchment paper and spread the hazelnuts on the tray. Put the tray on your worktop, near the hob. Have your icing ingredients nearby, as they will be needed as soon as the caramel is ready.Put the water in a small, heavy-bottomed pan and sprinkle in the caster sugar. Bring to the boil and, just as the sugar starts to caramelise, pour half of it over the hazelnuts. Leave to cool and harden, then break into shards.To make the icing, add the water to the remaining caramel in the pan, then pour the runny caramel from the pan into the icing sugar and whisk to a smooth paste. Add more water or icing sugar until it has the consistency of soft buttercream. Spread the icing on the cooled cakes and top with the shards of praline.115g butter, melted, plus more for greasing90g plain flour1 tsp baking powder 50g ground almonds40g ground hazelnuts40g ground pistachios190g icing sugar5 egg whites, lightly whisked2 tsp vanilla extract200g fresh raspberries (about 40-50)50g slivered pistachiosIcing sugar, for dustingHeat the oven to 160C325Fgas 3.

When the UK leaves the EU, it will also leave Euratom, the civil nuclear energy regulator. A replacement system is being put in place. But Islam has seen the government’s internal risk register showing that there are five high level risks - marked red on a greenamberred scale.Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, has been giving a big speech on immigration policy this morning, prompted by the Windrush scandal. Here are the key points.The Windrush scandal goes to the very heart of Theresa May’s hostile environment policy – it was not accidental – it is a direct consequence of government policy.The next Labour Government will repeal all those parts of the immigration legislation that were introduced to support it. We will rescind all Home Office instructions to carry it out, and we will remove all obligations on landlords, employers and others to enact it.Under the Tories, services for the most vulnerable women in society have been slashed again and again. So today I am announcing that Labour will take the millions that are used annually to fund Yarl’s Wood and Brook House immigration detention centres, and put this directly back into services to support the survivors of modern slavery, trafficking, and domestic violence. Yarl’s Wood in particular has caused so much pain to vulnerable women that we should have been protecting. Diverting these resources directly to them is not only essential, but the right thing to do.This government and its predecessors have long had an obsession with enriching the private sector from the public purse. This is despite the costs, either financially, in shoddy service or in human misery.So now we have the grotesque spectacle of G4S being rewarded for failure at Brook House. A firm which oversaw the appalling, brutal treatment of detainees, and was exposed by Panorama, continues to be rewarded for their cruelty. It beggars belief.Labour will end this rotten system. Private firms have no business in detention.In the Irish parliament yesterday Leo Vardakar, the Irish prime minister, said that the British government’s “maximum facilitation” customs proposal - the one favoured by Tory Brexiters - would be less useful than a deodorant. He made the comment after alluding to its “max fac” nickname, and it was partly a joke - although one that also reinforced how unimpressed he is by London’s thinking on customs. He told TDs (members of the Dail):The customs partnership proposed by the United Kingdom last June would not be workable. That is very much the view of the task force and the EU27 and it has been rejected. I believe the customs partnership is closer to being made workable than the maximum facilitation proposal or max-fac which, as Deputy Joan Burton pointed out, I had thought was some form of make-up or deodorant. I have certainly not seen to date any detail that indicates that such a solution would be as functional as make-up or a deodorant. We are not drawing up any plan for a border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, full stop. There is not going to be one. I have made it very clear to my counterpart in the United Kingdom and the other EU Prime Ministers that under no circumstances will there be a border.Here’s the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg on Vardakar’s comparison.This is what Ed Balls, the former shadow chancellor, told the Today programme about the Harvard report he has co-authored (see 9.25am) saying the UK would not benefit from a post-Brexit trade deal with the US. So if the idea is you leave the customs union and get the free trade agreement and that will be better, our conclusion is that is a complete fantasy.Balls was also asked if he thought the UK should stay in the EEA after Brexit - the so-called Norway option, backed by the Lords and to be voted on by MPs in the Commons. He replied:What David Cameron failed to deliver, and what we need, is a deal which allows Britain to trade with our main trading partner but to have control over the way in which we manage our borders and migration. That is the only way in which we can have a proper deal. And an EEA-style deal which allows that to happen would be a step forward.Brexiters argue that the UK has to leave the EU customs union so that it can benefit from striking its own free trade deals with other countries and they generally argue that the biggest prize would be a juicy trade deal with the US. This led Michael Gove, in his rather sycophantic interview (paywall) with Donald Trump in January last year (when Gove was out of government) to ask for an assurance that the UK would be “at the front of the queue”. The UK was “doing great”, Trump replied elliptically, although Gove concluded that overall Trump was very positive about a deal.But a new study, published by the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, says the UK won’t benefit from such a deal. It may well never happen, and even if it were to be signed, the UK would have to make so many concessions it could become politically unacceptable.Six authors have contributed to the report but one of them will be very familiar to readers - Ed Balls, the former shadow chancellor and now a research fellow at Harvard.Here is the conclusion:Despite the enthusiasm expressed by politicians on both sides of the Atlantic, officials directly involved, and experts with experience of such negotiations, express scepticism that a deal of any significance can be achieved ...Here are three quotes from sources quoted in the conclusion.Senior UK government official: “Personally, I am very doubtful about the ability of both governments to work through the domestic politics and political challenges of this deal.” Professor Larry Summers, former US Treasury secretary: “It is delusional to think that a US-UK trade deal will happen anytime soon. It is simply not possible.” And here is table 1, the chart from the report setting out the reasons why a good free trade deal is highly unlikely.Balls was on the Today programme talking about this. I will post some of his quotes soon.Here is the agenda for the day.9.30am: Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, gives a speech on immigration.10am: Sir Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, launches the Lib Dem campaign in the Lewisham East byelection.10.30am: Former MI5 director general Lord Evans of Weardale and former GCHQ director Robert Hannigan give evidence to a Lords committee about post-Brexit security cooperation.10.45am: Karen Bradley, the Northern Ireland secretary, gives evidence to the European scrutiny committee about Brexit.12pm: Theresa May faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs.2.15pm: Jeff Silvester, chief operating officers for AggregateIQ, gives evidence to the Commons culture committee as part of its fake news inquiry.After 3.30pm: Peers have their final debate (the third reading) on the EU withdrawal bill.Around 4pm: MPs begin a debate on a Labour motion that, if passed, would force the government to publish all its internal papers on its two proposed customs options.

Not for the first time the England and Wales Cricket Board promised “fresh ideas” and Smith duly delivered some that were genuinely fresh, coherently explained and rationally justified, unlike one or two other membersemployees of the board in recent times.He was also remarkably relaxed in his new role. He can articulate with the best of them indeed he sounded rather like his recent Australian counterpart, John Inverarity, who first bounced Smith on his knee at Tonbridge almost 40 years ago. He was enthusiastic and accommodating.“That’s a good question”, he said several times to his former colleagues everything would be “terrific”. His was a polished debut in front of the press – he even managed to exit the room just as a question about The Hundred was being framed.Smith has broken with convention – though he kept stressing that “we” or “the selection panel” were responsible for the erting list of 12 names chosen for the Lord’s Test – by selecting someone who has not encountered a red ball this year. This is a risk. But it is not a ridiculous one. He has long admired Jos Buttler and there is no doubting the wicketkeeper batsman’s talent or temperament he knows and likes the grand occasion. But there is the problem that he has recently been programmed to hit every ball he receives for six or four, which he has been doing regularly for the Rajasthan Royals in the Indian Premier League.Buttler, while encouraged to play with freedom, will have to rediscover how to bat in a Test match – in a Test match at Lord’s. This is quite an undertaking but trusting in “a unique talent” and defying old truisms meets personal approval.Indeed Smith’s selections have brought a smile especially to the West Country. Even though the word “Lancashire” appears after the name of Buttler in the list, most of his fans in England reside west of Bristol, where he was born. Now having mourned the cruel injury to Jack Leach in the nets at Taunton on Monday, those fans can also celebrate the rapid elevation of Dom Bess out west.If this is not the case already, Bess might soon become the best off-spinner to come out of Blundell’s School in Tiverton and Somerset CCC for half a century or more. He has played only 16 first-class games, most of them on turning pitches at Taunton (or in Bridgetown, Barbados, where he took eight wickets for MCC in the match against Essex in March as well as hitting a century). Two or three years ago he was moving from Sidmouth CC in Devon to Exeter CC partly in search of more bowling opportunities. Now a Test match at Lord’s beckons – he is bound to play if the sun stays out.Bess was quick to commiserate with Leach, who has been a source of much sound advice for him over the last two years. In fact he is almost the polar opposite of Leach as a cricketer. Leach is a methodical man, who has improved by dint of much hard graft as a batsman and fielder as well as a bowler. Bess, who made his debut for Somerset in a two-day game against Pakistan in 2016, is more of an instinctive sportsman and a natural athlete. If the force is with him, things happen.He is a clean striker of the ball, who would bat above Stuart Broad in this team he will certainly raise the standard of England in the outfield, where he buzzes and is capable of the odd breathtaking moment. So far he has never seemed overawed, though Lord’s will represent the highest hurdle yet.In Somerset’s recent game against Hampshire at Taunton Bess struck a breezy 92 and propelled 41 overs, taking the solitary wicket of Rilee Rossouw in the first innings for 77 runs. He bowled with sound control, admittedly against batsmen set upon saving the game in the second innings when most of his deliveries were at James Vince, who may have produced the most mature innings of his career and certainly his longest (514 minutes). Bess has already shown he is not intimidated by bowling on a turning pitch (some spinners are) there is less evidence about how he fares on a flat one. However he is always up for the challenge and his debut will be an exciting moment, not just for those in Devon and Somerset.Indeed the announcement of this squad prompts a smile and a spring in the step it represents the most cheerful thing to come out of the ECB this summer. A month ago Smith was unlikely to be the man to provide fans with eager anticipation. This season your correspondent has occasionally railed against The Hundred and the plans for domestic cricket to no great effect. Now on consecutive days Colin Graves, albeit unwittingly, seems to have been more effective in providing reasons to reconsider the ECB’s ship of the game. Meanwhile Smith, trusting his gut rather than the data (though he is “interested in data”), has, by making two bold selections, invigorated the summer of 2018. The first Test should be fun for young and old alike."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b72d937ed45600eee0bfc9a17e68da42aff16fc8/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=761b8314eff254cc3f43301ab61692da","title":"say it aint so joe how 1919 informs americas entire worldview on gambling","story":"A society’s century-long distrust of sports betting can be traced to the night of 21 September 1919, when the Black Sox went nationalAmerica’s century-long distrust of sports betting can be traced to the night of 21 September 1919. That’s when several members of baseball’s Chicago White Sox clandestinely met in first baseman Chick Gandil’s room at New York’s Ansonia Hotel and conspired with gambling boss Arnold Rothstein to throw the following month’s World Series.The scandal that unraveled after the White Sox’s sluggish five-games-to-three loss to the Cincinnati Reds hurled into the fire the innocence of a nation and led to the appointment of baseball’s first commissioner: Kenesaw Mountain Landis. It also created a firm distaste for any implication that sports were somehow compromised. History forgets the eight players involved were found not guilty on charges of conspiracy to defraud, or that the whole scandal came to pass because the White Sox owner Charles Comiskey was a notorious cheapskate who treated his players poorly. The players were banned for life and the World Series fix forced US sports to send a strong message that gambling was not to be tolerated.“Everything after that was summed up in one phrase: For the integrity of the game,” says Brett Smiley, the editor of sportshandle, a website that covers the American sports gambling industry. While legal sports gambling has thrived in most countries, it’s long been considered taboo in the US, characterized as a murky industry operated by mobsters. Sports that permit gambling – like thoroughbred racing, greyhound racing and jai alai – are often cast as enterprises surrounded by shady personalities. Sports leagues have vigilantly policed their members, squashing any attempts to associate their teams with betting. State and federal legislatures have passed laws banning sports gambling. For years, Nevada was the only state where sports gambling was legal, only furthering the image of sports betting as a sleazy business best left with the other sins found in Las Vegas. By overturning the 1992 Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act on Monday, the US Supreme Court wiped out 99 years of anti-gambling sentiment in American sports, allowing each state to decide if they want to legalize sports gambling. Considering that the America Gaming Association estimates that at least $150m is illegally wagered on sports in the US each year, many states are eager to forget old edicts against sports gambling. New Jersey, which brought the lawsuit challenging the Pasa, and West Virginia are among the states expected to quickly enact laws opening an industry most-often associated with Vegas casinos. Others will follow.The legalization of sports gambling will be a significant culture change for many Americans. Ever since the 1919 White Sox, forever branded as the Black Sox, sports leagues and institutions have worked hard to portray betting as an evil that must be fought. Occasional scandals in which college basketball players were caught point shaving (intentionally missing baskets to keep the score below a bookie’s desired total) were treated as high crimes. Pete Rose, who has more major league hits than any other player, is nearly three decades into a lifetime ban for betting on baseball while he played for the Cincinnati Reds.No league, however, has been as vigilant about eliminating connections to gambling than the NFL. In his book, America’s Game: The Epic Story Of How Pro Football Captured A Nation, Michael MacCambridge tells how NFL commissioner Bert Bell moved quickly in 1947 to suspend New York Giants players Merle Hapes and Frank Filchock when the two were suspected of fixing a playoff game – primarily to engendert the impression that the league was serious about policing gambling.“Professional football can’t continue to exist unless it is based on absolute honesty,” MacCambridge quotes Bell as saying at the time. “The players must not only be absolutely honest they must be above suspicion. In short, the game and its players must be kept free of corruption.”The irony of the NFL’s stance is that the league was built on gambling. As MacCambridge points out, two of the NFL’s most powerful early owners, New York’s Tim Mara and Pittsburgh’s Art Rooney, had been involved in gambling enterprises (Mara as a onetime bookmaker and Rooney as a horse track owner). Much of the league’s popularity comes from a once-a-week schedule that turns each Sunday’s games into big events making it easy to bet on them. A boom of new fans in the 1990s coincided with the rise of fantasy leagues that gave people who might not have otherwise watched football a reason to watch the games. Still, the NFL and other leagues pushed a storyline that linked sports betting to mobsters.President John F Kennedy and his brother Robert, the US attorney general, were fearful that organized crime was building too strong a grip on sports gambling they made controlling it an early priority. They urged Congress to pass several laws, most-importantly, 1961’s Federal Wire Act, banning the use of phone lines for transmitting bets. The anti-gambling facade remained until the last decade, when a lust for money challenged the need to maintain a veneer of purity. As states like Connecticut found a windfall in the rise of casinos on native tribal lands and others relaxed regulations against large casino chains, they realized they could be making even more from sports betting. New Jersey’s leaders felt particularly penalized by the Pasa as Atlantic City fell farther being Las Vegas in prominence. Sports leagues also realized they were losing millions by not embracing fantasy sports. When teams cut deals with daily fantasy companies like DraftKings, the old resistance to gambling began to wane. By the time New Jersey appealed an overturn of the Pasa to the Supreme Court, it seemed only a matter of time before the leagues who had fought gambling for decades were ready to cash in themselves. The stigma of betting as a domain of the mob wore away. That 1919 meeting in Chick Gandil’s room at the Ansonia Hotel started to seem like, well, 100 years ago.

Brando and Tasleet, though, are both very solid opponents, as Brando has the benefit of a run – and win – under his belt already this season and Tasleet showed his liking for this track and trip when successful in this race 12 months ago. Harry Angel could be a bit of a tearaway in his three-year-old career, and followed Group One wins in the July Cup and Haydock Sprint Cup last season with a below-par fourth behind Librisa Breeze in the Champions Sprint at Ascot, where he failed to settle and faded in the final furlong. Tasleet finished in front of him there and is likely to be the one to benefit if Harry Angel (3.30) is again too free on his seasonal debut, but Cox feels his sprinter has matured over the winter and anything close to his best form from last year would probably be good enough. Aidan O’Brien’s increasing preference for Chester as a testing ground for Epsom prospects has nibbled away a little at York’s reputation as the home of the best trials for the Derby and Oaks, and Sariska, in 2009, was the last Musidora Stakes winner to follow up in the Oaks. John Gosden has supplied the last three winners, including Star Of Seville, who went on to take the Prix de Diane (French Oaks) at Chantilly, and his runner Highgarden could well start favourite despite being one of only two in the field that did not manage a win last time out. She has also run both her races to date on soft ground so today’s faster surface is an unknown, and Ceilidh’s Dream (4.05), who looked much improved when winning at Newmarket first time up, could offer better value at the likely odds. Hamada is the favourite for the 12-furlong handicap which opens York’s season but his stable companion Banksea (2.20) has a similar chance on form and is more than double his price. George Bowen (2.55) has won off a higher mark than today’s 89 and looked close to his best at Doncaster last time, while Three Saints Bay (4.35) was a ready winner over six furlongs at Pontefract last time and has winning form over seven as a juvenile. Tallulah’s Quest (5.25) and Salt Whistle Bay (4.25), who beat the subsequent Victoria Cup winner Ripp Orf last time out, should both go well at Yarmouth, while Edge (7.25) made a solid return to turf at Salisbury last month and could be overpriced at around 9-1 on the evening card at Bath.

The characters and beats come from a kind of theatre that steadfastly refuses to go out of style, no matter how stale it is.But something is strange about the words coming from these mouths on stage. The sentences, while technically complete, veer off on weird tangents. There is no witty dialogue here if the lines are funny it is because of their nonsense. But playwright Roslyn Helper can be forgiven. She wrote the play with the help of artificial intelligence.Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noonSo if AI is the way of the future, is it the way of theatre?Lifestyle, a play presented by Next Wave festival and Melbourne Knowledge Week, suggests not. The “artificial” of AI sits heavily on the work it’s amusing for its glitches rather than its sense. But as AI encroaches on our day to day lives, it will increasingly make its way into the art world. So how will it be used? And what does it mean for how we understand art?AI is a learning system. To create AI artists, humans will need to select the information the system learns from. So while AI is nominally intelligent and separate from humans, its algorithms are built through the lens of human bias. We are currently seeing a distinct white male bias in AI. Not surprisingly, the history of western theatre is also one of white male bias.Lifestyle isn’t the only work in Next Wave to be thinking about this robot future. Bureau of Meteoranxiety is an installation piece acting as satire on contemporary mindfulness and self-care, and our disconnection from nature and fears about climate change. As part of the work, you are invited to talk with an AI chatbot, Gail, about your weather-based anxieties. While she often seems to answer a question that is slightly different from the one you actually asked, there is something strangely comforting about this discussion of weather. Yet Gail’s female name (most chatbots, in a position of subservience, have female names) hides the male influences that have gone into her. In my discussion with her she quotes (uncredited) the work of male poets and then, gallingly, Donald Trump.By using AI in this artistic context, the artists encourage us to view the technology through a critical lens. The Bureau, and Gail, feel like services people might very much want to use, but if we did, whose biases would we be fed? For that matter, whose biases exist in the AI we increasingly use? If AI becomes the artist, how will we know to look at who created the AI? Who is the creator’s creator?But if this future was supposed to be an allegory for how robots will make our lives dull, it fell down at the first hurdle, as I watched audience members during the performance pull out their phones to amuse themselves. The technology of today has long surpassed the imagined technology of tomorrow.Perhaps AI art is only as interesting insofar as you know what has gone into its creation. Little is said about how SwiftKey, the AI that co-wrote Lifestyle, was specifically used, but the strange beginning of the work pays off when Helper and director Harriet Giles break out of the mould of traditional theatre: the cast dance screens show us the predictive text used to write the work the world dissolves further and further into the creative imagination of performance – which can only ever be truly realised through human collaboration.Next Wave has long held the edict of asking artists to be as ambitious as possible, so it is only natural that the artists of today, in their ambition, ask what AI can do for them. For the moment, the artists seem to be coming out on top. • Bureau of Meteoranxiety is showing in Melbourne until 19 May.

Now Prasanna Puwanarajah is on stage at the National, starring opposite Benedict Cumberbatch in Patrick Melrose – and even writing his own sci-fi showIt was nine years ago that Prasanna Puwanarajah last worked on a hospital ward – he went from there to rehearsals for Twelfth Night at the Royal Shakespeare Company. In the previous two years, he had been working as a jobbing actor, writer and director, and as a doctor – going wherever he was needed in the NHS, and fitting in auditions, making a couple of short films, directing some plays, in between. He had been deferring a training post in reconstructive surgery, and at some point, though he never really made a definitive decision, he just never went back to medicine.We meet at the National Theatre, where Puwanarajah is appearing in Absolute Hell. There is still something doctorly about his manner – the steady voice the careful, analytical responses. The National is a place that proved instrumental in his career change. “I’d done a show at the Arcola,” he says, “and I was heading back to the NHS. I got auditions at the RSC and then at the National. I came here and did four shows and wrote a play, over the course of a year and a half. It felt vibrant and exciting and possible.” Puwanarajah’s career has been steady, but at the age of 36, he is powering forward with an impressively broad slate of projects. His most high-profile TV role to date was as Suranne Jones’s bewildered boyfriend in the last series of Doctor Foster. Now he is playing opposite Benedict Cumberbatch in Patrick Melrose, Sky Atlantic’s adaptation of the Edward St Aubyn novels. He’s about to appear in the forthcoming BBC comedy legal series Defending the Guilty, will direct two plays – one at Rada, another in Edinburgh – and (hopefully) a feature film, set in Northern Ireland. Then, he’s co-creating and writing a sci-fi series for a US network with Line of Duty writer Jed Mercurio. Nearly a decade after abandoning a stable career, he must feel vindicated.Both his parents, who moved to the UK from Sri Lanka, worked in the health service – his mother a drug and alcohol dependency psychiatrist, his father a dentist. Theatre wasn’t a big part of Puwanarajah’s childhood – he remembers going to the pantomime once as a child. Then he appeared in a couple of school plays. “I didn’t want to, but I remember vividly the surprise of enjoying the experience and enjoying the collective activity,” he says. As a teenager, he tried out for a place at the National Youth Theatre and the man auditioning him asked him why he wanted to be an actor. “I said ‘I don’t, I’m going to be a doctor’.” He got in, probably, he says with a laugh, on the basis that his answer intrigued them. The following year, during the summer break from medical school, he was back to do one of their shows. “I think out of 14 people in the show I was the only one who didn’t get any phone calls from agents and I was like, again, not fussed: ‘That makes perfect sense.’ I was pretty sure that Planet Acting doesn’t need someone like me.” He smiles. “I mean a brown person.”He is wary of the idea of “colourblind” casting. “I just don’t think we’re colourblind people,” he says. “My experience has not been of people being blind to it.” To skip through a few of Puwanarajah’s experiences may feel a bit superficial, but it makes his point: as a child, he was threatened for wearing an England football shirt in an operating theatre once, a colleague told him his English was surprisingly good a few weeks after the Brexit vote, he was told by two men, on the street in the middle of the day, to “fucking go home”.

Producers will announce on Wednesday that Matthew Lopez’s play The Inheritance, directed by Stephen Daldry and with a cast including Vanessa Redgrave, will open at the Noël Coward Theatre in September.It will be pleasing news for the many people who have tried, and failed, to get tickets for a play that has had stellar reviews as well as huge amounts of positive buzz on social media. “At the risk of sounding a little hackneyed … it is a dream come true,” said Lopez, responding to the news. “It is exciting and gratifying to know that the play is going to have another life and enable more people to come and see it.”The play, due to complete its short run at the Young Vic this week, has attracted some of the most glowing reviews of the last year. Michael Billington wrote in the  that it “pierces your emotional defences, raises any number of political issues and enfolds you in its narrative” and Dominic Cavendish in the Daily  described it as “perhaps the most important American play of the century so far”.The piece is inspired by EM Forster’s Howards End. Lopez said he fell in love with the book when he saw the Merchant Ivory film of it when he was 14, but could never quite understand why it made such a connection or why he kept rereading it.“I always questioned what it was about Howards End that spoke to a young kid growing up in the panhandle of Florida,” he said. Things fell into place more than a decade later when Lopez discovered that Forster was gay.He had the idea of transporting the Edwardian story to modern-day New York, but only began writing it in earnest three years ago.“It has always been with me sometime or other. I’ve always been waiting for the time … I think I just needed to wait to get to know myself a little better.”Lopez said it was the most personal thing he had written. “The only way I knew to write this was specifically, the world I knew, the community that I belonged to and the men who have come in and out of my life as friends, as partners, as lovers, over the years.“To my great delight and astonishment really, people have been expressing to me how universal they feel the play is.”Lopez said he had trimmed the play and that it would be closer to six and a half hours by the time of its opening in the West End, with people able to see it in two parts over the same day or on different nights. That is still long, though, and may put off some people. Others, used to binge-watching Netflix, might not think it long enough.“The idea of going into a long play is not for the faint of heart,” said Lopez. “But people are finding it funny and not quite so arduous as they might have feared.”Having one of the world’s best stage and screen directors on board clearly helps the production and it was a link-up that happened purely because Lopez and Daldry shared the same agent. It was Daldry who suggested the Young Vic as a venue and pitched it to his friend David Lan, who said yes and staged it as one of his last productions as artistic director.“Now that we’ve been through this experience, I can’t imagine starting it anywhere but the Young Vic,” said Lopez. “It is woven into the DNA of the play.”• The Inheritance begins previews at the Noël Coward Theatre on 21 September.

These can be mundane – football, Manhattan or dogs, for instance – or more esoteric.A  investigation in conjunction with the Danish Broadcasting Corporation found that Facebook is able to infer extremely personal information about users, which it allows advertisers to use for targeting purposes. Among the interests found in users’ profiles were communism, social democrats, Hinduism and Christianity.The EU’s general data protection regulation (GDPR), which comes into effect on 25 May, explicitly labels such categories of information as so sensitive, with such a risk of human rights breaches, that it mandates special conditions around how they can be collected and processed. Among those categories are information about a person’s race, ethnic origin, politics, religion, sex life and sexual orientation.The information commissioner’s office says: “This type of data could create more significant risks to a person’s fundamental rights and freedoms, for example, by putting them at risk of unlawful discrimination.” Organisations must cite one of 10 special dispensations to process such information, such as “preventive or occupational medicine”, “to protect the vital interests of the data subject”, or “the data subject has given explicit consent to the processing of those personal data for one or more specified purposes”.Facebook already applies those special categories elsewhere on the site. As part of its GDPR-focused updates, the company asked every user to confirm whether or not “political, religious, and relationship information” they had entered on the site should continue to be stored or displayed. But while it offered those controls for information that users had explicitly given it, it gathered no such consent for information it had inferred about users. The data means an advertiser can target messages at, for instance, people in the UK who are interested in homosexuality and Hinduism – about 68,000 people, according to the company’s advertising tools.Facebook does demonstrate some understanding that the information is sensitive and prone to misuse. The company provides advertisers with the ability to exclude users based on their interests, but not for sensitive interests. An advertiser can advertise to people interested in Islam, for instance, but cannot advertise to everyone except those interested in Islam.The company requires advertisers to agree to a set of policies that, among other things, bar them from “using targeting options to discriminate against, harass, provoke or disparage users, or to engage in predatory advertising practices.”In a statement, Facebook said classifying a user’s interests was not the same as classifying their personal traits. “Like other internet companies, Facebook shows ads based on topics we think people might be interested in, but without using sensitive personal data. This means that someone could have an ad interest listed as gay pride because they have liked a Pride-associated page or clicked a Pride ad, but it does not reflect any personal characteristics such as gender or sexuality.” The company also said it provided some controls to users on its ad preferences screen. “People are able to manage their ad preferences tool, which clearly explains how advertising works on Facebook and provides a way to tell us if you want to see ads based on specific interests or not. When interests are removed, we show people the list of removed interests so that they have a record they can access, but these interests are no longer used for ads.”It added: “Our advertising complies with relevant EU law and, like other companies, we are preparing for the GDPR to ensure we are compliant when it comes into force.”The findings are reminiscent of Facebook’s previous attempts to skirt the line between profiling users and profiling their interests. In 2016 it was revealed that the company had created a tool for “racial affinity targeting”.At the time, Facebook repeatedly argued that the tool “is based on affinity, not ethnicity”. Discussing a person who was in the African American affinity group, for instance, the company said: “They like African American content. But we cannot and do not say to advertisers that they are ethnically black.”Almost a year later, after it was revealed that advertisers could use the ethnic affinity tools to unlawfully discriminate against black Facebook users in housing adverts, Facebook agreed to limit how those tools could be used."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a333b16936f96b91a2f6e310e0705fa4c3b3ad3a/0_39_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3020faa9b778a60688225749605eda89","title":"julian assange ecuador london embassy how he became unwelcome guest","story":"He has been in the Knightsbridge building for six years, but his departure looks ever more likelyby  Luke Harding,  Stephanie Kirchgaessner and  Dan CollynsIn June 2012, a tall, mysterious figure turned up at the Ecuadorian embassy in London. He rang the bell, walked in and asked for political asylum.It was Julian Assange. Days earlier, he had lost his long legal fight against extradition to Sweden, where two women accused him of rape.Soon afterwards, the left-leaning then president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, agreed to Assange’s request, precipitating a major diplomatic row with the British government. And a full-blown siege. politan police officers swarmed outside the building, ready to arrest Assange should he venture out.It was against this febrile backdrop that Correa authorised a secret programme named “Operation Guest”. It was later renamed “Operation Hotel”. The guest was Assange, politely referred to as el huésped.The goal, at first, was to stop detectives bursting into the modest ground-floor embassy and dragging Assange away. But documents seen by the  show it developed into something more complex. The aim seems to have changed from protecting Assange – which propped up WikiLeaks in the process – to spying on him.Whatever its aims, WikiLeaks was able to keep going up to and beyond its role in the 2016 US presidential election, with all the seismic consequences. It was WikiLeaks that published hacked emails belonging to the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and senior Democratic officials, leading to claims that it was part of an alleged Kremlin plot to undermine Hillary Clinton and help Donald Trump.How WikiLeaks got the emails in the first place is an enduring mystery.Did someone drop them off to Assange on a flash drive? Were the files uploaded on to an encrypted remote server? Or did they come in by some other route?Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating allegations that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to win the election, is looking for the answer. The secret records seen by the  and the magazine Focus Ecuador may give him important new clues.According to the documents, the counter-espionage effort began nearly six years ago when a team secretly installed CCTV cameras in the Ecuadorian embassy. They covered the entrance lobby, a meeting room and the mini-balcony from which Assange would periodically address supporters. The agents filmed everyone who came in and out, and kept watch on the street.Security personnel worked two-person shifts and were on duty 24 hours a day. They do not appear to have recorded Assange’s conversations, documents suggest. However, they were able to observe him closeup, noting his moods, habits and sleeping patterns.Julian Assange has been in the Ecuadorian embassy in central London since August 2012. He initially sought asylum following a series of legal challenges through British courts to a European arrest warrant issued by Sweden, where he was accused of rape and sexual assault, which he denies.In February, a judge upheld a warrant for his arrest for skipping bail, meaning that although Swedish prosecutors have\u0026nbspdropped their investigation into alleged sexual offences, Assange faces being arrested if he leaves the embassy, and fears he would be subsequently extradited to the US for questioning about WikiLeaks’ activities.None of this came cheap.The documents set out how Ecuador’s intelligence agency, known as Senain, hired an international security company. Its bill in 2012 was $55,000 (£40,000) a month, paid from a “special expenses” government budget.They detail how the company’s agents slept 100 metres (330ft) away from the embassy, in a multi-tenant Edwardian mansion block in Basil Street. Unbeknown to Ecuadorian taxpayers, the operatives were camping out in one of the most expensive parts of London, albeit in a basic basement flat with two bedrooms, which cost £2,800 a month.From a control room, the security team oversaw Assange’s contacts. They consulted with him about anyone wanting to visit. If he agreed, guests were allowed in. They were met in the foyer, went through a security check, and handed over their passports and mobile phones.The documents show that operatives wrote down passport numbers, nationalities and the purposes of the visits. These included “social reunion”, “medical”, “legal” or “VIP”. They clocked when the guest arrived and when they exited, in the early months past a phalanx of armed police waiting in uniform on the embassy’s front steps. At the beginning of the crisis, when the small Andean nation was facing off against the might of the British state, officers lurked on the interior stairs and next to the embassy toilet. Every month, the security company sent a confidential list of Assange’s visitors to the Ecuadorian president. There were additional “extraordinary” reports. Sometimes, the company included stills from secret video footage of interesting guests, plus profiles and analysis. They also reported when a packet of sweets was lobbed on to the balcony, seemingly a present for Assange. It is these visitor logs that will interest Mueller. He is reportedly close to indicting Russian hackers allegedly behind the raid on the Democrats’ electronic servers and seems to view WikiLeaks as an integral part of the Kremlin’s multifaceted espionage operation. The FBI has interviewed at least one source close to Operation Guest, it is understood.Assange has refused to say how the emails got to WikiLeaks. He denies they came from a “state actor”. The FBI does not appear to believe him. Giving evidence last year, the agency’s then director, James Comey, told Congress that Moscow was behind the DNC cyber-raid. An “intermediary”, he said, passed the emails to WikiLeaks.Assange’s relationship with Moscow is certainly longstanding. In 2011, he signed a deal with the Kremlin-owned television network RT. The Julian Assange Show featured 10 guests, including Correa. Weeks after Assange’s interview with Correa was broadcast, the Australian sought refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy.The logs record that Assange had more than 80 visitors in one month in 2016. They included the WikiLeaks staff member Sarah Harrison and longtime supporters such as Craig Murray, the UK’s former ambassador to Uzbekistan. Another was the Croatian philosopher Srećko Horvat.There were also visits from Assange’s lawyer Gareth Peirce and Vaughan Smith, the founder of the Frontline Club, who hosted WikiLeaks at his Norfolk mansion for 13 months up until Assange jumped bail. On 23 June 2016, RT broadcast a referendum special from inside the embassy, with the final guests leaving at 4.30am.The external surveillance team wrote up descriptions of these encounters. They were sent back to Senain and Correa, sources say. The then Ecuadorian foreign minister, Ricardo Patiño, visited Assange in London, talking with him into the early hours, and criticised Britain for failing to find a solution to the standoff. The UK was unmoved. Asked what the government planned to do about Assange, the then foreign minister, Hugo Swire, said: “Not my stone, not my shoe.”Correa had no immediate comment on the operation. He has previously decried the UK’s attempts to arrest Assange, saying his country would not tolerate “colonialism of any kind”. Meanwhile, leaked invoices show the Ecuadorian government spent as much as $28m on surveillance equipment, sold only to states. What it was used for and by whom is unclear.By 2014, it appears tensions over Assange were growing. The documents reveal that Ecuador’s then ambassador to the UK, Juan Falconí Puig, forwarded a complaint to Senain after a bill arrived for unpaid council tax from Kensington and Chelsea. The tax was payable on the agents’ clandestine flat in Basil Mansions. Falconí had no idea it existed. He rang Patiño, demanding to know what was going on, according to sources in Quito.That autumn, the security consultants reported that Assange had somehow set up his own secret communications network. Moreover, they said he had “violated” the embassy’s computers and was apparently reading confidential diplomatic traffic, the company reported. Embassy staff apparently kept their personal files on Assange in a safe – the one place he could not access.The head of Ecuadorian intelligence, Rommy Vallejo, held a meeting with Patiño to discuss the Assange situation and the “risks” he posed to embassy staff. Over time, Assange came to take up more than one-third of the embassy’s ground-floor space. Initially, he slept in narrow room next to the balcony. He subsequently colonised a back room as a bedroom and occupied half the kitchen. Assange’s unkempt realm was home to WikiLeaks and its computers, and was entirely private. There was no CCTV. It was off limits to diplomats, the rooms only accessible via special codes.Patiño brushed off these concerns. His solution to this internal takeover was to dispatch three undercover intelligence officers from Quito to increase security, documents show. The Assange bill was already causing friction with Ecuador’s financial chief. The new state agents cost an extra $35,000 a month, paid out on top of the security company’s monthly invoice, which had climbed to $97,000.Documents show the private security team’s duties included keeping an eye on Hans Crescent, the street outside the embassy. It reported demonstrations in support of Assange, noting that they became smaller each year. There was a strange visit by an American superfan who spent two days outside the embassy sleeping in a car. Protesters who took part in an anti-Correa demonstration were surreptitiously photographed. One one occasion, the team sent back images of a young man in a suit whom they deemed suspicious. Much of their job involved monitoring British police officers stationed outside. Scotland Yard later scaled back its presence outside the embassy and withdrew officers altogether in 2017, when Sweden dropped its investigation into alleged sexual offences, which Assange has always denied.In November 2017, the team filed an “extraordinary” 10-page report on a visit by two Catalan separatists, Oriol Soler and Arnau Grinyó. The meeting might “trigger criticism” from Madrid if it leaked, they concluded. Assange tweeted that same day in support of Catalan secession.Over time, Ecuador’s counter-espionage operation became mundane. In January, the agents noted that a new cleaner had started work. Typically, Assange would hold private conversations in the women’s bathroom, they wrote in a daily log. Visitors noticed that he used a “squelch box”, a counter-surveillance device that emitted a loud sound.Letters arrived for him, as did flowers, the agents noted. The flowers were thrown away “according to protocol”. Sometimes, Assange smoked a pipe. His mood was generally placid. On occasion, there were angry eruptions, sympathetically interpreted by the agents who could understand his frustration after being in the embassy for such a long time. The agents faithfully recorded visits from Bolivia’s former foreign minister, as well as such high-profile guests as Pamela Anderson, Vivienne Westwood and Yanis Varoufakis. Early this year, Assange’s most frequent visitor was the legal analyst Stella Morris, a member of his legal team.Journalists and film-makers have been frequent guests. They included the ’s Ewen MacAskill, who visited twice in January and February to discuss Assange’s confinement and his prospects for the future.In February, there were no more visits recorded for two weeks. This barren spell was marked across a line as “sin visitas”.Friends conceded that after almost six years in the embassy, Assange was visibly suffering, and in poor health, although they described him as mentally robust. At weekends, embassy staff go home, leaving him with no one to talk to apart from a solitary guard.The logs do not explain how WikiLeaks received the 70,000 Democratic emails that had been hacked.By the spring of this year, developments in Quito had moved in an ominous direction for Assange. Ecuador’s president, Lenín Moreno, pronounced him a costly “inherited problem” and made it clear that he viewed Assange as an obstacle to better relations with the US.As a candidate, Donald Trump praised WikiLeaks when it revealed embarrassing Democratic party secrets. When Assange released the email correspondence of the Clinton aide John Podesta, Trump exclaimed: “I love WikiLeaks.” Before and after the election, Donald Trump Jr exchanged a handful of direct Twitter messages with Assange.Seemingly, the Trump White House changed its view when Wikileaks dumped out classified CIA hacking tools. The agency’s then director, Mike Pompeo, who was later made secretary of state, dubbed WikiLeaks a “hostile intelligence service”.In March, Assange’s internet access was cut off. A jammer was installed to prevent him from accessing emails. For more than a month, he has been forbidden visitors. Friends say he is passing the time by reading. They say he is leafing through books on the US election, which WikiLeaks did so much to influence and – its critics allege – subvert. Meanwhile, Correa, Assange’s protector and patron, has moved to Belgium. He has since landed at job at RT.Last week, the embassy appeared deserted. Nearby, well-heeled passengers emerged from Bentleys and Mercedes outside Harrods. Six supporters held banners that said “Free Assange” and #ReconnectJulian. A violinist serenaded him from the pavement. There was no sign of the guest, but the window next to his balcony was open.Assange faces a tough choice. If he walks out of the embassy, he can expect arrest and could spend up to a year in prison for breaking his bail conditions.The US might then seek to extradite him. He would contest any attempt, and might win, but would face a long, uncomfortable spell behind bars while his case is decided.Ecuadorian government sources say Quito is considering a plan for where Assange might go next. Russia would be an obvious choice, though this would cause problems with the US. Cuba and Venezuela are also said to be under discussion. Since January, Assange has officially been an Ecuadorian diplomat. However, this probably would not stop the UK arresting him if it had the chance.If Assange remains in the embassy, cut off from the world, WikiLeaks cannot function. Either way, it is clear that Ecuador no longer wants him. His future is more uncertain than ever. The most likely scenario is that he will soon walk out the door."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/540d8c66cb277f3b3516059b414e65cf778ac75a/0_117_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c47a77662b1d4b9e31831b2d7fa4a643","title":"forces women using chinese ride hailing app to change profile photos","story":"Users also switch listed gender to male after the stabbing to death of a 21-year-old and revelations that drivers review female users for their appearanceWomen using China’s largest ride-hailing platform, Didi Chuxing, are changing their profile photos after the death of a female passenger and revelations that drivers have been reviewing female users based on their appearance.Last week Didi apologised and closed its ride-sharing service, Hitch, after a 21-year-old woman was found dead, half naked with more than 20 stab wounds, in the central Chinese city of Zhengzhou. Police suspected her driver, a 27-year-old man whose body was found in a river in the same city at the weekend. Didi said the man had stolen the profile of his father to use the app.On Weibo, women have begun posting new profile photos that range from pictures of male relatives and stock photos found online to images of Thanos, a villain in Marvel’s Avengers series. Many changed their listed gender to male. Hitch, a cheaper carpool service, is one of Didi’s most used services. A 20-year-old university student in Sichuan identified only by the surname Wang said her mother asked that she change her picture. Wang’s profile, previously a photo of her standing demurely by the word “Gal” painted on a wall, now features a heavily tattooed young man. Most of her friends have changed their profiles too. Others have been advised by their parents to take self-defence classes.Chinese media have reported that a little-known function on the ride-sharing app allowed drivers to leave comments visible to other drivers about passengers. Tags include descriptions like “goddess” or “natural beauty”. Wang said that drivers left reviews describing her as “sweet looking.” One driver reviewed a female passenger as “long legged and hot as hell”, according to Caixin, a Chinese financial news publication.The incident reflects persistent sexism toward female commuters in China’s cities. After the Hitch incident, China’s state-owned broadcaster CCTV issued advice for women using ride-hailing apps. In a brochure including an image of a woman in high heels and rolling a small suitcase while hailing a cab, authorities advised women not to take a car late at night, to remote or unfamiliar places, or alone. The ad also advised women not to “chat too much” with drivers.Didi said in its statement last week it would review its operations and the identities of its drivers. It has not said anything about the reviews of passengers based on their appearance. The company did not respond to requests for comment from the .“After the accident, there are many people sharing their bad experiences using Didi and it seems that Didi hasn’t responded to those complaints,” Wang said.Additional reporting by Wang Xueying"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3b64635eb2fb5df81fdc9d73a7f26d1668ff7af/0_173_2766_1660/master/2766.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c7474be451055fbc44ceefd46927726","title":"sherpa guide conquers everest for record 22nd time","story":"Kami Rita, 48, from Nepal had held previous record of 21 successful ascents with two fellow guidesA veteran Sherpa guide has scaled Mount Everest for the 22nd time, setting a record for the most climbs of the world’s highest mountain.Kami Rita reached the summit on Wednesday morning with a team of foreign climbers and a fellow Sherpa guide, and was already safely descending to a lower camp by the afternoon, said Gyanendra Shrestha, a government official who is stationed at the base camp.The 48-year-old was among the three men who had held the previous record of 21 successful ascents of the 8,848m peak.Before leaving for the mountain last month, he told the Associated Press he wanted to scale Everest at least 25 times.Mountaineering runs in his family. His father was among the first professional guides after Nepal opened to foreign trekkers and mountaineers in 1950. His brother has scaled Everest 17 times. Most of his male relatives have reached the top at least once.Kami Rita first scaled Everest at 24, and has made the trip almost every year since then. He has also climbed many of the region’s other high peaks, including K-2, Cho-Oyu, Manaslu and Lhotse. In the autumn, he guides clients to smaller peaks in Nepal.The other two summit record-holders are also Sherpas. Apa, a 58-year-old guide who uses only one name, retired in 2011 and moved to Utah. Phurba Tashi, 47, retired from high-altitude climbing in 2013 but still works at Everest’s base camp, helping organise expeditions.Dozens of climbers are expected to reach the summit on Wednesday, taking advantage of the good weather on the mountain, according to Shrestha.The route to the summit was opened up by a team of Sherpas earlier this week.

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillDr Peter Boylan has strongly defended an assertion that a clear majority of members of the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists support repeal of the Eight Amendment.Dr Boylan is the chairman of the institute and has also been a leading campaigner for the Yes vote.He has repeatedly said that the 80 per cent of institute members back repeal.This week an internal row has emerged as to whether Dr Boylan’s views are representative of the institute. Seventeen obstetricians based in the south and south west wrote to Dr Boylan saying his position as chairman was incompatible with advocating on the issue.The obstetricians, based in Cos Cork, Tipperary and Kerry, wrote that as the “public face” of the institute he should refrain from public advocacy. The letter said Dr Boylan should “temporarily stand aside as chairperson” if he wished to continue to campaign.The letter said the view of its signatories was that the institute should reflect the ersity of opinion by not campaigning on either side.Dr Boylan, a former master of the National Maternity Hospital, responded that he was being asked to stand aside at a time “he was standing up for Irish women and getting them the proper treatment”.He said the letter was rushed out to the media before he got a hard copy of it. “Now that is playing dirty,” he said.The assertion that four-fifths of obstetricians in the institute back repeal has been challenged by some obstetricians campaigning for a No vote, and by the Love Both campaign.Dr Boylan told The  yesterday that 18 or 19 members of the institute’s national executive had backed repeal at a meeting which specifically discussed the referendum earlier this year.He also referred to a Survey Monkey form which was distributed to all members of the institute, seeking their views on the referendum and on its related proposals for reform. He said that 79 or 80 members responded, of whom 81 per cent supported repeal.According to its website, the institute has “close to 200 members, who are experienced consultant obstetriciansgynaecologists and leading experts in their fields”.Dr Trevor Hayes, an obstetrician campaigning for a No vote, last night contended the institute was more ided on the issue than the results of the survey indicated.He said that there was a tight timeframe to respond to the survey and added he did not believe its findings were representative of the institute as a whole. He based this on his view that fewer than half of its members had responded.Dr Hayes said Dr Boylan was a highly respected obstetrician but he should not be campaigning as chairman of the institute as he was “taking a solo run”.Love Both spokeswoman Dr Cora Sherlock said the letter from obstetricians was “an indication that he does not speak for all professionals involved in the care of pregnant women in Ireland”.Get the latest news and best analysis ahead of the Eighth Amendment referendum here-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3496712.1526418510!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord repealing angels have something to hide at leinster house","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tReferendum posters advocating Yes and No outside  Government Buildings in Dublin. Photograph: Getty ImagesA flying column of angels arrived at the gates of Leinster House just in time for Leaders’ Questions.They stayed outside. The Dáil is no place for angels, even if some of the politicians who inhabit it could give them lessons in how to dance on a pin.Large of feathery wing, they marched whiteously up Kildare Street and flapped into position near the wide pavement’s edge. The women formed a third line of silent protest in front of a back row of hugely magnified and luridly enhanced images of foetal remains. It was a strange scene.Representatives of a Tipperary-based group called the Irish Centre for Bioethical Reform (ICBR) – an offshoot of an American anti-abortion organisation – had lined up against the railings and put these giant banners on display.In front of them two young men held up a large rainbow flag, partially obscuring one graphic image. Two more beside them were shaking out what looked like a bedspread in advance of lifting it into position. Members of the Students Union of Ireland had hoisted a long banner in front of another blown-up print. Some Sinn Féin staffers came out and held up the letters Y-E-S, further eclipsing the repellent displays.And ahead of them stood the young women with the angel wings, wearing red “Repeal” hearts over their own hearts, further distracting from what was going on along the back wall.There has been a cat and mouse game around Dublin city in the past few weeks between the ICBR silent protesters and a stalking group of similarly silent protesters dedicated to blocking the abortion images they have been hawking around places like maternity hospital entrances.Back outside Leinster House, the anti-abortion campaigners also produced two smaller posters in an effort to thwart their determined adversaries. They started screwing aluminium rods together, like they were going to assemble a gazebo, until they had poles long enough to shove their bloodied images higher than everything else.“If this wasn’t so awful, it’d be very funny,” remarked one onlooker.What with the hoisting activities, the horrible images, the camouflaging efforts, the rosary beads women on the periphery, the earlier arrival of an amiable group of Grandfathers for Yes and the later turnout of angels, the photographers and TV camera people were delighted.Just over a week to go now to polling day. As TDs entered their penultimate week in the Dáil before the vote you could sense the atmosphere becoming a little more strained, emotions a little more heightened.There was much talk around the corridors about the previous night’s referendum debate on Claire Byrne Live, the conduct of which dismayed quite a few proponents of a Yes vote, who felt the anti-abortion panellists, with the help of very vocal and passionate supporters in the audience, had steamrollered their pro-choice opposition with a combination of confident answers and a crushingly combative style.On the other side – and the Dáil has a very substantial number of TDs who do not support repeal – there seemed a definite change of mood. They had a pep in their step and radiated a quiet satisfaction.\u0026nbspOne of the main reasons the repealers were feeling sore was because they felt obstetrician Prof Peter Boylan was “taken out” of Monday night’s debate by what they perceived to be a concerted onslaught of criticism and contradiction from the anti-abortion side.On the other hand, Independent TD Mattie McGrath, a leading light of that campaign, was not letting up on the charge started on television the night before. He also zoned in on the what he called inaccurate claims by medical experts, referencing a call by a number of doctors in the SouthSouthwest Hospital Group for Prof Boylan to step aside from his position as chairman of the Institution of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.He said that for the past two weeks two of the country’s senior medical professionals have been “endlessly repeating dangerous and reckless comments” in the referendum debate but “the Taoiseach will not stand up to them because they support his view in the upcoming referendum”.For his part, Leo Varadkar said he had hoped the debate would not become personalised, and until now it had remained largely respectful.“I deeply regret that some people have now chosen to try to personalise the campaign in regard to Dr Peter Boylan. Dr Boylan has the right to his view, just as doctors or former judges on the No side have the right to their view.”McGrath took umbrage at “a grossly offensive” remark by the Taoiseach last week where he said people who oppose repealing the Eighth Amendment were “turning a cold shoulder” to victims of sexual violence. This, he declared, was untrue and unfair.Varadkar noted how McGrath raised the issue of care and compassion, saying he had yet to hear from anyone, including the aforementioned Deputy, about how they care for and show compassion for the victims of sexual violence he had just mentioned.Victims “such as a 13-, 14- or 15-year-old girl who may have been raped by her father, grandfather or uncle, and is bleeding and in pain. What answer does the Deputy offer her?”The independent TD for Tipperary didn’t really have one.“You have no right to lecture us. We have compassion. Many organisations and agencies which I support assist victims of sexual violence on an hourly basis. We want more compassion, not the taking away of the last vestige of support for the unborn child – not a foetus – in the womb. We wish to maintain life from conception to end of life.”But they don’t want her to have the choice to end that pregnancy.Get the latest news and best analysis ahead of the Eighth Amendment referendum here-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3496683.1526417987!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"top health officials knowledge of cervicalcheck policy revealed","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDr Tony Holohan, chief medical officer at the  Department of Health, is due to appear before the Oireachtas health committee today. Photograph: Eric LukeThe Government’s chief medical officer and other senior Department of Health officials had a deeper knowledge of the CervicalCheck policy on informing women affected by cancer test audits than previously known, newly released records show.The documents confirm the chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan and others were advised in October 2016 about CervicalCheck’s policy on informing women with cervical cancer that their cases had been the subject of an audit.Clinicians were told to use their judgment as to whether the outcome of the review should be communicated to patients and asked to consider whether the release of the information would do more harm than good.In cases where the woman had died, CervicalCheck said to “simply ensure” the result was recorded in the woman’s notes.This policy was made known to senior officials within the department, the documents confirm. They also reveal the department was informed of the potential of legal cases, including by a woman who subsequently died.It is the first time that the documents show discussions around open disclosure – HSE policy since 2013 – and about whether it should be followed when it came to telling affected patients about the outcome of the review into their cases.“While CervicalCheck supports the principles of open disclosure, it is recognised that there are limitations to its universal implementation, particularly for screening services where there is an inherent recognised error rate,” a note from June 29th, 2016 said.In draft letters prepared by CervicalCheck to the clinicians of the affected women, it was implied there was no obligation on the clinicians to disclose the information.Labour TD Alan Kelly said the documents confirmed there was an awareness in the department about the audit and its policy on the communicating the outcome.Mr Kelly also questioned the decision of Dr Holohan not to inform Minister for Health Simon Harris about these memos when the controversy first erupted two weeks ago.The same point was raised by Sinn Féin TD Louise O’Reilly, who said Dr Holohan was in receipt of vital information but chose to withhold it from the Minister. Dr Holohan and the secretary general of the Department, Jim Breslin are due to appear before the Oireachtas health committee on Wednesday.Vicky Phelan and Stephen Teap are expected before the Public Accounts Committee at 5pm. Ms Phelan won a €2.5 million settlement after she received incorrect smear test results which failed to diagnose her with cervical cancer. Mr Teap’s wife Irene was diagnosed with cancer in 2015 and died last year after two undisclosed false tests in 2010 and 2013. It emerged last month that at least 162 women with cervical cancer had not been informed about the audit results and past false tests. Of 209 women who could have had earlier intervention in light of false tests, 18 have died.Meanwhile, the documents also confirm CervicalCheck warned the department in March 2016 of “a risk of negative publicity and international reputation” in communicating reviews showing revised smear test results to clinicians of affected patients.In a report shared with the department, the screening service said there was an inherent risk in having a clinical audit process as part of a national programme and this “has to be balanced by the benefit of continuous quality improvement”.The department said it believed that affected women were going to be told about the results of the review. Neither Mr Harris nor Taoiseach Leo Varadkar were made aware of the existence of the memos, the department has said.-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Unclear if Pyonyang intends to scuttle all diplomacy and cancel June 12th talksPyongyang takes action after calling military exercises between allies a provocationChina keeping close eye on references to territories from Taiwan to TibetProcess demanded by West already \u0026lsquowell under way\u0026rsquo, says monitoring website\u0026lsquoWhen I looked over . . . half of my co-pilot\u0026rsquos body was hanging out of the window\u0026rsquoEight-year-old survives explosion in Surabaya, a day after 13 killed in similar attacksSydney Letter: Much of the growing concern is from coming from people wondering how their children are ever going to be able to afford a house in Sydney, Melbourne or other state capitals\u0026lsquoWhat Chairman Kim will get from America is our finest \u0026ndash entrepreneurs, risk-takers, capital providers\u0026rsquoIsis inspired attacks in Surabaya wound at least 40 people at three churchesPyongyang to take action as part of build up to summit with Donald TrumpLeaked flight manifesto showed Najib Razak was due to leave on a private jet to JakartaCandidate Fidelis Magalh\u0026atildees represents next generation in country still dominated by revolutionary leadersSecurity, neutrality and control of public gatherings drove choice for June 12thNew PM Mahathir Mohamad says king is willing to pardon rival turned allyBodies of three adults and four children found near tourist town of Margaret RiverTeaching English in China can be tricky affair due to unregulated agenciesMahathir, the oldest elected leader in world, ends ruling coalition\u0026rsquos six-decade reignUS president promises \u0026lsquospecial moment for world peace\u0026rsquo when leaders meet on June 12thSome of over 100 protesters in Almaty carried banners saying \u0026lsquoFreedom to political prisoners\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquoStop torture\u0026rsquo"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3496696.1526416638!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"north korea cancels talks with south putting us summit in doubt","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNorth Korea’s leader Kim Jong-un shakes hands with South Korea’s president Moon Jae-in at the military demarcation line that ides their countries last month.  Photograph: Korea Summit Press PoolAFPGetty ImagesNorth Korea has abruptly cancelled high-level talks with South Korea scheduled for Wednesday and placed a doubt over next month’s planned summit in Singapore between its leader Kim Jong-un and US president Donald Trump. Delegations from North and South had been due to meet on Wednesday in the village of Panmunjom in the demilitarised zone separating the two countries. But North Korea’s Central News said Pyongyang had no choice but to suspend the talks, calling ongoing US-South Korean military exercises a “provocation”. In an ominous sign for the upcoming meeting between Mr Trump and his one-time foe Mr Kim, South Korea’s main news agency reported that North Korea had also threatened to cancel the June 12th summit with the US. The US “will have to undertake careful deliberations about the fate of the planned North Korea-US summit in light of this provocative military ruckus jointly conducted with the South Korean authorities,” South Korea’s Yonhap news agency quoted North Korea as saying. Addressing reporters shortly after the announcement, the spokeswoman for the US State Department said it had received no information from North Korea about plans to cancel the summit. “Kim Jong-un had said previously that he understands the need and the utility of the United States and the Republic of Korea continuing in its joint exercises,” Heather Nauert said, noting that the exercises were legal and planned well in advance. “We will continue to go ahead and plan the meeting between president Trump and Kim Jong-un.”The surprise cancellation of Wednesday’s meeting came less than 24 hours after Pyongyang had convened the talks, which aimed to build on the progress of the historic April 27th summit between Mr Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in. Delegations from North Korea and South Korea had been expected to travel to the demilitarised zone. The development comes after a period of unprecedented engagement between the US and North Korea. Last week, three US detainees who had been imprisoned in North Korea were released and secretary of state Mike Pompeo made his second visit to the North Korean capital in six weeks in preparation for next month’s summit. Satellite images appear to show that North Korea has begun closing its nuclear testing site at Punggye-ri. The foreign ministry said that it would invite journalists to witness the closing later this month.The so-called “Max Thunder” military drills are an aircraft-only series of drills conducted annually by US and South Korean forces, involving about 1,500 military personnel. About 23,000 American troops are stationed in South Korea and regularly partake in military drills with South Korean troops.Mr Trump has staked his foreign policy reputation on the forthcoming summit with North Korea, welcoming the apparent thaw in relations between the two countries. Mr Pompeo said over the weekend that the US would provide economic investment to North Korea if the country signed up to denuclearisation, though he stressed that this would involve “complete verifiable irreversible denuclearisation of North Korea”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3497139.1526452131!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"north korea has no interest in one sided meeting with us","story":"North Korea has thrown into question the summit between Kim Jong Un and  Donald Trump scheduled for next month, denouncing military exercises between South Korea and the United States as a provocation and calling off high-level talks with Seoul.\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA US  Air Force F-22 Raptor fighter jet flies in Gwangju, South Korea. Photograph: ReutersNorth Korea has no interest in a summit with the United States if it is going to be a “one-sided” affair where it is pressured to give up its nuclear weapons, the country’s first vice foreign minister said.Earlier North Korea cancelled a high-level meeting with South Korea and threatened to scrap the historic summit next month between US president Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un over military exercises between Seoul and Washington.The surprise declaration, which came in a pre-dawn dispatch in North Korea’s state media, appears to cool what had been an unusual flurry of outreach from a country that last year conducted a provocative series of weapons tests that had many fearing the region was on the edge of war.It is still unclear, however, whether the North intends to scuttle all diplomacy or merely wants to gain leverage ahead of the planned June 12th talks between Mr Kim and Mr Trump.The statement by North Korea’s Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) was released hours before the two Koreas were to meet at a border village to discuss how to implement their leaders’ recent agreements to reduce military tensions along their heavily fortified border and improve their overall ties.It called the two-week Max Thunder drills, which began Monday and reportedly include about 100 aircraft, an “intended military provocation” and an “apparent challenge” to an April summit between Mr Kim and South Korean president Moon Jae-in, when the leaders met on their border in their countries’ third summit talks since their formal ision in 1948.KCNA said the US aircraft mobilised for the drills include nuclear-capable B-52 bombers and stealth F-22 fighter jets, two of the US military assets it has previously said are aimed at launching nuclear strikes on the North.South Korea’s Defense Ministry said the drills will go on as planned.“The United States must carefully contemplate the fate of the planned North Korea-US summit amid the provocative military ruckus that it’s causing with South Korean authorities,” the North said on Wednesday.“We’ll keenly monitor how the United States and South Korean authorities will react.”North Korea’s first vice foreign minister, Kim Kye Gwan, later released a separate statement saying Pyongyang has no interest in a “one-sided” summit.He criticised recent comments by Mr Trump’s top security adviser John Bolton and other US officials who have been talking about how the North should follow the “Libyan model” of nuclear disarmament and provide a “complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantlement”.He also took issue with US views that the North should also fully relinquish its biological and chemical weapons.“We will appropriately respond to the Trump administration if it approaches the North Korea-US summit meeting with a truthful intent to improve relations,” he said.“But we are no longer interested in a negotiation that will be all about driving us into a corner and making a one-sided demand for us to give up our weapons and this would force us to reconsider whether we would accept the North Korea-US summit meeting.”Some analysts say bringing up Libya, which dismantled its rudimentary nuclear program in the 2000s in exchange for sanctions relief, would risk derailing any progress in negotiations with the North.Kim Jong Un took power weeks after former Libyan leader Moammar Gaddafy’s death at the hands of rebel forces amid a popular uprising in October 2011. The North has frequently used Gaddafy’s death to justify its own nuclear development in the face of perceived US threats.Annual military drills between Washington and Seoul have long been a major source of contention between the Koreas, and analysts have wondered whether their continuation would hurt the detente that, since an outreach by Mr Kim in January, has replaced the insults and threats of war.Earlier — and much larger — springtime drills, which Washington and Seoul toned down, went off without the North’s typically fiery condemnation or accompanying weapons tests.South Korean called North Korea’s move “regrettable” and demanded a quick return to talks.Seoul’s Unification Ministry spokesman Baek Tae-hyun said the North’s decision goes against the spirit of last month’s inter-Korean summit, where the Koreas’ leaders issued a vague vow on the “complete denuclearisation” on the Korean Peninsula and pledged permanent peace between the rivals.In Washington, the US State Department emphasised that Mr Kim had previously indicated he understood the need and purpose of the US continuing its long-planned exercises with South Korea.State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said the US had not heard anything directly from Pyongyang or Seoul that would change that.“We will continue to go ahead and plan the meeting between President Trump and Kim Jong Un,” Ms Nauert said.Army Colonel Rob Manning said this current exercise is part of US and South Korea’s “routine, annual training program to maintain a foundation of military readiness.”Col Manning, a Pentagon spokesman, said the purpose of Max Thunder and exercise Foal Eagle - another training event - is to enhance the two countries’ abilities to operate together to defend South Korea.“The defensive nature of these combined exercises has been clear for many decades and has not changed,” said Col Manning."},{"url":null,"title":"national geographic travel photographer year 2018 pictures","story":"The competition continues in the 2018 National Geographic Travel Photographer of the Year contest!

It\u0027s going to be a very special day for everybody.The Duke of CambridgeThe two get along wellPrince William may be on hand to walk his brother\u0027s bride down the aisle.He would likely be a good source of support for Meghan Markle, as the two have conducted Royal engagements together and appear to get along well.The Duke of Cambridge has also been through the pressure of a very public Royal Wedding, so would perhaps be able to calm any jangled nerves.Violet Von Westenholz, the matchmaker behind the Royal couple, at a Tatler party with Prince Harry\u0026#39s friend Guy PellyAn admittedly long shot, but if the couple do not pick a family member, a friend of Prince Harry may be a good bet.Guy Pelly has been a friend of the Prince and his brother since they were children, and is connected to the matchmaker who set the Royal couple up on their first date.He is friends with Violet Von Westenholz, who the  revealed as the Cupid who brought the pair together.

David Conner while the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, will officiate as the couple make their marriage vows.Pioneering American bishop, the Most Rev Bishop Michael Curry, from Chicago, Illinois, has been invited to deliver the address as the couple strive to reflect their transatlantic relationship amid the tradition of St George\u0027s Chapel.Bishop Curry, who has been praised for his infectious laughter and self-deprecating humour, is the first African-American bishop to have served as the Episcopal Church\u0027s presiding bishop, a role he has held since November 2015.The music will also have an American influence according to Christopher Warren-Green, who will conduct musicians on the day.Ms Markle, who was a UN women\u0027s advocate, is unlikely to opt to obey the prince. The couple will probably choose the Series One (1966) Book of Common Prayer ceremony, just as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge did, which allows the bride to drop obey him and serve him from the religious proceedings.The regiments Prince Harry served with in Afghanistan will a have a “special place” during the ceremony.The 3 Regiment Army Air Corps, where the prince served as an Apache Pilot in Helmand Province will be represented, as well as The Royal Gurkha Rifles, his comrades in Afghanistan in 2007, and RAF Honington, where he is Honorary Air Commandant.Household Cavalry troopers will line the staircase at St George\u0027s Chapel, while streets within the precincts of the castle will be lined by members of the Windsor Castle Guard from 1st Battalion Irish Guards, and by Armed Forces personnel from the Royal Navy Small Ships and Diving, which has the Prince as Commodore-in-Chief, and the Royal Marines, where he is Captain General.Read more about St George\u0027s Chapel here.It has been announced that Prince William will be Prince Harry\u0027s best man. The decision means the Duke, who is President of the Football Association, will not attend the FA Cup final, which is happening on the same day as the wedding.Scheduled to start at 17:15, the FA Cup final will see Chelsea and Manchester United go head to head for the title. Windsor Castle is about an hour\u0027s drive from Wembley Stadium, which would have taken the Duke of Cambridge away from the proceedings for at least two hours.The Duke’s own stag do is reported to have been held on a Devon estate, Hartland Abbey, where he and close friends indulged in drinking, clay pigeon shooting, surfing and games.Prince Harry went on to tease his brother mercilessly during a none-the-less heartfelt best man’s speech at the wedding reception, allegedly wearing a fez, mimicking the lovestruck conversations between a young Kate and William, and ridiculing his bald spot.Royal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan MarkleSt George\u0026#39s Chapel: Inside the Windsor Castle venue for the royal weddingDambusters 75th anniversary: How the Second World War raid unfoldedDoria Ragland, Meghan Markle\u0026#39s mother, now expected to walk her down the aisle - who else could it be?  Meet Meghan Markle\u0026#39s family: The yoga teacher, the diplomat and the cannabis farmerProcession route map for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s wedding day - where to spot the royal coupleMeghan Markle: The American actress and newest addition to the royal familyInside St George\u0026#39s Chapel: The Windsor Castle venue where Prince Harry will marry Meghan MarkleHow to watch Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s royal wedding this SaturdayHow Prince Harry and Meghan Markle met - a look back at the matchmaker who started the couple\u0026#39s royal romanceWhat royal titles will Meghan Markle and Prince Harry have after the wedding?Royal wedding guest list: Here\u0026#39s who has received an invite from Harry and MeghanWhat time are Prince Harry and Meghan Markle getting married?

He made an untidy search of a bedroom while children were in the bath in the next room. A £30,000 Rolex stolen in the raidThe suspect fled having stolen a £30,000 rose gold Rolex watch as well as cash and bank cards.Thursday, April 12 at 9.20pm in Cottesmore Gardens, W8The intruder got in through a bedroom window minutes after the family had gone out. He activated the house alarm, but managed to escape with jewellery worth £20,000 including a 1950s vintage men\u0027s Rolex watch and foreign currency.Saturday, April 14 at 8.10pm at a flat in Palace Gardens Terrace, W8The female victim was out and came home to find the burglar had got inside through a high fourth-floor window and stolen cash and jewellery worth around £35,000. The stolen items included sentimental pieces that belonged to the victim\u0027s late mother a solitaire emerald-cut diamond engagement ring with a stone around two carats and on a platinum band and a vintage women\u0027s Omega watch.The victim, who is offering a reward of up to £40,000 for the safe return of her mother\u0027s engagement ring and watch, said: This burglary has made me feel very sad. The fact that someone came into my house uninvited and rifled through my possessions is distressing.The items which were stolen were of huge sentimental value as they belonged to my late mother. She wore the ring and watch every day and they have been in our family for more than 70 years.”Monday, April 16 at 10.40pm in Victoria Road, W8While the victim, her husband and children were at home, the suspect broke in through an upstairs window to steal around £185,000 of designer bags, including Hermes, Louis Vuitton and Kelly.The victim said: I was at home with my husband and children when this man broke in. It is truly horrible to think someone was rummaging through our property as my husband and I were downstairs unaware of what was going on and my children were sleeping nearby. It has made us all feel really nervous about being in our home, a place where we should feel safe. I would ask anyone with information about this man to please come forward and speak to the police as soon as possible.Saturday, April 21 at 9.05pm in Brunswick Gardens W8The homeowner was abroad, but via the property\u0027s security cameras saw the burglar jumping over a rear garden fence and getting into the house through open patio doors. He rummaged through a dressing room with the homeowner\u0027s children and nanny on the floor above, but might have been disturbed as he left without stealing anything.Detective Constable Eve Kelly, of the politan Police, said: The man behind this spate of burglaries is organised and diligent and has targeted wealthy properties with great care. Waiting until it is dark, he climbs into gardens looking for opportunities to scale walls and climb roofs and drainpipes. Once inside, armed with a torch and a rucksack, he takes his time looking through cupboards and drawers.He is not afraid to break in when families are at home, although I must stress he takes care not to be seen and has not physically harmed anyone. On one occasion he ransacked a property while the family including two young children were in the house and another time he was seen on camera creeping around while children and a nanny were in the house hiding in the bathroom having been alerted to his presence. The homeowner was abroad but checked in on his children via cameras in the house and was understandably horrified by what he saw. The suspect would have been aware that children were in the house due to the noise they were making.CCTV image of a suspect wanted over raids in which the intruder climbed into gardens and then scaled walls, roofs and drainpipesDet Con Kelly added: The value of the property stolen amounts to hundreds of thousands of pounds and includes items of highly sentimental value which are irreplaceable. This type of crime has a huge impact on not only the victims and their families, who no longer feel safe in their own homes, but upon the local community who are worried he will strike again. This man must be arrested. We would appeal for anyone with information to come forward - this man certainly isn\u0027t scared of heights and is fit and agile. Could he be a scaffolder or a builder, someone used to working at height?Likewise we would ask anyone who has been offered these distinctive items for sale to contact us immediately.The politan Police said the suspect is described as:aged between 20 and 40A spokesman said: He has been pictured wearing a hooded jumper or jacket with zips on the left arm and chest, a black cap, a rucksack with waist straps and a carabiner clip on the outside of the bag, and black trainers with thick white soles.Law and orderSt George\u0026#39s Chapel: Inside the Windsor Castle venue for the royal weddingDambusters 75th anniversary: How the Second World War raid unfoldedDoria Ragland, Meghan Markle\u0026#39s mother, now expected to walk her down the aisle - who else could it be?  Meet Meghan Markle\u0026#39s family: The yoga teacher, the diplomat and the cannabis farmerProcession route map for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s wedding day - where to spot the royal coupleMeghan Markle: The American actress and newest addition to the royal familyInside St George\u0026#39s Chapel: The Windsor Castle venue where Prince Harry will marry Meghan MarkleHow to watch Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s royal wedding this SaturdayHow Prince Harry and Meghan Markle met - a look back at the matchmaker who started the couple\u0026#39s royal romanceWhat royal titles will Meghan Markle and Prince Harry have after the wedding?Royal wedding guest list: Here\u0026#39s who has received an invite from Harry and MeghanWhat time are Prince Harry and Meghan Markle getting married?

And it seems they will waste no time getting started.The newlyweds\u0027 royal wedding schedule sees them undertake a tour of Windsor as their first trip as man and wife, to greet well-wishers who are expected to turn out from all over the world to see them.Here\u0027s everything you need to know about how to watch it and where to stand.Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will undertake a carriage ride through Windsor straight after the St George’s Chapel ceremony and before their reception. The journey is designed to allow members of the public to see the newlyweds in person while they are still dressed in their finery, in what is likely to be one of the most photographed occasions of the year.Such a display of ceremonial prowess has been used by kings and queens for centuries to celebrate as much as it has been used to impress their subjects and foreign powers. Be that with gun salutes, marching guards, or golden carriages. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge during their wedding carriage procession in 2011There is no doubt that this royal wedding will pack a punch, just like Queen Victoria\u0027s marriage to Albert which featured a 21-gun salute as she embarked on her carriage procession at St Jame\u0027s Palace.  But it was not until King George VI\u0027s marriage to Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon in 1923 that royal weddings became public affairs they were married to great fanfare in order to lift the spirits of the nation after World War One (and royal weddings have been lavish events ever since).At 1pm, immediately after the service, Prince Harry and Ms Markle will leave Windsor Castle by carriage. They will be driven along Castle Hill, the High Street and into Windsor town centre before returning along the beautiful, tree-lined Long Walk for their reception. The whole procession is expected to take just 25 minutes.Meanwhile, guests from the congregation will wait for the happy couple in St George\u0027s Hall, to celebrate the first of the day\u0027s two receptions.To see the newlyweds up close, the best positions will be on the 2.64 mile stretch that rolls from Snow Hill to the gates of Windsor Castle. This is known as the \u0027Long Walk\u0027. The length of this section will allow thousands of spectators to catch a glimpse of Harry and Meghan in the final minutes of the procession.  There will be events on the Long Walk  throughout the day, with live screens showing footage from the ceremony.  On the hilltop above the procession route, the eagle-eyed can find a sweeping aerial view of the carriage ride. Snow Hill will offer fantastic views of the final moments and will be a popular picnic spot on the day, so get there early to reserve a spot.According to legend, King Henry VIII sat on Snow Hill to wait for news of the execution of his second wife, Queen Anne Boleyn. A precedent that has fortunately not been followed since. Prince Edward and his bride Sophie Rhys-Jones pass the crowd inside the grounds of Windsor Castle in an open carriage in 1999Royal fans can also mingle with the residents of Windsor as the carriage passes through the streets of the town centre. Although you should probably arrive at the crack of dawn if you\u0027re after a front-row High Street viewing spot - it\u0027s bound to get busy.With Windsor dressed in bunting and ceremonial decorations – and bursting with local street entertainment – the town will provide a feast for the eyes. Expect big screens showing live footage of the wedding plus an array of food stalls and general facilities will be available at both the Long Walk and Alexandra Gardens.Spectators can also line the entirety of the procession route, on Castle Hill, High Street, Sheet Street, Kings Road, Albert Road and the Long Walk. Disabled viewing spots will be available at the junctions of Victoria Street and Albert Road. The council has advised that visitors should not bring tents, but foldable chairs and umbrellas are fine. Also look out for the weather forecast on the day, and prepare for large crowds with plenty of food supplies, water, and sun cream. Further information will be published on the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead Council website. Of the three parking options on offer, most motorists should make use of the 6,000 designated parking spaces available at the Review Ground, Windsor Great Park, which is located to the south of Windsor Castle and the town centre.  Parking tickets must be booked in advance for a price of £30. These are being allocated on a first-come, first-serve basis. With wedding invitations being sent to more than 2,000 members of the public and many more expected to watch the ceremony on the town\u0027s live screens, it\u0027s a good idea get these sooner rather than later.This car park opens at 4am and closes at 10pm. Though it is next to the Long Walk, motorists will have to take a 25 minute stroll to the nearest spectator spots.  The second parking option is provided by Windsor Racecourse\u0027s \u0027Park and Float\u0027 service, which must also be booked in advance. There are 3,000 spots available for £30, as well as weekend parking packages, and the opportunity to journey into the heart of Windsor on a return boat trip for £10. The third car park can be found at The Windsor Boy\u0027s School, where motorists can park on a first-come-first basis on the day without pre-booking. This is expected to fill-up early in the morning. To accommodate the large number of attendees at Windsor\u0027s public events over the weekend, there will also be a series of road closures, beginning with a 9am - 2pm closure of the procession route on Thursday May 17. Then, from 10pm on Friday May 18 and until late on Saturday May 19, road closures will affect the procession route and surrounding roads. During this time Windsor residents will be able to leave the road closure area, but only emergency services vehicles can enter.Access to the car park on the Long Walk will not be affected by the road closures in place, at any time. Road closures beyond the procession route will take effect from 6am on Saturday May 19 these include Maidenhead Road, Clarence Road, Alma Road, St Leonards Road, Frances Road, Barry Avenue, and Datchet Road. Local authorities suggest that you check this live map of road closures to check what time the roads reopen from Saturday evening onwards. Rail operators will be running a bumper service on the wedding to help everyone get in and out of the celebrations at Windsor, which is expected to be one of the largest one-day events ever held on the local rail network.  Both Great Western and South Western will be increasing train frequency and capacity, with trains running up to four times an hour from London Waterloo and Slough. These services will also benefit from extra carriages to keep up with the expected demand, given that some of the 100,000 expected visitors will arrive by public transport. Windsor is served by two train stations that are within minutes of the town centre and Windsor Castle, making the railway a reliable option for getting to the Royal wedding celebrations: Windsor and Eton Central and Windsor and Eton Riverside.Queuing systems are likely to be in place at London Waterloo, Slough, Staines, and Windsor, whilst \u0027park and walk\u0027 and \u0027park and glide\u0027 bus services will help people get into town.Great Western Railway services connect Windsor and Eton station to South Wales and the West of England, as well as Reading and Oxford, via Slough. This branch-line service will be running with four carriages running every 20 minutes, from the very early hours of the morning to late on Saturday night. The journey from Reading or Oxford takes around 30 - 50 minutes and 50 - 75 minutes respectively, with a change required at Slough. Cardiff and Swansea are around two and a half hours away from Windsor, requiring changes at Reading and then Slough. London is connected to Windsor via the direct Waterloo to Windsor and Eton Riverside service, which takes one hour. Travellers have been advised not to take the London Paddington - Slough route, in order to ease rail congestion around Windsor. From the Midlands, take a Cross Country service from Birmingham New Street to Reading, and then change at Slough for the Eton Riverside station. This takes around two and a half hours.Train services from the North require changes at London terminals. Almost five hours of train travel await any royal super-fans making their way from Newcastle.  Because it is such a huge event, it is wise to make travel plans ahead of time – so make ticket bookings and travel arrangements well before the big day. Up to date advice on the best routes and how to pre-book your tickets, can be found at: for Great Western Railway here and South Western Railway here.Royal wedding: the best hotels for celebrating Prince Harry\u0027s and Meghan Markle\u0027s big dayThere will be a designated pick up and drop off point on the wedding day at King Edward VII Hospital, St Leonards Road. This will be the termination point for buses towards Windsor, as well as local routes. A full timetable of buses is available at the Royal Borough website, and more information on transport and bus alterations can be found here. Hotels, B\u0026ampBs and guesthouses will be bursting at the seams, so expect no empty hotel rooms in town for the duration of the wedding weekend. Royal fans had only a few hours to book the local accommodation offerings before rooms ran out after the announcement that Windsor would play host for the big day.Many residents and visitors will no doubt find a solution via room sharing service AirBnb, with the average price of a room around Windsor currently standing at £321 for Friday night and £286 for the Saturday night. Such prices look like a bargain, with some of the most expensive hotel rooms in Windsor going for up to £10,000. Alternative locations with more \u0027last-minute\u0027 availability include Heathrow, Bracknell and Weybridge. The council also suggests that anyone wanting help to find accommodation can contact the Royal Windsor Information Centre on 01753 743907 or by emailing: windsor.accommodation@rbwm. gov.uk.The monarchy has embarked on grand processions from coronations, marriages, funerals and other state occasions since the 15th century. Each year, a carriage procession carries the Queen to the State Opening of Parliament and the races at Ascot, although royal weddings and coronations are arguably the grandest occasions.   The last royal couple to undertake a carriage procession in Windsor was Prince Edward and Sophie Rhys-Jones – now the Earl and Countess of Wessex – after their wedding in St George\u0027s Chapel in 1999.Prince Edward and Sophie Rhys-Jones pictured in their carriage after their wedding in 1999It was the biggest occasion in the Berkshire town since since the funeral of King George VI in 1952.More recently, the newly-wed Duke and Duchess of Cambridge travelled through Westminster in a 1902 State Landau after their 2011 wedding, waving at thousands of well-wishers who had packed the streets to catch a glimpse of the happy couple. It\u0027s possible Harry and Meghan could use the same carriage. Steeped in history, the carriage was specifically built for King Edward VII in 1902 and is usually used by the Queen to meet foreign heads of state when they arrive on state visits to Britain.The Prince and Princess of Wales used it to travel back from St Paul’s Cathedral after their 1981 royal wedding, as did the Duke and Duchess of York in 1986. It was also used by the Queen during her Silver Wedding anniversary celebrations in 1972 and in her Silver and Diamond Jubilees in 1977 and 2012.Royal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan MarkleSt George\u0026#39s Chapel: Inside the Windsor Castle venue for the royal weddingDambusters 75th anniversary: How the Second World War raid unfoldedDoria Ragland, Meghan Markle\u0026#39s mother, now expected to walk her down the aisle - who else could it be?  Meet Meghan Markle\u0026#39s family: The yoga teacher, the diplomat and the cannabis farmerMeghan Markle: The American actress and newest addition to the royal familyInside St George\u0026#39s Chapel: The Windsor Castle venue where Prince Harry will marry Meghan MarkleHow to watch Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s royal wedding this SaturdayHow Prince Harry and Meghan Markle met - a look back at the matchmaker who started the couple\u0026#39s royal romanceWhat royal titles will Meghan Markle and Prince Harry have after the wedding?Royal wedding guest list: Here\u0026#39s who has received an invite from Harry and MeghanWhat time are Prince Harry and Meghan Markle getting married?

It would not comment further.The Duke of Cambridge will be Harry\u0027s best man, missing the FA Cup final to be at his brother\u0027s side.The Duke, who has always been the front-runner for the supporting role at the May wedding, is honoured to have been asked, Kensington Palace said.Prince William and Prince Harry in borrowed policemen outfitsPrince George and Princess Charlotte look almost certain to be page boy and flower girl. The siblings already know the score - they performed those roles at the wedding of Pippa Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s younger sister, to James Matthews in May last year.  Kensington Palace has announced that Ms Markle will have no adult bridesmaids \u0027because she\u0027s unable to choose between her friends\u0027, and will instead be surrounded by children as page boys, bridesmaids and flower girls.Friends including Jessica Mulroney, Misha Noo Lindsay Roth, Benita Litt, Janina Gavankar and Priyanka Chopra are expected to be part of the congregation.Bookmakers suspended betting on the designer of Ms Markle\u0027s wedding dress in March when British couture company Ralph \u0026amp Russo pulled ahead to become 13 favourites.The label, helmed by Australians Tamara Ralph and Michael Russo (a couple in real life) have shot to prominence after a string of celebrity endorsements.In 2014, Angelina Jolie wore the label to Buckingham Palace to receive an honorary damehood, in 2016 Gwyneth Paltrow to the Oscars. Add to that list of fans Beyonce, Rihanna and, finally, Meghan Markle herself, who chose a £56,000 embellished couture gown for the official photos taken to mark her engagement to Prince Harry.Before betting was suspended, London-based designer Erdem was at 31. Ms Markle\u0027s stylist and close friend Ms Mulroney runs a bridal store in Toronto was said to have helped the bride choose her gown.Read more about Ralph and Russo here.The couple will be make their vows at St George\u0027s Chapel, which last hosted a royal wedding in May 2008 when Peter Phillips - son of The Princess Royal - married Autumn Kelly. The traditional ceremony will be conducted by The Dean of Windsor, The Rt Revd. David Conner while the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, will officiate as the couple make their marriage vows.Pioneering American bishop, the Most Rev Bishop Michael Curry, from Chicago, Illinois, has been invited to deliver the address as the couple strive to reflect their transatlantic relationship amid the tradition of St George\u0027s Chapel.Bishop Curry, who has been praised for his infectious laughter and self-deprecating humour, is the first African-American bishop to have served as the Episcopal Church\u0027s presiding bishop, a role he has held since November 2015.The music will also have an American influence according to Christopher Warren-Green, who will conduct musicians on the day.Miss Markle, who was a UN women\u0027s advocate, is unlikely to opt to obey the prince. The couple will probably choose the Series One (1966) Book of Common Prayer ceremony, just as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge did, which allows the bride to drop obey him and serve him from the religious proceedings.The regiments Prince Harry served with in Afghanistan will a have a “special place” during the ceremony.The 3 Regiment Army Air Corps, where the prince served as an Apache Pilot in Helmand Province will be represented, as well as The Royal Gurkha Rifles, his comrades in Afghanistan in 2007, and RAF Honington, where he is Honorary Air Commandant.Household Cavalry troopers will line the staircase at St George\u0027s Chapel, while streets within the precincts of the castle will be lined by members of the Windsor Castle Guard from 1st Battalion Irish Guards, and by Armed Forces personnel from the Royal Navy Small Ships and Diving, which has the Prince as Commodore-in-Chief, and the Royal Marines, where he is Captain General.Read more about St George\u0027s Chapel here.WATCH: How Diana, the in-laws and Prince Louis will fit into the Royal WeddingAfter the ceremony, among the first people to congratulate the couple will be some of the 2,640 charity workers, community champions and local school children who are being invited to watch the wedding from inside the walls of Windsor Castle. Then at 1pm, the newlyweds will undertake a two mile tour of Windsor in an Ascot Landau carriage, greeting well-wishers, which is expected to take 25 minutes.It\u0027s the same carriage the prince used in the procession at the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton,when he was surrounded by small bridesmaids and page boys.The couple will leave Windsor Castle by carriage via Castle Hill, travelling along the High Street and through Windsor Town before returning along the Long Walk for the first reception at St George\u0027s Hall.Read more about the procession here.Wedding at Windsor CastleFollowing the carriage ride, the congregation will await the happy couple in St George\u0027s Hall, for the first of two receptions.The first, more formal afternoon reception for some 600 guests, will be hosted by the Queen. The 180-ft long room, traditionally used for state banquets, seats up to 162 people and was redesigned in a modern Gothic style – with walls lined with suits of armour – following the fire at the castle in 1992.Fashionable \u0027bowl food\u0027 will be served at the standing-only reception. Made with seasonal ingredients grown on the Crown Estates, the food is intended to be eaten standing up, allowing guests to mingle freely in St George’s Hall.The food is likely to be accompanied by champagne and wine from the extensive Royal cellars, and soft drinks.The second evening reception, for 200 close friends and family, will be thrown at Frogmore House by the Prince of Wales. Standing about half a mile south of Windsor Castle in Windsor Home Park, Frogmore House has been a Royal Residence since 1792. It is where Harry and Ms Markle posed for their official engagement photos in November.The location of the venue - away from the Castle - will offer the pair privacy as they celebrate with friends and family.Read more about the food here.The couple have asked Claire Ptak, an east London pastry chef, to make an organic lemon and elderflower wedding cake incorporating the bright flavours of spring, according to Kensington Palace. It will be covered with buttercream and decorated with fresh flowers.It is believed to be the first time a Royal couple have eschewed tradition by not serving a fruit cake to their wedding guests.Claire Ptak, owner of Violet Bakery in Hackney, east LondonThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge chose Fiona Cairns to make their 2011 wedding cake, a traditional multi-layered fruit cake with a floral design.Read more about the wedding cake here.The couple have chosen high society florist Philippa Craddock to design their day, using seasonal plants and flowers from the Crown Estates and Royal Parks chosen particularly for their pollinator-friendly properties.Aisles, pews, tables and halls will be lined with plants from wildflower meadows, picked to “provide a great habitat for bees and help to nurture and sustain entire ecosystems by promoting a healthy and bioerse environment”, Kensington Palace said.Ms Craddock has been named “Queen of London florists” by British Vogue and “a floral mastermind” by Tatler.Peonies are one of Ms Markle\u0027s favourite flowers, so it is likely her floral bouquet will include these fragrant blooms, which are in season in May.Read more about the wedding florist here.The prince will be putting pen to paper to write his speech for their reception. But Ms Markle, who is an accomplished public speaker, is expected to break with tradition and deliver her own as well, offering “affectionate” praise of her new husband, thanks to the Queen and a few suitable jokes.The former actress, is “ready” to speak at the reception, should her father choose to avoid the limelight, the Sunday Times reported earlier this year.Mr Markle, an award-winning Hollywood writing director who now lives a quiet life in Mexico, was expected to walk Ms Markle down the aisle before changing his plans to attend.At the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, reception speeches included words from best man Prince Harry, the groom’s father the Prince of Wales and Michael Middleton, who affectionately described how he knew his daughter’s relationship was serious when her boyfriend landed a helicopter in his garden.Meghan Markle and her mother, Doria Radlan at the Invictus GamesMs Markle will become an HRH and a senior royal after marrying Prince Harry. She is also expected to become a duchess, as Kate Middleton did when she became the Duchess of Cambridge after saying her vows in 2011.By tradition, male members of the Royal family receive a title from the monarch on their wedding day, and the vacant title Duke of Sussex is regarded as the most likely choice for the Prince, meaning Ms Markle would become HRH The Duchess of Sussex.Like Prince Harry, the previous Duke of Sussex lived at Kensington Palace, and he also married for love, rather than choosing brides who fitted the traditional royal mould.Read more about royal titles here.Prince William and his wife Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, outside Westminster Abbey on their wedding day in 2011The wedding is on a Saturday, so there will be no new bank holiday. Although the public were given a day off to celebrate the weddings of Prince Charles to Diana Spencer in 1981, Prince William to Catherine Middleton in 2011, and Princess Anne to Mark Phillips in 1973, no such national holidays were awarded for Prince Andrew or Prince Edward.However, it\u0027s not all bad news because pubs and bars will be allowed to do away with the usual curbs on opening hours on the wedding weekend. Ministers have extended licensing hours across Britain to allow venues to remain open until 1am on Friday and Saturday - which is also the day of the FA Cup final.There will also be lots of street parties planned across the UK.For information about how to host your own, click here.The royal bride and groom-to-be have approved a range of commemorative china to celebrate their nuptials. The exclusive design in white and cornflower blue has a monogram of the couple\u0027s initials at its centre, tied together with white ribbons and surmounted by the coronet of Prince Harry.  The decorative border of each piece is inspired by the ironwork of the 13th-century Gilebertus door of St George\u0027s Chapel and each is finished with 22-carat gold.The Royal Collection Trust range, which is made in Stoke-on-Trent, includes a decorative miniature coffee mug, coffee mug, pillbox, tankard and plate. The Royal wedding souvenir phenomenon dates back to Queen Victoria’s wedding to Prince Albert in 1840, linked to the rise of mass production in Victorian Britain. It remains a thriving industry today, with an estimated £222 million spent on memorabilia in the run-up to the 2011 royal wedding, according to the Centre for Retail Research.Prince Harry and Ms Markle will delay their honeymoon to go straight back to work in the week after their wedding, scheduling their first public engagement as a married couple just days later.The couple will go on honeymoon privately later this year, before a “busy” autumn including a trip to Sydney for the Invictus Games. But where will they go?Namibia has pulled ahead as the odds-on favourite. The southern African nation is best known among travellers for the enormous Sossusvlei sand dunes of the the Namib Desert, but reports suggest that the couple are looking instead at a safari trip to Hoanib Valley Camp in the country\u0027s north west.Botswana, where they holidayed in the early days of their whirlwind relationship, is also a good bet, (Ms Markle\u0027s engagement ring features diamonds from Diana\u0027s personal collection, and a stone from Botswana), but wherever they go, the newlyweds will be looking for seclusion away from the limelight as they start their married life together.Other possible destinations could include Tuscany, Hawaii, Turkey and the Philippines.Read more about the honeymoon options here.Meghan Markle and Prince Harry wedding features gridPrince Harry and Meghan MarkleRoyal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan MarkleSt George\u0026#39s Chapel: Inside the Windsor Castle venue for the royal weddingDambusters 75th anniversary: How the Second World War raid unfoldedDoria Ragland, Meghan Markle\u0026#39s mother, now expected to walk her down the aisle - who else could it be?  Meet Meghan Markle\u0026#39s family: The yoga teacher, the diplomat and the cannabis farmerProcession route map for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s wedding day - where to spot the royal coupleMeghan Markle: The American actress and newest addition to the royal familyInside St George\u0026#39s Chapel: The Windsor Castle venue where Prince Harry will marry Meghan MarkleHow to watch Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s royal wedding this SaturdayHow Prince Harry and Meghan Markle met - a look back at the matchmaker who started the couple\u0026#39s royal romanceWhat royal titles will Meghan Markle and Prince Harry have after the wedding?Royal wedding guest list: Here\u0026#39s who has received an invite from Harry and MeghanWhat time are Prince Harry and Meghan Markle getting married?

Prince Edward also wed Sophie, the Countess of Wessex, there in June 1999 plus Prince Harry was christened there in 1984 by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Runcie.Members of the public who have been invited to watch from the grounds of Windsor Castle will  begin to arrive from 9am.Guests will arrive between 9:30am and 11am by coach. Two driving routes have been suggested, with guests required to meet at the Windsor Farm Shop – founded in 2001 after the Duke of Edinburgh had an idea to support local businesses by selling produce.Wedding at Windsor CastleThere, three miles away from the venue, guests will be put through security checks and asked to show identification they will then be ushered onto buses to travel to Windsor Castle, where they will alight at the castle\u0027s Round Tower and enter the chapel through the south door.Instructions reportedly sent to the guests ban cameras and bulky bags, adding that guests will be asked to surrender mobile telephones\u0085 and any devices used for image capture.The rules further specify that guests should not wear medals, in a list of suggestions about accessories that includes: No swords.At 11:20am, members of the Royal Family will arrive and enter the chapel through the Galilee Porch. Some will arrive in state car from the Royal Mews, including Bentleys, Rolls-Royces and Daimlers.A view of the Quire in St George\u0026#39s Chapel at Windsor Castle, where Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will have their wedding servicePrince Harry and his brother and best man the Duke of Cambridge are expected to arrive at the chapel\u0027s west steps at 11:45am. It is assumed they will enter the grounds on foot, giving Prince Harry the opportunity to walk past the crowds in the grounds. He will pass 200 representatives from charities he is associated with, who are expected to gather in the horseshoe cloister at the bottom of the steps.The Queen will be the final member of the Royal Family to arrive for the service, and is expected at 11:55am.The service will begin at 12pm, with Ms Markle due to arrive at the chapel\u0027s west steps at 11:59am.She has chosen her mother, Doria, to travel with her to the wedding, travelling from their overnight accommodation to St George’s Chapel by car. The decision breaks with UK tradition, which usually sees the bride travel with her father before he gives her away in the wedding ceremony.Instead, Ms Markle wanted to include both parents in her wedding day. When the car stops at the castle, her mother will exchange places with the bridesmaids and pageboys. Ms Ragland will enter the chapel by the Galilee Porch.The most beautiful royal wedding dresses of all timeHowever, while it was planned that Meghan\u0027s father would meet her at the chapel\u0027s west door before walking her down the aisle, this step of the day has been thrown into confusion. On Monday it was reported the father-of-the-bride revealed he no longer intends to travel from Mexico to the UK to attend the ceremony it is still unconfirmed who will walk the bride down the aisle.The traditional ceremony will be conducted by the Dean of Windsor, The Rt Revd. David Conner while the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, will officiate as the couple make their marriage vows. Under the guidance of Harry\u0027s private secretary, Edward Lane Fox, the Lord Chamberlain\u0027s Office is dealing with the ceremonial aspects of the day.It is assumed that Ms Markle is unlikely to opt to obey the prince and will probably choose the Series One (1966) Book of Common Prayer ceremony, just as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge did. This allows the bride to drop the phrases obey him and serve him from the religious proceedings. Harry must decide whether to wear a wedding ring William does not wear one.The regiments Prince Harry served with in Afghanistan will also have a special place during the ceremony. Household Cavalry troopers will line the staircase at St George\u0027s Chapel, while streets within the precincts of the castle will be lined by members of the Windsor Castle Guard from 1st Battalion Irish Guards, and by Armed Forces personnel from the Royal Navy Small Ships and Diving, which has the Prince as Commodore-in-Chief, and the Royal Marines, where he is Captain General.The 3 Regiment Army Air Corps, where Prince Harry served as an Apache Pilot in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, will also be represented, as well as The Royal Gurkha Rifles, his comrades in Afghanistan in 2007, and RAF Honington, where he is Honorary Air Commandant.The service will end at 1pm and the newlyweds will leave the chapel at the west steps, before leaving the castle by carriage. Prince Harry and Ms Markle will be driven for two miles along Castle Hill, the High Street and into Windsor town centre before returning along the beautiful, tree-lined Long Walk for their reception.Kensington Palace has said: Prince Harry and Ms Markle are very much looking forward to this short journey which they hope will be a memorable moment for everyone who has gathered together in Windsor to enjoy the atmosphere of this special day.While we don\u0027t know for sure how long the procession will take, a similar procession in 1999 by Edward and Sophie took 15 minutes.The best photo opportunity will be the West Steps of St George’s Chapel, when the bride and groom and their families emerge after the service. If you are lucky enough to be in Windsor on the day, head for the grass of the Horseshoe Cloisters opposite those steps for the view.The Ascot Landau open carriage stands in the Royal Mews at Buckingham Palace in LondonThe newlyweds will make their journey through Windsor in an open-topped Ascot Landau carriage, Kensington Palace has confirmed. It is the same carriage Prince Harry used in the procession at the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton, when he was surrounded by small bridesmaids and page boys.Crown Equerry Colonel Toby Browne, who runs the royal mews where the carriage was selected, said: The fair weather option, the Ascot Landau, it was selected because it\u0027s a wonderfully bright, small, lovely carriage. Very easy for people to see, the passengers can sit up quite high - so there\u0027s lots of visibility for everybody.It was built in 1883, it\u0027s one of five that we have, most of them are down in Windsor, we always keep one in London for occasions.If it rains on the wedding day, the wet weather option is the Scottish State Coach. Built in 1830, a new top was created in 1969 with large windows and a partial glass roof, to allow spectators to see the passengers.Six horses, Windsor Greys, will be included the procession ride.A team of four, Milford Haven, Plymouth and father and son Storm and Tyrone, will pull the Landau and two others - Sir Basil and Londonderry - will be outriders.All have been involved in high profile events before, including the Spanish state visit last year, Royal Ascot, Trooping the Colour, the State Opening of Parliament and the Lord Mayor\u0027s Show. They will be waved off by members of both families and the congregation will leave the chapel to see the newlyweds leave, before going to St George\u0027s Hall for the lunchtime reception hosted by the Queen.While Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are touring Windsor, guests from the congregation will wait for the happy couple in St George\u0027s Hall to celebrate the first of the day\u0027s two receptions. This will be hosted by the Queen, will take place during the afternoon and will be attended by all guests who were invited to the service.Invitations have been posted to 600 lucky guests royal sources have said the guest list has been restricted to those who have a direct relationship with the couple, both because St George’s Chapel is relatively small and because the prince is not in the direct line of succession.Some members of the public have received an invitation to wait in the grounds outside the chapel to watch the bride and groom and their wedding guests arrive and leave.Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in the grounds of Frogmore HouseFrom 7pm, a select 200 close friends will attend an after party hosted by the Prince of Wales at Frogmore House, Windsor. Half a mile away from Windsor Castle, the 17th century Grade I country house is owned by the Crown Estate and is part of the Frogmore Estate on the ground of the Home Park.Prince Harry and Ms Markle\u0027s engagement photos were taken in the grounds of Frogmore House.

The invitations have been dispatched, the cake is being iced and the final flourishes are being added to the wedding gown. For those of us not lucky enough to be on the guest list or among the members of the public invited to Windsor, the next best option is to watch live from home. As with previous royal weddings and milestone celebrations, you can expect hours of television coverage streamed live from the lawns of Windsor Castle and the heights of St George\u0027s Chapel nave. This wedding will go beyond the heights of Suits, in which Ms Markle stars, or The Crown. There will be as much tradition and pomp as any drama or history series ever needed. The schedule for the royal day means you can expect cheering crowds in any weather packing the pavements of Windsor and thousands celebrating in their local communities at street parties across the nation. To make sure you catch every second on TV - including the dizzying spectacle of the FA Cup Final which falls on the same day - read on.  Not long to go... Prince Harry and Meghan Markle on the day they announced their engagementThe Prince and Ms Markle are set to be married this weekend (Saturday, 19 May). Clear your diary.The hour-long ceremony will begin at 12:00pm sharp at St George’s Chapel in Windsor, but expect several hours of TV coverage first as the excitement and anticipation builds.The service, conducted by the Dean of Windsor, will end around 1pm when Prince Harry and Ms Markle have taken their vows - officiated by The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby.Yes, you\u0027ll be able to catch all the action from your sofa. The wedding and procession will be televised live on networks around the world. A single pool camera will capture the nuptials so many channels will be able to broadcast it. It\u0027s highly unlikely that we\u0027ll catch a glimpse of the two wedding receptions. They are private events for guests only. In the UK, the BBC, Sky News and ITV will cover the day with big-name presenters.The BBC\u0027s coverage will run from 9am until 2pm on Saturday.

Whist CBC\u0027s World Report radio programme will air from 6:00 E.S.T (3:00 PT) for a special royal wedding breakfast edition.On the opposite side of the globe, New Zealanders can tune-in from 22:30 for TVNZ\u0027s simulcast of BBC One for the ceremony set to begin at 23:00 Wellington-time. The national broadcaster will also show a highlights package the next day, for anyone wanting an early night.     Australian\u0027s have a choice of ABC, Seven, SBS, and Nine for Aussie-led coverage from Windsor, or a BBC One simulcast via Foxtel, all kicking-off between 19:00 and 19:30 AEST.Windsor Castle from the airHas your royal wedding invite been lost in the post?

Everything from bunch, burgers and strawberries and cream will be available. Tickets are £25 and include a glass of bubbles.

Both screenings are free - even better. Kensington Palace is also hosting a special outdoor screening of the wedding in the palace gardens in association with The Luna Cinema - what better place to follow all the action than in Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0027s back garden.However, the 1,000 tickets were only available via a ballot, which has now closed.

More than a million people used BBC iPlayer to watch the coverage.In 2011, the BBC had faced intense criticism for choosing Huw Edwards to anchor the presenting team rather than more seasoned royal broadcasters such as David Dimbleby.

The game between Chelsea and Manchester United will kick-off at 17:15 BST on BBC One, so football-loving royalists can have their cake and eat it. However the BBC\u0027s one-off TV licence dispensation does not apply to the FA Cup final, so find a screen somewhere near to your royal wedding celebrations.    Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, usually attends the final and presents the cup to the winning captain in his role as Football Association president.

The researchers found that people who developed high blood pressure between the ages of 80-89 are less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease (the most common form of dementia) over the next three years than people of the same age with normal blood pressure.The majority of antidepressants are ineffective and may be unsafe, for children and teenager with major depression, experts have warned. In what is the most comprehensive comparison of 14 commonly prescribed antidepressant drugs to date, researchers found that only one brand was more effective at relieving symptoms of depression than a placebo. Another popular drug, venlafaxine, was shown increase the risk users engaging in suicidal thoughts and attempts at suicideScientists have taken a “very positive step” towards creating a universal vaccine against cancer that makes the body’s immune system attack tumours as if they were a virus, experts have said. Writing in Nature, an international team of researchers described how they had taken pieces of cancer’s genetic RNA code, put them into tiny nanoparticles of fat and then injected the mixture into the bloodstreams of three patients in the advanced stages of the disease. The patients\u0027 immune systems responded by producing killer T-cells designed to attack cancer. The vaccine was also found to be effective in fighting “aggressively growing” tumours in mice, according to researchers, who were led by Professor Ugur Sahin from Johannes Gutenberg University in GermanyA compound found in green tea could improve the cognitive abilities of those with Down’s syndrome, a team of scientists has discovered. Researchers found epigallocatechin gallate – which is especially present in green tea but can also be found in white and black teas – combined with cognitive stimulation, improved visual memory and led to more adaptive behaviour. Dr Rafael de la Torre, who led the year-long clinical trial along with Dr Mara Dierrssen, said: “The results suggest that iniduals who received treatment with the green tea compound, together with the cognitive stimulation protocol, had better scores in their cognitive capacities”Taking antidepressants during pregnancy could almost double the risk of a child being diagnosed with autism in the first years of life, a major study of nearly 150,000 pregnancies has suggested. Researchers have found a link between women in the later stages of pregnancy who were prescribed one of the most common types of antidepressant drugs, and autism diagnosed in children under seven years of ageParents have been warned that giving children paracetamol-based medicines such as Calpol and Disprol too often could lead to serious health issues later in life. Leading paediatrician and professor of general paediatrics at University College London, Alastair Sutcliffe, said parents were overusing paracetamol to treat mild fevers. As a result, the risk of developing asthma, as well as kidney, heart and liver damage is heightenedScientists have pinpointed how connections in the brain are destroyed in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease, in a study which it is hoped will help in the development of treatments for the debilitating condition. At the early stages of the development of Alzheimer’s disease the synapses – which connect the neurons in the brain – are destroyed, according to researchers at the University of New South Wales, Australia. The synapses are vital for brain function, particularly learning and forming memoriesThe technology lets paralysed people feel actual sensations when touching objects — including light taps on the mechanical finger — and could be a huge breakthrough for prosthetics, according to its makers. The tool was used to let a 28-year-old man who has been paralysed for more than a decade. While prosthetics have previously been able to be controlled directly from the brain, it is the first time that signals have been successfully sent the other wayScientists in a new study show that the first signs of Parkinson’s can be stopped. The UCL study is still in its research period but the team are ‘excited’. Today’s Parkinson’s drugs manage the symptoms of the disease but ultimately do not stop its progression in the brain.A new study shows that drinking alcohol three to four days a week could reduce the risk of diabetes. Wine was found to be most effective in reducing the risk due to the chemical compounds that balance blood sugar levels. Having lost the legal battle over who was to pay for the drug the NHS have finally agreed to fund the HIV prevention treatment. National Aids Trust, whom Princess Diana supported, said that it was a ‘pivotal moment’.Scientists have discovered that the switch is controlled in the hypothalamus area of the brain.

Mr McAfee, who is best known for creating the eponymous antivirus software, has recently been involved with various cryptocurrency companies and was served with a subpoena by the SEC in 2016.John McAfee reveals why he charges over $100,000 for a single tweetWe are in a five vehicle motorcade, Mr McAfee told The Independent. All vehicles driven by ex-military special forces and filled to the brim with heavily-armed security personnel.More details about his problems with the SEC were given in the first video, posted from an unknown location and filmed on Monday evening.“The SEC was never intended to have this power, please God America, wake up and see what has happened,” Mr McAfee said. “The SEC is in charge of our entire industry, our companies, our manufacturing, our distribution, our creativity, our entrepreneurship. When it was created, in the wisdom of the creators, it had only civil powers. If it got p***ed off at you, it could sue you, end of story.“Now, with the cooperation of the justice department, the SEC can get involved, or bring people in who can punish you beyond a civil suit. The SEC owns America, please God, wake up people. And if you think that an agency of the US government would not stoop to assassination, kidnapping, threats, then what are you smoking?”https:t.co1LaXdqm5UfIn an email exchange with The Independent in April, Mr McAfee mentioned his concerns, saying: “I know that I’m in the crosshairs of the SEC.”Mr McAfee has previously claimed that violent cartels have attempted to kidnap him on several occasions over the last few years, most recently in September. Those attempts, he says, relate to his time in Belize when he was caught up in the investigation of the murder of his neighbour in 2012.As a result, Mr McAfee lives with armed security guards at his heavily fortified home in Lexington, Tennessee.The SEC made us fear Ethereum because Bitcoin was so obviously just a currency and out of their realm. They want to crush crypto, so the only way to scare us is to frown at Ethereum. The legal field is clear: Fish will ride bicycles before Etheteum could be called a security.His latest fears of kidnapping relate to his involvement with cryptocurrency, which he says is a threat to the power wielded by the SEC and the financial elite.In an interview with his business associate Rob Loggia, Mr McAfee said his public advocacy of cryptocurrency has made him a target. “The SEC wants to destroy a revolution – a movement of the people – by making an example out of me,” Mr McAfee said. “I cannot allow that to happen.In the final video posted on Tuesday, Mr McAfee explained his views on the government agency.“We have a pyramidal power system that is corrupt at the core,” Mr McAfee said. “You think the SEC has no power, but every single major industry and business in America is under the thumb of the SEC.“The SEC is one of the most powerful agencies in the world. It is out of hand, and it does not anymore represent American values or the American people.”The SEC did not respond to a request for comment from The Independent. The Independent\u0027s bitcoin group on Facebook is the best place to follow the latest discussions and developments in cryptocurrency.

Moments later, Home Office official Hugh Ind told MPs the figure was ”up to five”.Mr Ind also admitted during his evidence that about £3.3m was paid out last year in compensation for detentions later ruled unlawful in the courts, and acknowledged that there was a “deep problem” with wrongful immigration detentions.When quizzed on whether Windrush citizens had been wrongly detained during the hearing on Tuesday, Mr Javid said he did not know, saying his priority was to know whether people had been wrongly been deported.UK news in picturesUK news in picturesA demonstrator holds a flare during a protest against Turkey\u0027s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan outside the entrance to Downing Street in central London.The funeral cortege of Alfie Evans goes past Everton\u0027s Goodison Park ground in Liverpool.

How would I go about it?\u0027Anne Frank tried to cover up two pages of writing in her diary that contained dirty jokes and a description of what she referred to as “sexual matters,” pasting brown paper over the pages in her red-and-white plaid notebook.But researchers have revealed the hidden text using new digital technologies, the Anne Frank House and two other Dutch cultural institutions announced on Tuesday.Frank, the teenage diarist who wrote about coming of age in a secret attic annexe while in hiding from the Nazis during the Second World War, may have camouflaged the two pages because they contained prurient content that she did not want her father or someone else in the cramped quarters to discover.“I sometimes imagine that someone might come to me and ask me to inform him about sexual matters,” Frank wrote in Dutch. “How would I go about it?” She attempts an answer, addressing an imaginary listener with a lofty tone, using phrases such as “rhythmical movements” to describe sex, and “internal medicament,” to refer to contraception.Anne Frank inspires scheme to protect refugees from Israel deportationShe also touches on menstruation, “a sign that she is ripe”, and prostitution: “In Paris they have big houses for that.”Peter de Bruijn, a senior researcher at the Huygens Institute for the History of the Netherlands, one of the partners in the research, said the newly uncovered pages are not significant for their sexual content because Frank explores similar matters in other parts of the diary, often in even more explicit terms. He said these pages were important because they show Frank’s first foray into trying to write in a more literary tone.“She starts with an imaginary person whom she is telling about sex, so she creates a kind of literary environment to write about a subject she’s maybe not comfortable with,” he said.In an interview, Ronald Leopold, executive director of the Anne Frank House, said, “It is really interesting and adds meaning to our understanding of the diary.”“It’s a very cautious start to her becoming a writer,” he said. “It’s still very early stages.”The two newly revealed pages were written in Frank’s first diary on September 28, 1942, when she was 13 years old. During her time in hiding, she wrote two versions of the diary. The first was written in a series of small notebooks, from her 13th birthday on June 12, 1942, until August 1, 1944, and was intended strictly for herself.But one day she heard on the radio that the Dutch government in exile was planning to publish eyewitness accounts of people’s suffering under the German occupation, and she resolved to write a new book she called “The Secret Annexe,” based on her diaries, which she hoped to submit after the war. She completed 215 loose pages in a couple of months, but in August 1944, she and her family were discovered, arrested and deported. She died in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp three months before her 16th birthday, in 1945.Lazio to wear Anne Frank on their shirts in bid to fight anti-SemitismAnne Frank Centre calls on Twitter to suspend Donald Trump\u0027s accountRemembered: Judith Jones, editor who rescued Anne Frank’s diaryDe Bruijn said Frank may have also pasted over the pages as a form of self-editing as she revised her diary in preparation for the second, public version.Researchers at the Anne Frank House discovered the two hidden pages in the original version of the diary while they were checking its condition and photographing the pages in 2016. The notebooks are in storage for safe keeping and only examined once every 10 years.Until now, the technology that would have allowed researchers to look at the covered pages without destroying them wasn’t available. “When you touch the pages they can be damaged, so we don’t touch them,” said Teresien da Silva, head of collections at the Anne Frank House. Using photo-imaging software, they were able to decipher text beneath the brown paper without any contact with the pages.Could it be considered disrespectful to reveal pages that Frank wanted to hide?“You can compare it, for example, with finding out that there’s something painted underneath a Rembrandt masterpiece,” da Silva said. “When you discover that you want to know what’s underneath, because it can tell you about how he worked.”She also compared it to salvaging the writings of Franz Kafka, who wanted to destroy many of his own literary works. “It’s not always good to follow the wish of an author,” she said. “It’s important sometimes for scientific research and also good to know for the public what she didn’t want to publish.”A spokeswoman for the Anne Frank House said the museum would make the new text available on its website, but only in Dutch at the moment, because of copyright restrictions. She said she did not know when the text would be available in English.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

They have been in negotiations since Thursday in a bid to fuse their differing policies into a workable joint platform to end a 10-week political stalemate.Berlusconi allowed to run again for election as Italy’s prime minister“It has been a very productive day,” 31-year-old Mr Di Maio told reporters on Sunday, following several hours of talks with his counterpart in Milan.  He said they were close to a “historic” agreement, but their choice of prime minister has not yet been announced and confusion remains over who it will be.The Five Star Movement won 32 per cent of the vote at the election and the League took 17 per cent, making them the two largest groups in parliament.The leaders both said their talks on Sunday made progress on a policy document which is likely to be tough on immigration and the EU. Mr Salvini has previous pledged illegal immigrants would be rounded up and sent home “in 15 minutes” if he and his allies take power.The two parties are said to have agreed on who would be prime minister but there has been no word on who would lead the proposed government, with neither Mr Salvini nor Mr Di Maio willing to let the other take the helm.The far-right leader argues that, although his party has far fewer votes, he represents a centre-right alliance that won the support of 37 per cent of the electorate. That alliance also includes former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi‘s party Forza Italia, which said during the election campaign it would use the police and the military to round up 600,000 undocumented migrants and deport them if it came to power.The League and Five Star Movement have been in discussions over nominating an independent figure to lead the government, without allegiance to either party.On Sunday, Mr Di Maio said the prime minister would be a “political” figure, rather than a non-partisan technocrat.A 71-year-old economist and university professor, Giulio Sapelli, said on Monday he had spoken to both leaders and would be willing to do the job as long as former centre-right economy minister Domenico Siniscalco was appointed finance minister.Mr Sapelli said another candidate for the prime minister’s job was also under consideration law professor Giuseppe Conte.World news in picturesWorld news in picturesPalestinians run away from tear gas shot at them by Israeli forces during a protest in Ramallah, in the occupied West BankA Palestinian demonstrator runs during a protest against the US embassy move to Jerusalem and ahead of the 70th anniversary of the Nakba at the Israel-Gaza border.A bullet hole on the window of a cafe in Paris, the day after a knifeman killed one man and wounded four other people before being shot dead by policeGermany\u0027s Chancellor Angela Merkel looks on after receiving the \u0027Lamp of Peace, the Nobel Catholic award for her work of conciliation for the peaceful cohabitation of peoples at The Basilica Superiore of St Francis of Assisi in Italy.Police forensics investigate the death of seven people in a suspected murder-suicide in Australia.

His supporters successfully campaigned for social and political reform and against a corrupt and dysfunctional political establishment.It was the latest surprise in the career of a man who barely survived the murder of his father, the revered Shia religious leader Mohammed Sadiq al-Sadr, and his two brothers, on the orders of Saddam Hussein in 1999.Four years later, after the US invasion of Iraq, he was in danger once again of being killed, this time by American forces who twice besieged him in the holy city of Najaf in 2004.Mr Sadr will be very much the kingmaker – though he will have no official position – in the formation of a new Iraqi government.His coalition, which includes the Iraqi Communist Party, independents and secularists as well as his religious followers, appealed strongly to Iraqis who feel that, with the war won against Isis, they need to rebuild their country.The Iraqi prime minister Haider al-Abadi hoped to win the election – though no party was ever likely to win an absolute majority – by appealing to voters as the leader who recaptured Mosul from Isis last year.He followed this up with a largely bloodless reoccupation of Kirkuk, held by the Kurds since 2003, and the restoration of a large measure of government authority in Iraqi Kurdistan.The political movement formed out of the largely Shia paramilitaries, the Hashd al-Shaabi, which came second in the polls, had, like Mr Abadi, hoped to win more votes through their role in the war against Isis.Coalition led by nationalist cleric takes shock lead in Iraqi electionUS and Iran battle for influence in first post-Isis Iraq electionWomen brace for Iraq’s election after race marked by harassment What would Trump have done about Saddam Hussein? But the drop in violence to a level not seen since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein means that Iraqis are focusing on the theft by the political elite of hundreds of billions of dollars in oil revenues that should have been used to improve the supply of water, electricity, waste disposal as well medical care and education.Mr Sadr has been frequently underestimated as a political leader since he first emerged from house arrest in Najaf at the time of the US invasion.He was described by the western media as a ‘maverick’ or ‘firebrand cleric’, but his views were always more sophisticated and flexible than he was given credit for.The origin of Mr Sadr’s influence was his family’s role as religious leaders and the martyrdom of many of them, beginning with the execution of Mohammed Baqr al-Sadr in 1980.His father led a movement that appealed to the Shia poor of Baghdad and southern Iraq, combining religious revivalism with social and political radicalism. From the start, Sadrism had a strong element of Iraqi nationalism in opposition to all foreign interference in Iraq, be it American, British or Iranian.‘The near future of Iraq is dark’: Warning from Muqtada al-Sadr -In an interview with The Independent in Najaf in 2013 – the first he had given face to face to a Western journalist for 10 years – Mr Sadr spoke graphically of the ill effects of Iraq inviting in different foreign powers to try to solve its problems. He compared this to “somebody who found a mouse in his house, then he kept a cat, then he wanted to get the cat out of the house so he kept a dog, then to get the dog out of his house he bought an elephant, so he bought a mouse”,Mr Sadr created the Shia paramilitary Mehdi Army to resist the Americans. He was later to stand this down during the Sunni-Shia sectarian mass killings of 2006-7, saying that it had been infiltrated by people not under his control.He was denounced by the US as a pro-Iranian proxy, but he has made clear over the years that he opposes Iranian interference as well as that of other countries.The Sadrist success in the election this month will be unwelcome in both Washington and Tehran.The US had done everything it could to back Mr Abadi as a victorious war leader and a sort of Iraqi Winston Churchill – forgetting, perhaps, that Churchill lost the British general election in 1945.Mr Sadr’s influence over an incoming government in Baghdad puts in doubt the future of the 10,000 American troops and military contractors in Iraq, though a Sadrist spokesman said after the election that US training and the weapons procurement from the US could continue.World news in picturesWorld news in picturesPalestinians run away from tear gas shot at them by Israeli forces during a protest in Ramallah, in the occupied West BankA Palestinian demonstrator runs during a protest against the US embassy move to Jerusalem and ahead of the 70th anniversary of the Nakba at the Israel-Gaza border.A bullet hole on the window of a cafe in Paris, the day after a knifeman killed one man and wounded four other people before being shot dead by policeGermany\u0027s Chancellor Angela Merkel looks on after receiving the \u0027Lamp of Peace, the Nobel Catholic award for her work of conciliation for the peaceful cohabitation of peoples at The Basilica Superiore of St Francis of Assisi in Italy.Police forensics investigate the death of seven people in a suspected murder-suicide in Australia.

When I interviewed him five years ago he warned against Sunni-Shia sectarianism and foreign interference. He said: “The Iraqi people will disintegrate, its government will disintegrate and it will be easy for foreign powers to control the country.” This prediction was to be fulfilled six months later when Isis took Mosul and the Iraqi army broke up.Mr Sadr said that sectarianism was spreading at street level and “if it spreads among the people, it will be difficult to fight”.Iraqi politics is still largely based on sectarian or ethnic identity – Shia, Sunni and Kurd – but the religious parties that were in the ascendant after 2003 have discredited themselves. The majority Shia community is also more confident, after its military victories last year, that it is firmly in control and is not going to be dispossessed from power.Mr Sadr said that the problem was that the Iraqi psychology had been shaped by a “constant cycle of violence: Saddam, occupation, war after war, first Gulf war, the second Gulf war, then the occupation war”.The election this month, in which so many voters gave priority to social rather than security issues, may show that, as violence ebbs, Iraqi are becoming less traumatised.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Rooms have been renovated, flowers planted in the design of the US flag and the seal of the US embassy has gone up.Security around the building has been upgraded, road signs installed and CCTV cameras set up in the area – all part of the renovations that President Trump says have cost a modest $400,000 (£295,000).After 14 months of rapid preparations, the consulate will be inaugurated to huge fanfare, with about 800 guests and a video address by President Trump beamed live around the world.The consulate building in Agron Road was constructed in 1868It was one of the first houses built outside Jerusalem\u0027s old city wallsThe original building had only two storeys a third was added in the early 20th centuryThe complex currently covers about 6,000 square metresPlans suggest it will be four times as big once converted, by the end of next yearRenovation work so far has cost £295,000The US government leases a second site in Jerusalem, in Nablus Road, providing visa services It will be a largely symbolic affair, however, because up to six more years of work are planned, including a 10ft perimeter wall, an opulent new chamber and several new floors – both upwards and underground – to house the 850 staff moving from Tel Aviv. Timed to coincide with the 70th anniversary of the founding of the state of Israel, the opening has been hailed as the beginning of a new quarter in Arnona, south Jerusalem, for embassies from countries around the world that will spring up there.We will soon see the true nature of Trump’s work in the Middle EastNew law allows Palestinians in Jerusalem to have residency strippedTrump says recognising Jerusalem as Israel’s capital ‘was wonderful\u0027“We might have to build dozens of embassies, and we would need new land ready for that purpose. I asked my ministry to vigorously take action as fast as possible, said construction minister Yoav Galant, The Jerusalem Post reported.Mr Galant even suggested possible names for the embassies area, the Post said. He initially called it “Embassy Town” but then decided he preferred “Trump Town” after the US president, who has deemed the city Israel’s capital. Ministers have already announced a new railway station near the Western Wall will be named after Mr Trump.The plan for the new consular facility was created and approved in little over a year thanks to the finance minister, Moshe Kahlon, exercising his authority to fast-track the process. And there will be celebrations aplenty on Monday.Many of those who know the site best, however, will not be joining in the festivities.When the rebuilding work begins in earnest, the embassy will be created in part by converting the Diplomat Hotel next door, which it also owns. The embassy will use the consulate building in the short term, but sources suggest the Diplomat is slated to house the embassy in the long run.For years, the hotel has been leased out as housing for about 450 elderly immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Now, the building is due to be demolished in two years’ time when the lease expires – and the residents have nowhere to go.Many of these men and women were doctors, musicians and academics in Russia before moving to Israel in the early 1990s, according to The Times of Israel. Some moved straight into the Diplomat and have never had any other home in the country. Most worked in minimum-wage jobs.Some of the former Soviet citizens are in their 90s and have had the anxiety of not knowing their fate hanging over them for four years, since they were warned in 2014 the hotel could close.Palestinians clash with Israeli troops during mass demonstrationsPalestinians clash with Israeli troops during mass demonstrationsPalestinian protesters flee from teargas Israeli soldiers stand as Palestinian protesters gather on the Israel Gaza borderA Palestinian is carried on a stretcher after being injured during the demonstrationIsraeli soldiers take aim as they lie prone over an earth barrier along the border with the Gaza strip in the southern Israeli kibbutz of Nahal Oz as Palestinians demonstrate on the other side commemorating Land DayPalestinian paramedics evacuate an injured man on the Gaza side of the Israel-Gaza borderPalestinians demonstrate with crossed-out posters depicting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US President Donald Trump, during a tent city protest near Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza StripPalestinian protesters flee from teargas Israeli soldiers shoot tear gas grenades towards the Palestinian tent city protest commemorating Land DayPalestinian protesters take cover from Israeli troopsPalestinians chant slogans as they attend a demonstration near the Gaza Strip borderWhen Mr Trump announced in December the embassy would move, it prompted shock and concern among both allies and critics because of the city’s contested status.The Palestinians want their own state with a capital in East Jerusalem, which Israel captured from Jordanian control in 1967, and many countries have been reluctant to endorse Mr Trump’s idea.However, in a confident gesture in advance of the embassy move, officials changed its Twitter name from USEmbassyTelAviv to USEmbassyJerusalem.The complex currently covers 6,000 square metres but blueprints given to planning authorities show it eventually covering about 20,000 square metres or more – four times the size. The US State Department says the new purpose-built building will be ​​a long-term project.According to Ynet News, the website of Yedioth Ahronoth, an Israeli newspaper, 20 planning companies and two New York firms were hired for the project. The US State Department usually employs selected American firms, but deviated from the norm by hiring an Israeli team, including architect Amir Mann and an Israeli contractor to carry out the work, it said.A five-storey structure was originally planned but to keep costs down the extra floors have not yet been completed, and the ambassador, David Friedman, will make only limited use of the embassy for now, using it for work but not yet moving in full-time.Both the Tel Aviv and Jerusalem consulates will provide passports and US visa services during the transition period.Neighbours have complained that the work, carried out under time pressures, could be environmentally unfriendly and risk going against planning and construction bylaws.But none is as worried as the 450 Russian residents.The job of finding a new home for them is down to Israel’s Immigrant Absorption Ministry.Ksenia Svetlova, a member of the Knesset, of the Zionist Union party, said the ministry has no set plan as to where or how the residents will be moved, and no estimate of potential costs or subsequent budget.She fears residents could be forced out before June 2020, when the lease expires.Just a few days before the historic opening of the beautiful United States Embassy in Jerusalem, Israel. So excited for the ceremony and proud of all the Embassy staff who worked so hard to make this event happen. Eternally grateful to President Trump for his courage and vision. pic.twitterpGVENzJlBtAbsorption Ministry spokeswoman Elisheva Cohen told the paper: “The ministry is working together in full cooperation with the relevant bodies in order to find an appropriate solution for the residents of the Diplomat compound and will make sure that no new immigrant will be left without a housing solution following June 20, 2020.”Meanwhile, the new embassy is inviting people to watch Monday’s opening ceremony live on its Facebook page.

Police make MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENT on homeless Then came the news he had changed his mind after a phone conversation with Meghan - but would still need the go-ahead from his doctors after suffering a heart attack last week. The former Suits actress could be forgiven for feeling she is losing control of her special day.But then if marrying into the Royal Family means also wedding yourself to centuries of tradition perhaps the nervous bride can take some comfort from the fact that even if dad is not there on Saturday royal weddings have a long history of mishaps.Distressing though the absence of her father might be for Meghan, back in 1328 Princess Philippa of Hainault had to contend not with a missing parent but a missing roof.Her wedding to Edward III was conducted in York Minster, which was still under construction and the happy couple were forced to say their vows in the middle of a snow storm.THROW IN THE TOWEL? Diana was talked into not pulling outMore recently the union of Prince Harry\u0027s mother and father in 1981 is still held up as the ultimate in royal pomp but the truth is it nearly didn\u0027t happen.Days before the ceremony Lady Diana, then just 20 years old, tried to call the whole thing off after discovering that her 32-year-old fianc\u0026eacute had not ended his affair with mistress Camilla Parker Bowles.She was convinced to change her mind by older sister Lady Sarah McCorquodale (coincidentally an old flame of Charles) who told Diana she had to go through with it because the tea towels are printed.Diana later fluffed her lines at the altar, pledging herself to Philip Charles Arthur George instead of Charles Philip Arthur George, prompting Prince Andrew to quip: You\u0027ve married his father.Royal weddings: The bride and groom with their bridal parties.                    PA1 of 10Royal weddings and their bridal partiesBut if Harry\u0027s mum came close to backing out of her wedding, in 2011 Princess Charlene of Monaco - then plain old Charlene Wittstock - is said to have made no fewer than three serious attempts to escape her marriage to Prince Albert.According to the French press she first tried to flee when visiting Paris to try on her wedding dress, before making a second bid for freedom during the Monaco Grand Prix.Then a week before she was due to walk up the aisle royal officials are said to have intercepted her en route to Nice airport and even confiscated her passport.The wedding went ahead, however, and the couple are still together though during the ceremony Charlene was pictured dabbing away tears.Tiaras, tulle and fairy tale flair are in full swing at a Royal Wedding                     PopperfotoGetty Images1 of 17Masahito, Prince Hitachi and Hanako Tsugaru (Hanako, Princess Hitachi) pictured together in ceremonial dress in Japan on the day of their wedding, 30th September 1964.Even the 70-year marriage of Meghan\u0027s new grandmother-inlaw and current Queen saw a few hitches on the big day.The ceremony came within a whisker of being delayed, first after courtiers had to battle through crowds to retrieve Elizabeth\u0027s necklace from St James\u0027s Palace and then after the frame of her diamond tiara snapped as her hairdresser attached the veil.At least Meghan can be sure her new husband loves her. Seven monarchs before Elizabeth and Prince Philip\u0027s wedding, the union of the future George IV and his cousin Princess Caroline of Brunswick in 1795 seemed to be doomed from the start.A dissolute, overweight drunkard, his happy day - and choice of bride - had been arranged by his father who demanded George wed her in return for paying off his debts.The couple married after having met just once. Upon laying eyes on his fianc\u0026eacutee for the first time George declared: I\u0027m not well! Get me a glass of brandy! It then emerged that he was already secretly married to one of his mistresses: Catholic widow Maria Fitzherbert.That wedding was quickly declared invalid according to the new Royal Marriages Act.After the service George is said to have spent the majority of the evening passed out in a drunken stupor on his bedroom floor.And even if things don\u0027t go according to plan on Saturday afternoon Meghan can be reassured that whatever happens her big day will be better than that of Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha who in 1736 married George IV\u0027s grandfather Frederick, Prince of Wales.Their wedding ceremony was a shambles.First Princess Augusta publicly begged her mother not to leave her at the altar and then, unable to speak a word of English, she had to have her vows shouted into her ear by Frederick so she could repeat them phonetically.As if all that was not spectacle enough she rounded off proceedings in technicolour style by vomiting all over her gown and her mother-in-law Queen Caroline.Now that really would be a day to remember."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/106/590x/Meghan-Markle-family-960452.jpg","title":"meghan markle family arrive london royal wedding","story":"Constant MediaMeghan\u0026rsquos sister-in-law Tracy and nephews Tyler and Thomas arrive in capitalMeghan\u0027s sister-in-law Tracy Dooley was pictured arriving at Heathrow with her sons Tyler and Thomas.Ms Dooley, who was married to Meghan\u0027s half-brother Thomas Jr, previously said she has not seen Meghan for 20 years.The Dooleys took to Facebook to announce their presence in the capital on Monday evening.Ms Dooley posted pictures of several landmarks, including the Palace of Westminster and London Eye, writing: We\u0027re here!

On Saturday at 11.59am precisely — these royal weddings really do run like Rolex watches — Thomas will meet his daughter at the West Door of St George’s Chapel, Windsor, and escort her to where her ginger Prince Charming is waiting.“Poor Pa Markle!” sighed one pundit. “A total nightmare!”I have a different prediction. This shy man with an allergy to publicity will tug on the heartstrings of the world at Meghan’s wedding to Harry.Because no matter how awkward it feels to be under the pitiless gaze of planet Earth, Thomas Markle is above and beyond all else, a proud and loving father.No matter how bashful his instincts may be, no matter how comfortable he was in obscure retirement in Rosarito, Mexico, I would bet my life that there was never a chance that he would miss his daughter’s wedding. Thomas Markle is clearly — and understandably — apprehensive about the big day.He has been seen in one of his local cafes in Mexico, head buried in a book called Images Of Britain. At an internet cafe, he stares with some bewilderment at the engagement photos of Meghan and Harry. But what father of the bride, any bride, would not feel a giddy cocktail of pride, anxiety and a touch of sadness at the prospect of walking his baby girl down the aisle?I doubt if he is enjoying the big build-up — having a wedding suit made to fit his bear-like frame, contemplating meeting the Queen, Prince Philip and the sprawling royal clan, and, horror of horrors, working out what to say when he rises to his feet to make that wedding speech.But Thomas Markle’s nerves about the big day do not make him a misfit or a freak. They make him gloriously human. Meghan Markle is loved because she brings some Hollywood flash to our staid, stoic, rather fusty Royal Family.But Meghan is also loved because she seems strangely familiar to us — a mixed-race child of divorced parents, divorced herself and a working woman who has fought hard for her success.Beyond the showbiz gloss, we have some understanding of the life of Meghan Markle. Because millions of our own lives are not so different.Because no matter how self-conscious this shy man feels taking to the global stage, his overwhelming emotions on his daughter’s wedding day will be love and pride. As any father of the bride will tell you, love and pride trump everything.IT is exciting news that Major League Baseball is coming to the capital for the first time next year, when the Boston Red Sox meet the New York Yankees at the London Stadium.  Mayor Sadiq Khan has worked hard to make this happen.WITH their fiery eyes and flashing thighs, female cadets in Vladimir Putin’s barmy Red Army look as though they are ready to invade somewhere.Possibly Stringfellows.WHAT makes Brexit inevitable is the total lack of respect shown to this country by Brussels since we decided to leave.German EU commissioner Gunther Oettinger sneers that Theresa May is “weak” and mocks Boris Johnson for having the same hair as Donald Trump.“That says everything,” sneers Herr Oettinger, 64, who once called a group of Chinese ministers “slitty-eyed” and has joked that gay marriage will become compulsory.And that says all you need to know about this buffoon. LABOUR’S Emily Thornberry has called for the Little Miss books to be renamed because they are sexist.“I don’t like this thing about being little,” says Emily. “I think that’s my problem with the Mr Men books.” Funny enough, that’s my problem with the Labour Party. The institutionalised sexism. The casual misogyny. The assumption that men should lead and the little ladies should tiptoe meekly behind.The Labour Party is at least as overtly sexist as the Little Miss books, Emily.The Tories are already on their second female Prime Minister while Labour have never even had a woman as their leader. Why not? It’s not as though the long line of miserable male mediocrities who have led Labour were much cop.It’s hard to believe that Barbara Castle or Yvette Cooper wouldn’t have done a better job of leading Labour than Foot, Kinnock, Brown, Miliband or Corbyn – who didn’t win one General Election between them.If Thornberry truly wants to prove that women can do anything that men can do, she should be demanding to know why no woman has ever led Labour in its 118-year-history.When washing down the next bacon butty, better stick to the decaffeinated coffee, Ed.SIR BOBBY ROBSON inspired the current managers of Manchester United and Manchester City, and inspired love in all who played for him from England to Barcelona, including Paul Gascoigne in his mercurial prime. Sir Bobby remains one of only two England managers to take our national team to a World Cup semi-final.The subject of a new feature film called Bobby Robson: More Than A Manager, Robson was clearly a wise and com-passionate man.In comparison, Sir Alf Ramse was a cold, distant and aloof figure with a robotic voice and a weird accent fabricated by elocution lessons. He went to school with my father – he should have talked like a Cockney, not the Duchess of Devonshire.But Sir Alf did it. He made the dream – that eternal dream of every England football fan – come true.So I have to beg to differ when Gary Lineker says that Sir Bobby Robson is the “best England manager of all time”. There is only one Sir Alf Ramsey.THE Met Gala is the most fashionable party in New York and this year the theme was Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination – inspiring a host of celebrities to bowl up in what looked like deeply religious lingerie. Rihanna was possibly a mini-skirted Pope or perhaps a cleavage-flashing cardinal. Katy Perry was an angel.Rosie Huntington-Whiteley had a golden halo and a neckline that skimmed her navel. Madonna wore a crown made of multiple crucifixes.It is true that these Big Apple fashionistas – the Met Gala is hosted by the editor of American Vogue, Anna Wintour – would not have taken the mick out of any non-Christian religion. But perhaps that is a compliment to Christianity. It can be mocked by empty-headed, attention-seeking celebrities and nobody gets a death threat. Perhaps all religions should be this tolerant.“I no longer want to continue life,” said Dr Goodall before he died. “I’m happy to have the chance to end it.”Every one of us should have that choice. Dr Goodall should never have been compelled to go to Switzerland.IN more than 50 years of going to watch football matches, I have still never had one of those mythical half-time pies. But man and boy, I have collected football programmes. What could be a more evocative memento of a match? An overpriced replica shirt? A polyester team scarf? A football programme is the next best thing to memories.But now, after more than a century of programmes being sold on match days, the English Football League will decide in June if it will continue to make it compulsory for clubs to produce them.In the age of social media, the death of football programmes makes sense, although 600,000 of them are still sold every weekend. But there will be a little less magic in the world if they are allowed to die.I still have my treasured copy of England v West Germany in the World Cup Final of 1966. Second-hand editions go for anything from £10 for a fake to £10,000 for the real thing.But to me, that programme is priceless.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Because it is supported by wooden peers.”The second chamber that acts within constitutional conventions is beneficial and helps prevent the “elected dictatorship” that our system of government can create.Asking the Government and the House of Commons to think again is both reasonable and valuable — it also has a distinguished history.As long ago as 1539, when Henry VIII was at his most powerful, the Lords amended his Act of Proclamation, which would have allowed monarchical despotism.This is the first example I know of the Upper House acting successfully as a revising chamber and preserving the nation’s liberties. The legislation was so ineffective that it was repealed eight years later.It is that act which spawned the expression “Henry VIII powers”, now used to describe the ability of ministerial action to amend the law.In the EU Withdrawal Bill, it is wholly unexceptional for the Lords to seek to reduce the number and extent of the Henry VIII powers available to the Government.These are technical issues when it is a matter of judgement as to where the balance between efficiency and process lies. It is not an attack on the democratic process or a power grab by an unelected chamber.This is not true of some of the other amendments passed against the withdrawal bill. There is a rule that the Lords does not oppose manifesto commitments.It was introduced in the 1940s to stop an inbuilt Tory majority blocking the then Labour government’s programme.It has relevance of a particular kind today when a Labour and LibDem majority could vote down any government proposal it dislikes.As was found in the 1940s, the Lords needs to observe this self-denying ordinance if it is to maintain credibility, otherwise it quickly becomes a matter of Peers against the People.In trying to insist on the UK remaining in a customs union, the Lords has overturned a specific manifesto promise by the Conservatives. Removing the date of departure — March 29, 2019 — similarly overturns an implicit guarantee in the same document.These are two of the most egregious breaches of the convention and raise the question: What is the Lords for?Tomorrow, it may be about to get worse. There is an amendment to the Data Protection Bill to require the Government to carry out Part Two of the Leveson Inquiry.This is in the name of Baroness Hollins, who has every right to feel her family was badly treated by the Press. And although I disagree with her, she deserves considerable sympathy because of what happened.Nonetheless, she is on dangerous constitutional ground.Page 80 of the Tory party manifesto says: “Given the comprehensive nature of the first stage of the Leveson Inquiry and the lengthy investigations by the police and Crown Prosecution Service into alleged wrongdoing, we will not proceed with the second stage of the Leveson Inquiry into the culture, practices and ethics of the Press.”This could not be clearer, yet the Lords are contemplating legislating to force this second stage upon the nation. It is a clear and outright tearing up of conventions.Unfortunately, it is even more serious than an arrogant desire to overrule a manifesto commitment — it is a proposal for the Lords to do the opposite of what it is there to do.The Lords ought to protect the liberties of the country against attempts by the government to erode them.It used to do this when it opposed extensions to detention without trial or efforts to reduce freedom of speech.Now it is suggested it will do the reverse to make our media less free and to ignore fundamental rights of justice.In just four years, the UK has already fallen ten places — from 30th to 40th — in the global rankings for free speech.Dozens of journalists have been put on trial and mainly acquitted for the reporting of stories involving the police and other public officials.The Leveson Inquiry was used to put journalists in the public pillory and now it is proposed that this should happen all over again.People who have been acquitted of a crime have nothing further to answer for and to demand they go on oath to rehash issues settled by a jury is the type of bullying of the Press normally seen in totalitarian states.If Lady Hollins’s amendment were passed, it would be giving in to the vested interests of the rich and powerful to punish newspapers which had exposed their peccadilloes.It would deter the Press from such fearless reporting in future and would be an attack on one of our most ancient and precious freedoms, a pillar of our constitution.A free Press must not be bullied or harried by those who do not like what it reports or else self-censorship will be the rule of the day.Fundamental questions will arise about the Lords if it ignores the constitutional conventions, sets Peers against the People and, instead of being the bulwark against an over-mighty Government becomes the cheerleader for censorship.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She needs to solve the housing crisis.The number of people renting in their 30s, 40s, and 50s has nearly doubled in the past decade. Home ownership is at a 30-year low.The average home costs almost eight times average earnings, 11 in London.Brickies and nurses need six- figure deposits to get on the ladder.New Housing Secretary James Brokenshire needs to get radical to solve the issue.The Treasury should find the cash to unleash a building programme.Archaic planning laws need to be scrapped, too. The housing crisis cannot be fixed without building on some of the Green Belt.Construction firms who sit on land to keep supply low and prices high should also be fined to force them to build.The Government was right to slash stamp duty for first-time buyers, but it needs shaking up across the board. Cutting it would encourage older people to downsize and help families upsize.Most people under 40 are not socialists, just smitten by Jeremy Corbyn’s promise of freebies.

It is enforceable.If foam-flecked ex-Labour leader Ed Miliband gets his way, we won’t be able to write it, either.We won’t be able to expose silly hypocrisy like this, let alone the misdeeds and corruption of those who abuse their power over us.We could soon be kissing goodbye to 300 years of Press freedom, the cornerstone of democracy.Red Ed’s campaign to curb newspapers might be applauded by the young voters Labour is seeking to cultivate — ­millennial “snowflakes” who cannot be in the same room as someone with a different point of view.They demand “safe spaces” to protect their sensitive souls or, better, a total ban on speakers they dislike.The attack on Press freedom by Labour — and, to their ­eternal shame, some Tories — is simply a monstrous extension of this intolerance.How can we have come within nine votes of state ­censorship?Soon we may be breaking a law if we fail to say “please” or “thanks” to ­someone who labels themselves a “victim” or a “survivor”.Survivors used to be people who escaped mortal danger.Today, they include anyone ­subjected to heavy-handed ­flirtation or mild embarrass-ment.This is one-way traffic.Self-proclaimed victims or survivors can say anything they like. They are exempt from ­criticism.Only whites can be racist. Only men can be sexist.All white men are “privileged” — another invented offence — ­simply because they are white and male.This group is decreed by the Left to embrace all Tories who, by definition, are “scum”. Only Tories can be cruel.Schools might churn out 16-year-olds who can’t read or write but that is apparently because Tories support ­grammar schools, not because left-wing teaching unions ­outlawed classroom ­discipline.A tower-block inferno could have erupted in Labour- controlled Islington but fate picked Kensington and “evil” Tories are now forever ­identified with the incineration of poor immigrants.The NHS is in crisis — and has been under every ­government for the past 30 years.But despite pouring ­billions into healthcare, Tory “scum” are to blame.Labour delivered mass ­immigration but it is the “vile” Tories who failed to see we would need extra houses, schools and hospitals.Welfare was out of control but it was “callous” Tories who swapped jobs for benefits.Now, preposterously, the United Nations apparently agrees.After a brief flying visit — and without a shred of ­evidence — the UN’s racism busybody, Zambian Tendayi Achiume, says we are a racist nation in breach of international human rights laws, thanks to Brexit and austerity.Has she been to Europe recently, where attitudes to immigration suggest Britain is in fact a haven of tolerance and integration?Luckily, ­people are not ­stupid. They can sniff ­hypocrisy.So it is refreshing to see, in poll after poll, they put those evil Tory scum running this country ahead of saintly Jezza’s Labour Party.Can I say that?Tessa’s political achievements were significant, not least London’s 2012 Olympics triumph.But what set her apart was her role as good- natured peacemaker and cross-party conciliator.In the Blair-Brown years she was a smiling bridge builder for the embattled Blair government, not just with the press but with members of other ­parties who now mourn her death.This talent is now vanishingly rare.Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour could learn a lot from her example of old-fashioned give and take across the political divide.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It took only days for peers to resurrect it.Another inquiry would be an obscene waste of time and money and serves no purpose. The public do not want it. Even  opposes it.It’s not hard to see why some peers might have a vested interest in silencing the media.Some have been exposed by the Press for wrongdoing — whether it was fiddling their expenses or having extra-marital affairs.And many of the Labour peers rooting for it believe their party has been unfairly covered in the media.They want newspapers they can tame into giving them an easy ride. Well, that is not the role of the Press in a democracy.The Leveson inquiry and subsequent police probes cost taxpayers more than £48million after dozens of failed trials against journalists.Leveson’s 2012 report ran to 1,987 pages and contained over a million words. What do these peers seriously think is left to learn?They are foolish, too, to think the media landscape looks as it once did. Today, Facebook and Google dominate. Most newspapers belong to IPSO, a self-funded, independent regulator that holds the Press to account more than any regulator before.Then again, this is not really about probing the relationship between cops and the Press, or phone-hacking. That is a Trojan horse.These politicians, with their celebrity pals at Hacked Off, really just want to see newspapers neutered. This must not be allowed to happen.Traditionally, the House of Lords respects the Government’s manifesto commitments. The Tory manifesto said they would not pursue the second part of Leveson.

In the past four years, we have fallen from 30th to 40th. “Leveson 2” would mean we shamefully fall even further.Our free Press may not be perfect, but it noisily holds power to account.

Everyone cheers.He does a fist pump to his mates and she pulls down her boob tube, flashing her breasts at her girlfriends.The same guy went on to have sex with five other women that evening.By the end of the night he was rubbing cocaine on his willy to try to maintain an erection.Over one summer I saw people having sex on stage, witnessed vast quantities of alcohol downed in seconds and dodged more puke on pavements in one hour than an A\u0026ampE nurse cleans up over New Year’s Eve.It might sound depraved and debauched but the fortnight rite of passage ensured those same kids returned home as smarter and wiser adults.Over the years I have made ­countless 18-30-based documentaries around the Med.The behaviour is wilder and more X-rated than any brochure can suggest — without it being relegated to the top shelf.That’s why I am gutted that there is a question mark dangling over the experience Club 18-30 owners Thomas Cook said this week it is “exploring options” for the brand’s future, including a possible sale.Naysayers may comment “bloody good riddance” to the iconic institution that sticks two fingers up to political correctness. But I disagree.Back in the Eighties and Nineties there were no low-cost flights to Alicante or flight-comparison websites.Instead the entire package tour was laid on for you — and there were zero complaints.The hotels were laughably basic. The food was about as foreign as a Maccy D’s.The pools often had more than lilos floating in them. But none of that mattered.The “factory fortnight” annual leave was when things really kicked off in resorts such as Ibiza’s San Antonio and Corfu’s Kavos.When the night flights churned out the up-for-it guys and girls, most didn’t bother going to bed.When you arrived the reps flogged you the tours that went with the holiday — the bar crawls, booze cruises and wet T-shirt contests.In reality, the price of the add-on excursions doubled the cost of the holiday. But no one cared because to decline was to miss out on the opportunity for lots of sex.Sex underpins the 18-30 experience and the games designed by the reps encourage it.Whether it is passing a water-filled condom down a line using only your thighs, or timing who can put the condom on an oiled courgette the quickest.To be a holiday rep you need the drinking stamina of an elephant and the energy of the Duracell bunny. Many burned out or got kicked out and sent back to the UK. Holiday reps aren’t supposed to shag one another — obviously that rule goes out the window the second the plane lifts off from Britain.In every resort I have filmed at, the reps have kept score of the ­number of women they had sex with. Did the girls know this? Absolutely. Did they care? No.Is it a suspect institution rotten to the core? Nope. What I saw is that underneath the sex, the dubious games and the round-the-clock drinking was an 18-30 safety net that protected men and women on ­holiday. The bar crawls were staffed by dozens of reps ensuring everyone got safely from one pub to another.Admittedly by the end of each bar crawl it wasn’t unusual to see couples attempting to have sex against the bar, someone crashed out on the pavement in his urine-stained jeans or a girl face down in a goldfish-sized cocktail bowl of her own vomit.But the purpose of the night was to consume enough shots to fill an Olympic-sized swimming pool — and make it out alive afterwards.The opportunity for sex is jumped on every minute of the day. I made the mistake of meeting the groups I was filming for a morning-after catch-up.I soon stopped using my universal door card key — because I’d often interrupt a couple in the kitchen, the loo or even on the balcony going at it hell for leather.The same women who prefer the missionary position and the lights off in the bedroom back in the UK don’t give a monkeys when they are away.It can be the only reason so many willingly enter the wet T-shirt competitions.My theory is the more that a girl says “no way” the more likely you are to see her on stage, arms in the air, egging the crowd on with her soaked top clinging to her braless boobs.Us Brits are certainly not afraid to get wet and wildInclude a contact number and any pics when emailing into features@the-sunWho are we to judge if — for some women — there is something empowering about a bloke pouring a jug of water over her nipples? No one was forced to do it, either.While filming a beach sunrise, I got used to seeing women doing the walk of shame to their hotel. Sick in their hair, one shoe missing but usually with a cheeky smile on their faces. Sloping off to do the deed in the dunes And the beaches get busier when the sun goes down. While on a pub crawl it is easier to slope off to the sandy stretches than it is to bonk in an awkward, tiny loo with pee all over the floor.We could always tells those who had done the deed in the dunes — bites on their legs and sand burns on their knees. My favourite nights to film were out with groups of girls. “We’re not here for a long time, we’re here for a good time!” was the motto of one lot I followed.Make no mistake. Every girl had already earmarked their target.Getting ready and the female camaraderie was just as important as the night out itself. And if you didn’t get laid? You always had a mate to walk back to the apartment with. Perhaps the most outrageous nights were the foam parties.When the soapy liquid was fired over the dance floor it was as though a “have sex now!” klaxon had sounded. Clothes would regularly be lost in the foam. More than once I saw women in a panic because after the foam had evaporated they had nothing to wear to go home in.It wasn’t all sex, either. During one season a couple had a holiday romance and got engaged on the dance floor. On another island I’ve seen a holiday rep have the confidence to come out. For those who went home without a tan it was to be celebrated.But in the middle of the chaos, these holidays are a rite of passage that forge friendships, teach kids about responsibility and let them make the mistakes that turn teenagers into adults — and I for one am sad to see them go.FOR decades Club 18-30 promised a debauched week of sun, sea and sex.For many it was their first ever trip abroad, delivering cheap, basic accommodation and the freedom to misbehave with impunity (and no chance of an embarrassing Facebook post alerting folks back home).Fast forward through the decades and today’s Millennial youngsters are light years ahead of their parents. They’ve been on umpteen foreign holidays with their families and got used to decent hotels and great pools.So now our sophisticated young travellers are looking further – and wanting more. The success of TV show Love Island conjoured up the paradise excess they all wanted to emulate.Add to that Instagrammers bragging about their global travels and Snapchat feeds full of celebs living it large in luxury and today’s youngsters aren’t satisfied with a dodgy 2H hotel in Malia and a pub crawl up Bar Street.Today’s youngsters with limited budgets are savvy enough to know how to book a holiday on one of the many online travel agencies.Thomas Cook is now targetting the Millennials with money who want to be seen in the right resorts with plenty of selfie-perfect settings.It’s new Cook’s Club hotels – the first of which will open in Crete this summer – will offer urban-cool, stylish rooms, decent food and chilled tunes around a signature pool.Thomas Cook wants to ditch the lower end of the market to concentrate on those aspiring Millennials prepared to dig deeper to emulate their social media idols.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

MPs have voted twice to reject a backward-looking, disproportionate and costly Leveson 2 inquiry.We would now urge the House of Lords to respect the wishes of the elected House.The Government win came after Culture Secretary Matt Hancock vowed to carry out a regular review of how the media handles sensitive data in a last-ditch attempt to head off a Commons rebellion.He also said ministers would act if the press self-regulation regime appeared to stop working well in future.Mr Hancock told MPs: “We have gone out of our way to offer concessions at every stage to make sure the system of press regulation is both free and fair.What we propose with this set of amendments is that this house can continue to debate and scrutinise the effectiveness of the self-regulation of the press, without requiring statutory regulation which we seek to avoid.Now is the time to look forward, not back and come together to build a vibrant, free and fair press that holds the powerful to account and rises to the challenges of our time.He was speaking after the House of Lords last night voted to hold a re-run of the Leveson Inquiry even though it had already been rejected by the Commons.Peers decision to back a controversial amendment to the Data Protection Bill meant that MPs had to vote again even though theyd already rejected the plans.Last week, the Commons narrowly voted against an almost identical amendment, proposed by ex-Labour boss Ed Miliband.But the margin of victory was just nine votes - raising hopes among anti-press campaigners that they could win over enough MPs to change the result second time around.Mr Hancocks last-minute offer of a new amendment enshrining regular reviews of the media was designed to convince the Commons there is no need for a full-blown inquiry which could drag on for years.It seemed to work - as the Governments winning margin increased from nine votes to 12.Speaking as MPs debated this afternoon, ex-Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said anti-press campaigners only wanted to get even with the media by holding a Leveson re-run.Tory MP Peter Bone - one of five Conservative rebels in last week’s vote - switched sides in today’s vote.He suggested that it was wrong for the Lords to defy the wishes of the Commons because Theresa May vowed not to hold a “Leveson 2” inquiry in her election manifesto last year.The only Tory rebels today were veteran Ken Clarke, Crispin Blunt and Philip Hollobone, as Dominic Grieve chose to abstain rather than opposing the Government.Senior backbencher John Redwood said in the Commons that the peers’ vote was “rather undemocratic”, adding: “They dont like results of referendums, they dont like the EU Withdrawal Bill... and now they want to regulate the press because the press points out the errors of their ways.”The Lords vote came despite senior peers warning their colleagues they risked undermining Britain’s tradition of the free press by holding a re-run of the inquiry.VOTED IN FAVOUR OF LEVESON 2 (291)Diane Abbott (Labour - Hackney North and Stoke Newington)ABSTAINED IN TODAYS VOTE (44)Ian Austin (Labour, Dudley North) - PREVIOUSLY SUPPORTED LEVESON 2(Note: those abstaining includes MPs unable to vote because they are absent or ill. Does not include the Speaker and three Deputy Speakers, who dont vote, or seven Sinn Fein MPs, who refuse to take their seats.)Viscount Colville said: “Even the prospect of the bar being raised will have a chilling effect on investigative journalism.”And Lord Hunt added: “I suspect what lies behind this amendment is yet another attempt to exercise some statutory controls or levers over our free media.”The House of Lords will technically be able to push the Leveson 2 amendment again when the bill returns from the Commons - but it is highly unlikely they will seek to defy MPs for a second time.Despite being a well-paid columnist until last year, he hates newspapers for revealing he had an affair using his government-owned flat.LORD KERSLAKE: The former head of the civil service now advises Jeremy Corbyn and Labour, but press revealed he was nicknamed “Bungalow Bob” by staff as there was “not much upstairs.”Never far from the headlines after his bungling in Whitehall and later as an NHS Trust chief.PETER HAIN:The Labour arch-remoaner was forced to resign as Transport Secretary in 2008 in a scandal about undeclared donations from rich donors.He was left red faced after he put an expensive new roof for his “log store” on his expenses.LORD MENDELSOHN:The Labour big-hitter was forced to quit the frontbench in January after the press revealed he attended the controversial President’s Club Ball.Female waitresses were groped and harrassed at the all-male charity dinner that rocked the City.LORD MACLEAN:The former Tory whip led the charge to have MPs exempt from Freedom of Information laws when he was in the Commons.And he was a key player in trying to block the publication of MPs expenses ahead of the devastating 2009 scandal.BARONESS CHAKRABARTI: Corbynista peer Shami was accused of whitewashing antisemitism in the Labour Party in a duff report published shortly before she was ennobled.Exposed as a hypocrite for sending her son to £18,000-per-year private school after attacking grammar schools for being unfair."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/tp-graphic-unemployment-rate.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"employment rate soars to record high as wages pace ahead of inflation","story":"The number of people out of work dropped 46,000 to 1.42million, latest Office for National Statistics figures revealed yesterday.Employment is also at the highest since records began in 1971 with 75.6 per cent in a job.Numbers in work rose 179,000 to 32.34million, with 2,000 people finding work each day.The plunge in unemployment - to just 4.2 per cent - comes as the number of EU nationals working in the UK fell for the first time in eight years.In the three months to March there were around 2.29million EU workers — down 28,000 on the same period last year.The drop was fuelled by 91,000 workers leaving from eight Eastern European countries that joined the EU in 2004, such as Poland and Hungary.The net number of Brits employed rose 417,000 to a record 28.73million.Experts said it was too early to say if Brits were finding jobs due to fewer migrants. Pro-EU campaign groups warned of a Brexodus brain drain.But Alp Mehmet, of Migration Watch, said: “There are tentative signs that businesses may be turning to the domestic workforce.”Average earnings excluding bonuses also rose by 2.9 per cent — outstripping inflation.Chancellor Philip Hammond said: “Growth in real wages means people are starting to feel the benefit of more money in their pockets.”The Resolution think tank warned pay was still around £730 a year lower than a decade ago.But Gerard Lyons, chief economist at NetWealth, said the “great” job figures showed how wrong Remain campaigners had been with their warnings about how a Brexit vote would cripple the economy.He said: “Project Fear’s warnings look more ridiculous by the day.”Official figures yesterday showed the employment rate among 16 to 64-year-olds was 80 per cent for the first time since 1991.The Office for National Statistics said more blokes than ever were working beyond traditional retirement age, with 731,000 over-65s clocking on.A record 71.2 per cent of working age women have a job, the ONS added.

There could be a little bit of mist early on but that will burn off relatively quickly.The main uncertainty is cloud cover, with fair weather cloud developing through the afternoon - its temperature driven.At the moment the average temperature looks like 19C to 20C (68F) but up to 23C is possible.The amount of sunshine and cloud cover will determine whether we get those upper temperatures.Most of

twice a month.The study was commissioned by American Express to celebrate the launch of its new brand campaign and understand more about how the support of others can help propel you forward.Digital entrepreneur Jamal Edwards, who is working with American Express on the launch of its new campaign, said: “Having the support of others can be instrumental to success, but it’s not always about having friends in high places.Support can come from anywhere and more often than not it’s people you’ve known all your life.’’The study also found for nearly half of Brits (47 per cent) this social support network has become more important today than ever before.More than a third put this down to busier lives while 28 per cent blamed an increased pressure to succeed.According to the data, Brits believe having a support network around you is one of the most important factors to self-achievement.Additionally, the research identified the support network is primarily made up of a “backer” (64 per cent), a “comforter” (62 per cent) and a “cheerleader” (62 per cent).It also consists of a “constructive critic” (45 per cent) and a “big picture thinker” (40 per cent).Jamal Edwards, who is also the founder of SBTV, a British company run by a small team of young people working on web-based content, added:  “I’ve relied on my parents more than anyone else.“They’ve helped back me on many occasions and

to the Wonsan international tourist zone.Now high-resolution photos from Skysat show the North Korean dictator is following through on his promise.Pictures from the ground show buildings tens of stories high, meaning the entire resort could house tens of thousands of people.Meanwhile time-lapse imagery suggests the work began almost immediately after Kims speech and has been carried out at a rapid pace.It shows temporary shelters and workers facilities springing up along the coast between January and February.Photos even show floodlights being erected all over the beach so construction can continue at night time.North Korean soldiers are often drafted in to work on such projects, according to NK news, which says the resort could be completed as early as March.With tourism one being one of the few industries not targeted by US sanctions, experts believe the resort is aimed at making money through tourism.Wonsan and Kalma airport are also important defence areas, used for large-scale artillery drills and as the launch site for dozens of missile tests in recent years.In April last year, Kim used the same beach near Wonsans new airport to unleash an artillery drill

Looking like a giraffe was found to be a turn-off too.That may not come as a surprise to 6ft 7in Crouchie, 37, who nonetheless is married to model Abbey Clancy, 32.When he was once asked what he would be if he were not a footballer, he quipped: “A virgin.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Two Home Secretaries, the Immigration Minister and officials claimed they didn’t know there had been any wrongful deportations.“Last week they claimed there were only a handful – now we find out that it’s at least 63 – and that’s only Windrush cases.”The confession follows weeks spent by Home Office officials suggesting no Windrush-era immigrants had been wrongly deported.The scandal exploded into light last month when Commonwealth leaders slammed Downing Street for refusing them a meeting with Theresa May over the crisis during the Commonwealth Summit.Amber Rudd resigned as Home Secretary after mistakenly telling the Home Affairs Select Committee the Home Office didn’t use immigration removal targets.Mr Javid yesterday said the department was now investigating a potential 4,482 Windrush cases, where citizens needed to be given a permanent leave to remain. So far just 526 have been given the necessary documents. The new Home Secretary also risked a backlash from Theresa May by saying he wouldn’t be using the term “hostile environment” that she adopted in her spell at the Home Office – saying the term hostile was “unBritish”.He separately hinted a new policy paper on post-Brexit immigration could be brought forward to as early as July.Last night Labour’s Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott demanded justice for the Windrush generation.She blasted: “The hostile environment created by Theresa May has led to illegal deportations of lawful citizens.“Their lives have been potentially destroyed and uprooted because of this Government’s immigration policies.“Apologies and empty words of sympathy are not enough to undo the damage and great pain that has been caused to an entire community.”Home Affairs Select Committee chair Yvette Cooper said there were still many unanswered questions over Windrush.She added: “It is shocking to find that 63 people may have been wrongly removed or deported and troubling that they have not yet been contacted.“It was also significant that the Home Secretary admitted they have no way of knowing either how many Windrush cases may have lost their homes and jobs.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A senior female member of staff discovered “inappropriate material of a sexual nature” in their station cupboard.That is, she found a pair of novelty tea mugs which featured nude women with the crew members’ heads super-imposed on them.They had swapped them as secret Santa gifts.Four other crew members have resigned in protest at the sackings, locals have started a petition to reinstate the pair and long-term donors have threatened to withdraw funding. But the RNLI insists it has not gone overboard. A statement claims the incident was “not trivial” as the saucy mugs presented a “safeguarding breach”.“Safeguarding” in this context clearly has nothing to do with the physical safety of those at risk of drowning, ostensibly the remit of the RNLI. One of the offenders had 15 years’ experience of saving lives at sea, which he is now forbidden to make use of.Apparently, safeguarding the emotional safety of any potential offence-taker is more important. Similarly, few will be surprised to hear of a humour deficit in academia. But one incident shows that a poorly received joke is no laughing matter.At the annual meeting of the International Studies Association (ISA) in San Francisco, some scholars found themselves in a crowded hotel lift. Simona Sharoni, a professor of women’s and gender studies at Merrimack College in Massachusetts, offered to press the buttons for her colleagues.Richard Ned Lebow, a political scientist at King’s College London, jokingly asked to be let off at the “ladies’ lingerie” department. It was a fairly standard, if old-fashioned, gag. But Sharoni claims that “as a survivor of sexual harassment”, she was “quite shaken by this incident”. Later that day she lodged a formal complaint.Hearing she had done it, Lebow attempted to reach out to her, writing that: “Like you, I am strongly opposed to the exploitation, coercion or humiliation of women.”However, making such a “frivolous” complaint, he argued, risked diverting attention from “the real offences that trouble us both”. By describing the obviously frivolous complaint as frivolous, he aggravated matters further, it seems. Sharoni hit back, saying she “cannot and will not remain silent when misogyny is at play”.She was not alone in confusing a harmless attempt at humour with a hatred for womankind.Last week, the ISA upheld her complaint, ordering Lebow to write an “unequivocal apology” for his “offensive and inappropriate” joke or face disciplinary action.To his credit, he has refused to comply and denounced the ISA’s ruling as a “horrifying and chilling example of political correctness” that “encourages others to censor their remarks for fear of retribution”.No reasonable adult of sound mind, with any experience of real life, could possibly find Lebow’s joke about ladies’ lingerie offensive, let alone misogynistic. But policing of such saucy jokes is more common than you would think.Free Speech University Rankings, recently revealed by online free speech website Spiked, showed some British universities and students’ unions have bans on offensive jokes and banter — usually as part of their policies against sexual harassment.And it is not just jobsworth bosses, snow- flake students and highly strung academics taking offence at harmless banter — as saucy puns can even become a police matter. A butcher in Staffordshire was recently rapped by the police for the innuendo-laden signs outside his shop.Slogans promoting “big-breasted birds”, “big cocks” and offers to “have your rump tenderized” have adorned his boards for ten years. No member of the public felt sufficiently offended to complain to the police in that time.Nevertheless, the local police chief inspector warned the butcher to “give careful consideration” to his slogans, in case anyone takes offence in future. The joyless claims that smutty humour constitutes sexual harassment, a safe- guarding breach or any tangible harm whatsoever, are certainly worthy of ridicule.But when jokes no naughtier than Victorian postcards can see people disciplined and sacked, and innuendos no saucier than a Carry On one-liner draw the attention of the police, we need to get serious about defending smut.Fraser Myers writes for spiked-online, where this article also appears.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You will see thousands of police as you approach the stadium.“You will be walking down avenues of police with shields, helmets and guns.”Chief Inspector Joseph Stokoe, of the Met Police and head hooligan spotter in Russia, added : “People need to be aware that the numbers of police and military that you will see at games will frankly be off the scale as to what you see in the UK.”British police say the chances of violence at matches will be “remote.”Football policing boss Mr Roberts said : “Russia is committed to providing a safe haven and a festival of football.“Notwithstanding everything else that is going on, we do have a shared interest in this,” he said in reference to the Salisbury poisoning of Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, and Boris Johnson’s comparison of Vladimir Putin to Hitler.At a briefing held at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in Westminster yesterday, Mr Roberts outlined the punishment awaiting hooligans falling foul of local Russian cops.At the minor end of the scale, touts face a £20,000 fine and deportation for every ticket they are caught selling while petty offences are punishable with 15 days imprisonment and a £291 fine.Individual hooligans causing trouble face five years hard labour in a detention centre, 480 hours of community service and a £5,825 fine.Anyone caught and convicted of mass disorder will be sentenced to between eight and 15 years hard labour and 10 years in a modern day gulag for assaulting anyone in authority, such as a cop or soldier.Up to 10,000 England fans are expected to travel to Russia, despite the paltry allocation of official tickets, through the FA.Just 1,460 tickets have been allocated to England for the Tunisia match, 1,772 for the second group game against Panama in Nizhny Novgorod on June 24 and 2,359 for the final encounter four days later against Belgium in Kalinigrad, on the Polish border.Mr Roberts warned that any fans travelling without a ticket for the World Cup would be unlikely to be granted a visa to enter Russia.He also pointed out the logistical problems caused by the “huge distances” between cities and shortage of available accommodation.A total of 1,751 football banning orders have been issued by courts against yobs who must surrender their passports in advance of the tournament.Spotters from the UK Football Policing Unit are being deployed at UK ports to watch for hardcore thugs trying to sneak out of the country and will also be on the ground in Russia to engage with fans.Police chief Mr Roberts said the main concern were middle-of-the road fans who end up drinking too much and causing trouble rather than known hooligans.He said : “They are the people who there with a stag party excess...this gives me a degree of concern.”Warning of the particular concern about offence being caused in Volgograd and at its commemorative sites, he added : “Any student of history will know Russian casualties during World War Two were horrific.“If people from any other country got drunk and placed their flag on the Cenotaph it would make the locals here angry.”Kevin Miles, chief executive of the England Supporters’ Federation, has visited the cities where the Three Lions are playing, and said : “We have to treat the place with respect.“It is one thing to hang a flag up in a bar where the landlord has been taking your money.“But it is quite another to put in a place of particular sensitivity.“We want to be treated as welcome guests.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She’s been devastated by what’s happened.“After the revelation he had staged those paparazzi pictures, she has felt so let down and majorly questioned his loyalties.“He collaborated with the Press yet never condemned the actions of his other children Samantha and Junior, who were forever publicly disparaging Meghan.”While history has taught us is that the royals are adept at looking after themselves, this latest episode has left many wondering: just who is looking out for Thomas Markle?Clearly, the retired Hollywood lighting director has been left to fend for himself.Palace sources indicate that he was offered significant help and advice — but he turned it down.They also suggested that Meghan, 36, and Harry, 33, had tried to contact him before she finally got through yesterday.Thomas said he had not heard from his younger daughter after it made global news that he was not going to the wedding.But he said he had changed his mind after Meghan had called him.As for the advice — maybe it was never offered or perhaps he refused it as a proud man who believed he could handle the pressure.Either way, the Palace suits should have stayed in close contact because they must know the pressure is worse than he expected.Now he’s so anxious he’s been “popping Valium for the pain, especially when I hear about my oldest daughter”.That is Samantha Markle — Meghan’s estranged half-sister who hasn’t seen her for ten years and is not invited.She has been shading Meghan as a “pushy princess” at every opportunity.And why no intervention from the Palace?Why has no one flown over to collect him, protect him behind castle gates and show some ­concern for a vulnerable man with heart problems?Where did it all go wrong and who to believe in this sorry saga?Thomas Markle Snr was a successful lighting director, but obviously bad with money.After his retirement he declared himself bankrupt in 2016 with credit card debts of £24,181 and savings of just £160.He moved to tiny Rosarito just across the US border with Mexico, hiding from the world in a ­ramshackle cliff-top house and not socialising with any of the expats.Thomas was so upset after he was pictured earlier this year looking dishevelled, he wanted to control the narrative.He colluded with a photo agency to get shots of him being measured for a suit, working out, reading a book on English history and looking at internet ­pictures of Harry and Meghan.Then came the bombshell revelation that he was so embarrassed to have been rumbled taking cash for the snaps, that he was pulling out of the wedding.Princess Diana’s best friend Rosa Monckton helped her pal dodge the paparazzi — but also knew how she used them for her own ends.Rosa told The Sun: “He strikes me as a man who is out of his depth at every level on this and I don’t judge him at all.“They should have advised him to hide up somewhere until after the wedding. He’s obviously very vulnerable and I don’t know what could have been done or should have been done to offer him more advice and protection.”So should that advice have come from Meghan — the actress with a grasp of the pitfalls of global fameTo answer that you need to understand their up-and-down relationship. Thomas was overjoyed at the birth of his baby girl with second wife Doria Ragland and appears to have been a positive role model for Suits star Meghan.Meghan has credited her dad — who won two Emmys — with being a huge influence on her career.Describing him as “hardworking” and “caring”, she has said that he “invested in my future so that I could grow up to have so much”.For a man from a poor family who grew up on simple dinners of “potatoes and spam”, this was helped by a £500,000 lottery win when Meghan was nine. Her half-brother Tom Jnr said: “That money allowed Meg to go to the best schools and get the best training”.Thomas Snr overcame the racial prejudice of others to marry an African-American and helped develop his daughter’s social conscience.He and Doria got hitched in 1979 but separated when Meghan was six.However, Thomas stayed in close contact with his daughter.Meghan recalled him buying a white Barbie family set and a black Barbie family — splitting them up to make “her” family. But as a teenager she didn’t want to see her father.Driving through her home city of Los Angeles aged 18 with then-best friend Ninaki Priddy, she said she would not visit her dad as they “weren’t on the best of terms”.But a post Meghan sent to her dad on Instagram on Father’s Day 2016 showed the extent of his influence on her and her love for him.She declared: “To this day your hugs are still the very best in the whole wide world. Thanks for my work ethic, my love of Busby Berkeley films and club sandwiches, for teaching me the importance of handwritten thank-you notes, and for giving me that signature Markle nose. I love you xo — Bean.” It was accompanied by a photo showing Meghan as an infant laying on her father’s chest.But a friend said of Thomas: “He’s always been a bit of a slob, selfish with no emotional intelligence.“They didn’t really connect when she was growing up as a girl and didn’t bond when she was a woman.“There were periods when they were closer — he helped her move to Toronto when she started Suits (in 2012). But as he’s become older he’s become much more reclusive.“The man he is today is not the man he was even ten, 15 years ago. He just eats junk food, sleeps in, drinks and reads.“She has helped him many times financially. But there just comes a point when you have to let go.“Not exactly wash her hands of him but there is only so much she can do.“Hence why she didn’t feel Harry had to meet him or that she needed her dad’s approval to get married.”Thomas is now saying he will make the wedding — as long as doctors allow him to fly. Let’s hope for Meghan’s sake he does.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Holmes who owned a hotel in Chicago who created a factory of death to murder the innocents who visited the fair.He was the first serial killer, he claims, adding that he was a pure evil genius.Her half-sister Samantha Markle also spoke of her relationship with the Royal bride and her own relationship with her husband before telling the host her husband is addicted to tabloid stories about Meghan and Samantha, and slammed rumours she was writing a tell-all.Amelia travelled across America to track down significant people from Meghan’s past and met members of her extended family.At its heart, the wedding is a story of two people in love, but the couples union allowed Amelia to explore a wide range of subjects and will ask what the Americans really think of Meghan joining the Royal Family.On her documentary, the host says: “Exploring Meghan Markle’s America was a crazy journey for me.

He had told friends that he wanted to come with the peace gesture for an appeasement before the wedding and his daughters big day, but his recent actions have crushed that.The source added: The couple were also at odds with one another because of his other children speaking out so disrespectfully about Meghan in the last year.She had asked him to have them not do so, but little changed.Their divorce was quite acrimonious, and they really lived very separate lives and would only connect when necessary.Meghans estranged family certainly havent been shy at speaking out about the US actress ahead of the royal wedding.Her half-brother Thomas Jr even wrote an open letter to Prince Harry, telling the 33-year-old royal to call off the upcoming nuptials, blasting it as a fake fairy tale.Thomas letter, published in In Touch Weekly, warned: As more time passes to your royal wedding it becomes very clear that this is the biggest mistake in royal history.Half-sister Samantha Markle has also not held back in discussing Meghan and was even labelled a vulture by Piers Morgan for continually criticising the actress.After Meghan wore a £56,000 designer dress for her engagement photo, Samantha Markle, 52, said: If you can spend $75,000 on a dress, you can spend $75,000 on your dad.Some family members are also expected to cash in on the Royal Wedding, with a Channel 4 documentary giving an insight into Prince Harrys future in-laws.Her family members were also pictured arriving in London, drafted in as special correspondents for Good Morning Britain for the big day.But Meghans support system has also started to fly into the UK, with best pal Jessica Mulroney arriving at London Heathrow last night.The support couldnt come at a better time for Meghan, with the US actress having had to beg her dad to come to her wedding after TMZ revealed he would not be walking her down the aisle.The 73-year-old recluse had initially intended on being by his daughters side but pulled out after it was revealed he had staged photographs with paparazzi - later admitting they were stupid and hammy.He soon changed his mind, telling TMZ: I hate the idea of missing one of the greatest moments in history and walking my daughter down the aisle.”But he again did an about-face, revealing that he needed urgent heart surgery and would not be able to fly to the UK for the wedding - or to meet his future son-in-law and the royal family.Thomas later said that he believed Doria would be a good choice to walk Meghan down the aisle.Yoga instructor Doria, who has already met Prince Harry, is described as a free-spirited clinical therapist who has been by her daughters side for  a number of events.Ladbrokes has since put it at 4/6 odds that Meghans mum Doria will be by her side when she walks down the aisle, while Prince Charles is tipped at 2/1.The Duke of Cambridge has also been tipped to step up to the plate, with 5/1 odds of walking Meghan down the aisle, while there have been a flurry of bets predicting the US actress would walk down the aisle alone."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict0004038848791.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"meghan markle prince harry royal wedding bridesmaids page boys","story":"The pair are among four boys and six girls who will play a part in the ceremony this Saturday.Both Meghan and Harry have chosen children close to their heart to take part, with Prince Williams eldest two children securing starring roles.As well as Charlotte, the bridesmaids will include Ms Markles seven-year-old twin goddaughters Rylan Litt and Remi Litt.What we know so far...Harrys goddaughters, three-year-old Florence van Cutsem and two-year-old Zalie Warren, are also bridesmaids, along with Ivy Mulroney, four-year-old daughter Meghans best friend Jessica Mulroney.Ivys twin brothers, seven-year-old Brian and John Mulroney, will be page boys alongside Prince George and Harrys godson Jasper Dyer, six. BridesmaidsHer Royal Highness Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, 3Miss Florence van Cutsem, 3, goddaughter of Prince Harry, daughter of Mrs. Alice van Cutsem and Major Nicholas van CutsemMiss Remi Litt, 6, goddaughter of Ms. Markle, daughter of Mrs. Benita Litt and Mr. Darren LittMiss Rylan Litt, 4, goddaughter of Ms. Markle, daughter of Mrs. Benita Litt and Mr. Darren LittMiss Ivy Mulroney, 4 , daughter of Mrs. Jessica Mulroney and Mr. Benedict MulroneyMiss Zalie Warren, 2, goddaughter of Prince Harry, daughter of Mrs. Zoe Warren and Mr. Jake Warren Page Boys:His Royal Highness Prince George of Cambridge, 4Master Jasper Dyer, 6, godson of Prince Harry, son of Mrs. Amanda Dyer and Mr. Mark Dyer M.V.O.Master Brian Mulroney, 7, son of Mrs. Jessica Mulroney and Mr. Benedict MulroneyMaster John Mulroney, 7, son of Mrs. Jessica Mulroney and Mr. Benedict MulroneyMeghans pal Jessica Mulroney landed at London Heathrow just last night, with her children right beside her.The 37-year-old Canadian stylist was pictured arriving at Heathrow with her family last night - with the wedding of the year just three days away.Jessica, who is rumoured to have flown to the UK earlier this year to be by Meghans side for her wedding dress fittings, was pictured last night wheeling a number of bags off the plane after her long-haul flight from Toronto.The Canadian socialite, who flew into London with her husband Ben Mulroney and three children by her side, will undoubtedly be a source of comfort for the bride-to-be, with Meghans dad Thomas recently announcing he would not be able to attend the wedding due to a heart operation.The 73-year-old, who lives in Mexico, had initially said he would walk his daughter down the aisle, but then pulled out after it was revealed he had posed in staged snaps with paparazzi.He later told TMZ that he would love to be by his daughters side at the Saturday wedding, but was having a heart operation today.For the latest news on this story keep checking back at Sun Online.Thesun is your go to destination for the best celebrity news, football news, real-life stories, jaw-dropping pictures and must-see video.Download our fantastic, new and improved free App for the best ever Sun Online experience.

It also meant the company\u0027s by-then prodigious cash-flow - augmented by the sale of unwanted assets - could be invested in upgrading and expanding its networks, rather than having to be spent on servicing debt.Sir Chris\u0027s time is also associated with heavy investment in 3G licences around Europe.It was a thrilling time to be covering the company\u0027s fortunes and the soundtrack to it all was Bohemian Like You, a track by the US band The Dandy Warhols, which became ubiquitous as Vodafone became one of the world\u0027s heaviest-spending advertisers.When Sir Chris stepped down, in 2003, it fell to his Indian-born successor, Arun Sarin, to make all that investment pay off."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/05/2048x1152/skynews-robbery-london_4311408.jpg?20180516071816 ","title":"hunt for creeping burglar targeting wealthy homes in kensington and chelsea","story":"\"This burglary has made me feel very sad,\" they said, explaining that the watch and ring had been in her family for more than 70 years. \"The fact that someone came into my house uninvited and rifled through my possessions is distressing.\"Police have described the burglar as \"organised and diligent\", waiting until dark to climb into gardens and scale walls and drainpipes before rifling through cupboards and drawers armed with a torch.They say the man has been targeting properties, located in an area where average house prices are between \u0026#1632m and \u0026#1634m, with \"great care\".In another incident, the thief broke into the top floor of a four-storey house, breaking through the window while the family were downstairs having dinner and searching a bedroom while the children were having a bath next door.One another occasion the homeowner, who was abroad, checked in on his children and their nanny via cameras in the house and saw the burglar creeping around.\"This type of crime has a huge impact on not only the victims and their families, who no longer feel safe in their own homes, but upon the local community who are worried he will strike again,\" Detective Constable Eve Kelly said.\"He is not afraid to break in when families are at home, although I must stress he takes care not to be seen and has not physically harmed anyone.\"The suspect is described as white, between 20 and 40, and of athletic build, and has been pictured wearing a hooded jumper."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/05/2048x1152/cf9ff12470b6aa92e70fab8c0fcdd83e563fbfe93a8e65d401a05b9251786fd7_4311235.jpg?20180515210613 ","title":"israeli snipers and shifting rules of engagement","story":"Israelis say 16 militants were killed in two such attacks.But critics want an explanation of rules of engagement that remain secret but appear to have been relaxed.Britain and other allies of Israel are alarmed by the staggering casualty figures.The shift in rules seems to have allowed Israeli sharpshooters to kill and wound unarmed protesters.Nadav Weiman was in an Israeli military sniper unit 10 years ago.He now works for the NGO Breaking the Silence.He said: \"We see IDF snipers shooting at unarmed Palestinians when they are 300m away from the fence.\"That\u0027s a huge change from when I was a sniper and I think that this is a red line that I personally thought we were never going to cross.\""},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/05/2048x1152/skynews-pm-may_4304642.jpg?20180509120848 ","title":"may promises to spell out brexit strategy in government dossier","story":"Downing Street claims the document will \"include detailed, ambitious and precise explanations of our positions...it should set out what will change and what will feel different outside the EU\".The white paper was announced just hours after rock legend Sir Mick Jagger added his voice to calls for the Prime Minister to spell out her Brexit strategy and end the customs confusion.\"Everyone would like to see a fast resolution, a united front and some leadership that\u0027s united rather than split,\" the Rolling Stones frontman said in a radio interview.The Government\u0027s aim is to publish the white paper in time for the next EU summit of European leaders in six weeks\u0027 time. It will cover security, financial services, aviation and fisheries.But if the Cabinet fails to reach a deal on customs and break the deadlock between the Brexiteers and Remainers by then, critics will claim the white paper is a pointless exercise. The so-called Brexit \"war Cabinet\" of 11 senior ministers met for more than 90 minutes in its latest attempt to come to an agreement on a \"customs partnership or \"maximum facilitation\".Under a customs partnership, favoured by Remainers and the PM but bitterly opposed by Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, who called it \"crazy\" last week, the UK would collect tariffs for Brussels.Maximum facilitation, known in Whitehall jargon as \"max fac\", relies on new technology and is thought to be a potential compromise that could win support from Conservative MPs.The EU\u0027s Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier also mocked Mrs May over her failure to agree a post-Brexit customs model, claiming it was \"unnecessary to fight\" over two options which Brussels will reject anyway since neither was realistic.At the latest Cabinet sub-committee meeting, ministers heard presentations from Mr Davis and Cabinet Office minister David Lidington on work done by two ministerial working groups set up last week.Reacting to the white paper announcement, Labour Brexit spokesman Paul Blomfield said: \"It is deeply disturbing that, after yet another meeting, the Cabinet still cannot agree on the most fundamental Brexit issues.\"Ministers have finally agreed to publish a White Paper on the Government\u0027s negotiating position, but they still don\u0027t know what it will say.\"Labour called for a white paper before Article 50 was triggered.\"However, Ministers have wasted months arguing amongst themselves rather than negotiating in the national interest.\"Today\u0027s failure highlights the deep division at the heart of Government on the most basic of issues.\"Whether those divisions can be resolved in the next month remains to be seen.\"If the Cabinet can\u0027t take the decisions, Parliament will.\"In another move, Labour is also attempting to force a binding vote in the House of Commons requiring the Government to publish Cabinet papers on the two customs options being considered by ministers.Using the \"humble address\" procedure it has used successfully previously, Labour will call on the Government to release to Parliament all papers prepared for the Brexit sub-committee, including any economic analysis. Speaking ahead of the debate Keir Starmer, Labour\u0027s shadow Brexit secretary, said: \"The Government\u0027s Brexit strategy is in complete and utter deadlock.\"Nearly two years on from the referendum, ministers have still yet to agree what our future customs and trading relationship with Europe will look like after Brexit.\"Instead, the Prime Minister has wasted months pursing her two fatally flawed customs options and presiding over a Government that is too busy arguing with itself to negotiate for

The Prime Minister did not single out either side alone for blame despite Turkey\u0027s President accusing Israel of waging terrorism and saying: Israel will not be forgiven. Mrs May stood alongside President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the pair met for talks in Downing Street.  Erdogan - himself branded a fascist by protesters today over his human rights record - blasted Israel and its backers the US.  He said: You are powerful but you are not right. History will not forgive you and this is the fact we will observe in the future. Israel will not be forgiven.  So it all boils down to making a choice. Are we going to side with the strong, or side with those who are right?  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has also accused Israel of flagrant illegality and demanded tougher UK action.  But Mrs May said: The loss of life we have seen is tragic and extremely concerning. Such violence is destructive to peace efforts and we call on all sides to show restraint. There is an urgent need to establish the facts of what happened yesterday through an independent and transparent investigation, including why such a volume of live fire was used - and what role Hamas played in events.  On Palestinians, she said: Palestinians have the right to protest but these protests must be peaceful. We are concerned that extremist elements are seeking to hijack legitimate protests to further their own objectives. On Israel, she added: The use of live fire and resulting loss of life is deeply troubling. We urge Israel to show restraint.” Palestinian officials say 60 Palestinians died yesterday after Israeli troops opened fire during protests on the Gaza border. The figure rose from 59 overnight after an eight-month-old baby died from tear gas. The girl\u0027s family said she inhaled the gas at a protest camp near the border. More than 2,200 Palestinians were also injured by gunfire or tear gas, local medics said. Yesterday was the bloodiest day for Palestinians since the 2014 Gaza war.  Another Palestinian was killed today but numbers at the border were generally lower as protesters buried their dead. Palestinian medical officials say 106 Gazans have now been killed since the start of the protests and nearly 11,000 people wounded, about 3,500 of them hit by live fire. Israeli officials dispute those numbers and say they are acting in self-defence. The Israeli military said at least 24 of those killed on Monday were terrorists with documented terror background and most of them were active operatives of Hamas.

Sajid Javid revealed the shock figure in a grilling by the Commons Home Affairs Committee. It comes just weeks after Mr Javid, whose predecessor Amber Rudd resigned over the scandal, said he was not aware of any Windrush citizens being wrongly deported. Furious Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: The responsibility for these wrongful deportations stops at Theresa May\u0027s door. Apologies are not enough for the lives that have been ruined and the deep hurt and pain that communities have suffered. Campaigning MP David Lammy added: This is the worst human rights and home affairs crisis in my time in politics. The Prime Minister\u0027s hostile environment stands in the dock, guilty as charged. The 63 people are Caribbean nationals who were removed from the UK since records began in 2002, and who are also over the age of 45.  Their age means some of them might have arrived in Britain before 1973 - a legal cut-off date. Under UK law, anyone who arrived from the Caribbean before 1973 should have had an automatic right to stay in Britain, so should not be deported. Home Office officials do not yet know how many of the 63 should have been protected under Windrush law.  Only last week the Immigration Minister, Caroline Nokes, said she had not yet found a single wrongful deportation of a Windrush citizen. Her officials also suggested only a handful of people - five - had been wrongly deported from Britain at all in the last five years, even beyond the Windrush scandal. Yet today Mr Javid suggested the final total could be even higher than 63, telling MPs: It\u0027s not a final number at this point - it could change. The work on those records is still ongoing.  Of the 63 citizens, Mr Javid said 32 were removed because they committed crimes. The other 31 were administrative removals, which includes people who were sent Home Office letters telling them to leave. The cases were found in an ongoing trawl of 8,000 Home Office records on people deported from the UK since 2002. Mr Javid confirmed: Out of the 8,000, there\u0027s so far a focus on 63 where there\u0027s something on their record that indicates they could have been in the UK before 1973.  The \u0027Windrush generation\u0027 are British residents who arrived from Commonwealth countries before New Year\u0027s Day 1973. They are named after the Empire Windrush, the ship which brought some of the first Caribbean migrants to Britain in 1948. Anyone who arrived in the UK from a Commonwealth country before 1973 has a legal right to stay, unless they left the UK for more than two years. But they faced being threatened with deportation under new immigration rules despite living and working here for decades. People were ordered to prove they have the right to be in the UK to rent property, work or access services and benefits. The government failed to keep detailed records of Windrush arrivals, and landing cards were destroyed in 2010. The Home Office set up a task force with the aim of sorting out cases within two weeks. Windrush immigrants are also being granted fee-free citizenship and a compensation scheme, the rules of which have not been set yet.

A purpose-built \"bouncing bomb\" developed by Barnes Wallis breached the Möhne and Edersee Dams causing catastrophic flooding which destroyed two hydroelectric power stations and killed 1,600 people. The mission is regarded as a wartime triumph and resulted in acclaimed 1955 film The Dam Busters, starring Michael Redgrave and Richard Todd. On Saturday, a premiere of a restored version of the film takes place at the International Bomber Command Centre in Lincoln where the mission began.

But one call-out would change his life. He was sent to help a young girl struggling to breathe, and on arrival he saw she was the victim of appalling abuse. Despite all his efforts to save her she died in hospital. It was not the first time a patient had not made it, but something about this 2014 case triggered a hidden pain, and the dad-of-four became haunted by the child’s image. Soon he was suffering nightmares, cold sweats and vivid flashbacks. “I was in a dark place,” says Dan, 32, of the North West Ambulance Service. “I felt a sense of impending doom, like I was in a plane that was about to crash.” Finally he talked to fellow paramedic Rich Morton, 29, and with his support sought medical help. He was diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Now Dan and Rich have set up Our Blue Light, an initiative to help essential services staff who might be struggling. “We all know how to deal with cuts and CPR but what about mental health first aid?” says Dan, of Blackpool. “Once you put the uniform on, people forget that you’re human. We want to change that.”  The pair received the Mental Health Champion honour from film star Michael Sheen at our first NHS Heroes Awards, brought to you by ITV and the Mirror, which were held this week at London’s Park Lane Hilton and will be broadcast next Monday. Prince William, a supporter of the duo’s work, sent a video message in which he called them “inspiring”. He added: “They are doing incredible work to tackle PTSD and other mental health issues through Our Blue Light. “I want to say a huge congratulations to Dan and Rich, both for your contribution to mental health and on winning this award. You are true NHS Heroes.” And while the award was indeed an honour, especially during Mental Health Awareness Week, Dan’s biggest wish is just to help as many people like him as possible. He joined the NWAS at 18 and in two years’ training learned practical skills such as medical care and driving an ambulance. But there was no advice on dealing mentally with traumatic situations. “Nothing equips us for it,” says Dan. “The culture was we don’t talk of our mental health. We help people – why would we need help ourselves? I recall going out to my first deceased person. The crew told me, ‘You’ll see this a lot lad’. Nothing more was said about it.” Dan says it is not just major horrors such as last year’s Grenfell Tower fire and terror attacks in London and Manchester that can mental stress for emergency staff.  “It’s a kind of drip, drip effect,” he says. “That day in 2014 it was evident the child was taking her final breaths. We did all we could but she later died. I knew right away it would be very difficult to deal with. “I struggled to sleep and grew isolated. I had nightmares, vivid flashbacks and woke up in a cold sweats. It was very scary.” His feelings were intensified because his children reminded him of the victim. “She had blonde hair, like them, and if you take something like this home you relate it to the family,” he says. “Just going to the park with the kids was a worry but I didn’t know what I was scared of. “Part of me was ashamed. I was scared someone would say, ‘If you can’t deal with this sort of stuff, then the job isn’t for you’.” After two weeks he texted colleague Rich, who says: “I thought the best thing to do was go and listen.” Dan said: “It was like the weight of the world came off my shoulders.” On Rich’s advice he saw his GP and was diagnosed with PTSD. He had counselling and therapy and was off work for five months. “Eventually the nightmares and flashbacks stopped,” he says.

Thomas Markle Snr says he is due to undergo an operation this morning, just three days before Meghan ties the knot with Prince Harry. He told TMZ details of the surgery, saying: They [doctors] will go in and clear blockage, repair damage and put a stent where it is needed. It comes after Mr Markle Snr reportedly revealed that he wanted to walk Meghan, 36, down the aisle at Windsor Castle, Berkshire, on Saturday.  The 73-year-old was said to have had a \u0027change of mind\u0027 - less than 24 hours after pulling out of performing the honour at St George\u0027s Chapel. He earlier told the gossip site: I hate the idea of missing one of the greatest moments in history and walking my daughter down the aisle. But he feared his heart problems could prevent him from doing this.  It is thought Meghan\u0027s mum Doria Ragland has stepped in to walk her down the aisle in her father\u0027s absence. Earlier on Tuesday, the 61-year-old was picked up from her LA home and chauffeur driven to LAX airport, according to TMZ. The website reports that she was given the A-list treatment, dropped off at the new Private Suite before being driven directly to her flight. The father was said to be back in hospital, undergoing a series of tests, after suffering from serious chest pains following a heart attack last week.  Speaking to Australian news programme Sunrise, Samantha Markle, Meghan\u0027s half sister, said: Everything about him being under an incredible amount of stress is true and he, you know, sent me a message that he was undergoing heart surgery so all of that was true. He\u0027s been under a tremendous amount of stress amidst challenges and I hope, I think we\u0027re all hoping he pulls through this now and can still go the wedding.  The surgery is said to be taking place at 7.30am local time. Mr Markle Snr will likely be recovering from the procedure when his former actress daughter, 36, and Harry, 33, tie the knot in Windsor this weekend. In a statement earlier this month, Kensington Palace said the father, who lives near Rosarito, Mexico, would walk Meghan down the aisle of St George\u0027s Chapel. A spokesman said at the time: “Prince Harry and Ms Markle are very much looking forward to welcoming Ms Markle\u0027s parents to Windsor for the wedding. Mr Thomas Markle and Ms Doria Ragland will be arriving in the UK in the week of the wedding, allowing time for Prince Harry\u0027s family, including The Queen, The Duke of Edinburgh, The Prince of Wales, The Duchess of Cornwall, and The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, to spend time with them before the big day.  Both of the bride\u0027s parents will have important roles in the wedding. On the morning of the wedding, Ms Ragland will travel with Ms Markle by car to Windsor Castle. Mr Markle will walk his daughter down the aisle of St George\u0027s Chapel. Ms. Markle is delighted to have her parents by her side on this important and happy occasion.” But last night, it was claimed that Mr Markle Snr no longer planned to travel to Britain to give Meghan away after he admitted staging photos for the paparazzi. The father earlier told TMZ that he had meant no harm to his daughter or the Royal Family when he set up a photoshoot in an Internet cafe. The shoot is said to have been part of a deal worth \u0026pound100,000.  Reports suggested some wedding plans had been thrown into turmoil with the ex-Hollywood lighting director deciding to stay put at home. It was claimed Harry was blaming himself for the situation, while Meghan was said to be distraught and standing by her father. Last night, the couple released a statement addressing the reports that Mr Markle Snr was not going to attend the ceremony. A spokesman for Kensington Palace said: This is a deeply personal moment for Ms Markle in the days before her wedding. She and Prince Harry ask again for understanding and respect to be extended to Mr Markle in this difficult situation.

Meghan\u0027s dad is reportedly being prepped for major heart surgery and it is incredibly unlikely he will make it to Windsor Castle to walk the former Suits star down the aisle to wed Prince Harry. On Sunday it was reported Thomas Markle had set up paparazzi photos of himself preparing for the much-anticipated wedding in exchange for cash. Less than 24 hours later he told magazine website TMZ he was pulling out of the wedding due to a heart attack suffered last week.  But following messages from Meghan he is believed to have changed his mind again - before it emerged that he had to undergo major heart surgery and will not attend. But his daughter Samantha, Meghan\u0027s half-sister, has defended Thomas. Speaking to Australian morning news programme Sunrise she was asked if the reports in TMZ were true. She said: Don\u0027t believe tabloids but we\u0027re really not sure at this point... Everything about him being under an incredible amount of stress is true and he, you know, sent me a message that he was undergoing heart surgery so all of that was true. He\u0027s been under a tremendous amount of stress amidst challenges and I hope, I think we\u0027re all hoping he pulls through this now and can still go the wedding. He sent me a message that he was prepping for surgery an hour ago, it\u0027s a little more imminent than tomorrow.  When told this would make it almost impossible for him to attend she replied: I can\u0027t speak for him. It depends on the extent and the complication of the surgery. I don\u0027t know what that entails yet, so I\u0027m leaving that up top his doctors but my concern really is more that he pulls through safely and whatever happens after that we\u0027ll just wait and see. Samantha was then asked if the situation around her dad has \u0027spun out of control\u0027. She said: Is it out of control that a normal American family have to come out and defend themselves against media created drama, really? I mean the negative slamming all of the tabloid headlines - those were tabloid created from the very beginning last year.

The couple are due to wed at St George\u0027s Chapel on Saturday, with about 100,000 of well-wishers expected in the Berkshire town and police on high alert. A number of homeless people living near the Queen\u0027s residence had their belongings cleared, but police say the rough sleepers they gave them up voluntarily under a scheme overseen by a local charity. As the royal wedding draws near, the area around Windsor Castle is on lockdown and anti-terror bollards are going up as extra police patrol the town.  Thames Valley Police said the sleeping bags and other belongings, including bedding and books, are being stored by the Windsor Homeless Project and will be returned to the rough sleepers after Saturday\u0027s nuptials. Tory council leader Simon Dudley had sparked anger months ago after asking police to remove rough sleepers from the affluent borough before the royal wedding. He complained about rough sleepers on Twitter while he was on a Christmas skiing holiday, and then wrote a letter to the police - copying in Prime Minister Theresa May and then-Home Secretary Amber Rudd after he returned to the UK.    Footage obtained by MailOnline shows two homeless men, who were camped outside a Barclays bank across from the castle, putting their possessions in clear plastic bags. The bags were sealed and taken away in a police van. One of the rough sleepers said: There was big speak on the TV about the homeless being helped but when they said helped they meant removed. But a police spokesman insisted that the rough sleepers voluntarily gave up their possessions and they were not forcibly taken away as part of security measures.  He said the possessions will be returned after Windsor hosts the wedding, and officers were just assisting the Windsor Homeless Project with the scheme. Officers will be carrying out security sweeps and screening the thousands of well-wishers who will cram pavements around the castle, hoping to catch a glimpse of Harry and Meghan. But the police spokesman warned that large items deemed to be a security risk will likely be removed by officers. The spokesman said: “Thames Valley Police is working closely with The Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead council, The Windsor Homeless Project, and local support services in order to offer support to homeless people in Windsor. \u2028 "},{"url":null,"title":"royal wedding bridesmaids pageboys meghan","story":"NewsBREAKING Royal wedding: Meghan Markle and Prince Harry reveal bridesmaids and page boys - including Prince George and Princess CharlotteThe palace have announced bridesmaids and page boys will include Princess Charlotte and Prince George\u0026nbspShareByAbigail O\u0027Leary10:06, 16 MAY 2018Updated10:39, 16 MAY 2018NewsMeghan and Harry\u0027s day is just three days away (Image: Getty Images Europe)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPrincess Charlotte and Prince George will play key roles in the royal wedding of Meghan Markle and Prince Harry, it\u0027s been revealed.

The losses that night were  catastrophic and only 77 men returned from the raid, but the legend of “The Dambusters” had been born.  George “Johnny” Johnson is one of only two surviving airmen and I have shared many glasses of his favoured red wine with him as he recounted his memories of the operation, and his thoughts as he looks back 75 years on. During the dark days of the Second World War, when the British public had been forced to swallow an unremitting diet of blood, sweat, tears, toil and gloom, the RAF’s Bomber Command had offered almost the only glimmers of hope carrying the war into the very heart of Germany.  A crucial target was the string of dams in the hills flanking the Ruhr which generated the power for heavy industries, fuelling the Nazi war machine with aircraft parts, tanks, guns and munitions. Many attacks had been attempted, but all had failed, so a specialist RAF Squadron – 617 – was formed to utilise the now famous “Bouncing Bomb” in an effort to deliver a killer blow. At 9.28pm on Sunday, May 16, 1943, a few minutes before sunset, the roar of Rolls Royce Merlin engines shattered the peace of the morning and the first of those 19 Lancaster bombers rumbled off the runway at RAF Scampton into the Lincolnshire skies – and into the history books.  Johnny, a country boy, the son of a farm foreman from a small Lincolnshire village, was a bomb-aimer in one of the aircraft that night. He had been married only a few weeks to his sweetheart Gwyn, who he’d met on an RAF base two years previously. Death was never far away in Bomber Command – nearly half of the 125,000 men who served were killed. Johnny, now 96, says: “I’d lost a good friend, my room-mate Bernie, in a previous squadron. His pilot overshot the runway on landing, went through a hedge and smashed the nose up.  “Bernie was still in the bomb-aimer’s position and was killed outright. By the time I got back, all his gear had been cleared away from our room. One minute he was there and the next minute, no trace of him. Just bad luck really, but you just had to go on and find another friend. That was how it was then. I just never thought it would happen to me.” By the time Johnny arrived at his target, the Sorpe Dam, a number of planes had already been shot down or had crashed – killing many of his friends. The steep terrain, plus tall trees on one side and a church steeple on the other made it difficult to get low enough over the water for a successful bomb drop.  He says: “We couldn’t make a head-on attack, so had to fly down one side of the hills, level out with the port outer engine over the dam itself, so that we were just on the water side of the dam, and estimate as best we could to the centre of the dam to drop the bomb.” Amid the terrible dangers and to the concern of his crew, Johnny ordered an astonishing nine runs at the target before, to the clear relief of the rest of the men, he was finally satisfied with his aim and he released their bomb. It was an accurate drop and the bomb detonated right at the centre of the dam, blasting a water spout so high it hit the rear gun turret of the Lancaster as it banked away, provoking a shocked cry of “God almighty!” from the rear gunner.   The last Lancaster to return  eventually touched down at a quarter past six that morning – almost nine hours after the first had taken off.  The cost included eight aircraft, 53 men killed and three captured. For Gwyn’s peace of mind, Johnny hadn’t told her about the raid before taking off. “I didn’t really want to tell her I’d been on that particular op,” he says, “as I suspected she might be annoyed.  “I’d never mentioned it previously. Sure enough, when she did find out, she gave me an earful for not telling her in the first place.” Gwyn sadly died in 2005, but Johnny still credits her, and luck, with his survival. “She was my rock when I was on ops and I was lucky to be with the right crew in the right place at the right time.” Canadian air-gunner Fred Sutherland is the only other surviving Dambuster. When I spoke to him a few years ago, it took some persuasion to get him to recount his experiences – like so many of his generation, he felt he “hadn’t done anything special” that night.  He was invited to Britain to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the Dams raid in 2013, but politely declined the invitation. “It’s not much of a party,” he says, “when there are so few of us left. My crew are all gone. Passed away. And most people don’t really understand what we did, anyway. They could never understand.” As we spoke, it was increasingly clear to me that Fred had been deeply affected by his war service and in his advancing years, he was reflecting more on what he had been through.

Revellers for the Royal wedding are set for a sizzling treat with forecasters confident the blue skies and sunshine will hold out until Saturday - and probably beyond.  There is a chance the mercury could even beat the record currently set for May 19 (28.3C), which was recorded in the Argyll Forest Park in Scotland in 1948. Exacta Weather forecaster James Madden told The Express spring could end with another potentially record-breaking bank holiday scorcher.  He said: “The remainder of this month will remain predominantly summery and confidence is increasing for another burst of very warm to hot temperatures for the next bank holiday weekend. “It is plausible that maximum temperatures could rise into the high 20Cs or even the low 30Cs for several days in a row within this period. This will pave the way for a warm and settled start to summer.” The weather will see a brief dip on Wednesday before turning warmer again. Spokesman Grahame Madge said: “High pressure is back in charge and so the outlook is for the weather to be largely fine through this week. “Confidence for good weather on Saturday is increasing, we expect temperatures of between 20C (68F) and 23C (73.4F).  “Temperatures will build through the start of this week with Tuesday likely to be the warmest day, we could possibly see 25C (77F) in parts. “A cold front will bring these values down by around six to nine degrees on Wednesday before it turns warmer again. “There may be some fronts approaching the northwest bringing unsettled conditions over the weekend, but for the majority of the UK we expect conditions to remain dry and fine. “There are no strong signals yet for this pattern of weather coming to an end.”  MeteoGroup forecaster Mario Cuellar said on Monday: “Air will probably start coming to the UK from France, with 24C shown on forecast models by May 21 as temperatures increase. “The weather for the royal wedding looks good for people enjoying time outdoors.” American Ms Markle will be relieved after her reported worries about Britain’s weather disrupting her wedding. The couple will travel in an open-topped carriage if dry, but a covered carriage if wet. The Weather Outlook forecaster Brian Gaze said: “It looks like sunblock not brollies for Harry and Meghan’s big day.

Danielle Dick, 32, died peacefully as she lay next to her husband Tyler in her hospital bed. She received the shock diagnosis after she suffered headaches and struggled to speak 17 weeks into her pregnancy. An obstetrician initially thought it was just pregnancy brain. But after she was rushed to A\u0026ampE doctors discovered that she had three masses in her brain, and they were later confirmed to be stage 4 melanoma.  Tyler, from Goddard in the US state of Kansas, is now speaking out to raise awareness about skin cancer and encourage people to protect themselves and get checked. In 2011, he had noticed a strange mole on his wife\u0027s back and a biopsy found that it wasn\u0027t cancerous. But the mole grew back and a biopsy determined it was melanoma.  Tyler, 32, told the Today programme the mole and the lymph nodes were removed and it was believed Danielle, a physical therapist, was in the clear.   She gave birth to the couple\u0027s first child, a daughter named Taylor, in 2015 and fell pregnant with twins in 2016. But in April 2017 she became frustrated when she couldn\u0027t find the right words. They visited an obstetrician, who told them it was probably pregnancy brain, said Tyler, a nurse anesthetist. However, the couple rushed to A\u0026ampE one day when Danielle couldn\u0027t speak at all. An MRI revealed three melanoma masses in her brain. Danielle would have had a 20 per cent chance of surviving five years if she began immediate radiation treatment, but she chose to delay it so her unborn twins would survive.  She eventually took a chemotherapy pill and underwent some pinpoint radiation. The twins - a boy named Colby and a daughter named Reagan - were delivered prematurely via Caesarean section at 29 weeks on July 12 last year, allowing Danielle to begin aggressive treatment. It was too late, however, as the cancer had spread rapidly through her body. Immediate treatment failed to help and doctors later found almost 20 new masses in her brain. The twins remained in neonatal intensive care until they were strong enough to go home.  She underwent full brain radiation but the cancer spread to her spinal cord, and she was transferred to a hospital in Houston, Texas, for further care as her condition deteriorated. Danielle died next to her husband on April 25, just nine months after giving birth. Tyler said doctors will be carrying out tests to find out if the cancer has possibly spread to the twins. He told Today that his best friend was determined to do as much as she could with their three children and remained upbeat, even when she felt ill or exhausted, before she died.  He said: “She never got any breaks. Every time she went to the doctor she got the worst news of her life. It was just shocking how they would get one [tumour] to shrink or go away and another would pop up.” He added: “She loved those babies so much. She also began ticking things off her bucket list, including swimming with dolphins, going to see The Killers in concert and attending college basketball games.

The teenager had hidden two pages of her original childhood diary with brown sticky paper prior to its publication, leaving a mystery as to the contents underneath. Using digital scanning techniques, researchers have now discovered that the pages contain four rude jokes and her thoughts about sex education. The entries candidly discuss periods, the mechanics of sex and her own understanding of prostitution which she once heard through her father, Otto.   “They bring us even closer to the girl and the writer Anne Frank,” said Ronald Leopold, the executive director of the Anne Frank House museum.  According to Leopold, Frank’s writings are unsurprising as the teenager candidly discussed her sexual development elsewhere throughout the diary.  It is unclear why Anne felt compelled hide her writings but Leopold believes that she was worried that others would discover her diary and read it. Anne wrote the pages in September 1943, less than three months after she and her family were forced into hiding from Nazi troops at a secret annex behind a canalside Amsterdam home.  On prostitution, she wrote: “All men, if they are normal, go with women, women like that accost them on the street and then they go together. In Paris they have big houses for that. Papa has been there.” While on the subject of periods, she said they are “a sign that she is ripe to have relations with a man but one doesn’t do that of course before one is married”.  “Anyone who reads the passages that have now been discovered will be unable to suppress a smile,” said Frank van Vree, the director of the Netherlands Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies.  “The dirty jokes are classics among growing children. They make it clear that Anne, with all her gifts, was above all also an ordinary girl.” "},{"url":null,"title":"worlds quickest kettle can boil","story":"NewsWorld\u0027s quickest kettle can boil water in a under a TRILLIONTH of a secondSwedish scientists used a super strong laser machine to turn water into an \"exotic state\" in the quest to learn more about it\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByMark Waghorn22:04, 15 MAY 2018NewsThe Swedish team used a super strong laser machine to turn Earth\u0027s most important liquid into an exotic state (Image: SLAC)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe world\u0027s quickest \u0027kettle\u0027 has been unveiled by scientists. It heated water from room temperature to 100,000 degrees Centigrade - in under a trillionth of a second. The Swedish team used a super strong laser machine to turn Earth\u0027s most important liquid into an exotic state - from which they hope to learn more about it. In less than a tenth of a picosecond - that is 75 millionths of a billionth of a second or 0.000 000 000 000 075 seconds - the water changes from liquid to plasma. The device called the Linac Coherent Light Source at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory near Palo Alto, California, shot intense and ultra short X-ray pulses at a jet of water.  The machine is a billion times brighter than the previous generation of lasers. Each X-ray pulse has as much power as the national grid of a large country, and a hundred are produced every second. Dr Carl Caleman said:  It is not the usual way to boil your water. Normally, when you heat water, the molecules will just be shaken stronger and stronger. At the chemical level heat is motion - meaning the hotter the molecules the more rapidly they move, according to Dr Caleman. This can be achieved via heat transfer from a stove, or more directly with microwaves that make the water molecules swing back and forth ever faster in step with the electromagnetic field. Dr Caleman, of Uppsala University in Sweden, said: Our heating is fundamentally different. The energetic X-rays punch electrons out of the water molecules, thereby destroying the balance of electric charges. So, suddenly, the atoms feel a strong repulsive force and start to move violently. The study, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, said a plasma is a state of matter where the electrons have been removed from the atoms, leading to a sort of electrically charged gas.

city development, has told the authority of his intention to retire.It is thought he will depart before the end of the financial year next March, having guided the Waterfront project towards the completion of two major milestones: a new rail station entrance, and the V\u0026ampA Dundee.Mr Galloway has led the regeneration efforts in Dundee since 1997 when the project first began.Since then, he has developed the area’s masterplan and pushed for new investment coming into the city.As such, he leaves a diverse legacy in his wake after 21 years: the demolition of Tayside House, the relocation of the Olympia, realigned Tay Road Bridge ramps, the Waterfront plots and, of course, the V\u0026ampA Dundee.Mr Galloway was born in Aberfeldy and raised in Glasgow, but later attended Perth Academy before earning a degree at Dundee University.He left the city after graduating, working for almost two decades as a city planner before returning to Dundee to work on the Waterfront project.Mr Galloway has declined the Tele’s request for an interview at this time.However, a number of his council colleagues paid tribute to the sizeable portfolio of work he leaves in his

remembered for the regeneration of the Waterfront.‘‘It is very fitting that his retirement will coincide with one of the most talked about buildings of this generation opening in the form of the

That will rise to \u0026pound42.5 million next year and \u0026pound45.3 million in 2020-21.It is desperately needed, according to those in the front line facing daily calls from struggling Highlanders.Alasdair Christie, manager of the Citizens Advice Bureau in Inverness, Badenoch and Strathspey, said: \u0026ldquoWe see more and more people struggling to be able to afford a home or maintain tenancies.\u0026ldquoA lot of it is down to the fact that they simply don\u0026rsquot have the income to cover the cost of rent and associated living expenses, and the demand greatly outweighs the supply of housing available.\u0026ldquoThe emphasis has to be on more council and housing association rented properties being available.According to Scottish Government statistics, almost 72,500 affordable homes have been added since 2007.Housing Minister Kevin Stewart said affordability was \u0026ldquoabout more than just bricks and mortar, by providing \u0026ldquosafe, warm homes.He said the government was on target to deliver at least 50,000 homes during this parliament through \u0026pound3 billion of investment, of which 35 percent would be for social rent.He is working with councils and housing associations \u0026ldquoto deliver quality homes to meet local needs.Labour regional MSP David Stewart welcomed the extra funding but wants an assurance that the right kind of property is being built.He said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquod invest more in good quality council and social housing, with a mixture of home types, ensuring these options were attractive and available to help relieve the pressure so many young people feel about home ownership.Wednesday 16 May 2018 10:48 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04097000/04097386.jpg","title":"Community buyout plans for castle","story":"\u0026nbspBOLD plans for a community buyout of Urquhart Castle visitor centre overlooking Loch Ness \u0026ndash which could generate millions of pounds for the local economy \u0026ndash will be discussed at a public meeting next week.The site, visited by almost half a million people last year, making it one of Scotland\u0027 most popular tourist attractions, is operated by the government agency Historic Environment Scotland (HES).But a community group believes the tourist attraction could generate much-needed funds for local projects ranging from road improvements to supporting a childcare centre if it was run by locals.It wants to explore the possibility of using community asset transfer legislation to acquire the visitor centre, car park and land along with the neighbouring tourist information centre and Loch Ness Homes parkland.The Glen Urquhart Rural Community Association (Gurca) is urging people to give their views at a meeting at Glenurquhart Public Hall, starting at 7.30pm next Tuesday.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspLoch Ness tourism expert Willie Cameron, a spokesman for Gurca which includes community and business representatives, said there had been some initial meetings to discuss the idea.\"At this stage, it is a proposal,\" he said. \"No action is going to be taken until the meeting when we will find out the will of the people.\"If support was forthcoming, the next step would be to carry out a feasibility study but he believed Urquhart Castle had the potential to bring in revenue for infrastructure projects such as pothole repairs, improved footpaths and cycle ways, as well as supporting local facilities such as the day care centre and a childcare centre.\"We have a cash cow sitting on our doorstep but it seems not a penny is coming into the area,\" he said.\"We have potholes on the A82.

But the Courier understands the \u0026pound370,000 art installation, still branded by Highland Council as the Gathering Place, will be divided into two sections positioned on either side of the river. The installation is thought to be a mix of stone and wooden construction.There is great excitement among city councillors who have seen two-dimensional design work, and there is apparent consensus that it is aesthetically pleasing and will easily blend into the local, tranquil environment.The \"pier\" project, proposed for a spot by Eden Court, was aborted two years ago due to the scale of public objections to the design.The location for the new proposal is believed to be nearby, slightly further upriver, at the most shallow point on the edge of the Ness Islands.The council\u0027 Inverness city committee delegated powers of approval to the Inverness city arts working group. Its current chairwoman, councillor Isabelle MacKenzie, said she had closely scrutinised the fresh concept adding that it was \"within budget\".Giving little away, she added: \"I can see it appealing to the local community. It\u0027 innovative and there are a variety of ways to use it.\"The artwork is believed to be static and radically different from the previous offering.Fellow city councillor Duncan Macpherson said: \"The whole thing looks good. I think people who use this walkway regularly will be impressed.

It\u0027 a natural \u0026lsquogathering place\u0026rsquo unlike the previous design which was very modern. That may go on to be a great success in another city but it wasn\u0026rsquot for Inverness or the location.\"A two-day public consultation was held last December at the city\u0027 railway station and in the Eastgate Shopping Centre to gather opinions about the overall riverside arts project to consider \"how the river should connect with the people and community of Inverness\".The arts initiative has been plagued by complaints about design and costs.The council has consistently stressed that the overall \u0026pound759,000 project, featuring a range of different art installations, is publicly funded but largely through ring-fenced grants.They were \u0026ndash Creative Scotland (\u0026pound305,600), the Inverness Common Good Fund (\u0026pound281,000), the council\u0027 \"cities gateway\" initiative (\u0026pound66,000), Highlands and Islands Enterprise (\u0026pound66,000) and a further \u0026pound40,000 from the council. Backers also emphasised that if Inverness spurned the project the funding would simply go elsewhere in Scotland.The local authority\u0027 Inverness city manager David Haas said: \"It is in development and about to be revealed to the public.\"I\u0026rsquom confident the new proposal will prove a big hit for the city.

The details were aired at a meeting with ward councillors.Inverness West SNP councillor Bill Boyd, Ballifeary Community Council chairwoman Zosia Fraser and Murdo Campbell, who owns Loanfern Guest House in Glenurquhart Road, consider the response inadequate.The agency was praised by Cllr Boyd and ward colleague Graham Ross for listening and a public consultation will follow in the next few months.But Mrs Fraser said: \u0026ldquoFrankly, are we waiting for someone to be killed or seriously injured on Glenurqhart Road?\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove seen kids trying to get across the road to the Co-op, to stock up for the day, and they\u0026rsquore taking their life in their hands to get across that road.
