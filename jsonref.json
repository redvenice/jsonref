So we did,’ a statement from the band read (Picture: Allstar Picture Library)‘We all four felt that, after some 35 years, it could be fun to join forces again and go into the recording studio.

An extremely joyous experience.‘It resulted in two new songs and one of them, I Still Have Faith In You will be performed by or digital selves in a TV special produced by NBC and the BBC aimed for broadcasting in December.’It comes just two days after the band revealed they’d be going on tour again… as holograms (Pictures: AFPGetty Images)They added: ‘We may have been old, but the song is new.

And she wasn’t prepared to give up Blue Dozer.After the local community caught wind of the distressing story, they outed the woman via social media, and things got ugly.However, she eventually agreed to give Blue Dozer up, so he could be reunited with his best buddy.The shelter were quick to point out that the story had a happy ending, which is what we must focus on, and asked people to stop harassing the woman.opinionThere\u0027s a major problem with \u0027mummy drinking\u0027 culture‘We very much appreciate the outpouring of community support but want to be very clear about a few details,’ the shelter wrote in a Facebook post.‘First, we do not support any act of violence or threat of violence towards anyone. Ever. The only thing that matters is these sweet dogs get to stay together – and in the end that’s what we have…‘Our work is about love and compassion for animals -please extend that kindness to humans.’Thankfully, the pair are back together (Picture: Richmond Animal Care and Control)The shelter also addressed the question of how the adoption went so wrong in the first place.‘Our practices, adoption policy and choices to make adoptions are done in the best interest of each animal.‘We can not account for decisions that are made by citizens after adoption and work diligently to keep our open adoption process successful. In the end, we have to trust people-trust them to love the pets we have cared for, and trust them to do what is best.’The shelter are letting OJ and Dozer chill and enjoy each other’s company for a few days, before deciding what to do with them.Wishing you better luck in your next adoption, guys.If you want to learn how to support your cat or dog with Homeopathy which gives your animal a better chance for fast healing and less suffering.

(Insert eye roll) The one that is leaving early because day care has called…… again,’ wrote Adele on Facebook.‘The Mum that only talks about her kids in the lunch room. That Mum who is forever taking days off. And the one, that has a shorter working week and gets an extra day off?Adele explains that leaving work early for your kids isn’t a fun way to dodge the office. It comes with all kinds of stress.‘Let me assure you that they are on edge at work, hoping that daycare won’t call and their heart drops when the phone rings,’ writes Adele.‘They don’t want to leave again. They know how it looks. And if they leave, it’s because they have nobody else to cover them.‘And when the kids come along, life gets pretty busy. They are consumed with looking after the little one and won’t have much to talk about, other than them.‘At 3am, when they are rocking a baby with yet another illness they are dreading that they can’t go to work the next day, again. They are sick of missing work and do not want to fall behind.’With that, Adele shared a photo of herself with her new baby, to show exactly what her ‘time off’ work looks like.‘This is what they are up to when they are not at work,’ she explains. ‘There’s no coffee with friends or shopping sprees, beach trips or salon visits.‘It’s being rundown with hairy legs, mum buns and boogie filled snuggles. It’s selfless and can be bloody relentless.’Adele urges everyone to be a little kinder to working mums – to stop the judgement and understand that they’re not dossing about, but trying to juggle a bunch of overwhelming responsibilities.‘I’m very lucky to work in a workplace now that gets it,’ she writes. ‘But in previous roles I’ve felt the eye rolls and the guilt.‘Know that the new mum is finding her feet. The missed days at work are short lived.‘And behind the dark eyes is the same women that was first hired…. and she will be back. But she just needs a little understanding and a knowing smile.’Clearly the Facebook post struck a chord, as it’s since been shared more than 7,000 times and flooded with comments from mums thanking Adele for speaking up on their behalf.‘Parent guilt because you go to work, parent guilt because your little ones get sick, parent guilt because you enjoy going to work, parent guilt because you love being at home,’ wrote one commenter. ‘Double edge swords all over the bloody place but this too shall pass!’‘It was an internal struggle to “look good” and be reliable at work but also being the best mum I could be to my young son.‘Motherhood ain’t easy, and being a working mum definitely isn’t either. Less judgement and more understanding goes a long way in today’s day and age.’Hear that, everyone? Scale back the sighs and eye rolls and check in on the parents working in your office.

It’s a good name.’A town crier pictured reading a scroll outside the Lindo Wing (Picture: PA)The duke also remarked on how Sir Jerry Mateparae, New Zealand High Commissioner to the UK, had a ‘strong name’.William and Kate’s third child is a younger brother to Prince George and Princess Charlotte.Four-year-old George was christened George Alexander Louis in 2013, while Charlotte, who turns three next week, was named Charlotte Elizabeth Diana in 2015.Their names were announced when they were two days old.William joked on Monday that he had ‘thrice the worry’ now as he took the prince home to Kensington Palace, after the baby’s debut on the steps of the exclusive Lindo Wing maternity unit in London.The duchess is on maternity leave, but is expected to attend Harry and Ms Markle’s high-profile wedding in Windsor on May 19.Kate gave birth at the Lindo Wing of St Mary’s Hospital (Picture: Reuters) "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/27/09/4B9AC50C00000578-5659503-image-a-2_1524817387021.jpg","title":"Siblings nut allergies spend seven hour Emirates flight blankets heads","story":"    Shannen Sahota, 24, and her brother Sundeep, 33, were forced to spend a seven hour flight with blankets over their head and nostrilsThe siblings, from Wolverhampton, paid more than £5,000 on their holiday which was to Dubai and Singapore.They were treating their parents for their 60th birthdays.Ms Sahota claimed that she told Emirates staff three times about the nut allergies.  She said she told staff when booking, at check-in and then once more when boarding the flight.  But despite the repeated warnings, they were stunned when they discovered the chicken dinner main on the flight contained cashew nuts.      The siblings carry EpiPen jabs for emergencies and expressed their fury to the cabin crew at being exposed to nut residue carried through air vents.          The siblings were outraged after discovering nuts in the main meal on the flight, despite informing Emirates of their allergiesThey refused to move into the toilets after a staff member suggested it and spent the next seven hours sitting at the back of the plane with blankets covering their heads and nostrils.Ms Sahota, an analyst said: \u0027We felt so degraded and embarrassed - it was horrible and it was meant to be a happy occasion but the start of our holiday was ruined.\u0027We had contacted Emirates beforehand to make sure they were aware of our allergies, and when we arrived at the airport and checked our bags in, we let them know and they said it was all fine and that it was in the system.\u0027When we spoke to the people who greet you at the plane, the said it was fine and showed us to our seats.\u0027We had bought our own food and snacks with us as we just didn\u0027t want to take the risk as our allergies are so severe.\u0027When we realised what they were serving we were just completely panicked and started frantically buzzing for the staff to come over as it was too late to get off.\u0027We must have buzzed about 15 minutes before someone came - we told her the issue and how we had already informed them, multiple times about it.\u0027I told her that we could potentially die as we have got a severe nut allergy and she didn\u0027t seem to concerned.\u0027She asked if we had any medication for it and we always carry epi-pens, but they\u0027re only for emergencies and you need to go straight to hospital after.  They claimed that one staff member told them to move to the toilets, which the siblings (pictured holding their tickets) refused to do\u0027I said to her that we could potentially die, but she said there are 500 passengers on this plane and we can\u0027t stop them from having their dinner.\u0027She suggested that we sit at the back of the plane, but we explained that the nut particles would already be in the air.\u0027She said the only other option was for us to go and sit in the plane toilets - with cushions and blankets for the rest of the seven hours.\u0027  An Emirates spokesperson said: \u0027We are sorry to hear about Ms Sahota\u0027s complaint.\u0027Emirates tries to cater to all passenger specific needs by offering a number of special meals that cover as many medical, dietary and religious requirements as possible. However, Emirates cannot guarantee completely nut-free flights.\u0027We\u0027ve looked into Ms Sahota\u0027s booking and our records do not reflect any mention of a nut allergy. All passengers who alert us of a nut allergy prior to travel are informed of our policy and it is also outlined on our website\u0027When alerted during the flight, our crew tried their best to offer Ms Sahota and her brother alternative locations in an open space in back of the aircraft cabin to minimise their proximity to other passengers who may be consuming meals with nuts.\u0027We apologise for any inconvenience caused and our customer care team will be in touch with Miss Sahota directly.\u0027  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/23/08/04AC68ED00000514-0-image-a-2_1524469795473.jpg","title":"Prince Louis Cambridge takes place royal order succession","story":"Here is how the line of succession looks now that Kate and William\u0027s new royal baby has been bornFollowing the baby\u0027s arrival, Prince Harry  shifts down the line of succession to sixth place.The Duke of York, who was born second in line, has moved to seventh and Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie to eighth and ninth.Andrew falling out of the top six means he will no longer have to ask the Queen for permission to marry - unlike Charles, William, George, Charlotte and Harry. Kate Middleton royal baby LIVE: First pictures as Duchess of...Kate\u0027s in Labour!

But then no other senior royals have yet visited the latest addition to the family.The Queen, who is at Windsor, was informed by phone about the birth. She may see her sixth great-grandchild at the weekend, when it is possible that William and Kate will take him to the castle to see her and Prince Philip, who is recovering from a hip replacement and unable to travel.Early visitors to Kensington Palace included Kate\u0027s parents, Michael and Carole Middleton, and siblings, Pippa and James, while Princess Eugenie has also dropped in. Mrs Middleton has been seen helping out with George\u0027s school run and generally making herself useful.

Even Fergie’s daughter Princess Eugenie turned up to welcome the arrival of her first cousin once removed.For Charles, languishing in Scotland, the pain must be considerable.To many puzzled observers it may seem that the neglect in not yet having seen his new grandson, when the Middletons have, must lie with the Prince of Wales. But is that the case?On Wednesday, he understandably had to put duty first, travelling to northern France for the dawn ceremony marking Anzac Day and the centenary of the Second Battle of Villers-Bretonneux. A long-planned trip, it involved the prime ministers of France and Australia.All the same, there was a sense of unease among courtiers this week as the prince found himself relegated behind William’s in-laws in the queue to see the latest addition to the House of Windsor.Despite the fact no other senior royals have called in to see the baby, the prince’s absence shines an uncomfortable light on the tricky and perplexing relationship between father and son.We have been here before, of course. Three years ago, Charles complained that he ‘almost never’ sees his first grandson, Prince George, and that he occupied a peripheral role in the little boy’s life.The dismay at seeing less than he expected of his first grandson was amplified because he hoped to become a mentor to the future king.Just a few days before George was born, Charles was happily asking a ladies’ circle for ‘any hints’ on being a grandfather.The anticipation was clear, and it was obvious to those ladies that Charles was determined to be the attentive and loving grandfather he never knew himself.The prince was only three when George VI died, and he never knew his paternal grandfather, Prince Philip’s playboy father Prince Andrew of Greece, who died in 1944.It is not difficult to see how this sparked his desire to be involved in the development of young George, particularly as Charles feels they have a special connection.For he knows that, like himself, George is probably going to have to wait almost a lifetime before he fulfils his destiny. But from the outset, according to insiders, William’s attitude was somewhat different. ‘Very strange,’ says one.On the day Kate’s labour began at St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington, Charles was on a train en route to a day of engagements.He had offered to cancel his duties, but was assured it was not necessary because William did not want visitors to come to the hospital immediately, fearing they would be disruptive. Instead, George’s first visitors were the Middletons, which established a pattern that, tellingly, repeated itself this week.When Kate’s due date with Princess Charlotte emerged, the same instruction not to visit and not to cancel engagements followed. But as a royal aide noted: ‘The Middletons don’t do engagements, so it didn’t apply to them.’In the event, Charlotte was born at the weekend and Kate quickly went home to Kensington Palace. When it became clear to Charles that the Middletons would be visiting, he made an immediate decision to go, driving himself and Camilla from Highgrove.According to a friend, he felt it would ‘look awful’ if he didn’t visit his new granddaughter at the same time as the Middletons.He was said to have ‘hared’ down the motorway to London, and even radioed ahead to London for an aide to collect a gift from Clarence House which Camilla had chosen for the baby, to be sent over to Kensington Palace.In the event, Granny Carole and Grandpa Charles arrived at the palace almost at the same time.‘When it suits him, William can be friendly and welcoming, but he can also be aloof and icy,’ says a close figure. ‘With his father, he can be cordial or effusive, especially if he wants more money, as he did for work on Anmer Hall – his house in Norfolk. He dispenses niceties like he is the owner of a sweet shop to a small child.’Nothing illustrates this wilful approach better than William’s reaction after Charles included a picture on his desk of him with George – alongside photographs of William and Harry – for one of the regular in-house videos the Prince of Wales makes for his charities in Commonwealth countries.William complained bitterly, even though the picture was one that had been issued publicly.Nor, say friends, has he made any secret of the fact that he views the relationship that Carole and Mike Middleton enjoy with their children as being just what he covets for his own family.It doesn’t take a genius to work out that he doesn’t think he has had that kind of relationship with his father.For Charles, who wants only to be a mentor and sounding board for his sons and his grandchildren, it is not just a puzzling situation. It is also a sad one.

He played Obama like a fiddle...Trump warns countries who don’t support the combined 2026...Share this articleAware of the optics, anxious German diplomats pressed, in vain, for Merkel to enjoy a similarly meaty two days at the White House, betting the face time would help sweeten difficult relations, officials told AFP.When Merkel last came to Washington, the cautious dry-witted chancellor held several awkward joint appearances with her more impulsive host -- clashing publicly over defense spending, trade and migration.This time around, the tricolor French flags were only just removed in time for Merkel\u0027s arrival for a one day, run-of-the-mill \u0027working visit.\u0027The stylistic differences between the Macron and Merkel visits are \u0027very telling\u0027 according to Mona Krewel of Cornell University.It points, she said, \u0027to the much more difficult relationship Trump has with Merkel.\u0027          Unlike French President Emamanuel Macron, Merkel\u0027s visit is a one day, run-of-the-mill \u0027working visit\u0027That is a dramatic change in fortunes for the German leader who, for more than a decade, was seen by Washington not just as a sensible and pragmatic interlocutor, but the de facto leader of Europe.Her relationship with Barack Obama was particularly close, officials from that administration have said, so much so that he was a powerful voice encouraging her to run for a fourth term.Their partnership has proven, along with centrists claiming her as the new \u0027leader of the free world\u0027, to be a poisoned chalice for Berlin in the age of Trump.Just hours before the chancellor landed late Thursday, some 15 months after Trump was sworn into office, the Republican Congress finally got around to confirming an ambassador to Germany.Shortly after his nomination, Richard Grenell, who is known for his pugilistic conservatism and combative defense of Trump\u0027s \u0027America First\u0027 policies, told AFP it was \u0027humbling\u0027 to be chosen for a post once held by John Quincy Adams, and he vowed to work diligently.\u0027There is a special responsibility that all US officials have to reject partisan politics when they take government service jobs,\u0027 he said.Merkel this week stressed that, despite the differences, she wants to preserve the bedrock strategic partnership.\u0027The transatlantic alliance, given the many non-democratic developments in this world,\u0027 she said, \u0027is a great treasure that I certainly want to cherish and nurture.\u0027Despite her more sober style, she is unlikely to erge much from Macron on substance.She will be trying to persuade Trump to back off his dual threats of punitive metal tariffs that could spark a transatlantic trade war and his instinct to scrap the Iran nuclear deal.  Merke\u0027s trip to Washington comes on the heels of visit by French President Emmanuel Macron, who was given a lavish welcome by TrumpTrump last month announced tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum, claiming foreign imports were harming US national security by undermining the domestic production needed for military readiness.After an outcry from US allies, he granted a temporary exemption to key partners including the European Union, but this expires on May 1.Trump\u0027s National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow told CNBC Thursday that Washington would continue to exempt allied economies, including the EU, if they make concessions, citing the example of \u0027equal treatment of automobiles.\u0027On the eve of Merkel\u0027s US visit, Berlin\u0027s hopes were dim.\u0027From today\u0027s perspective, we must assume that the tariffs will come on May 1,\u0027 said a German government source. \u0027And then we will see how we will handle it.\u0027The next looming deadline is May 12, the date by which Trump has threatened to tear up the landmark 2015 agreement to stop Iran from developing nuclear weapons in return for relief from international sanctions.Trump has called the agreement, which Germany helped negotiate, \u0027insane\u0027 and the \u0027worst deal ever,\u0027 demanding that its \u0027disastrous flaws\u0027 be fixed.Macron came away from his meetings speculating that Trump would kill the deal, but debate continues to rage.US Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis on Thursday said Washington was yet to make \u0027any decision\u0027 on tearing up the deal, but stressed that some aspects needed to be improved.It is unclear how Mike Pompeo\u0027s confirmation as Secretary of State will tilt the debate.Despite his hawkish views on Iran, his criticism of the deal had been somewhat tempered in internal discussions, officials said.As head of the CIA, for instance, he had relayed the spy agency\u0027s institutional assessment that Iran was broadly complying with the terms of the agreement, despite Trump\u0027s public pronouncements.The German foreign ministry has insisted that \u0027the biggest priority is maintaining the existing nuclear accord,\u0027 while Merkel has also called Iran\u0027s ballistic missile program a \u0027cause for concern.\u0027"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/27/05/4B98CC9E00000578-0-image-m-54_1524802115804.jpg","title":"Ann Curry says reported Lauer behalf woman 2012","story":"    Former Today co-host Ann Curry (pictured with Lauer) has claimed that she reported Matt Lauer as a sex pest on behalf of another woman in 2012, despite NBC Chairman Andy Lack saying last year\u0027s complaint against Lauer was the first of its kind  Curry said she approached two members of NBC\u0027s management team after a female staffer told her she was \u0027sexually harassed physically\u0027 by Lauer. \u0027A woman approached me and asked me tearfully if I could help her,\u0027 Curry said Though Curry did not tell NBC management the woman\u0027s name, she did point to Lauer as the person of concern.   \u0027I told management they had a problem and they needed to keep an eye on him and how he deals with women,\u0027 she said.The NBC staffer also confirmed to the Post that she went to Curry with her complaint.An NBC spokesman told the newspaper that there was no record of the report and no mention of it was in Lauer\u0027s personnel file. The network also noted that Lack was not with the company at the time.

At the time, Lack (center) said it was the first complaint lodged against Lauer in his 20 years at NBC, but the network said \u0027may not have been an isolated incident\u0027  Also on Thursday, former Nightly News anchor Tom Brokaw (left) was accused of sexual misconduct. Linda Vester (right), a former war correspondent for the network, has alleged that Brokaw made unwanted advances toward her in the 1990sAmong other things, Variety reported allegations that Lauer once gave a colleague a sex toy with an explicit note about how he wanted to use it on her that he exposed himself to another female co-worker that he would question female producers about their sex lives and that he would talk about which co-hosts he would like to sleep with.Lauer became the second morning host in a week to lose his job over sexual misconduct allegations. CBS fired Charlie Rose after several women who worked for him complained about his behavior.The 60-year-old has essentially been the king of television morning news since first being paired with Katie Couric on Today in 1997.For many years, Today was the unquestioned ratings leader, until it was eclipsed by ABC\u0027s Good Morning America following the ugly 2012 firing of Lauer\u0027s co-host Curry. The show had stabilized in recent years with Lauer\u0027s pairing with Guthrie. He joins a lengthening list of media figures felled by sexual misconduct accusations this year. Besides Rose, they include Lauer\u0027s NBC News colleague Mark Halperin, Fox News prime-time host Bill O\u0027Reilly and National Public Radio newsroom chief Michael Oreskes. Lauer\u0027s firing came just six weeks after the Harvey Weinstein scandal broke.The Washington Post also reported on Thursday about allegations against former Nightly News anchor Tom Brokaw. Linda Vester, a former war correspondent for the network, has alleged that Brokaw made unwanted advances toward her in the 1990s.One of those advances, she claims, was a forcible kiss. Vester, now 52, said she was 28 at the time of the alleged incidents.   Vester alleged that Brokaw, now 78, invited her for a drink when she was in New York on assignment in 1994. Vester said a similar incident occurred a year later in London.  NBC News faces skepticism in remedying in-house sexual harassment - The Washington Post"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/27/05/4B987FDD00000578-0-image-a-41_1524801686212.jpg","title":"Never seen photographs bring Americas history life","story":"    The Great Depression. This woman is Florence Thompson, age 32, and the mother of seven children.

Two or three sites are under consideration, he revealed.Trump and Kim, the North Korean dictator, have spent the last year trading threats and insults as Pyongyang made rapid advances in pursuit of nuclear-armed missiles capable of hitting America.But amid a softening of relations between Pyongyang and Seoul, the two men have reached an agreement to discuss nuclear disarmament in person.Trump affirmed said he would be meeting with Kim \u0027in the coming weeks\u0027 during a White House celebration on Friday for Olympic athletes.\u0027I want to express my hope that all of the people of Korea, North Korea and South, can someday live in harmony, prosperity and peace,\u0027 he said. \u0027And it looks like it could happen.\u0027           Their dramatic meeting that resulted in an end to the decades long Korean War comes weeks before Kim Jong-un (left) is due to meet U.S. President Donald Trump          North Korean leader Kim Jong Un (centre, right, next to his suster Kim Yo Jong) and South Korean President Moon Jae-in (centre, left) had \u0027serious, frank\u0027 discussions on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and a permanent peace in their first summit session on Friday   Trump cautiously praised today\u0027s historic Korea meeting in a tweet this morning then spoke about it at a ceremony for Olympians at the White House.Trump said that people claimed that denuclearization was an \u0027impossibility\u0027 when he began his campaign to force North Korea to its break point.\u0027And now we have a much better alternative than anybody thought even possible,\u0027 he said.This year\u0027s Winter Olympics, held in South Korea, were instrumental to bringing the North and South together. They walked under one flag in Pyeongchang at the Opening Ceremony. \u0027Hopefully the day will come when Olympic athletes can compete on a Korean Peninsula that is free of nuclear weapons and where all Koreans can live together and care share their dreams,\u0027 Trump today observed.Kim became the first North Korean leader since the 1950-53 Korean War to set foot in the South this morning during talks in which he and South Korean President Moon Jae-in agreed to a \u0027complete denuclearization\u0027 during the talks.  In tweets on Friday morning Trump acknowledged the progress even as he cast doubt over how long positive diplomacy may last.\u0027After a furious year of missile launches and Nuclear testing, a historic meeting between North and South Korea is now taking place.

The United States, and all of its GREAT people, should be very proud of what is now taking place in Korea!\u0027 Trump gave his blessing last week to South Korea, an important American ally, to end the Korean War.The U.S. president has said in recent days that he will meet with Kim \u0027very soon\u0027 and probably by the beginning of June.\u0027It could be that I walk out quickly, with respect,\u0027 he said in a Thursday morning update. \u0027But it could be that the meeting doesn\u0027t even take place, who knows.\u0027           The White House released photos of outgoing CIA director Mike Pompeo meeting North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un on Thursday after Trump revealed their existence          The White House released photos yesterday of former CIA director Mike Pompeo —now Trump\u0027s secretary of state — meeting with Kim during a clandestine visit to Pyongyang earlier this month.\u0027He wasn\u0027t supposed to meet with Kim Jong-un, but he did,\u0027 Trump revealed on Fox \u0026amp Friends. \u0027We have incredible pictures of the two talking and meeting, which I\u0027d love to release if we can, I\u0027ll do that,\u0027 the president had said.Eight hours later, the White House published photos of Pompeo and Kim shaking hands, their countenance pleasant without extending into a grin. On Tuesday Trump said that North Korea\u0027s tyrant \u0027has been very open, and I think very honorable\u0027 in the lead-up to nuclear talks.He clarified later, after he came under scrutiny for the remark, that he meant, \u0027I hope that we will be able to deal in a very open and honorable fashion with North Korea. A lot is happening. And I think it\u0027s going to be very positive.\u0027Trump said Tuesday, as he met with France\u0027s Emmanuel Macron, that \u0027a lot of promises have been made by North Korea over the years,\u0027 however he has reason to believe that Kim, a 33-year-old dictator who took over from is father in 2011, is serious about wanting to make a deal.\u0027We have been very, very tough on maximum pressure.

However, his finish time was never recorded.According to Peter Mowbray, 51, a fellow runner who publicised the incident on Facebook, Mr Halliday was prevented from completing the race by two marshals who saw that he wasn\u0027t wearing a number and escorted him from the course.\u0027It takes a lot of work to run a marathon. It\u0027s not a matter of eating a bowl of pasta and having a go, it\u0027s 12 months worth of training,\u0027 Mr Mowbray said.\u0027Jake had his once-in-a-lifetime experience stolen from him by an imposter.

That man needs to go viral and be named and shamed.\u0027The London Marathon has seen a number of allegations of cheating in its 37-year history.In 2016, TOWIE star James Argent\u0027s sister Natasha had her results removed from the official race website and agreed to return her medal after she ‘ducked under a barrier’ during the race.She was found to have missed 11 out of 24 checkpoints and miraculously finishing the final 20km in just 39mins, quicker than Olympian Sir Mo Farah.In 2014, 34-year-old model Jason Scotland-Williams denied skipping nine miles of the course to achieve a \u0027miracle’ time, the second half of which fell just three minutes shy of the world record – and three minutes faster than Sir Mo.Four years before that, a runner thought to have recorded the quickest-ever time for a pensioner was stripped of his ‘fastest OAP’ title after admitting he took a 10 mile shortcut at Tower Bridge. He claimed he had altered his route due to injury.          The alleged imposter was photographed (pictured) by the friend of a fellow race-goer who said he took his t-shirt off and threw it into the grandstand and said he was behaving strangelyIn 2011, another competitor was disqualified from the Great North Run after it was revealed that he had travelled most of the final six miles on a bus.The following year, father-of-two Rob Sloan tried to get round his ban by entering the race again under a fake name while disguised in sunglasses. Runner Louise Rooney, 41, was coming towards the end of the race when she noticed the imposter behaving strangely.\u0027I was just running to the finish line past the grandstand when the imposter caught my eye,\u0027 she told MailOnline.\u0027He had a very distinctive haircut shaved all over apart from a stripe of hair at the back.\u0027He was walking with a woman I think towards the finish line and I saw him take off his t-shirt and throw it into the grandstand.

Then he stopped and seemed to have second thoughts and he turned round walked back against the flow of the race.

We were calling this \u0027Charlie\u0027s Law\u0027 whilst also working on the foundation set up in his memory.\u0027Once cases are public it is difficult for people to be fully aware of the complexities and this often leads to illinformed judgements on both sides and creates unnecessary conflicts.\u0027We have something that is better for everybody - hospitals, healthcare professionals, families with sick children, the NHS, and the reputation of our own government. We would ask those pushing for law change to take account of the careful work already done, and join us as we continue to push for a solution that is best for all involved\u0027.Alfie Evans\u0027 \u0027Army\u0027 of supporters have abandoned protests outside Alder Hey - but left their banners, flags and balloons - as his family said today they want to take him home in the next day or two to live, not die.  The much-loved little boy is still alive inside the Liverpool hospital more than 72 hours after his life support was withdrawn.The toddler\u0027s parents Tom Evans, 21, and Kate James, 20, insist their son could survive for \u0027months or years\u0027 as they dramatically abandoned their fight to take him abroad for treatment and pledged to work with doctors in a bid to take him home.But Alfie\u0027s family have reacted with fury to claims that their attempt to \u0027build bridges\u0027 with Alder Hey meant they were accepting he is about to pass away.Mr Evans\u0027 brother Daniel said last night: \u0027Thomas and Kate are not preparing themselves for their son\u0027s death in no way shape or form, to get him home is their priority and that’s what they plan to do with the help of Alder Hey\u0027.He added: \u0027Alfie is doing good, 72 hours independent breathing!!\u0027    Alfie\u0027s supporters have spent weeks outside Alder Hey but they have heeded the warning and stayed away today, but their balloons and flags remain            Tom\u0027s brother Daniel has said Alfie\u0027s parents believe their don is coming home to live, not dieTom Evans also had a message for the tens of thousands in \u0027Alfie\u0027s Army\u0027 as he asked them to stand down \u0027if this is what it takes to get our son home\u0027.He said: \u0027Please respect this. You have all been the most crucial part of our fight and we love you all\u0027. Until last night, Mr Evans and Miss James were desperate to fly him to a hospital in the Vatican - but now accept their best hope of leaving Alder Hey is getting him home. Mr Evans said the \u0027warrior\u0027 toddler\u0027s mother has been keeping him alive with cuddles.He said: \u0027Alfie\u0027s fought through the night the last two nights because he\u0027s been lying on Kate\u0027s chest non-stop. And him and his mum have become closer now more than ever before\u0027.  A military helicopter had been put on standby at the request of the Pope, who met Mr Evans last week. But on Tuesday a High Court judge again refused the couple permission to take Alfie to Rome and his decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal the following day.  After a meeting with doctors, Mr Evans said he and Kate James, 20, and the hospital in Liverpool wanted privacy in order to ‘form a relationship, build a bridge and walk across it’.‘In Alfie’s interests we will work with his treating team on a plan that provides our boy with the dignity and comfort he needs,’ he said. The comments marked a huge sea change in the couple’s attitude to medics, whom Mr Evans had previously threatened to prosecute for conspiring to murder his 23-month-old son.Earlier yesterday he had said doctors were treating him and Miss James like criminals. Mr Evans, who wants three of his doctors prosecuted for conspiracy to murder, said: \u0027They hate us. They don\u0027t like us because I\u0027ve fought against them for so long and I\u0027m right\u0027.He added: \u0027We\u0027re not like them. We walk around the corridors and they pop into other cubicles to avoid us. They give us some horrible smug look as if we\u0027re in the wrong. It\u0027s like we\u0027re criminals and we\u0027re being looked down on\u0027.             Alfie, with his father sleeping in the background, is still fighting, his family say, despite a lack of a ventilator            Mr Evans made a plea for supporters to stop their protests in the hope it will convince doctors to let Alfie leave But by 6pm the couple had apparently decided to work with medics, thanking both supporters and hospital staff – many of whom have been the targets of abuse – and said they would not be making any more public comments.‘Our lives have been turned upside down by the intense focus on Alfie and his situation,’ Mr Evans said. ‘Our little family, along with Alder Hey, has become the centre of attention for many people around the world and it has meant we have not been able to live our lives as we would like.‘We are very grateful and we appreciate all the support we have received from around the world... (but) we would now ask you to return back to your everyday lives and allow myself, Kate and Alder Hey to form a relationship, build a bridge and walk across it.‘We also wish to thank Alder Hey staff at every level for their dignity and professionalism during what must be an incredibly difficult time for them too.’ Mr Evans’s comments came as protests and vigils were held in Poland, Ireland and the Vatican for Alfie, who was taken off life-support on Monday following a drawn-out legal battle.Doctors say he has a degenerative, incurable neurological condition, is in a deep coma and it is in his best interests to let him die.High Court judge Mr Justice Hayden urged the parents to disregard the advice of ‘pro-life’ campaigners who he accused of manipulating them and to spend what precious time they had left with their son.           People hold candles as they gather to attend a prayer vigil for terminally ill toddler Alfie Evans           Another candlelit vigil in support of Alfie Evans took place in front of the Great Britain embassy building in Warsaw          Alfie\u0027s Army have also gathered outside Liverpool including here at Belfast city Hall to voice their support for the childHe slammed the \u0027malign hand\u0027 of Pavel Stroilov, who works for the Christian Legal Centre (CLC), and called him a \u0027fanatical and deluded\u0027 man whose advice had come \u0027perilously close\u0027 to contempt of court.The couple apparently agreed with the judge, who said their only option was to work with medics to try to move Alfie from intensive care – either onto a normal ward, a hospice or home – for his final days. It came as health chiefs warned hospital staff to hide their uniforms due to threats directed at them after Alfie’s case. It came after a \u0027sick\u0027 and \u0027psychotic\u0027 minority of Alfie Evans\u0027 supporters threatened to \u0027burn down\u0027 Alder Hey and wished harm on doctors as it was revealed police are ready to arrest the trolls. For more information on the Charlie Gard Foundation click HERE "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/27/15/4B9B79F600000578-5665217-image-a-47_1524841152201.jpg","title":"Rogue puppy trader 50 000 lying customers","story":"    Lisa Canning outside Cardiff Crown Court, where she admitted unfair commercial practice and four counts of fraudA cruel puppy trader made £50,000 by lying about the breeds of dogs and tampering with their medical records before selling them to unsuspecting victims online.Lisa Canning  flogged puppies to customers who wanted fashionable breeds - but DNA tests showed they were completely different types of dog.Canning was not licensed to sell dogs at her farmhouse in Barry, south Wales, but made thousands flogging more than 100 puppies.As he ordered her to pay more than £40,000 in court costs and £3,000 compensation, a judge said the greedy 50-year-old \u0027played on people\u0027s emotions\u0027. One vaccination card found at her home had been \u0027tampered with\u0027 to change the name of a cocker-Labrador cross to a \u0027golden Labrador\u0027. The judge said Canning \u0027knew buyers wouldn\u0027t return the dogs,\u0027 adding: \u0027Almost everyone is vulnerable to the charms of a puppy.\u0027            Rescued Isla (pictured with a volunteer) is one of the dogs cared for by Hope Rescue following Canning\u0027s offending          The 50-year-old advertised this golden Labrador puppy - but the medical records had been tampered with Prosecutor Lee Reynolds said: \u0027She traded unlawfully for a significant period of time.\u0027The business knowingly and deliberately breached its dog breeding licence requirements.\u0027 Canning sold around 100 dogs online using sites including Pets4Homes, Gumtree and Preloved, the court heard.

The siblings were outraged after discovering nuts in the main meal on the flight, despite informing Emirates of their allergiesThey refused to move into the toilets after a staff member suggested it and spent the next seven hours sitting at the back of the plane with blankets covering their heads and nostrils.Ms Sahota, an analyst said: \u0027We felt so degraded and embarrassed - it was horrible and it was meant to be a happy occasion but the start of our holiday was ruined.\u0027We had contacted Emirates beforehand to make sure they were aware of our allergies, and when we arrived at the airport and checked our bags in, we let them know and they said it was all fine and that it was in the system.\u0027When we spoke to the people who greet you at the plane, the said it was fine and showed us to our seats.\u0027We had bought our own food and snacks with us as we just didn\u0027t want to take the risk as our allergies are so severe.\u0027When we realised what they were serving we were just completely panicked and started frantically buzzing for the staff to come over as it was too late to get off.\u0027We must have buzzed about 15 minutes before someone came - we told her the issue and how we had already informed them, multiple times about it.\u0027I told her that we could potentially die as we have got a severe nut allergy and she didn\u0027t seem to concerned.\u0027She asked if we had any medication for it and we always carry epi-pens, but they\u0027re only for emergencies and you need to go straight to hospital after.

He played Obama like a fiddle...Trump warns countries who don’t support the combined 2026...Share this articleAware of the optics, anxious German diplomats pressed, in vain, for Merkel to enjoy a similarly meaty two days at the White House, betting the face time would help sweeten difficult relations, officials told AFP.When Merkel last came to Washington, the cautious dry-witted chancellor held several awkward joint appearances with her more impulsive host -- clashing publicly over defense spending, trade and migration.This time around, the tricolor French flags were only just removed in time for Merkel\u0027s arrival for a one day, run-of-the-mill \u0027working visit.\u0027The stylistic differences between the Macron and Merkel visits are \u0027very telling\u0027 according to Mona Krewel of Cornell University.It points, she said, \u0027to the much more difficult relationship Trump has with Merkel.\u0027          Unlike French President Emamanuel Macron, Merkel\u0027s visit is a one day, run-of-the-mill \u0027working visit\u0027That is a dramatic change in fortunes for the German leader who, for more than a decade, was seen by Washington not just as a sensible and pragmatic interlocutor, but the de facto leader of Europe.Her relationship with Barack Obama was particularly close, officials from that administration have said, so much so that he was a powerful voice encouraging her to run for a fourth term.Their partnership has proven, along with centrists claiming her as the new \u0027leader of the free world\u0027, to be a poisoned chalice for Berlin in the age of Trump.Just hours before the chancellor landed late Thursday, some 15 months after Trump was sworn into office, the Republican Congress finally got around to confirming an ambassador to Germany.Shortly after his nomination, Richard Grenell, who is known for his pugilistic conservatism and combative defense of Trump\u0027s \u0027America First\u0027 policies, told AFP it was \u0027humbling\u0027 to be chosen for a post once held by John Quincy Adams, and he vowed to work diligently.\u0027There is a special responsibility that all US officials have to reject partisan politics when they take government service jobs,\u0027 he said.Merkel this week stressed that, despite the differences, she wants to preserve the bedrock strategic partnership.\u0027The transatlantic alliance, given the many non-democratic developments in this world,\u0027 she said, \u0027is a great treasure that I certainly want to cherish and nurture.\u0027Despite her more sober style, she is unlikely to erge much from Macron on substance.She will be trying to persuade Trump to back off his dual threats of punitive metal tariffs that could spark a transatlantic trade war and his instinct to scrap the Iran nuclear deal.  Merke\u0027s trip to Washington comes on the heels of visit by French President Emmanuel Macron, who was given a lavish welcome by TrumpTrump last month announced tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum, claiming foreign imports were harming US national security by undermining the domestic production needed for military readiness.After an outcry from US allies, he granted a temporary exemption to key partners including the European Union, but this expires on May 1.Trump\u0027s National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow told CNBC Thursday that Washington would continue to exempt allied economies, including the EU, if they make concessions, citing the example of \u0027equal treatment of automobiles.\u0027On the eve of Merkel\u0027s US visit, Berlin\u0027s hopes were dim.\u0027From today\u0027s perspective, we must assume that the tariffs will come on May 1,\u0027 said a German government source. \u0027And then we will see how we will handle it.\u0027The next looming deadline is May 12, the date by which Trump has threatened to tear up the landmark 2015 agreement to stop Iran from developing nuclear weapons in return for relief from international sanctions.Trump has called the agreement, which Germany helped negotiate, \u0027insane\u0027 and the \u0027worst deal ever,\u0027 demanding that its \u0027disastrous flaws\u0027 be fixed.Macron came away from his meetings speculating that Trump would kill the deal, but debate continues to rage.US Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis on Thursday said Washington was yet to make \u0027any decision\u0027 on tearing up the deal, but stressed that some aspects needed to be improved.It is unclear how Mike Pompeo\u0027s confirmation as Secretary of State will tilt the debate.Despite his hawkish views on Iran, his criticism of the deal had been somewhat tempered in internal discussions, officials said.As head of the CIA, for instance, he had relayed the spy agency\u0027s institutional assessment that Iran was broadly complying with the terms of the agreement, despite Trump\u0027s public pronouncements.The German foreign ministry has insisted that \u0027the biggest priority is maintaining the existing nuclear accord,\u0027 while Merkel has also called Iran\u0027s ballistic missile program a \u0027cause for concern.\u0027"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/27/06/4B98B2C800000578-5663467-image-m-12_1524806884888.jpg","title":"A dozen jogging guards surround Kim Jong uns Mercedes limo","story":"The crack team is believed to have been chosen from the Supreme Guard Command which overseen the Kim family for three generations          Television showed the bodyguards in a ring-shaped formation around the vehicle as it rolled back to the northern side of the Panmunjom truce village           The guards deftly altered their formation to avoid being hit as the car turned a slight bend in the roadKim was seen stepping into the limo outside the Peace House, where his talks with Moon had taken place. As the vehicle began to pull off the bodyguards immediately leapt into action, peeling off one by one to ensure it was covered on all sides. A bromance blossoms as Kim and Moon hold hands during...Otto Warmbier\u0027s family sue North Korea for the brutal...Share this articleThe guards deftly altered their formation to avoid being hit as the car turned a slight bend before crossing a patch of dead grass over to its destination. Twitter users poked fun at the bizarre video after it emerged online.           The Mercedes limo then crossed a patch of dead grass on the way to the dictator\u0027s lunch destination          The all male team of suited guards followed the North Korean dictator throughout the day   The bodyguards first appeared as Kim descended steps towards the demilitarized zone and President Moon          Later they reappeared to run next to Kim\u0027s car.

With great respect, we leave the room and just keep it going.\u0027Trump was optimistic on Friday that a commitment to end the decades-long Korean War and an agreement to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula would pave the way for him to meet face-to-face with Kim Jong-un. Two or three sites are under consideration, he revealed.Trump and Kim, the North Korean dictator, have spent the last year trading threats and insults as Pyongyang made rapid advances in pursuit of nuclear-armed missiles capable of hitting America.But amid a softening of relations between Pyongyang and Seoul, the two men have reached an agreement to discuss nuclear disarmament in person.Trump affirmed said he would be meeting with Kim \u0027in the coming weeks\u0027 during a White House celebration on Friday for Olympic athletes.\u0027I want to express my hope that all of the people of Korea, North Korea and South, can someday live in harmony, prosperity and peace,\u0027 he said. \u0027And it looks like it could happen.\u0027           Their dramatic meeting that resulted in an end to the decades long Korean War comes weeks before Kim Jong-un (left) is due to meet U.S. President Donald Trump          North Korean leader Kim Jong Un (centre, right, next to his suster Kim Yo Jong) and South Korean President Moon Jae-in (centre, left) had \u0027serious, frank\u0027 discussions on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and a permanent peace in their first summit session on Friday   Trump cautiously praised today\u0027s historic Korea meeting in a tweet this morning then spoke about it at a ceremony for Olympians at the White House.Trump said that people claimed that denuclearization was an \u0027impossibility\u0027 when he began his campaign to force North Korea to its break point.\u0027And now we have a much better alternative than anybody thought even possible,\u0027 he said.This year\u0027s Winter Olympics, held in South Korea, were instrumental to bringing the North and South together. They walked under one flag in Pyeongchang at the Opening Ceremony. \u0027Hopefully the day will come when Olympic athletes can compete on a Korean Peninsula that is free of nuclear weapons and where all Koreans can live together and care share their dreams,\u0027 Trump today observed.Kim became the first North Korean leader since the 1950-53 Korean War to set foot in the South this morning during talks in which he and South Korean President Moon Jae-in agreed to a \u0027complete denuclearization\u0027 during the talks.  In tweets on Friday morning Trump acknowledged the progress even as he cast doubt over how long positive diplomacy may last.\u0027After a furious year of missile launches and Nuclear testing, a historic meeting between North and South Korea is now taking place. Good things are happening, but only time will tell!\u0027 Trump wrote this morning.In a second message, he added: \u0027KOREAN WAR TO END! The United States, and all of its GREAT people, should be very proud of what is now taking place in Korea!\u0027 Trump gave his blessing last week to South Korea, an important American ally, to end the Korean War.The U.S. president has said in recent days that he will meet with Kim \u0027very soon\u0027 and probably by the beginning of June.\u0027It could be that I walk out quickly, with respect,\u0027 he said in a Thursday morning update. \u0027But it could be that the meeting doesn\u0027t even take place, who knows.\u0027           The White House released photos of outgoing CIA director Mike Pompeo meeting North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un on Thursday after Trump revealed their existence          The White House released photos yesterday of former CIA director Mike Pompeo —now Trump\u0027s secretary of state — meeting with Kim during a clandestine visit to Pyongyang earlier this month.\u0027He wasn\u0027t supposed to meet with Kim Jong-un, but he did,\u0027 Trump revealed on Fox \u0026amp Friends. \u0027We have incredible pictures of the two talking and meeting, which I\u0027d love to release if we can, I\u0027ll do that,\u0027 the president had said.Eight hours later, the White House published photos of Pompeo and Kim shaking hands, their countenance pleasant without extending into a grin. On Tuesday Trump said that North Korea\u0027s tyrant \u0027has been very open, and I think very honorable\u0027 in the lead-up to nuclear talks.He clarified later, after he came under scrutiny for the remark, that he meant, \u0027I hope that we will be able to deal in a very open and honorable fashion with North Korea. A lot is happening. And I think it\u0027s going to be very positive.\u0027Trump said Tuesday, as he met with France\u0027s Emmanuel Macron, that \u0027a lot of promises have been made by North Korea over the years,\u0027 however he has reason to believe that Kim, a 33-year-old dictator who took over from is father in 2011, is serious about wanting to make a deal.\u0027We have been very, very tough on maximum pressure. We have been very tough on, as you know, trade. We\u0027ve been very, very tough at the border. Sanctions have been the toughest we\u0027ve ever imposed on any country,\u0027 he said. \u0027And we think it will be a great thing for North Korea and it will be a great thing for the world. So we\u0027ll see where that all goes.\u0027Trump reiterated that he would \u0027leave the table\u0027 if the discussions with Kim are not productive — a threat he first made during a summit with Japan\u0027s prime minister in Florida last week. \u0027Maybe it will be wonderful and maybe it won\u0027t.

The prize has now been withdrawn after judges noticed a problem: the anteater pictured is almost certainly a stuffed animal kept outside a visitor centre.The Natural History Museum, which administers the awards, has disqualified the Brazilian wildlife photographer Marcio Cabral for attempting to deceive judges by submitting a picture of a taxidermy specimen in the “animals in their environment” category.After a “thorough investigation” involving two mammal experts and a taxidermy specialist from the museum, in addition to two South American experts, it was concluded that the photograph features the dead anteater that greets visitors at the entrance to Brazil’s Emas National Park.“The five scientists, working independently of each other, all concluded that there are elements of the animal’s posture, morphology, raised tufts of fur and patterns on the neck and head that are too similar for the images to show two different animals,” said a spokesperson for the museum.The investigation followed a tip-off from a third party that the photograph, entitled The Night Raider, broke competition rules, which demand that “entries must not deceive the viewer or attempt to misrepresent the reality of nature”.Cabral, who strongly denies using a stuffed animal in the image, claimed in his original submission that he had spent three years waiting for the right conditions to capture the glowing termite mounds. According to his original caption, the photographer spent days frustrated by rain in Emas National Park before a “giant anteater ambled out of the darkness” and stayed “just long enough” for him to take a single photo.The museum said Cabral co-operated with the investigation and supplied image files taken before and after the winning shot. None of them included the anteater.According to the museum, Cabral also offered a witness who claims he also saw the animal alive, but the investigators were unconvinced.Roz Kidman Cox, a member of the 2017 judging panel, issued a stern warning to others who submit dubious images in an attempt to win awards: “I find it disheartening and surprising that a photographer would go to such lengths to deceive the competition and its worldwide following.”“The competition places great store on honesty and integrity, and such a breach of the rules is disrespectful to the wildlife photography community, which is at the heart of the competition.”The image had been on display at the Natural History Museum since October as part of a paid exhibition. On Friday morning it was removed from the gallery wall and replaced with a notice explaining the alleged falsification.Fellow photographers were baffled by Cabral’s apparent attempt to dupe judges. “If that’s true, he’s just done himself so much more harm than is necessary,” said Brent Stirton, who won the overall Wildlife Photographer of the Year prize in the same awards ceremony. “There are plenty of experts in our field and sooner or later, if you do that kind of thing, it catches up with you.”Stirton said winning such an award can make a “huge difference for people who on their way up”. “For the wildlife world, this is their Oscars. This is a big deal. Guys spend their whole career trying to win one of these ones. It’s one that counts.“I’m just a bit sorry for this guy. I’m not sure if he did fake this, but if he did it’s a sign of desperation. I don’t want to be that guy because that kind of stain will follow you around. Even if you take the greatest wildlife picture ever taken, people are going to doubt it.”Stirton said fake images would usually be detected: “A great deal of us are just photographers and we rely on genuine experts to know how animals behave. Those people spend their whole life looking at those animals. If you think you can slip one past those guys, it’s optimistic at best and arrogant at worst.“Why take that kind of risk? Because surely if you do that and collect an award, in the back of your mind you’re waiting to be uncovered?”This is not the first time the competition has been hit by accusations of fakery. In 2010, the overall winner lost his award following claims that he hired a tame wolf to feature in the winning photo."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4eacd6dc9ba4b7e0bd126794be3cc1bd07bcf1be/0_0_8681_5787/master/8681.jpg?w=480\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=961ca23cdd7297ac701528febb304966 480w","title":"theresa may faces cross party push company public registers overseas territories amendment tory","story":"Amendment has enough Tory backers to implement measure Cameron and Osborne proposed in 2013A group of Tory and Labour backbenchers are increasingly confident they can force Theresa May to introduce public ownership registers in Britain’s overseas territories in an attempt to prevent them from being used to hide “dirty money”.Nineteen Conservative MPs have signed an amendment scheduled for debate in the Commons on Tuesday – theoretically a sufficient number to defeat the government, which has halted plans to implement a transparency measure originally proposed by David Cameron and George Osborne in 2013.The Labour MP Margaret Hodge, who is one of the two principal backers of the amendment, said: “There is a spectrum of activity that starts with tax avoidance and then quickly goes on to money laundering and organised crime. Britain and its overseas territories have become the jurisdiction of choice for dirty money because of the secrecy of our offshore ownership laws.”More than half of the offshore companies referred to in the Panama Papers were set up in the British Virgin Islands (BVI), according to Transparency International. The jurisdiction allows people to register companies in secret, prompting accusations that it is easy to hide cash and assets without external scrutiny.Conservative supporters of the amendment to the sanctions and anti-money laundering bill are led by Andrew Mitchell and include the former cabinet ministers Nicky Morgan, Dominic Grieve, Stephen Crabb and Ken Clarke. The SNP’s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, and the Liberal Democrat leader, Vince Cable, are also backers.Mitchell said he was hopeful the government would recognise the strength of parliamentary opinion on the subject and find a way of “elegantly getting off the hook”.He said: “The argument that the registers are available in private to UK authorities is insufficient. Public registers allow reporting and discussion of these matters by the media and civil society, as was demonstrated by debate that followed the leak of the Panama Papers.”No 10 said on Friday it was studying the amendment carefully, prompting speculation that ministers may attempt to broker a compromise. “We want to analyse its effectiveness. This is an important issue and one we want to get right,” the prime minister’s spokesman said. There are 14 British overseas territories, with a combined population of 350,000. Several have become major offshore financial centres, including Bermuda, Cayman Islands, Gibraltar and the BVI.The overseas territories have introduced private central registers of ownership, which are accessible to UK law enforcement and tax authorities. The amendment calls on them to make those publicly available by December 2020, or have UK ministers impose that requirement upon them via orders in council.Some of the territories have expressed opposition to the imposition of public registers, with one leading offshore centre saying it would cost its public purse $100m (£72m) a year.In March, in a previously unreported submission, the BVI government told British MPs debating the bill that such a move “without consultation or consensus effectively disenfranchises the BVI legislature and its electorate creating resentment and damaging the historically strong relationship between the BVI and the UK”.It said the territory was still recovering from the impact of Hurricane Irma and could not afford to deal with the effects from lost revenue. The BVI called on the UK government “to foot the bill or see a crisis in the BVI’s public services. Over the next 10 years this could result in an additional funding gap of $1bn.”Proponents of the amendment have lobbied government ministers.

Yet Mr Justice Hayden, referring to some of the campaigners now surrounding Alfie’s parents, did not mince his words, after this most hellish of ethical dilemmas ended this week in a court ruling that the child’s ventilator be switched off against the family’s\u0026nbspwishes.The judge was careful not to attach blame to Tom Evans and Kate James, who cannot accept the settled view of their son’s doctors that his brain has been damaged catastrophically by an as yet undiagnosed condition, or that the intensive treatment required to keep him alive is no longer in his best interest and may be causing him suffering.Alfie’s parents have fought like tigers both in and out of court and no parent – even those whose sympathies in this case are with the doctors facing death threats for doing what they honestly believe is the right thing – will begrudge the family their right to clutch in their grief at every straw there is.But the high court judge is surely right to question the motives of some of those extending straws. The most disturbing aspect of this case is the sense that it is now being exploited by those who see Alfie not as a desperately sick little boy, but as an expedient means of advancing their own ideological cause.That description doesn’t just apply to the pro-life movement, of course. Among Alfie’s viscerally engaged army of Facebook supporters, which includes many parents of small children, you will find anti-vaxxers using the story to peddle utterly deluded junk science theories about the Vitamin K injection every newborn gets. You’ll find American gun lobby enthusiasts ranting on about how this is what happens when “the government” runs people’s lives and that’s why everyone needs to keep hold of their weapons never mind that this decision has nothing to do with the government, resting as it does on the independent judgment of doctors upheld by an independent judiciary.Others have sought to use the case to score cheap, wildly inaccurate points over healthcare reform in the US to claim this is where “socialised medicine” gets you, when without the NHS and its daily miracle of providing treatment free at the point of use, Alfie’s parents would now be struggling with medical bills running into the millions.And where far-right conspiracy sites such as Infowars and Breitbart rush in, an army of trolls inevitably follows. Staff at Alder Hey children’s hospital have experienced a horrific barrage of death threats and other online abuse. There have been ugly scenes at the hospital too, reports of over-zealous protesters blocking ambulances or intimidating visitors and patients. It is all too uncomfortably reminiscent of those who harass pregnant women outside abortion clinics and threaten to kill doctors offering terminations, so high on their self-righteous mission to save that all other human lives cease to matter.But none of that is quite what the judge meant. His concern centres specifically on the way the Evans family has been taken under the wing of a hitherto little-known evangelical group called the Christian Legal Centre, which has supplied the parents with a barrister and, somewhat dubiously, the services of a law student named Pavel Stroilov. A statement drafted for Alfie’s father was, according to Hayden, loaded with “vituperation and bile” against the hospital, which had not helped the baby’s case. At one point, Stroilov apparently became party to an attempt by Alfie’s father to have the doctors prosecuted for murder.The family’s former solicitor Mary Holmes has accused activists of seeking to “keep this child alive at any costs and not for the right reasons”, using the case to raise their profile with interventions such as securing Tom Evans an audience with the pope. Most seriously, Stroilov stands accused of giving Evans inaccurate advice in a letter stating that he had the legal right to remove his son from the hospital, despite a court order to the contrary, causing an understandably emotional standoff between the parents and the hospital when it became clear that was not the case. What is compassionate or Christian about giving a desperate man false hope?The judge’s objection to an outpouring of what he called “emotive nonsense” in his courtroom is not to be confused with heartlessness. Rather, it is a recognition that courts are the one place where, in cases like these, reason can still prevail over white-hot emotion that their job is to provide a calm enough environment for doctors facing impossibly difficult choices to explain their clinical reasoning, and for evidence to be considered on its merits. For in British law, what matters is what is in the best interest of the child, not of the parents or the doctors or wider public opinion, and certainly not of organised religion. The court process functions only when the adults involved can be mature enough to put their own interests to one side, which means lawyers in such cases acting as advocates for their clients – not campaigners advancing their own beliefs.And while advocacy may mean fighting to the bitter end, there are times when it means gently introducing a client to the idea that it is time to stop that however unreconciled they are to a painful verdict, it isn’t going to change. It is a conversation that would be familiar, ironically enough, not only to doctors but to priests.The church’s role can be to give hope where secular medicine has none. Light a candle, say a prayer, and just for a minute you might believe in a miracle. Yet that is not its only role at the end of life, when the dying and the grieving are looking as much for comfort as for hope and for help in accepting the inevitable with grace. As Psalm 23: 4 has it, “Yea, though I walk through the shadows of the valley of death, I will fear no evil for thou art with me.” This family is walking through the shadows of that valley now, and they deserve to be accompanied by people with only their best interests at heart. May they find the comfort and grace they deserve."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f66a12845628109a56b2e39d44c91c9837c4b622/0_1_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9a0dba8c96f539c990f2f170b3e0a603","title":"david davis brexit tory government talentless","story":"It’s long been traditional to describe a lazy performance by an actor as phoned in. In the case of DExEu’s David Davis, however, he doesn’t even text it in. The secretary of state’s performance in front of the Brexit select committee this week basically amounted to a series of emoticons. He\u0026nbspcan’t do you an explanation of how in the name of magical thinking the government can square its promises on the Irish border with promises on leaving the customs union – but he can do you the shrug. ¯\\_(ツ)_¯ Did you miss it? Don’t worry. Just ask him another question and he’ll do it again.At such a late stage of the game, it is unclear quite how many civil service lectures on the problem Davis has failed to pay attention to. But on this evidence, he urgently needs to be bored harder over the hard border. Or perhaps the looming crisis point is what he wants. Perhaps Britain has had enough of exports.Since before the referendum was even a twinkle in\u0026nbspDavid Cameron’s eye, leavers have been immeasurably helped by the fact that many of us – most\u0026nbspof us? – don’t understand the simplicities of Brexit, let alone its complexities. I recently watched an ITV news dispatch from Norway’s border with Sweden during which I discovered that either Davis did not know what the word “frictionless” meant, or was hoping no one else did. On this basis, Joan Crawford and Bette\u0026nbspDavis had a frictionless relationship.I can only recall one hard lesson from Theresa May in the past year, when she said to the nation: “If we don’t get the negotiation right, your economic security and prosperity will be put at risk and the opportunities you seek for your families will simply not happen. If we do not stand up and get this negotiation right, we risk the secure and well-paid jobs we want for our children and our children’s children too.” And yet, in context, even this is not the moment of brutal candour it appears. May made these comments outside Downing Street in the course of a ludicrously aggressive diatribe against the EU, immediately after returning from Buckingham Palace to call her Darwin award-winning election.Last August, it emerged that some on the EU side of negotiations thought it impossible that the UK side should be as under-prepared and aimless as they seemed, and that it must all be a clever ploy. Pretty sure no one’s floating that theory any more. What’s somehow more unsettling, though, is the look on the faces of Brexiteers outside the inner circle as they realise we really are winging this. This week even such allies appeared concerned by Davis’s shallows.Elsewhere in the government of all the talentless, Amber Rudd’s eye-catching decision to make her terrible week worse is drawing conspiracy theories of its own. On Thursday, the home secretary popped to the Commons to apologise for misleading them over Windrush again, then told journalists she “was not going to be drawn” as to whether Britain would stay in the customs union, despite May saying it wouldn’t. It’s a mark of the government’s baroque dysfunction that the embattled Rudd’s gaffe was regarded by some as a cunning ruse. “I think a lot of people in government are willing us on,” judged one Tory customs union rebel.Underpinning all this is the government’s own structural problem – namely, the impossibility of even the sympathetic half of the audience being able to suspend their disbelief. These people might back them,\u0026nbspbut do they really believe them? We all know what they did two summers ago.The cabinet is now cobbled together from two sides of the referendum ide, each of whom accused the other of the most despicable lies during the campaign. Ever since, preposterously, they have expected the public to accept they are telling the truth when they act together. How is this supposed to work?It is difficult to overstate the absurdity of the home secretary presenting any sort of united front with the foreign secretary, for instance, given that she explained to a TV audience of millions: “Boris? Well, he’s the life and soul of the party but he’s not the man you want driving you home at the end of the evening.” This is a date-rape joke with a drink-drive cover story – a memorable attempt by Amber to cast herself as the Iceman to Boris’s Maverick. I’m not precisely sure where that metaphor leaves us after the past fortnight, but it’s fair to say that if world war three does threaten to break out, you don’t want Amber within two continents of a fighter jet cockpit. It feels more as if we’ve reached the point in a movie where Theresa May is using Rudd’s political corpse as a bullet shield.Or have we? In the sort of masterstroke of comic timing many have come to expect from this outfit, we learned on Thursday of the “war chests” that have been built up this year by cabinet ministers thought to be eyeing leadership bids. As the Sun revealed, those big beasts are: Gavin Williamson (who no longer sells fireplaces), Michael Gove and Amber Rudd. But of course. Reflecting on her abject and shameful Windrush failures this week, Rudd said: “I look back with hindsight and I’m surprised I did not see the shape of it sooner.”The same might be said of the government’s quarter-arsed handling of negotiations with the EU. What will eventually unite many leave and remain voters, one suspects, is the enraged conviction that the politicians should have known what they were doing with Brexit, and rather sooner than this."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b34271cbf2342fe18e93372f64e6ed1b019dec8/0_37_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=959e0d0d4303ef483a5d92d5b95ee4a2","title":"eu agrees total ban on bee harming pesticides","story":"The world’s most widely used insecticides will be banned from all fields within six months, to protect both wild and honeybees that are vital to crop pollinationThe European Union will ban the world’s most widely used insecticides from all fields due to the serious danger they pose to bees.The ban on neonicotinoids, approved by member nations on Friday, is expected to come into force by the end of 2018 and will mean they can only be used in closed greenhouses.Bees and other insects are vital for global food production as they pollinate three-quarters of all crops. The plummeting numbers of pollinators in recent years has been blamed, in part, on the widespread use of pesticides. The EU banned the use of neonicotinoids on flowering crops that attract bees, such as oil seed rape, in 2013.But in February, a major report from the European Union’s scientific risk assessors (Efsa) concluded that the high risk to both honeybees and wild bees resulted from any outdoor use, because the pesticides contaminate soil and water. This leads to the pesticides appearing in wildflowers or succeeding crops. A recent study of honey samples revealed global contamination by neonicotinoids.Vytenis Andriukaitis, European commissioner for Health and Food Safety, welcomed Friday’s vote: “The commission had proposed these measures months ago, on the basis of the scientific advice from Efsa. Bee health remains of paramount importance for me since it concerns bioersity, food production and the environment.”The ban on the three main neonicotinoids has widespread public support, with almost 5 million people signing a petition from campaign group Avaaz. “Banning these toxic pesticides is a beacon of hope for bees,” said Antonia Staats at Avaaz. “Finally, our governments are listening to their citizens, the scientific evidence and farmers who know that bees can’t live with these chemicals and we can’t live without bees.”Martin Dermine, at Pesticide Action Network Europe, said: “Authorising neonicotinoids a quarter of a century ago was a mistake and led to an environmental disaster. Today’s vote is historic.”However, the pesticide manufacturers and some farming groups have accused the EU of being overly cautious and suggested crop yields could fall, a claim rejected by others. “European agriculture will suffer as a result of this decision,” said Graeme Taylor, at the European Crop Protection Association. “Perhaps not today, perhaps not tomorrow, but in time decision makers will see the clear impact of removing a vital tool for farmers.”The UK’s National Farmers’ Union (NFU) said the ban was regrettable and not justified by the evidence. Guy Smith, NFU deputy president, said: “The pest problems that neonicotinoids helped farmers tackle have not gone away. There is a real risk that these restrictions will do nothing measurable to improve bee health, while compromising the effectiveness of crop protection.” A spokesman for the UK Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs welcomed the ban, but added: “We recognise the impact a ban will have on farmers and will continue to work with them to explore alternative approaches.” In November, UK environment secretary Michael Gove overturned the UK’s previous opposition to a full outdoor ban. Neonicotinoids, which are nerve agents, have been shown to cause a wide range of harm to inidual bees, such as damaging memory and reducing queen numbers.Prof Dave Goulson, at the University of Sussex, said the EU ban was logical given the weight of evidence but that disease and lack of flowery habitats were also harming bees. “Also, if these neonicotinoids are simply replaced by other similar compounds, then we will simply be going round in circles. What is needed is a move towards truly sustainable farming,” he said.Some experts are worried that the exemption for greenhouses means neonicotinoids will be washed out into water courses, where they can severely harm aquatic life.Prof Jeroen van der Sluijs, at the University of Bergen, Norway, said neonicotinoids will also continue to be used in flea treatments for pets and in stables and animal transport vehicles, which account for about a third of all uses: “Environmental pollution will continue.”The EU decision could have global ramifications, according to Prof Nigel Raine, at the University of Guelph in Canada: “Policy makers in other jurisdictions will be paying close attention to these decisions. We rely on both farmers and pollinators for the food we eat. Pesticide regulation is a balancing act between unintended consequences of their use for non-target organisms, including pollinators, and giving farmers the tools they need to control crop pests.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37ee5ba5151826eaa657aaef2dbc02f2d55d6a49/0_0_5472_3648/master/5472.jpg?w=1010\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3006b3da41e4514b10f32ca606e2020c 1010w","title":"peter rabbit hereditary trailer years scariest film australia perth","story":"‘Parents were yelling at the projectionist to stop,’ says audience member as teaser for horror film Hereditary is mistakenly aired before Peter Rabbit screeningFamilies were forced to flee an Australian cinema when a trailer for a horror film dubbed “the year’s scariest film” was accidentally shown before a school holidays showing of Peter Rabbit.WAtoday reports that the incident occurred an Anzac Day holiday screening of the Beatrix Potter adaptation at Event Cinemas in Innaloo, Perth. As audience members settled down for the film, a trailer for Hereditary began to play. The film, which stars Toni Colette, has received an MA15+ rating in Australia for “themes of strong horror”. Its trailer features a number of unsettling scenes, including one in which a child appears to cut the head off a dead pigeon with a pair of scissors.“It was dreadful. Very quickly you could tell this was not a kid’s film,” an audience member told the newspaper. “Parents were yelling at the projectionist to stop, covering their kids’ eyes and ears. Some parents fled the cinema with their kids in tow.”The cinema eventually switched off the screen, and later offered audience members complimentary tickets as a gesture of goodwill. A spokesperson for Event Cinema’s parent company, Event Hospitality and Entertainment, said that the issue was being “investigated internally to ensure situations like this do not occur again”.This is far from the first time a screening for a family-friendly film has been preceded by an unsuitable trailer. In 2012, a cinema in south London accidentally screened trailers for horror film The Devil Inside and Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance, which stars a flaming skeleton on a motorbike, ahead of a showing of Puss in Boots, while in 2013 a teaser for Lars von Trier’s sexually explicit arthouse drama Nymphomaniac appeared in advance of a screening of Frozen in Florida.

The manager was incredulous that the FA should have goaded a player that will be a key component of Gareth Southgate’s England squad at the World Cup finals in Russia. Kane is expected to captain the team.“It was embarrassing, no?” Pochettino said of the tweet. “It was a shame, because the FA is English football and Harry is a potential captain at the World Cup.

But the reason those screamers, outrageous assists, and crunching tackles stand out is because, well, how to put this … the rest of the Premier League matchday experience can be rubbish.The statisticians at Opta have provided exhaustive lists of numbers and we have abused them. So while the stats are right, there is no guarantee our interpretation passes muster – but it’s not called the ineptitude index for nothing. For each act of Premier League incompetence, we have awarded a number of penalty points (reasonably arbitrarily, if we are honest – best look elsewhere for the serious analysis) which we have tallied into a rolling league table. Who will join 2014-15 champions QPR, 2015-16 title winners Aston Villa and last season’s supremos Hull City as the year’s most incompetent side? There are multiple reasons football is complex but chiefly it is because you play it with your feet, which are not the most dextrous part of the body. It stands to reason then, that the bits you play with your hands are simpler – which brings us to throw-ins. Clearly, some are long, high-risk lobs into the box, or low-percentage balls designed to aid a quick attack. But the majority should be a simple chuck to a team-mate. Somehow Watford have managed to get that wrong 256 times this season, or over seven times a game. Stoke City are nearly as bad – they have conceded possession from a throw-in 214 times – with Leicester (199 times), Brighton (197) and West Ham (193) the next worst offenders. Arsenal are the best, losing possession just 57 times and, given what is coming up later on in this exercise, that is something for their fans to cling on to.We have penalised Watford 10 points, Stoke eight, Leicester six, Brighton four and West Ham two for their incompetence.Rightly or wrongly, it has been a law of the game since 1 July 2004 that it is an offence for a player to remove their shirt during a game – so it is a high level of ineptitude to earn yourself a booking for something so entirely unnecessary. Hats off to Stoke City, and particularly Ramadan Sobhi who picked up bookings in consecutive matches for taking his shirt off and then over celebrating, whose players have earned three bookings this season for whipping off their tops. West Ham have managed the feat twice, so we will punish Stoke 10 points for crass stupidity, West Ham five, and let any team who have done it once off the hook because, idiotic though it is to transgress, it is a silly law. There is often five, possibly six minutes, of added time? Frequently it’s less than that. And yet 11 Premier League teams have conceded goals on or past the 90-minute mark to lose a game. Watford have done it four times! Had all 11 players simply lined up across the goal for added time, they could be battling for Europe. Burnley and Swansea were the next worst, doing it twice, with eight clubs doing it once. We will hand out five penalty points for each time a team have blown it in added time.Nine teams have been two goals up at some stage in the match, only to lose or draw. Take a bow Liverpool, Southampton and West Bromwich Albion, who have all managed it twice. Those three get a 10-point penalty, everyone else (Burnley, Crystal Palace, Manchester City, Newcastle, Watford and West Ham – who each did it once) get five.Mistakes happen at the back – it’s a high-pressure environment – but a goalkeeper’s job-title makes it pretty clear what he should be doing, so we are going to punish goalkeeper errors that lead to an opposition goal. We’ll allow some leeway – any club whose keeper(s) made no more than two errors get a free pass – but sides whose keeper(s) made more than that get a draconian five penalty points for each mistake that led to a goal. It would perhaps seem likely Joe Hart would clean up here, however it is Arsenal’s Petr Cech who tops the list with six howlers (30 penalty points). Asmir Begovic and Hugo Lloris are joint second on five (25 points) and Hart earns West Ham 20 points for four catastrophic errors. A combination of Heurelho Gomes and Orestis Karnezis earn Watford 15 points and Jonas Lössl gets Huddersfield on the board with another 15.There are few greater hallmarks of ineptitude than actually scoring for the opposition – and so we will award five points for each own goal scored, but give a free pass to those that only did it once because, well, accidents happen. Brighton are the worst offenders (five) with Newcastle (three) in second. Only Southampton, Everton, Liverpool, West Ham and Arsenal have not conceded any. Incidentally, the worst solo performer? Brighton’s Lewis Dunk, who has singlehandedly scored four.By the same measure, conceding a penalty is textbook incompetence. It’s not as bad as scoring for the opposition, however, so we will award three points to any team who has done it more than once. West Ham, Watford, Huddersfield and Liverpool have conceded six penalties, so are given 18 points each, but West Brom and Manchester United have only done it once so get away scot-free.Granit Xhaka and Shkodran Mustafi have combined beautifully for Arsenal to be joint top of the outfield errors that lead to goals chart. Alongside Southampton (top work Wesley Hoedt and Cédric Soares!), they have committed nine howlers that have led to the opposition scoring. We’ll award two points per mistake, per team (more lenient than the same offence for goalkeepers because it’s almost the goalkeeper’s sole job not to do it, whereas outfield players have other responsibilities). Incidentally, Burnley, Leicester and West Brom are the most mistake-free, which gives an idea of their organisation but perhaps also their ambition.So far, we have largely dealt with defensive incompetence, so it’s worth throwing it up the other end. The very simplest marker for crass inability is failing to put the ball into a 17.8 square metre target from 12 yards, with only one person to beat. Five points are awarded per penalty miss to each team. Everton are the worst offenders (Wayne Rooney has missed three) with Brighton (Glenn Murray, twice), Manchester City (Jesus, twice) and various others on two or one.At its heart, there is only one key aim in football: to put the ball in the net. A failure to do so ranks as top bodging. We will issue a one-point fine for each time a team failed to score in a match. So it’s bad news for Huddersfield (18 times), Brighton and Swansea (15), and Crystal Palace (14), but good news for Manchester City (once), Tottenham (three times) and Liverpool (five).A catch-all category for simulation, dissent and red cards. There is a two-point penalty for simulation, and Bournemouth and Manchester United top that list with three yellow cards for the offence (the single worst offenders, however, are Tottenham’s Dele Alli and Swansea’s Martin Olsson, who have both been booked for ing twice).We will award one penalty point for each yellow card given to a club’s player for dissent, with Manchester City leading on 12 (Arsenal and Southampton are not far behind on 11). Incidentally, Brighton, Everton and Huddersfield are the most polite teams, only picking up four bookings each for dissent.Getting yourself sent off hands the opposition a distinct advantage, so ranks high in the ineptitude stakes – it also gives us a chance to stick it to two clubs who might have thought they were bobbing along pretty competently thus far. There is a strict five-point penalty per red card which is bad news for Chelsea, Leicester and Watford (four each, so a 20-point fine), but good news for Palace and Burnley, who have had none.And finally, a category to mop up some indefinables not covered by Opta stats. Any club to have hired and fired a manager in the same season get a 10-point fine (Alan Pardew at West Brom) but only a five-point fine for hiring someone in pre-season then giving him the chop before the season is out (Watford, Southampton and Crystal Palace).Opta does not carry stats on foul throws, however we are going to give Tottenham a five-point penalty for Serge Aurier’s spectacular hat-trick at Crystal Palace in February.Pep Guardiola escapes an incompetence penalty, because though he was fined for a breach of clothing rules (yellow ribbon-gate), it did not lead to a touchline ban so cannot be said to have harmed his side. Yet, West Ham do get a clothing-related five-point penalty for spelling Marco Arnautovic’s name wrong on his shirt against Bournemouth on Boxing Day.So three cheers to Watford! Championes, championes etc. A spectacular effort. They set out their stall for ineptitude early and saw it home across the season. What’s curious is they are well clear of the relegation battle since, in the past three seasons, the team who topped the ineptitude index went down to the Championship. It takes an impressive kind of incompetence to be that bad and still not go down. Well played.That Stoke are up there is perhaps no real surprise given their season, but oh, Arsenal! Poor Arsène Wenger, that’s no way to see out his career at the Emirates, is it?One thing the ineptitude index has tended to get relatively correct, is the team at the bottom of the table – in this case, Manchester United – have tended to play some efficient, purposeful football without ever setting the pulses racing. That Burnley are up there ties into that, though Liverpool and Manchester City’s presence suggests it is possible to combine efficiency with flair.But is the real story West Brom? How come a team who, by this measure, appear to have had a decent season are about to go down? For that new level of ineptitude, let’s just give thanks to Tony Pulis and Alan Pardew. Top work, chaps.

For someone who has had agents circling since he was 10, and long been hailed as the next superstar to come out of Brazil, he seems remarkably grounded. There is no arrogance, no sense of entitlement and no hint he has let attention and fame go to his head.Rather the contrary. He is polite, mature and engaging company in his first international interview since agreeing that remarkable transfer at a time when he had not yet made his first appearance for Flamengo.“I know I am still no one and I have done nothing so far,” he says. And to a certain extent he is right. Compared with the players he wants to emulate – Neymar and Cristiano Ronaldo in particular – he has achieved nothing. But compared with other teenagers he has not done too badly, making his debut for Flamengo at 16 and being voted the player of the tournament at the Under-17 South American Championship, during which he scored seven goals to lead Brazil to the title.Vinícius Júnior is modest but that does not stop him from aiming high. “I want to become one of the best players in football and win a World Cup. I want to reach my goals and make my family proud,” he says.According to Fifa rules he is allowed to join Real when he turns 18 on 12 July and, although he could be loaned back to Flamengo for the 2018-19 season, he is already looking forward to joining up with Ronaldo, Casemiro and Marcelo for pre-season training. But his desire is to work with another Brazilian too.“If God wants, Neymar and I will play together at Real Madrid. I would definitely be in favour of him moving to Madrid because it would be my big dream to play in the same side as Neymar. He is my idol in football. If had a chance to play with him, I would feel very happy.”Ronaldo is another inspiration. “Every day, I say thank you for being blessed with the gift of playing football. The dream of any player is to have the gift but very few have. I have been given this gift and my desire to improve is even stronger. In this respect, Cristiano Ronaldo is my inspiration. I admire what he has been doing for the last 10 years, playing at such a high level. It is not just talent and quality but hard work too. I hope to be able to tell him that one day.”There is excitement at the thought of moving to Europe but there is a little apprehension, too. The terror attacks are well covered in Brazil and Vinícius Júnior is worried. “I am concerned about terrorism because I don’t know what to do, where to run. This isn’t a problem where I can predict. It’s very hard.”But it is not as if Brazil is without problems. Vinícius Júnior was born in São Gonçalo, a suburb of Rio de Janeiro. Violence and crime are something people have to face every day. For many, it is a scary situation and there is even an app called OTT (Onde Tem Tiroteio or Where There Are Shootouts) where you track in real time if have there are any shootings in the city.Vinícius Júnior is no different to other people from Rio. He fears the violence too and after signing for Real his first decision was to move all his relatives out of São Gonçalo to the western side of Rio, where he has lived since 2013.“This is one of the best decisions I’ve made in my life. I lived for 13 years in São Gonçalo. I know how hard it is to live there. I saw a lot of shootings because I lived close to a favela. I feared for my brother and what could happen to him. The dream of many people like me, who live in a poor city, is moving to a better place with better conditions.”Start of a sensationBorn in São Gonçalo, a suburb of Rio de Janeiro, in July 2000 and joins Flamengo’s youth setup at the age of fiveGoals and gloryFinishes as top-scorer with seven goals and is named best player as Brazil win the Under-17 South American Championship in Chile in early 2017The Real dealA few months later, Real Madrid announce they have signed the 16-year-old for £39m and that he will join the club when he turns 18\u0026nbspBig stage performerMakes his first-team debut for Flamengo soon after agreeing Real move and goes on to shine in the Rio derby against Fluminense. Has continued to impressVinícius Júnior is a teenager – and he acts like one. All the time he uses social media and interacts with friends. He is not the first youngster who has made a big move to Real and will not be the last.Kyllian Mbappé and Martin Odegaard are two other teenagers but whereas the Frenchman has done well at Paris Saint-Germain, the Norwegian has struggled to cope with the pressure and is on loan at Heerenveen where he is not even a regular starter.The expectation and the criticism is already a reality and so, sadly, is another problem: racism. Since his debut for Flamengo, he has been the target of racist abuse twice, both times when he was playing against Botafogo. “We are a country who has all colours, all kinds of people. It’s so sad. The main problem isn’t me but I feel more worried about my family. Football arguably has a bigger problem with racism than society as a whole because there is so much envy in football and my family suffers a lot. I don’t suffer racist abuse on a daily basis because people know me, they know I am a footballer but my family suffers a lot. I think Fifa could react stronger when there is a problem. There are a lot of children watching football and they just want to see a good game, not racism in any form. It is a bad thing which affects the game as well as our society.”Away from the problems, there is an unbelievable excitement at what lies ahead. There is not only Real on the horizon but also, potentially, a World Cup. On 14 May, Tite will announce the 23 players who will represent Brazil in Russia.Brazil have a history of selecting young players for the biggest tournament of them all. In 1958, Pelé starred as a 17-year-old and in 1994 a young kid named Ronaldo was included in the squad. Eight years later Kaká was called up after only two seasons as a professional."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f8ea268fb4c584588a1c21eaa73ac9cc8ab3874/0_0_7145_4768/master/7145.jpg?w=480\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=582197466ce17d1bce8009438583324f 480w","title":"cocktail of the week rhubasberry sour","story":"A smooth springtime sip with terrific tartnessHere in Yorkshire, we’re obsessed with rhubarb – which is hardly surprising, since the finest incarnation of this iconic ingredient is grown locally in the Rhubarb Triangle.

The walls were slimy and cold, and the water smelled like a toilet. I thought I was going to dieEarlier this month, I was having a family picnic on Easter Sunday in Griffith Park, Los Angeles, with my auntie and cousins. While the little kids did an Easter egg hunt (I’m 13), me and my three cousins went off to play soccer. After kicking the ball around for a bit, we found an abandoned building on the edge of the park, so we climbed over the fence and started playing tag. I wasn’t looking where I was going when I felt a piece of wood underneath me break, and I fell 25ft into a pipe.I landed into water and it was running pretty fast. It felt like being on a waterslide, but the water smelled nasty, like a toilet. It was dark, so I grabbed my phone from my pocket to use as a flashlight, but the water knocked it out of my hand and I lost it. In those first few moments I panicked – I thought I was going to die.After a few minutes of sliding, I found I could put my hands against the wall of the pipe and stand up. The walls were slimy and cold, the water was up to my knees and the pipe was about 4ft wide. I shouted for help but I could just hear my own voice echoing back to me and the sound of rushing water. I started crying a little because I was so scared. I was in the dark, alone, thinking, “Where am I?” and, “Will I ever get to see my family again?” I kept seeing the face of my little sister, who is 18 months old, and my Mom, who’s pregnant. I wondered if I’d ever get to meet my baby brother.I thought about trying to carry on walking through the pipe to find a way out, but it looked scary so I decided it was better to stay put and hope that someone would find me. I was praying to God, “Please, please get me out of here safe.” We pray a lot at home, but that day I was really praying.Not too long after that, I heard helicopters and I knew people were looking for me. I started relaxing and thinking I was OK, I was going to be rescued. But when nobody came after what felt like hours, I went back to thinking I was going to die. I wasn’t really hungry or thirsty or tired, I just knew I had to wait. Over 12 hours after I’d first fallen in – around 5am – I saw a light above me and I heard someone shout, “Here’s the kid!” I started calling for help, and a rope got lowered down with a platform at the bottom of it, so I just held on and they pulled me out through a manhole. I felt disoriented when I came to the surface. I was by a freeway with all these flashing lights. They gave me a phone and I called my mom. I said, “Mom, I’m good. Where you at? You need to come pick me up.” She was crying and saying, “Oh my God, where are you?” over and over again.The firefighters took my T-shirt off, hosed me down and wrapped me in a plastic sheet. Someone gave me a Gatorade, but I only drank a little bit because I don’t really like it and I didn’t feel thirsty. At the hospital I took a hot shower and they gave me a change of clothes and put me on an IV drip. After a couple of hours the doctor told me I was fine – I just had grazes on my knees and knuckles from the fall – and my mom and stepdad took me home. All my family were waiting for me, and I hugged them and went to sleep for a few hours. When I woke up, there were news reporters outside waiting to interview me, which was weird.I found out that when I fell into the pipe my cousins ran back to my family and the adults phoned 911, but it took a long time to find me because I’d travelled about a mile from where I fell. They’d sent cameras down to look for me. They only found me because a camera picked up my handprints in a pipe. Over 100 people were involved in the search, so I felt bad I’d caused all that drama, but happy that they hadn’t given up on me. I heard there were toxic gases down there, so I was lucky.Three days later, I went back to school – I just wanted to get back to normal. Everyone in my class was asking if I was OK.Sometimes in my mind I go back to the moment when I fell and think about what would have happened if they had never found me. Thank God I got another chance.• As told to Kate Wills.Do you have an experience to share?

Or the wasted time anxiously wondering if the invitation to play Trivia Crack from an ex is actually a message.Hours are lost poring over the ins and outs of lives you barely recall meeting. That’s the thing about having an account for over a decade, as I have: people who’d usually be relegated to the crevices of memory are kept in full view, as you are to them. Supposedly, that’s keeping in touch, but in reality it’s keeping score.And then, of course, there’s the family. You can’t deny your mum’s friend request, or her right to share your holiday photos to her profile, while mistagging all your relatives – so instead of flagging your pic to Uncle Abbas, she’s let everyone in the ABBA fan page know you ate a pizza in Italy.(Side story: a few years ago, a friend told her mum that “FML” – internet slang for “F*** my life”, a sign of exasperation – stood for “From Mum with Love”. That really livened up her Facebook statuses. “Nan came over for dinner, FML.”)Ergh… that little red notification box, the little red box of horror. It has controlled me for too long, especially with its most vicious feature: event invitations. “You have been invited,” reads Facebook, in its distinctly chipper Californian voice, “to the engagement party of your ex. Good job!” Or it’s an acquaintance’s uninspiring birthday bash involving a long journey, when the sofa is calling. My finger hovers over the “not attending” button when, lo and behold, I see it, the invite list, full of familiar faces.“Perhaps this will be the party to end all parties,” I\u0026nbspthink. “I can’t miss out… Maybe this party will fortify the friendship of my friends between each other, and I will be left in the cold. I can’t miss out.”But no more. If being an adult is about not giving a damn about what people think, then sign me up. No more attending events on the off-chance they might be OK. No more fretting about missing things. No more RSVPing “maybe” when you really mean no, lest you stop getting invited to things you don’t actually want to go to.It’s time to end the cycle.

Adjoining it was a bakery where, every afternoon, chef Angus would make puff pastry for the following day’s croissants, some filled with gruyere cheese, others homemade almond paste or Valhrona chocolate. Sadly, I have neither Angus’s giant roller nor his patience, but there are enough really good ready-made all-butter pastries in shops that it need not stop you making a deliciously flaky, homemade tart.For a really fast tart, omit the cream, eggs and blind-baking – just strew it with the onions, cheese, thyme and some olive oil. You will need a 28cm springform tart tin.About 320g all-butter puff pastry, in a sheet or block – enough to to cover a 28cm tart caseFlour, for dusting30g butter, plus more for greasing5 medium red onions, or a mix of red and white (about 600g)2 tbsp olive oil3 eggs, whisked1 tbsp good-quality balsamic vinegar½ tsp caster sugar1 small bunch fresh thyme leaves, roughly chopped200g mild blue cheese, such as Oxford Blue or Stichelton160g double cream160g creme fraicheSalt and black pepperHeat the oven to 200C390Fgas 6.Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface until it is wide enough to cover the tart tin comfortably, with at least a 1cm overhang (or use a ready-rolled sheet). Grease the tart tin and then line with the pastry, pricking it all over with a fork. Chill in the fridge for at least 15 minutes.Meanwhile, prepare the onions. Do not cut off the root: just peel them like an orange and cut away any straggling strands from the base. Cut each onion into five to six even wedges. Heat the oil and butter in a wide, deep frying pan on a medium-high heat and, when hot, add the onionwedge wedges, season well, and saute for 12-15 minutes.Now remove the pastry from the fridge, line with greaseproof paper and fill to the brim with baking beans. Bake the tart shell for 20 minutes, then remove the beans and paper and lightly brush the pastry shell all over with a little beaten egg. Put the tin back in the oven and bake for eight to 10 minutes, until golden.The onions should now be caramelised beautifully. Drizzle with balsamic, sugar, half the thyme and two tablespoons of water, and cook for a further eight to 10 minutes, until the onions are soft and dark. Taste and adjust the seasoning, if necessary.Beat the creams together, add the remaining eggs, whisk with the rest of the thyme and season well with salt and pepper. Arrange the onion wedges on the base of the tart shell, crumble over nuggets of the blue cheese, pour over the cream mix and bake for 25-30 minutes.When cooked, remove from the oven and leave to cool for five to 10 minutes. Serve still warm with a crisp chicory and toasted walnut salad, or a simple green salad.This tart is very good eaten at room temperature and lasts several days. Whizz any leftover blue cheese with sherry vinegar and extra-virgin olive oil – a wonderful dressing for the last of the year’s bitter leaves. Finally, make a simple sweet tart with any leftover pastry – delicious filled with chocolate ganache or rhubarb and a great excuse to eat up the leftover creme fraiche."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f21acd0ebc0c887a105cd1beda3715ac2f56d43d/465_215_2163_1298/master/2163.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b458f3ed061a2b6c6e024e1eb9cc25a","title":"cardi b sued for 10m by former manager and co writer","story":"The chart-topping rapper is accused of breach of contract and defamationUS rapper Cardi B is being sued for $10m (£7.25m) by her former manager, Klenord “Shaft” Raphael, who has accused her of breach of contract and defamation.In a claim filed on 26 April and seen by Variety, the dispute centres on Cardi’s departure from Raphael’s company, World Star Marketing Group, and her new deal with Solid Foundation. The latter is the management arm of Quality Control, the label to whom the rapper’s fiance, Offset, is signed with his group Migos. A statement from a representative for Raphael claims: “Since discovering Cardi B in 2015, Shaft has played an integral role in developing her music career and public image … Shaft is disappointed by her actions to freeze him out of her career, which are detailed in the complaint.” Raphael is credited as a producer and songwriter for Cardi B’s biggest hit, Bodak Yellow, which reached No 1 in the US. He also appears on the songwriting credits of many other songs by her, plus tracks by rap and R\u0026ampB stars G-Eazy and Tinashe.He claims Offset “is responsible for steering Cardi B to Quality Control”, and that the rapper sent him threatening text messages. He also accuses Cardi B of defamation after she allegedly told Offset and others: “Shaft is robbing me.”Cardi B has yet to comment on the claims.  has contacted her representatives for comment, but has not yet received a response.Raised in the Bronx, Cardi B was a stripper and was affiliated with a gang. Her music career took off after she was featured in the reality show Love \u0026amp Hip-Hop, and she gained a huge fanbase for her charismatic Instagram videos. After the success of Bodak Yellow, she has scored other big solo hits such as Bartier Cardi, guested on tracks by Migos and Bruno Mars, and released her widely acclaimed debut album which reached No 1 in the US earlier this month.She is pregnant with her first child, and unveiled the pregnancy when she became the first person to co-host The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. She has since cancelled some forthcoming concerts, but performed at the Billboard Latin music awards this week, and said she will return in September to tour with Bruno Mars. “I might be off from doing performances for a couple of months but in the meantime ima be working my ass off,” she wrote on Twitter. “So many songs, features to do.

In among the glowing testimonies to his talent and humility from colleagues, old schoolfriends and – an unexpected move, this – a man who doesn’t seem to know who Post Malone is, there is much talk of his resilience to criticism, his bird-flipping attitude to those who “talk shit” about him.You can see why a thick skin might be an essential character trait for Austin Richard Post. The reviews of his debut, 2016’s Stoney, weren’t so much vicious as dismissive: it was held to be the work of a one-hit wonder who never should have been allowed to make an album in the first place. It went on to sell 2m copies in the US alone, and spawn a succession of hit singles. He has weathered accusations of cultural appropriation and the opprobrium of other rappers, who possibly remember the last time a long-haired white guy with a liking for both rap and down-home American rock got big – Kid Rock – and how well that turned out for everybody. The press, meanwhile, can’t seem to work out whether they think that, with his belief in chemtrails, obsession with firearms and I’ve-suffered-racism-too response to Black Lives Matter, he’s just an idiot – a conclusion you might jump to, based on the haircut he sported last year, a mid-forehead fringe that left him looking like Jim Carrey in Dumb and Dumber – or something more cynical and calculating. Suspicious eyebrows were raised regarding the veracity of the recent viral story about him giving a postal worker a copy of his forthcoming album in lieu of a tip. His 2017 hit Rockstar was helped to the US No 1 spot by a YouTube video that featured not the song, but just its chorus repeated five times, which, depending on your perspective, is either cheating your way into the charts, a brilliant marketing ploy aimed at the Musical.ly generation who consume not songs but sections of songs, or the kind of incisive editing by which a lot of chart singles could be vastly improved.Throughout it all, Post Malone has got bigger and bigger: he’s as impregnable as barbed wire, which, in another curious fashion decision, he has tattooed across his forehead. Which brings us to his second album, pretty much a guaranteed smash. If you cleave to the just-an-idiot theory regarding Post Malone you might note that, well, it’s called Beerbongs \u0026amp Bentleys, that its lyrical rendering of the current vogue for moaning about the emptiness and misery of wealth and success tends to the thumpingly prosaic – it contains a song called Rich and Sad – and that he writes about sex in such a dummkopf way, it makes you feel like taking up a lifelong vow of chastity: “I ain’t even seen the face but she got beautiful boobies – wow!”If you think he’s more calculating, you could point to its bet-spreading sound, which melds a host of current big pop memes, from warm, post-tropical house synthesisers to icily Auto-Tuned R\u0026ampB, from earnest acoustic balladry to mumble-rap. “Barf on me,” he pleads repeatedly at one point, which feels a bit alarming until you realise he’s actually saying “ball for me”. There are references to classic rock – Same Bitches swipes a lyric from the Zombies’ Time of the Season, Over Now concludes with a thrilling, distorted explosion of John Bonham-esque drumming – and a great deal of that weird latter-day lyrical trope whereby you spend half your time boasting about how many drugs you take and how much you drink in party-hearty style, and the other half trying to elicit sympathy from the listener because of how many drugs you take and how much you drink.It would be churlish indeed to deny that a lot of the songs on Beerbongs \u0026amp Bentleys are exceptionally well-turned, stuffed with hooks and powerful choruses: Rockstar’s global success had less to do with shenanigans involving YouTube than the fact that it’s a maddeningly catchy song, and there’s plenty more where that came from. Furthermore, while no great shakes as a rapper, Post Malone’s singing voice is impressive and the production is regularly tricked out with beautiful touches: the lovely Mellotron intro to Rich and Sad the eerie, feedback-and-echo-heavy guitar that runs through Takin’ Shots. However, over a protracted period of time – and Beerbongs \u0026amp Bentleys goes on and on like a charity telethon – there’s a paucity of original ideas, the sense that he has virtually nothing to say for himself, and that whatever he has, has already been said umpteen times before with considerably more skill, wit and impact. Meanwhile, the guest appearances are a mixed blessing. An impressive array of supporting talent has been assembled, seemingly with the express intention of showing Post Malone up: the gulf between what he does and the sparky power of Nicki Minaj’s guest verse on Ball for Me – “could have been a seamstress, still wouldn’t cut him slack” – feels immense.Of course, Beerbongs \u0026amp Bentleys’ defects might be less evident in smaller doses, if you consider it less as an album than a collection of songs made for picking and choosing, for filleting on to playlists, then the aforementioned hooks, choruses and production touches might well outweigh the repetitiousness and predictability. Listening to it, you understand both the charges against him and the reasons for Post Malone’s success, and you wonder how long his apparent impenetrability will last. Whether he can move with the times when the trends collated here change remains to be seen."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea43f68a06453521259587c83b8786a8cf764ee6/0_1405_5265_3158/master/5265.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=236d03a356f532f65e14adb3fb1aea7a","title":"bulldoze the business school","story":"Visit the average university campus and it is likely that the newest and most ostentatious building will be occupied by the business school. The business school has the best building because it makes the biggest profits (or, euphemistically, “contribution” or “surplus”) – as you might expect, from a form of knowledge that teaches people how to make profits.Business schools have huge influence, yet they are also widely regarded to be intellectually fraudulent places, fostering a culture of short-termism and greed. (There is a whole genre of jokes about what MBA – Master of Business Administration – really stands for: “Mediocre But Arrogant”, “Management by Accident”, “More Bad Advice”, “Master Bullshit Artist” and so on.) Critics of business schools come in many shapes and sizes: employers complain that graduates lack practical skills, conservative voices scorn the arriviste MBA, Europeans moan about Americanisation, radicals wail about the concentration of power in the hands of the running dogs of capital. Since 2008, many commentators have also suggested that business schools were complicit in producing the crash.Having taught in business schools for 20 years, I have come to believe that the best solution to these problems is to shut down business schools altogether. This is not a typical view among my colleagues. Even so, it is remarkable just how much criticism of business schools over the past decade has come from inside the schools themselves. Many business school professors, particularly in north America, have argued that their institutions have gone horribly astray. B-schools have been corrupted, they say, by deans following the money, teachers giving the punters what they want, researchers pumping out paint-by-numbers papers for journals that no one reads and students expecting a qualification in return for their cash (or, more likely, their parents’ cash). At the end of it all, most business-school graduates won’t become high-level managers anyway, just precarious cubicle drones in anonymous office blocks.These are not complaints from professors of sociology, state policymakers or even outraged anti-capitalist activists. These are views in books written by insiders, by employees of business schools who themselves feel some sense of disquiet or even disgust at what they are getting up to. Of course, these dissenting views are still those of a minority. Most work within business schools is blithely unconcerned with any expression of doubt, participants being too busy oiling the wheels to worry about where the engine is going. Still, this internal criticism is loud and significant.The problem is that these insiders’ dissent has become so thoroughly institutionalised within the well-carpeted corridors that it now passes unremarked, just an everyday counterpoint to business as usual. Careers are made by wailing loudly in books and papers about the problems with business schools. The business school has been described by two insiders as “a cancerous machine spewing out sick and irrelevant detritus”. Even titles such as Against Management, Fucking Management and The Greedy Bastard’s Guide to Business appear not to cause any particular difficulties for their authors. I know this, because I wrote the first two. Frankly, the idea that I was permitted to get away with this speaks volumes about the extent to which this sort of criticism means anything very much at all. In fact, it is rewarded, because the fact that I publish is more important than what I publish.Most solutions to the problem of the B-school shy away from radical restructuring, and instead tend to suggest a return to supposedly more traditional business practices, or a form of moral rearmament decorated with terms such as “responsibility” and “ethics”. All of these suggestions leave the basic problem untouched, that the business school only teaches one form of organising – market managerialism.That’s why I think that we should call in the bulldozers and demand an entirely new way of thinking about management, business and markets. If we want those in power to become more responsible, then we must stop teaching students that heroic transformational leaders are the answer to every problem, or that the purpose of learning about taxation laws is to evade taxation, or that creating new desires is the purpose of marketing. In every case, the business school acts as an apologist, selling ideology as if it were science.Universities have been around for a millenium, but the vast majority of business schools only came into existence in the last century. Despite loud and continual claims that they were a US invention, the first was probably the École Supérieure de Commerce de Paris, founded in 1819 as a privately funded attempt to produce a grande école for business. A century later, hundreds of business schools had popped up across Europe and the US, and from the 1950s onwards, they began to grow rapidly in other parts of the world.In 2011, the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business estimated that there were then nearly 13,000 business schools in the world. India alone is estimated to have 3,000 private schools of business. Pause for a moment, and consider that figure. Think about the huge numbers of people employed by those institutions, about the armies of graduates marching out with business degrees, about the gigantic sums of money circulating in the name of business education. (In 2013, the top 20 US MBA programmes already charged at least $100,000 (£72,000). At the time of writing, London Business School is advertising a tuition fee of £84,500 for its MBA.) No wonder that the bandwagon keeps rolling.For the most part, business schools all assume a similar form. The architecture is generic modern – glass, panel, brick. Outside, there’s some expensive signage offering an inoffensive logo, probably in blue, probably with a square on it. The door opens, automatically. Inside, there’s a female receptionist dressed office-smart. Some abstract art hangs on the walls, and perhaps a banner or two with some hopeful assertions: “We mean business.” “Teaching and Research for Impact.” A big screen will hang somewhere over the lobby, running a Bloomberg news ticker and advertising visiting speakers and talks about preparing your CV. Shiny marketing leaflets sit in dispensing racks, with images of a erse tableau of open-faced students on the cover. On the leaflets, you can find an alphabet of mastery: MBA, MSc Management, MSc Accounting, MSc Management and Accounting, MSc Marketing, MSc International Business, MSc Operations Management.There will be plush lecture theatres with thick carpet, perhaps named after companies or personal donors. The lectern bears the logo of the business school. In fact, pretty much everything bears the weight of the logo, like someone who worries their possessions might get stolen and so marks them with their name. Unlike some of the shabby buildings in other parts of the university, the business school tries hard to project efficiency and confidence. The business school knows what it is doing and has its well-scrubbed face aimed firmly at the busy future. It cares about what people think of it.Even if the reality isn’t always as shiny – if the roof leaks a little and the toilet is blocked – that is what the business-school dean would like to think that their school was like, or what they would want their school to be. A clean machine for turning income from students into profits.What do business schools actually teach? This is a more complicated question than it first appears. Much writing on education has explored the ways in which a “hidden curriculum” supplies lessons to students without doing so explicitly. From the 1970s onwards, researchers explored how social class, gender, ethnicity, sexuality and so on were being implicitly taught in the classroom. This might involve segregating students into separate classes – the girls doing domestic science and the boys doing metalwork, say – which, in turn, implies what is natural or appropriate for different groups of people. The hidden curriculum can be taught in other ways too, by the ways in which teaching and assessment are practised, or through what is or isn’t included in the curriculum. The hidden curriculum tells us what matters and who matters, which places are most important and what topics can be ignored.In many countries, a lot of work has been done on trying to deal with these issues. Materials on black history, women in science or pop songs as poetry are now fairly routine. That doesn’t mean that the hidden curriculum is no longer a problem, but at least in many of the more enlightened educational systems, it is not now routinely assumed that there is one history, one set of actors, one way of telling the story.But in the business school, both the explicit and hidden curriculums sing the same song. The things taught and the way that they are taught generally mean\u0026nbspthat the virtues of capitalist market managerialism are told and sold as if there were no other ways of seeing\u0026nbspthe world.If we educate our graduates in the inevitability of tooth-and-claw capitalism, it is hardly surprising that we end up with justifications for massive salary payments to people who take huge risks with other people’s money. If we teach that there is nothing else below the bottom line, then ideas about sustainability, ersity, responsibility and so on become mere decoration. The message that management research and teaching often provides is that capitalism is inevitable, and that the financial and legal techniques for running capitalism are a form of science. This combination of ideology and technocracy is what has made the business school into such an effective, and dangerous, institution.We can see how this works if we look a bit more closely at the business-school curriculum and how it is taught. Take finance, for instance. This is a field concerned with understanding how people with money invest it. It assumes that there are people with money or capital that can be used as security for money, and hence it also assumes substantial inequalities of income and wealth. The greater the inequalities within any given society, the greater the interest in finance, as well as the market in luxury yachts. Finance academics almost always assume that earning rent on capital (however it was acquired) is a legitimate and perhaps even praiseworthy activity, with skilful investors being lionised for their technical skills and success. The purpose of this form of knowledge is to maximise the rent from wealth, often by developing mathematical or legal mechanisms that can multiply it. Successful financial strategies are those that produce the maximum return in the shortest period, and hence that further exacerbate the social inequalities that made them possible in the first place.Or consider human resource management. This field applies theories of rational egoism – roughly the idea that people act according to rational calculations about what will maximise their own interest – to the management of human beings in organisations. The name of the field is telling, since it implies that human beings are akin to technological or financial resources insofar as they are an element to be used by management in order to produce a successful organisation. Despite its use of the word, human resource management is not particularly interested in what it is like to be a human being. Its object of interest are categories – women, ethnic minorities, the underperforming employee – and their relationship to the functioning of the organisation. It is also the part of the business school most likely to be dealing with the problem of organised resistance to management strategies, usually in the form of trade unions. And in case it needs saying, human resource management is not on the side of the trade union. That would be partisan. It is a function which, in its most ambitious manifestation, seeks to become “strategic”, to assist senior management in the formulation of their plans to open a factory here, or close a branch office there.A similar kind of lens could be applied to other modules found in most business schools – accounting, marketing, international business, innovation, logistics – but I’ll conclude with business ethics and corporate social responsibility – pretty much the only areas within the business school that have developed a sustained critique of the consequences of management education and practice. These are domains that pride themselves on being gadflies to the business school, insisting that its dominant forms of education, teaching and research require reform. The complaints that propel writing and teaching in these areas are predictable but important – sustainability, inequality, the production of graduates who are taught that greed is good.The problem is that business ethics and corporate social responsibility are subjects used as window dressing in the marketing of the business school, and as a fig leaf to cover the conscience of B-school deans – as if talking about ethics and responsibility were the same as doing something about it. They almost never systematically address the simple idea that since current social and economic relations produce the problems that ethics and corporate social responsibility courses treat as subjects to be studied, it is those social and economic relations that need to be changed.You might well think that each of these areas of research and teaching are innocuous enough in themselves, and collectively they just appear to cover all the different dimensions of business activity – money, people, technology, transport, selling and so on. But it is worth spelling out the shared assumptions of every subject studied at business school.The first thing that all these areas share is a powerful sense that market managerial forms of social order are desirable. The acceleration of global trade, the use of market mechanisms and managerial techniques, the extension of technologies such as accounting, finance and operations are not routinely questioned. This is a progressive account of the modern world, one that relies on the promise of technology, choice, plenty and wealth. Within the business school, capitalism is assumed to be the end of history, an economic model that has trumped all the others, and is now taught as science, rather than ideology.The second is the assumption that human behaviour – of employees, customers, managers and so on – is best understood as if we are all rational egoists. This provides a set of background assumptions that allow for the development of models of how human beings might be managed in the interests of the business organisation. Motivating employees, correcting market failures, designing lean management systems or persuading consumers to spend money are all instances of the same sort of problem. The foregrounded interest here is that of the person who wants control, and the people who are the objects of that interest can then be treated as people who can be manipulated.The final similarity I want to point to concerns the nature of the knowledge being produced and disseminated by the business school itself. Because it borrows the gown and mortarboard of the university, and cloaks its knowledge in the apparatus of science – journals, professors, big words – it is relatively easy to imagine that the knowledge the business school sells and the way that it sells it somehow less vulgar and stupid than it really is.The easiest summary of all of the above, and one that would inform most people’s understandings of what goes on in the B-school, is that they are places that teach people how to get money out of the pockets of ordinary people and keep it for themselves. In some senses, that’s a description of capitalism, but there is also a sense here that business schools actually teach that “greed is good”. As Joel M Podolny, the former dean of Yale School of Management, once opined: “The way business schools today compete leads students to ask, ‘What can I do to make the most money?’ and the manner in which faculty members teach allows students to regard the moral consequences of their actions as mere afterthoughts.”This picture is, to some extent, backed up by research, although some of this is of dubious quality. There are various surveys of business-school students that suggest that they have an instrumental approach to education that is to say, they want what marketing and branding tells them that they want. In terms of the classroom, they expect the teaching of uncomplicated and practical concepts and tools that they deem will be helpful to them in their future careers. Philosophy is for the birds.As someone who has taught in business schools for decades, this sort of finding doesn’t surprise me, though others suggest rather more incendiary findings. One US survey compared MBA students to people who were imprisoned in low-security prisons and found that the latter were more ethical. Another suggested that the likelihood of committing some form of corporate crime increased if the inidual concerned had experience of graduate business education, or military service. (Both careers presumably involve absolving responsibility to an organisation.) Other surveys suggest that students come in believing in employee wellbeing and customer\u0026nbspsatisfaction and leave thinking that shareholder value is the most important issue, and that business-school students are more likely to cheat than students in other subjects.Whether the causes and effects (or indeed the findings) are as neat as surveys like this might suggest is something that I doubt, but it would be equally daft to suggest that the business school has no effect on its graduates. Having an MBA might not make a student greedy, impatient or unethical, but both the B-school’s explicit and hidden curriculums do teach lessons. Not that these lessons are acknowledged when something goes wrong, because then the business school usually denies all responsibility. That’s a tricky position, though, because, as a 2009 Economist editorial put it, “You cannot claim that your mission is to ‘educate the leaders who make a difference to the world’ and then wash your hands of your alumni when the difference they make is malign”.After the 2007 crash, there was a game of pass-the-blame-parcel going on, so it’s not surprising that most business-school deans were also trying to blame consumers for borrowing too much, the bankers for behaving so riskily, rotten apples for being so bad and the system for being, well, the system. Who, after all, would want to claim that they merely taught greed?The sorts of doors to knowledge we find in universities are based on exclusions. A subject is made up by teaching this and not that, about space (geography) and not time (history), about collectives of people (sociology) and not about iniduals (psychology), and so on. Of course, there are leakages and these are often where the most interesting thinking happens, but this partitioning of the world is constitutive of any university discipline. We cannot study everything, all the time, which is why there are names of departments over the doors to buildings and corridors.However, the B-school is an even more extreme case. It is constituted through separating commercial life from the rest of life, but then undergoes a further specialisation. The business school assumes capitalism, corporations and managers as the default form of organisation, and everything else as history, anomaly, exception, alternative. In terms of curriculum and research, everything else is peripheral.Most business schools exist as parts of universities, and universities are generally understood as institutions with responsibilities to the societies they serve. Why then do we assume that degree courses in business should only teach one form of organisation – capitalism – as if that were the only way in which human life could be arranged?The sort of world that is being produced by the market managerialism that the business school sells is not a pleasant one. It’s a sort of utopia for the wealthy and powerful, a group that the students are encouraged to imagine themselves joining, but such privilege is bought at a very high cost, resulting in environmental catastrophe, resource wars and forced migration, inequality within and between countries, the encouragement of hyper-consumption as well as persistently anti-democratic practices at work.Selling the business school works by ignoring these problems, or by mentioning them as challenges and then ignoring them in the practices of teaching and research. If we want to be able to respond to the challenges that face human life on this planet, then we need to research and teach about as many different forms of organising as we are able to collectively imagine. For us to assume that global capitalism can continue as it is means to assume a path to destruction.\u0026nbspSo if we are going to move away from business as usual, then we also need to radically reimagine the business school as usual. And this means\u0026nbspmore than pious murmurings about corporate social responsibility. It means doing away with what we have, and starting again.Shut Down the Business School: What’s Wrong with Management Education will be published by Pluto Press in May• Follow the long read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98f5ece63df26a50f1699a175bfb8265cc0f2ebd/0_0_5760_3840/master/5760.jpg?w=720\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=bfb27dce1b518fd5b5b98ea7320df06b 1440w","title":"more than 120 homeopaths trying to cure autism in uk","story":"Exclusive: the ‘cure’ involves detoxing children of vaccines and antibiotics held responsible for the conditionMore than 120 homeopaths in the UK are offering a “cure” for autism that involves supposedly detoxing children of the vaccines and antibiotics held responsible for the condition, the  has learned.The homeopaths are accredited practitioners of CEASE “therapy”, which stands for Complete Elimination of Autistic Spectrum Expression. CEASE was invented by a Dutch doctor called Tinus Smits, who died of cancer in 2010. His book and website, which lists therapists around the world, describe a method of ridding children of toxins – predominantly vaccines and medication – that are said to cause autism. It involves homeopathic remedies and high doses of vitamin C in excess of those recommended by national guidelines.Diarrhoea, which could be a result of excessive vitamin C, and fever in children should not necessarily be cause for concern, say CEASE therapists, because it is the child’s body purging itself of toxins.“It’s absolutely appalling,” said Carol Povey, director of the centre for autism at the National Autistic Society (NAS), which helps develop best practice. “As healthcare practitioners, homeopaths should still be working on evidence-based practice and looking at national guidelines.”The NAS is concerned by the suggestion that autism, a developmental disorder, could be cured. It is also disturbed by the claim that autism is linked to vaccines, as proposed by Andrew Wakefield – a theory that has been comprehensively discredited. Wakefield, a former gastroenterologist, was struck off the medical register over his claims.Homeopathic cures, like other bogus therapies on the internet, “hoodwink new parents when they are vulnerable” and can cause harm, said Povey.A minority of CEASE therapists in the UK are members of the Society of Homeopaths. Its regulatory body, the Professional Standards Authority (PSA), has said the Society of Homeopaths must state by the middle of next month what action it will take to ensure children are safe as a condition of its re-accreditation.The PSA told the Society of Homeopaths that “CEASE therapy contravenes medical advice by apparently advising against vaccination of children, avoiding antibiotics in the case of infection and advocates high doses of vitamins not recommended for children. We are also concerned that the full name of CEASE (Complete Elimination of Autistic Spectrum Expression) strongly implies the ability to cure autism through this therapy,” it said in a statement.While the society had responded that its members “should not be practising the aspects of CEASE that defy medical advice”, this was not clear on its website, said the PSA.Mark Taylor, chief executive of the Society of Homeopaths, said it was looking into how many of its members practised CEASE therapy and whether they complied with advice on respecting medical evidence. “We are looking at the advice we will offer over the next few weeks so there is nothing more to say at the moment,” he told the .Many other homeopaths who are also CEASE therapists are not members of the society. The PSA urges the public to choose only those on its accredited register.Jennifer Hautman, a homeopath who is not a Society of Homeopaths member, says she has used CEASE therapy if parents have requested it. Smits’s book, she says, is written for lay people, who then look for a therapist. “I would never promise to cure anything. I do think autism can be treated. It can be improved,” she said. Children often had gut disorders, she said, adding: “I’m not a gut specialist. That’s what Andrew Wakefield was working on. She claimed: “There are a lot of scientists finding similar results to his.”While the causes of autistic spectrum disorder are unclear, she says on her website that “ASD is often linked to vaccine damage” and asks parents to fill in a questionnaire “if you feel you or your children have been damaged by vaccines”.Asked about the CEASE theory that fever and diarrhoea help expel toxins, she said: “Generally speaking in homeopathy, discharge can be a good thing. If you have infected wounds, you want the pus to come out. If you have diarrhoea you want it to come out rather than be constipated.” A child must not be allowed to become dehydrated, however.Smits, the creator of CEASE therapy, wrote in his book that “all kinds of detoxification reactions may occur” as a result of the treatment. Most common is fever, he said, which “should not be treated with medication, as it is a healthy reaction of the organism and not a disease! ... Eliminations like diarrhea, flu, expectoration, and bad-smelling and cloudy urine should also be left alone, because they are a part of the healing process.”One child he treated had diarrhoea that “relieved his system so much that his autism almost disappeared instantly”. After 10 days, however, his mother was so concerned that she took him to the doctor, who gave him immodium to stop the diarrhoea. “Almost immediately the child had a setback and became autistic as before. The diarrhea was a perfect detoxification for his bowels and brain. Neither the doctor not the mother understood this, and the medication interfered with the progress of the cure,” claimed Smits.Ursula Kraus-Harper, a member of the Society of Homeopaths, told the  she has used CEASE therapy since attending a seminar with Smits in 2010 but that she uses it in conjunction with classical homeopathy. Children started improving after a certain set of detoxes, she said. She did not believe homeopathy was a cure, however.She said she was not against vaccination, but said “vaccines can be a problem and so can medical drugs. That is more and more accepted by everybody who is not blinded by drug-driven medicine.” She denied CEASE put children at risk. “Tell me of one child, one person that has died from high doses of vitamin C,” she said. “When the body has had too much of it, it will produce diarrhoea then you lower the dose and the diarrhoea will stop.”The Labour MP Barry Sheerman, who chaired the cross-party Westminster Commission on Autism, condemned the claims of CEASE therapists to cure the disorder. “There is support and much we can do but there are no cures and if someone says so, show me the evidence,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/953ca9cc601c34d2fddcdbc7e723a1cc090cb7a6/0_280_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d92532a7746eb1735a5c1f77a499dd7","title":"scotland minimum alcohol pricing mixed emotions","story":"Effect will be noticeable at the till on 1 May, but some question if policy will help prime targetIt is early afternoon in the east end of Glasgow and Neil Martin is buying his regular half bottle of high-strength tonic wine and large bottle of Strongbow cider. The caffeine-reinforced wine Eldorado boasts the distinctive slogan “Scotland’s own” along with a yellow and red thistle.Martin seems unfazed by the fact that at midnight on Tuesday, the price of a bottle of Strongbow will jump to at least £5. “It won’t make any difference to me,” he says cheerfully. “When you have a drink problem, you’re going to find the money from somewhere. It doesn’t matter how much they put it up.”Next week Scotland will begin a vast live experiment by introducing a legally enforced minimum price for all alcoholic drinks of 50p per unit, to help tackle a particularly Scottish problem with chronic alcohol abuse. Men like Martin are prime targets and this policy may yet be copied across the UK, with Wales next in line.The effects in shops will be noticeable. Supermarkets across Scotland are expected to sideline their own-label vodka, gin and whisky, which will be no longer cheap enough to compete. Overnight, a standard bottle of whisky (700ml) must cost at least £14 from 1 May, compared with £11.25 for Asda’s own brand, while vodka will cost £13.13 or more, compared with £11 for Tesco and Asda own-label bottles.Drinks firms producing so-called white cider, a high-strength product typecast for its abuse by binge-drinking teenagers, are already taking their largest bottles off the shelves. Some will see their prices triple overnight. Multipacks of beer and cider will also double in price.Thousands of retailers have, in recent days, received Scottish government-branded warning signs and leaflets, backed by social media campaigns. But to the disappointment of some alcohol health experts, there are no official advertising campaigns on television or radio. Some retailers fear customers unaware of the imminent price hike will react aggressively when they find out at the till.Further east towards Celtic football stadium in Parkhead, Imran Mohammed sells his bottles and cans behind floor-to-ceiling glass-fronted displays, taking payment through a small grid. One of his bestsellers is the high-strength cider HCC Black, which retails at £1 a can. It will nearly double in price to £1.90.Sanguine about the new policy, Mohammed plans to stop stocking most of his cheaper brands once the price change comes into force. “Nobody will pay double price, so it will affect business badly,” he says. “I’m expecting to lose about £500 a week, adding in the vodka too. But you’ve got to get on with it. Once the law kicks in it should help people’s health. If it’s cheap, they’ll buy anything, whether it’s drugs or fake cigarettes.”Scotland’s pioneering experiment is being closely watched both in the rest of the UK and abroad. Thanks to Nicola Sturgeon’s persistence in defeating repeated attempts led by the Scotch Whisky Association to derail her proposals in the courts, minimum pricing is becoming a widely accepted idea. “Prevention is better than cure, which is why the introduction of minimum pricing is such a positive step forward,” Sturgeon told MSPs on Thursday. “In years to come, I think this will be something this parliament will be really, really proud of.”Similar legislation is to come into force next year in Wales. A bill is working its way through the Welsh assembly and will get royal assent this summer. But Wales may set a higher price, of 60p or more per unit. Scottish experts, including the Royal Society of Edinburgh, believe 50p is too low. It was set in 2012, but with inflation they say 70p per unit would be more effective.Ministers in Northern Ireland were considering minimum pricing before the Stormont power-sharing government collapsed last year and are expected to float the idea again once it resumes. Across the border, the government in Dublin likes the idea too. That combination is forcing the Home Office in London to shift ground. It will consider the policy again in two to three years’ time.Prof Sir Ian Gilmore, the chair of the Alcohol Health Alliance, which includes the Royal College of Physicians, British Medical Association and Alcohol Concern, said ministers in Westminster needed to follow Scotland’s lead. “There are more than 23,000 deaths a year in England linked to alcohol, and many of these come from the poorest and most vulnerable sections of society,” he said. “Any delay in implementing minimum unit pricing in England will only cost lives and lead to unnecessary alcohol-related harm.”In private, industry sources say, the drinks industry is trying to pre-empt that by pressing the chancellor, Philip Hammond, to increase excise duty on low-cost, high-strength drinks rather than support blanket minimum pricing. Brewers that also run pubs, such as C\u0026ampC Group, the owner of Tennent’s lager, back minimum pricing as it reduces competition from supermarkets. But other industry sources warn minimum pricing will boost black-market sales. But he believes most consumers will be shocked by the impact of minimum pricing on them. “What concerns me the most is that these moderate drinkers are going to be paying for the bulk of this policy,” he said. “Their choice is reducing and the products which are left are going to be significantly more expensive.” Sturgeon: “We need to change our relationship with alcohol to save lives. This Tuesday, the eyes of the world will once again be on Scotland as we implement a minimum price for alcohol of 50 pence per unit.She continued: “Alcohol misuse causes around 700 hospital admissions and 22 deaths each week. Behind every one of these statistics is a person, a family, a community struggling with the impact of alcohol abuse. “Last year, UK chief medical officers published new alcohol guidelines, recommending that both men and women drink no more than 14 units per week. In Scotland, those 14 units can currently be bought for just £2.52. “The research is clear – alcohol consumption and harm go hand in hand, and the links between the two run deep. Minimum pricing is the best way to tackle the cheap, high strength alcohol that causes so much damage to so many families.“Given alcohol is an epidemic faced right across the UK we stand ready to share our experience in delivering this responsible, forward-thinking policy with any other government, that is ready to take action.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64961b3a529673cb831d5c04a119a8067844b1fc/0_94_4559_2736/master/4559.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f04ff5fdd7b7afae12a43c7efaf5a809","title":"iaaf accused blatant racism over new testosterone regulations caster semenya","story":"• Rules will impact on world 800m champion Caster Semenya• Minister says regulations designed to ‘disadvantage’ South AfricanThe IAAF has been accused of “blatant racism” by the ruling party of South Africa, the African National Congress, over its new regulations on testosterone levels.On Thursday the IAAF introduced the regulations aimed at athletes with differences of sex development. The rules limit the testosterone levels of female athletes competing over distances between 400m and a mile.The rules will have an impact on Caster Semenya, South Africa’s world and Olympic 800m champion, who now has to take medication to lower her testosterone levels to keep competing at that distance. The South African minister of sport, Tokozile Xasa, described them as “Caster Semenya Regulations as they are designed to disadvantage Caster in her career”.The ANC spokesman Pule Mabe also compared the new IAAF regulations to government policies in apartheid South Africa. “The regulations are a painful reminder of our past where an unjust government specifically legislated laws for certain activists in society to stifle their fight against an unjust system,” he said. “The IAAF uses the same tactic to exclude those who have defined the past decade as champions and treasures of their home countries. We call on government to challenge this grossly unfair, unjust and blatant racist attempt by the IAAF to the court of arbitration for sport.“The ANC has always understood sport as a unifier and a tool to bring people and nations together. It is for this reason and many that the ANC cannot ignore the attempt by the IAAF to discriminate and exclude athletes. These new regulations infringe on the human rights of athletes, targeting mainly those in east Europe, Asia and the African continent. The racial undertones of this cannot go unnoticed.”Xasa added: “South Africans and all progressive people of the world must unite and support Caster and all affected athletes in this regard. Caster is not just an athlete to people of South Africa – she represents their hopes and aspirations. She is a pathfinder to the rural poor and downtrodden, she is an affirmation of black excellence. She\u0026nbspundermines a stereotype that nothing good will ever come from the rural villages.”The secretary general of the women’s league of the ANC, Meokgo Matuba, described the new regulations as the culmination of a “concerted effort to please some of the sore racist losers who cannot afford to see a black female South African athlete dominating the world”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9eaa96c022547dd8ea4d687dc7cb2ea7d28b5d0/0_115_1792_1075/master/1792.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=553e2bd854cff66d603b48f512e51a37","title":"london marathon impostor accused of claiming runners medal","story":"Man pictured at finish with lost race number of charity runner who was removed from courseLondon Marathon organisers are investigating after it emerged that an apparent impostor may have used a genuine runner’s lost race number to collect a medal.Jake Halliday, 28, an investment manager from Edinburgh, reportedly lost his race number and was removed from the course three and a half hours into his run and about 15 minutes from the finish. Hailliday was running with his friend Andrew Keiller for the blood cancer research charity Bloodwise, in support of Keiller’s girlfriend who was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma in October 2016. The pair – along with their friend Chris Chisholm who is due to run the Stirling marathon this weekend – have raised more than £48,500, smashing their £20,000 target. According to race tracking data, Halliday crossed the start line at 10.05am and reached the 40km mark in a little over three and a half hours, but did not record a finish time.Pictures have emerged apparently showing an alleged impostor posing at the finish line with Halliday’s race number, 35179, and a finisher’s medal.Officials said they were aware of the claims and were investigating but would make “no further comment at the moment”. According to Peter Mowbray, 51, a runner who publicised the incident on Facebook, Halliday was prevented from completing the race by two marshals who saw that he was not wearing a number, the Daily Mail reported. “It takes a lot of work to run a marathon. It’s not a matter of eating a bowl of pasta and having a go, it’s 12 months worth of training,” Mowbray wrote. “Jake had his once-in-a-lifetime experience stolen from him by an impostor. The running world is very close-knit and when I saw the photograph of that man taking Jake’s medal I cried.”It is not the first time in the London Marathon’s 37-year-history that allegations of cheating have surfaced. In 2016, Natasha Argent, 26, agreed to return her finisher’s medal after she was found to have missed 11 of the 24 checkpoints. She was recorded as having completed the final 20km in 39mins – quicker than Sir Mo Farah. She later said she had had a panic attack and got lost.In 2010, a runner who was initially thought to have recorded the fastest London Marathon time by someone aged over 65 was found to have taken a 10-mile shortcut at Tower Bridge. He said he had done so because of an injury.Donations to a fundraising page set up by a former MasterChef contestant who died after collapsing during this year’s marathon have topped £220,000. Matt Campbell, 29, from Kendal, collapsed at the 22.5-mile mark during Sunday’s event, which took place in record 24.1C (73.3F) temperatures.Campbell was running to raise a target of £2,500 for the Brathay Trust, which was where his father had worked before he died suddenly in 2016. By Friday afternoon, £217,500 had been raised through Campbell’s JustGiving page for the Cumbria-based charity, which works with vulnerable young people."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/859169f1612abf8af017fdd52f9491afee95446d/1_316_851_511/master/851.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ae1af5718e9a1d07c104d9ac8cc3286","title":"magnus carlsen fabiano caruana hunt for prizes","story":"Seven months before the world title series Norway’s Magnus Carlsen and his US challenger, Fabiano Caruana, are in good form. The American is still benefiting from the momentum he achieved at the Berlin Candidates and in the Grenke Classic while Carlsen has been sparked by the emergence of a dangerous rival.On Thursday night Caruana was sharing the lead in the US championship at St Louis on 5.58 with three rounds left while Carlsen, after a slow start in the Azeri elite event at Shamkir, had taken a clear 5.58 lead. Just one round remains there, but in Saturday’s ninth and final game Carlsen meets China’s Ding Liren, who is only half a point behind the world champion.The final stages of both tournaments can be viewed free and live online this weekend with grandmaster and computer move-by-move commentaries.Caruana has been impressive in his four game victories, notably crushing two French Defences 1 e4 e6, but his performance was blemished by a shock defeat from Zviad Izoria, a semi-retired Californian GM who won a long ending with a rook pawn which Caruana’s knight could not stop. Earlier Caruana declined a draw and admitted he lost his objectivity: “I just went crazy.”Caruana’s elite GM colleague Hikaru Nakamura thought this game was ominous for the world title series in November: “It bodes poorly for the match because Magnus is very good at drawing out long games. That’s one of the big weaknesses Fabiano is going to have to work on.”Sam Shankland, 26, was Caruana’s co-leader after eight rounds and created a stir when he declared that it was wrong to try to draw with the top-rated trio of Caruana, Nakamura and Wesley So because “they are also human beings. They can die.” These were brave\u0026nbspwords and, after halving with\u0026nbspCaruana and So, Shankland launched a powerful attack against the out-of-form Nakamura, who needed all his experience to escape into a level\u0026nbspending.Before that, Carlsen unleashed a new anti-Sicilian idea to defeat Poland’s Radoslaw Wojtaszek.The legendary tactician Mikhail Tal had Nd5 sacrifices against the Sicilian as a trademark, but Carlsen flunked it at move 17 because he could not visualise all the complications. However, it was near winning after 17 Nd5! ed5 18 exd5 Nd8 19 Bd3! Rh5 20 Rxe7+!

Chris Bush and Matt Winkworth’s musical is definitely not a call for the murder of a self-styled hate figure. Rather, it’s an intelligent, thoughtful and often wryly enjoyable look at the polarisation of public debate in the age of social media, and what happens when it ceases to be a discourse and becomes a mere echo chamber. Lucy Osborne’s design of stairs, platforms and movable screens features the lights of thousands of endlessly winking mobile phones. Yes, Katie Hopkins is dead, cut down in public by an unknown assailant. But while some celebrate her passing by taking to the streets to sing Ding Dong! The Witch Is Dead, the police search for her killer without success. Kayleigh (an impressive debut from Bethzienna Williams), an intern at an Amnesty-style charity is asked to compile a dossier explaining Katie’s appeal. What she finds confounds her expectations, appals her boss (“I asked for a dossier, not a love letter”) and leads to her setting up a group called Justice4Katie. Soon the hashtag #JeSuisKatie is trending. Justice is also on the mind of trainee soliciter Shayma Hussaini (Maimuna Memon) who is returning to work after she rocked the boat by making a sexual harassment allegation against her superior. She tries patience further when she takes up the cause of office cleaner Elena (Amy Booth-Steel) whose cousin is one of 12 people killed in a caravan fire on a fruit-picking farm. Their deaths have passed almost unnoticed in the hysteria surrounding Hopkins’ demise. The two stories never quite meet, but offer a series of reverberating reflections on free speech, confirmation bias, our obsession with celebrity, who gets justice, and how humanity and truth are casualties in a world of instant messaging, unchecked news reports and videos that go viral at the click of a button. Both Kayleigh and Shayma are, like Katie, women who refuse to be silenced and pay a price for not conforming to expectations. There is a particularly striking moment when Shayma responds to racial harassment on a train, to startling effect. Bush and director James Grieve set out their stall early by pointing to the inability of theatre, or indeed any medium, to tell the whole truth, while slyly suggesting that what we are watching is a verbatim play based on real interviews and news reports. But, of course, it is a fiction. It’s very neatly done, as is Winkworth’s deliciously inventive score, which pulsates and bleeps like a mobile device and yet still has a lyrical underscoring, and plenty of earworms. Music and words are sometimes in harmony, but often cleverly used in counterpoint to each other. Most importantly, the score offers an emotional hook that Bush’s clever, inquiring script sometimes lacks. The show has pitched itself in the realm of Jerry Springer: The Opera, and there are similarities. But it is less outrageously satirical and eager to shock, and more reflective. There are moments when it feels a little dry, and it’s definitely overlong and repetitive. But with tightening and cuts, it should shine, thanks to its brilliant cast and willingness to grapple intelligently with how technology is changing us.

In 1892 three black men, co-owners of a store giving white businesses a run for their money, were attacked, fought back and were arrested. They never stood trial. A white mob broke into the jail, dragged them away and lynched them.The murders were grieved by their friend Ida B Wells, an African American teacher, journalist, civil rights pioneer and suffragist about whom it was once said: “She has plenty of nerve she is as smart as a steel trap, and she has no sympathy with humbug.” Wells was galvanised to count, investigate and report lynchings in America as no one had done before, hurling her 5ft frame into hostile territory with all the fearlessness of a war reporter.For a century she has languished as an unsung heroine, overshadowed by more familiar giants of the civil rights movement. In recent years, however, her crusading activism and muckraking techniques are being rediscovered. A society for investigative reporting bears her name the New York Times – which once branded her “a slanderous and nasty-minded mulattress” – just published a belated obituary, and there are moves to name a street after her in New York and build a monument in Chicago.“I consider her my spiritual grandmother,” says Nikole Hannah-Jones, an investigative journalist covering civil rights. “She was was a trailblazer in every way ... as a feminist, as a suffragist, as an investigative reporter, as a civil rights leader. She was just an all-around badass.”Wells was born into slavery in Holly Springs, Mississippi, during the civil war. She was orphaned at 16 after her parents – as well as a younger brother – died from a yellow fever epidemic. She found work as a teacher to support her five remaining siblings, then moved to Memphis, where she became a leading journalist and civil rights activist.At 21, Wells clashed with a white train conductor who ordered her to move from the ladies’ car to the a section designated for black passengers, despite her having bought a first class ticket. When she refused and the conductor tried to forcibly move her, Wells “fastened her teeth on the back of his hand”, as she wrote later. Wells sued after being ejected from the train and won the case (a newspaper headline declared “Darky damsel gets damages”), though the decision was later reversed in court.By the time Wells turned 25, she was the co-owner and editor of the Free Speech and Headlight, a local black newspaper, a platform she used to skewer racial inequality. Then came the People’s Grocery Lynching. She denounced it in print, armed herself with a pistol and spent months traveling alone in the south, researching more than 700 lynchings from the previous decade.Some 4,075 African Americans were lynched in 12 southern states between 1877 and 1950, according to the Equal Justice Initiative’s 2015 report, Lynching in America. Some were witnessed by big crowds who brought children and picnic baskets, as if at a public entertainment.Wells’s great-granddaughter, Michelle Duster, an author and public speaker, says: “They would torture people before they were killed and dismember them afterwards and pass around the body parts. It was shocking to me that people would take bones as souvenirs. The more I learned about the level of violence, the more I appreciated what it took for her to do what she did. I am just amazed.”Wells visited places where people had been hanged, shot, beaten, burned alive, drowned or mutilated. She examined photos of victims hanging from trees as mobs looked on, pored over local newspaper accounts, took sworn statements from eyewitnesses and, on occasion, even hired private investigators.It was astoundingly courageous work in an era of Jim Crow segregation and in which women did not have the vote. Hannah-Jones, who writes for the New York Times Magazine, says: “There was no protection from the law for a black woman who was going into territories where black people had been stolen from the jail and lynched with the help of law enforcement. “These places would have been hostile to a black person questioning these communities at all, but think about the types of emotion in a community that has just lynched someone and strung their body up for public display and then to have a black woman come in there asking questions. One has to ask: ‘Would I have the courage to do that?’ There was no help that was going to come for you. There was no protection from the law. Black folks didn’t even have a lot of legal rights and they certainly didn’t have much protection from law enforcement.”Wells, however, was a force of nature who once said, “One had better die fighting injustice than die like a dog or a rat in a trap.” On another occasion, she wrote: “I had already determined to sell my life as dearly as possible if attacked. If I could take one lyncher with me, this would even up the score a little bit.”She destroyed the mainstream media’s narratives that suggested lynching victims were criminals – often rapists of white women – who got their just desserts. Her reporting showed that rape had not been alleged in two thirds of the lynchings or was only alleged after a covert, consensual, interracial relationship had been exposed.Duster says: “She was putting names to stories and names to statistics. She was putting context into what was happening. Without what she did, it was pretty much ‘OK, this person committed a crime, they got what they deserved.’ She said, ‘No, they did not commit a crime.’ The narrative of the mainstream media at this time was very different from the reality she found on the ground.”Hannah-Jones adds: “Much like the killing of black people by police today, the ‘official’ story of lynchings was just largely accepted, which was that black men were rapists and that unknown vigilantes were just meting out justice to black brutes. You can look at the way that newspapers covered these things and that was just accepted and Ida B Wells exposed the reality behind lynchings, which is that they were often used as economic retaliation.“They were used to sow fear in black communities so that black people would stay in their place and she exposed the truth about that. She also exposed that while law enforcement would often say they these lynchings occur ‘at the hands of parties unknown’, everyone in town knew who committed them and often law enforcement took part.”While Wells was out of town, a mob destroyed her printing press in Memphis and threatened to kill her if she returned. She stayed away from the south for more than three decades but toured the US and UK, raising awareness through public speaking. In 1895 she published a pamphlet, the Red Record, the first statistical record of the history of American lynchings, a forerunner of data journalism projects such as The Counted, the ’s project to document people killed by police.Hannah-Jones says: “She was one of the first people to actually tally the number of lynchings that were happening. We like to say she was one of our early data reporters. She began to collect data on this to show how actually vast the scope of the problem was.”When Wells died in 1931 at the age of 68 from a brief illness due to kidney failure, her influence was waning, her autobiography was unfinished and her ambition of a federal anti-lynching law was unrealised. Duster muses: “She went out with a whimper. She was almost obsolete. She writes in her autobiography that there was a generation who didn’t know who she was and didn’t know about lynching. She wrote the book to stop it being forgotten.”“I think her being a woman, and a black woman, were things that pretty much guaranteed her obscurity. She was also written out of the suffrage movement even though she played a huge role in it and was trying to push the white suffragists on racial equality. Both her gender and her race are the reasons why she was largely written out of history.”But now she is inspiring a new generation of women in journalism. Hannah-Jones is co-founder of the Ida B Wells Society for Investigative Reporting, which aims to increase the ranks, retention and profile of reporters and editors of colour in the field. What if Wells herself were alive today? “I think she would be very unsurprised by the America of 2018,” she says. “In many ways it would look very familiar to her. As long as she was able, she would be one of the sharpest critics of this country right now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52386a1d0ca67812c02951afc3c3713d23b19ccf/0_78_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=38e0309ba619051ee1bfadfd17442472","title":"north south korea summit leaders promise lasting peace denuclearisation kim jong un moon jae in","story":"Kim Jong-un and Moon Jae-in pledge denuclearisation and end to decades of hostility after summitThe leaders of North and South Korea have promised after a landmark summit to bring “lasting peace” to the peninsula with a commitment to denuclearisation and to ending decades of hostilities.Speaking at the end of an extraordinary day that began with a lingering handshake across the demarcation line separating their countries, the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, and the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, issued a joint statement that was short on detail but offered cause for optimism as the world looks ahead to a summit between Kim and Donald Trump.The US president, in his first comments on the declaration, tweeted: “Good things are happening, but only time will tell!” He later added: “KOREAN WAR TO END!”Later, Trump warned that the US was “not going to be played” by North Korea. Speaking alongside Angela Merkel at the White House, the US president said that talks on the ided Korean peninsula have “never gone this far.”The Panmunjom declaration, named after the truce village that hosted the talks on Friday, committed the two Koreas to seek the “complete denuclearisation” of the peninsula.“South and North Korea confirmed the common goal of realising, through complete denuclearisation, a nuclear-free Korean peninsula,” it said. “South and North Korea shared the view that the measures being initiated by North Korea are very meaningful and crucial for the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula, and agreed to carry out their respective roles and responsibilities in this regard.”The statement did not specify what Pyongyang expected in return for abandoning its nuclear weapons – the regime’s best deterrent against what it regards as a hostile US.Speaking outside the peace house on the southern side of the border that has ided the Korean peninsula for 65 years, the leaders also pledged to push for talks with the US, and possibly China, to formally end the 1950-53 Korean war with a peace treaty to replace the uneasy truce that stopped hostilities.North and South Korea have been ided since the end of the Korean War (1950-53), and except for about a decade ending in 2008, relations between the two have remained frosty. The two nations technically remain in a state of war, since a peace treaty was never signed.\u0026nbspThere have been occasional outbreaks of violence, most recently in 2010 when 50 people were killed when a South Korean navy corvette was sunk and several islands close to the border were attacked.This meeting\u0026nbspcould touch on a formal truce\u0026nbspbut this is also not the first time North Korea has expressed a willingness to abandon its nuclear ambitions. A deal with the US, Japan and South Korea in the 1990s was meant to give the North civilian nuclear power without the ability to build a weapon, but the reactor was never finished.North Korea\u0026nbsppledged to relinquish its nuclear programme\u0026nbspin 2007 in exchange for sanctions relief and fuel, but later pulled out of that agreement and expelled inspectors in 2009.Read a full explainer on the Korea summit hereNoting that more than a decade had passed since the countries’ leaders last met, Kim and Moon agreed to talk regularly by phone and meet more often, starting with a summit in Pyongyang in autumn.They vowed to work more closely on a host of bilateral issues, including reuniting families ided by the Korean war and improving cross-border transport links.Months after relations between the two countries sank to their lowest level following North Korean missile launches and its sixth nuclear test, Moon said he and Kim were aware that the hopes of 80 million North and South Koreans rested on their shoulders.“We were able to stand together today and agree that we should denuclearise the Korean peninsula,” Moon said, according to a translation provided by South Korea’s Arirang TV.With Kim standing nearby behind a separate podium, he said. “To completely denuclearise, we declare that we will cooperate to bring about an everlasting peace on the peninsula.”Moon applauded Kim’s “courage and determination” and vowed that “there will be no going back” to an era of tension and provocation that has occasionally brought the neighbours to the brink of conflict. “We are giving a great present to the citizens of the two Koreas,” he said.The goodwill measures would begin with a halt to “all forms of hostility” on land, at sea and in the air, the declaration said. The demilitarised zone – the heavily armed border separating the two countries – and the western maritime border will be turned into “peace zones”.From Tuesday, both countries will suspend all loudspeaker propaganda broadcasts and dismantle broadcasting equipment. They will also stop sending propaganda leaflets across the border.Kim said: “We hope we will not repeat the mistake of the past. I hope this will be an opportunity for the Korean people to move freely from North to South. We need to take responsibility for our own history.“We have waited for this day for a very long time. We are tied by blood and cannot be separated – we are the same country, the same people, and should not be separated by hostility.“We hope we can open a new road towards a new future, and that is why I crossed the demarcation line today. We hope for a new era of peace, and we have reaffirmed our commitment to that.”Duyeon Kim, a senior fellow at the Korean Peninsula Future Forum, said the wording of the statement was encouraging, as Kim prepares for his summit with Trump in late May or early June.“It’s good that the nuclear language is in there, and including ‘complete denuclearisation’ is a win for Moon,” she said. “It’s really aimed at setting up the meeting with Trump.”But she said it would have been easy for Kim to agree to the statement since “it reiterates what their position has been all along”, and from Pyongyang’s perspective, denuclearisation would include significant concessions from the US on its military presence in South Korea.“In the grand scheme of things, this declaration is continuing the spirit of the 2007 agreement, and much of what we see in this declaration has been agreed to before,” she said. “But it’s still a long and complicated road ahead.”Earlier, the two leaders signed the joint statement before standing to shake hands. At Moon’s instigation, they joined hands and raised their arms aloft, ending the exchange with an embrace and more of the broad smiles that were a feature of their joint public appearances throughout the day.International reaction to the summit was largely positive. China, the North’s main ally and its biggest economic partner, described the leaders’ handshake as a historic moment.“We applaud the Korean leaders’ historic step and appreciate their political decisions and courage,” Hua Chunying, a foreign ministry spokeswoman, told reporters. “We hope and look forward to them taking this opportunity to further open a new journey of long-term stability on the peninsula.”The UK foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, sounded a more cautious note. While “very encouraged” by the summit, he said: “I don’t think that anybody looking at the history of North Korea’s plans to develop a nuclear weapon would want to be over-optimistic at this point. But it is clearly good news that the two leaders are meeting. Absolutely.”Virginie Grzelczyk, a senior lecturer at Aston University, said: “This is a very long game, and confidence-building will take a lot of time. I am not sure a meeting between Kim Jong-un and President Trump would add anything to this particularly good development in inter-Korean relations today, and it might be that this would blur the line.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9e366edcf082ca438dbc29e82185e81d9bfe989/0_59_3555_2567/master/3555.jpg?w=480\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=4fb981920c2d7351b5bdbccff214b561 960w","title":"my financial future can i have my brunch and eat it too","story":"The options appear to be: never socialise and stay in to save for a house, or live a normal, modern urban life and spiral into debt. But is there a third way?Sitting firmly in the middle of the millennial generation (those born 1981-2000) and I’m told I could easily afford to buy my first home in London if I just give up: coffee, my gym membership, an annual weekend away, takeaway food, and a mobile upgrade, or one night out a week, for five years – or avocados.Sure, London living is afforded by renting the equivalent of a dodgy hostel dorm, nights out revolving around two-for-one deals, and “side-hustles”, which is a glorified term for my three jobs. So, should I accept that I can’t have my brunch and eat it too? Living paycheck to paycheck isn’t the dream and maybe neither is owning a home, but there must be a way I could at least consider the option.I’m certainly not alone, but maybe we’re placing too much value on “Yolo” – apparently a typical habit of young people today – so I’ve asked Paul Bridgwater, head of commercial and proposition at financial services provider OneFamily, and millennial lifestyle and personal finance expert Lisa Rowan from The Penny Hoarder what they think – and luckily neither suggested a five-year period where I give up all that I hold dear.Is it really that hard to save in a big city or am I being led astray?Rowan suggests that, unfortunately, it’s not all in my head. “Affordable, low-amenity units are being replaced with luxury buildings that are simply out of reach for many people, especially young people in the early stages of their careers,” she says. “This competitive housing environment means more workers in their 20s and 30s are enduring long commutes from the suburbs or are living with several roommates in order to make the most of their budgets.” But, Bridgwater says, while it can feel unattainable without the help from “the bank of mum and dad” we do have the benefit of living in a connected, digital age that can help us achieve our financial goals.I really value my social life – do I have to give up a chunk of it for five years?No, says Rowan, but there are some hacks to help make sure you don’t spend most of your monthly wages during the excitement of payday. In short, be at least a bit prepared. “Knowing the type of activity upfront can help you determine whether an event is a social and financial priority for you – then, it’s easier to make compromises. You may skip on the 12-person birthday dinner at a fancy restaurant, but you can still meet the group for drinks or dessert afterward. You can still go on a bar crawl with your friends, but perhaps eat a hearty meal before you leave the house,” she says.Bridgwater agrees, and says it’s safe to assume that most of your friends are in the same boat, so be straight up with them. “Money is a bit of a taboo subject for any age group, especially in the UK. On a practical level, earnings, savings and debts are not really discussed and perhaps they should be,” he says. “Like anything else in life, by talking and sharing issues, interesting solutions will come to light.”OK, so maybe I should be budgeting. What are some handy guidelines?Bridgwater says that budgeting isn’t the same for everyone, but taking away the temptation to spend is often the easiest way to save. “Create different accounts for your big expenses (housing, bills and savings) and then set up a standing order into these accounts one to two days after your wages go in from your main account. You’ll then know the money you have left in your main account is money you can spend,” he says.So, can I think about saving for a big purchase and still keep seeing my friends?Yes, says Rowan: “You can have your instant and delayed gratification at the same time.” A product like OneFamily’s stocks and shares Lifetime Isa is a good start when considering your options. With a Lifetime Isa, for every £4 put in, the government adds £1 – so save up to £4,000 a year and get £1,000 as a bonus (available after 12 months). Lifetime Isas are available either based on cash investments, which can be preferable for first-time house purchases in the short-term or stocks and shares investments, which might be preferable if you are aiming to buy your first home in five or more years, as they offer potentially better returns over the longer term, but be aware that capital is at risk.For information on the OneFamily stocks and shares Lifetime Isa, visit OneFamily.

Photograph: PABritain hopes to make “significant progress” to resolve the issue of the Border post-Brexit by June but has until October to finalise a deal on the overall withdrawal, the UK’s cabinet office minister has said.On a visit to the Border region, David Lidington, Britain’s de facto deputy prime minister, said London was “very determined” that there should be progress by the next EU summit at the end of June but that the Brexit treaty as a whole, including the Irish issue, needed to be completed by October.“We should aim to make significant progress in June. Let’s devote all our energies to that: no hard border on the island of Ireland, no customs border on the Irish Sea,” he told reporters after meeting businesspeople from the local chamber of commerce in Newry. Differences of opinion have emerged between the EU and the UK on the pace of progress on the unresolved issue of how to avoid a hard border after the UK leaves the EU and around deadlines in Brexit talks.The UK’s Brexit secretary, David Davis, said on Wednesday he regarded June as an “artificial deadline” for agreement on the so-called backstop, the emergency default position effectively keeping Northern Ireland under EU economic rules post-Brexit in the absence of another option. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said on Thursday it was essential that there be “real and solid progress by June” on a solution to the Border question and that, without it, there can be no overall Brexit deal.Mr Lidington sounded a more conciliatory and constructive note on his visit to Co Down saying that all parties needed “to keep our eyes on the strategic prize”.“It is really important that we focus all our energies on ensuring no hard border on the island of Ireland and no border, no customs border to trade in the Irish Sea,” he said.Asked about Mr Varadkar’s remarks that the biggest barrier to a deal was the UK’s “very, very hard red lines”, the Conservative MP said that London had put forward “a number of ideas for negotiation” and that officials were working every week “to go through the nitty-gritty of those proposals issue by issue”.Mr Lidington, a former shadow Northern Ireland secretary of state from 2003 to 2007, said “good progress” had been made on maintaining the Common Travel Area covering freedom of travel between the UK and Ireland after Brexit, on equalities and human rights, and on the single energy market."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3476650.1524844779!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"state pathologist turns into a ballet dancer once a week","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAnne Maher, artistic director and co-founder of Ballet Ireland, with Prof Marie Cassidy, right, the State Pathologist and a keen proponent of ballet, at a fundraising lunch in Dublin. Photograph: Nick BradshawNot even the most imaginative crime writer would put ballet dancing and forensic pathology together. It was no wonder then that the State pathologist, Prof Marie Cassidy, admitted she was an odd choice to be guest speaker at the Ballet Ireland fundraiser in Dublin’s Merrion Hotel.Prof Cassidy was the ideal speaker, according to the organisation’s chair, Gerardine Connolly SC, who introduced the pathologist as a “true Hitchcock heroine” with an image that is “cool, striking and detached”.The pathologist’s speech was a mixture of humour and self-deprecation, in which she tried to make light of herself and her chosen profession.It was a profession so grim, she told the audience, that during a murder trial involving a prostitute in Glasgow, another prostitute told her, “Ach, I don’t know how you do that job, Hen.”Prof Cassidy described her profession as an “ugly and gruesome world, though CSI tries to make it sexy”, in comparison to “grace and beauty” of ballet.She said the Ballet Ireland lunch was a glamorous occasion for which she got to dress up, a contrast to her day job for which she wears a “one size fits nobody” white suit so big that she has to wear high heels just to be able to stand in it.The occasion was the first fundraiser for Ballet Ireland, the country’s only professional ballet company. Some 108 guests paid €120 to attend. The organisation hopes to raise €15,000 to take a production of the ballet Giselle to the Edinburgh Festival.Prof Cassidy took up ballet at the age of four but was, by her own admission, a “podgy child” who nevertheless entertained dreams of being a ballerina. If Ballet Ireland had a euro for every child who wanted to be a ballet dancer growing up, it would not need to do any fundraising, she said.Her presence at the lunch was down to a decision she took a few years ago to go to adult ballet lessons for an hour every week.She said ballet provides “beauty and bright colours. You need anything that distracts you. I’ve never looked back. You have to have balance in your life.“I do see and hear some terrible things, but you have got to walk away from it and orce yourself from it. I did discover by going to ballet that it redressed some of the awful things I have seen.”Prof Cassidy drew tentative comparisons between the two walks of life – both demand passion and involve unsociable hours.“You really have to give up on something. You really have to give up on a social life. Your social life becomes work. Your social life becomes the people you work with,” she said.“Some people say you can have it all. I’m not a believer in that at all. I think you have to make choices. I chose my career and my family and I didn’t have anything in between.“My daughter’s appalled. She said: ‘Mum, why don’t you have any friends?’ I go: ‘I don’t need friends, I have you.’”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3468658.1524242996!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"le big mac emmanuel macron s rise and rise","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWinning ways: Emmanuel Macron at his victory rally in Paris after being elected president, in May 2017. Photograph: Patrick KovarikAFPGettyPresident Emmanuel Macron likes to convince people. In manner and method, he is unlike his predecessors. Nicolas Sarkozy cajoled and bullied. François Hollande just gave up. Macron fixes interlocutors with his intense blue stare and builds a Cartesian argument. If that doesn’t work, he starts over, patiently, but with determination.The past week has tested the young president’s powers of persuasion. Early in the hours of April 14th, Macron used his constitutional power as commander in chief for the first time, joining the US and Britain in launching cruise missiles against three chemical weapons installations in Syria. The goal, Macron said later, was to convince Bashar al Assad and Vladimir Putin that the international community was more than a “nice” and “weak” body they could push around.In a further exercise in persuasion, Macron volunteered for a combative, 2½ hour live television interview on Sunday night, during which he made the surprising claim that, “Ten days ago, President Trump said the US would pull out of Syria. We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the duration.”The White House later issued a statement saying Trump’s view had not changed, and the French president made an embarrassing climbdown on Monday, claiming he “never said” the US or France would remain militarily engaged in Syria for the long term.Perhaps Macron, whose nickname is “Jupiter”, is threatened by hubris, the sin of pride that afflicted Greek gods.The rest of the week was one long attempt to convince Europeans and the French of the rightness of his positions. Macron – who has become the de facto leader of Europe – received the heads of the three Baltic states who have teamed up with five other northern EU countries, including the Netherlands and Ireland, to thwart his efforts to further integrate the euro zone.Then, before a more sympathetic audience at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Macron pleaded with proponents of liberal democracy to wake up and oppose the populist authoritarians who deny European values. Macron then travelled to Berlin in yet another effort to enlist German chancellor Angela Merkel’s support for his European reform agenda.On Monday, Macron will go to Washington for a three-day state visit, the first of Trump’s presidential term. Although the two men have clashed on climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, trade protectionism and the rise of Eurosceptical populism, Trump appears to have been charmed by the young president, who says Franco-American co-operation is crucial in the fight against terrorism.As the first anniversary of Macron’s election approaches on May 7th, and a half century after the May 1968 revolution, a different kind of spring is flowering in France. For the first time in decades, the country is reversing its post second World War decline, and the persuasive Macron is turning France into the world’s greatest soft power.There is, of course, discontent. It wouldn’t be France if there wasn’t. This week Macron also confronted striking railway workers in the Vosges, telling them to “stop taking people hostage.” The country is struggling through a rolling strike over the reform of the SNCF railway company.And despite Macron’s best efforts to reassure them, many in France suspect their young president is out to destroy the familiar but dysfunctional “French social model”. In their eyes, Macron is pushing France into the chasm of savage, race-to-the bottom capitalism.So what do they make of him in his home town? The  travelled there to find out.Macron was born in Amiens, the capital of Picardy, 40 years ago and lived here until just before his 17th birthday. From age 11 to 16, he studied at the Jesuit school La Providence.Built in the graceless concrete style of the 1950s, “La Pro” is an elementary, secondary and technical school for 2,000 pupils, spread over several acres. Aside from occasional crucifixes, calendars of Pope Francis and portraits of St Ignatius of Loyola, the religious footprint is light. The teachers are lay people. The priest visits only once a week now.Not a single plaque or photograph records that the president and first lady of France passed through these corridors. Yet this is where Macron asked to be baptised at the age of 12, and where, at 15, he fell in love with his future wife, a French and drama teacher called Brigitte Trogneux Auzière.Macron has always been drawn to older people. His maternal grandmother, Germaine “Manette” Nogues, died in his arms five years ago, at the age of 97. The Protestant humanist philosopher Paul Ricoeur was a spiritual father to him the progressive socialist millionaire Henry Hermand his political mentor. “He’s attracted by knowledge, by people who have experience,” his neurologist father, Jean-Michel (67), says over lunch in Amiens.At La Pro and subsequently at Henri IV, France’s leading lycée and prep school in Paris, Macron often stayed after class to talk to teachers.Marc Defernand (78) taught Macron history and geography here, and was principal of Macron’s section. “He was more mature than other students,” says Defernand. “He always asked a lot of questions. Sometimes he would pick up a conversation we’d started eight days earlier, exactly where we’d left off.”In the autumn of 2016, Defernand queued in a local bookshop to ask Macron to sign his autobiographical manifesto, Révolution. The retired educator is moved, recalling what happened. “He grabbed me by the hand and said, ‘Monsieur Defernand! It’s so good to see you!’” Macron inscribed the book: “To Marc, this ‘Revolution’, which owes more to him than he knows. In friendship, Emmanuel.”We visit the 700-seat theatre where Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux Auzière adapted a play by Eduardo De Filippo together.“He was dynamite,” Defernand says. “I told him that if he continued, he would be the Gérard Philippe of the 21st century. It was difficult for others to act in the same play with him. In the same way, it’s difficult for his cabinet ministers now.”Defernand wasn’t aware of the relationship at the time, though he knew Macron went often to Auzière’s house. “I assumed there was a flirt between him and her daughter Laurence,” he says.The scandal of a married teacher with three children having an affair with a student nearly 25 years her junior has been transformed into romantic legend. Everyone would rather forget the trauma.“Jesuits never pried into people’s private lives. There was no morality investigation,” Defernand says. “There were unmarried teachers living together at the time. I was more worried about students taking drugs.”The fact that Brigitte continued to teach at La Pro for years after her lover’s departure, and then transferred to Lycée St Louis de Gonzague when they began to live together later in Paris, is further evidence of tolerance, Defernand says.A tragic love story, known to most French people, occurred a quarter-century earlier and helped pave the way for Macron and Auzière.Schoolteacher Gabrielle Russier (32) had an affair with a lycée student half her age, Christian Rossi, in Marseille. The youth’s parents filed a complaint against the teacher and had their son placed in a mental hospital. Russier was given a suspended prison sentence and took her own life. The story became the subject of books, films and songs. Asked about it at a press conference, former president Georges Pompidou famously quoted a poem by Paul Eluard that was sympathetic to women accused of having slept with German soldiers during the war.The historian Jean-François Sirinelli\u0026nbspcompares the Russier and Macron stories in his book Les Révolutions françaises, to show how much France evolved in a single generation. “Gabrielle Russier takes her own life in 1969. Emmanuel Macron and his teacher start an affair in the 1990s, and in May 2017, Brigitte Macron becomes first lady of France.”Macron’s parents learned of the affair by chance. “My wife was much more upset than I was,” Prof Macron says. “It may sound macho, but I thought he’d get over it. He didn’t . . . I thought it was a little early. It wasn’t the way I envisioned life, but it wasn’t my life. I raised my children to be free and independent.”The Macrons didn’t consider filing charges against Brigitte Auzière, but they asked to meet her. “I was requisitioned to impose authority,” Prof Macron laughs. “I told her, ‘He’s a minor. I want him to complete his studies. After that, he’s free to do what he wants.’”The president’s parents have been hurt by press reports that they sent their son to Paris to get him away from Auzière. “He was going to go to Henri IV anyway. It was planned,” Prof Macron says, nonetheless admitting that perhaps Emmanuel “went a little early”.At La Pro, I ask a class of 14-15 year-olds, Macron’s age when he met Brigitte, if they could fall in love with a teacher. The teenagers laugh and say yes. “If it happened to someone our age, it would shock me,” says a student called Grégoire. “But now that he’s an adult, it doesn’t bother me.”The students say it’s “cool” that Macron is president. “He was elected because there was Marine Le Pen,” pipes in Ayoub, of north African origin. Perhaps parroting their parents’ opinions, the youths object to rising taxes and praise the appointment of cabinet ministers who are not professional politicians. For the future, they predict flying cars and tell me France will never know full employment.On a scale of one to 10, they give the young president an approval rating of seven. “He has to prove himself,” one explains. Like France, Macron’s successors at La Pro are waiting to see.The Amienois may seem blasé about their president, but his father attributes this attitude to the “taciturn, reserved” character of Picard people. The region particularly suffered in both world wars, has a miserable climate and has been decimated by de-industralisation.His son is an atypical Picard, “an extrovert” infused with the sun of the southwest on the side of his mother, Françoise Nogues-Macron.History and bloodlines led me to Macron père, to find out more about the family’s English ancestry. In February, Macron spent an evening with the Presidential Press Association. As the representative for foreign journalists, I was part of the welcoming party. I gave him a sepia postcard of English soldiers in Amiens in 1918. \u0026nbspMacron studied the photograph closely. “You know, they found me an English great grandfather,” he said with a laugh, staring at the postcard. “He was called George Robertson.” The president scrutinised the English faces for a long moment. He was looking for a face that resembled his own.Towards the end of last year’s presidential campaign, Brigitte Macron mentioned to British journalists that her husband had a great grandfather called “Mr Robertson from Bristol”. The London Times, Mirror and Daily Mail researched the story and told the Macrons more than they had ever known about “Mr Robertson”.George William Robertson was born in Bristol in December 1887, and is believed to have fought in the Battle of the Somme. Distant relatives in England have preserved his war medals.Robertson married Macron’s great grandmother, Suzanne Leblond, in the town of Abbeville, 40km from Amiens, in 1919. They had three daughters. The middle daughter, Jacqueline, born in 1922, was Emmanuel Macron’s paternal grandmother.“He disappeared from one day to the next,” Prof Macron told me. “No one in the family ever heard from him. Suzanne raised three daughters alone. She kept a very modest grocery shop in Abbeville. My parents sent me to live with her and my aunts for two years as a child.”The failed marriage to an Englishman “was never, never talked about. The family kept no trace of him. I never saw a picture,” Prof Macron continues. George Robertson married again, settled in east London and kept a grocery shop, like his ex-wife, Suzanne. A step-daughter told the Mirror that he liked to sing Roses of Picardy, which he had learned in the trenches.Had a butcher from Bristol not fought in the Somme, married a Frenchwoman and fathered her children, Emmanuel Macron would not exist, would not be president of France today.Macron’s intellectual precociousness and his relationship with Brigitte meant he “skipped his adolescence”, his father says. In the autumn of 1993, three months short of his 17th birthday, the future president moved to a garret near the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. \u0026nbspHe continued his relationship with Brigitte. “When I went to see him in his chambre de bonne, sometimes he called through the door for me to come back later,” Prof Macron laughs. “I knew she was there with him.”Christian Monjou taught Macron American and British civilisation for three years at Henri IV. Though he did not know about the romance, Monjou noticed that Macron raced off to Amiens the moment classes ended on Saturday. “It was a case of\u0026nbsp ‘the ided self’,” Monjou says in an interview in his book-lined study.Macron obtained his baccalauréat with honours, but twice failed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure, which trains French academics. It was the only failure of his life. Had it not been for the distraction of romance with Brigitte, Monjou says, Macron would have succeeded in the exam and become an academic.Against all odds, Brigitte Macron eventually orced and moved to Paris to live with Emmanuel. They married in 2007. “Without her, I would not be me,” Macron said during the campaign.Macron went on to earn a doctorate in philosophy, then reoriented his life towards politics with degrees from Sciences Po and the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA). “He used failure as a launching pad,” says Monjou. “That is typical of a leader.”“Have you brought your helmet and bulletproof vest?” the taxi driver who takes me to the Whirlpool clothes dryer factory in north Amiens asks. It’s a joke, of course, but the “Whirlpools” are notoriously hostile. A year ago, Marine Le Pen promised their factory would not close if she became president. Macron ignored advice and plunged into the crowd of angry strikers, saying, “If you listen to the security guys, you’re dead.”The factory will move to Poland at the end of May. Most of the 290 workers have been promised retraining or jobs building “intelligent” refrigerators by the factory’s new owner. But they’re still angry. On the day I visit, management proposed a clothes dryer in lieu of a severance bonus.“Macron, Macron. He’s not a god. We’re losing jobs. We don’t give a damn about Macron,” François Gorlia, the in-house union leader, tells me on the phone when he refuses to come to the gate to talk to me.“He’s a right-wing guy. Everything for the rich. Nothing for the poor,” Sibylle (39), an assembly line worker says as she arrives for the 1pm shift. She’ll benefit from Macron’s investment in training for the jobless, but she isn’t convinced. “Training is fine and dandy, but there are no jobs.”After lunch in a simple bistro, Macron’s father Jean-Michel guides me through a maze of streets under construction, to the music conservatory where his son studied piano for nine years. When he failed the conservatory exam after his first year, Macron’s mother told his biographer Anne Fulda, the boy insisted on having the same examiner the second year, an early sign of his determination to convince. He played well, Prof Macron recalls, mastering Bach’s devilishly difficult Goldberg Variations.Prof Macron gives me the address of the modest, two-storey brick bungalow where Emmanuel and his two siblings grew up, and where the neurologist still lives with his second wife. “It’s not Neuilly,” Macron père says laughing, referring to the Beverly Hills-like Paris suburb where Nicolas Sarkozy came from. Though they are both doctors, Macron’s parents earned low, public sector salaries. “They weren’t neurosurgeons with private jets,” comments a presidential adviser.The Trogneux chocolate shop, near the cathedral in central Amiens, is where Brigitte Macron’s family have made chocolates and macaroons for five generations. They also own the local Renault dealership.Black-and-white photographs of successive generations of the Trogneux chocolate dynasty hang inside the shop. There is no photograph or mention of Brigitte Trogneux Auzière Macron. Jean-Alexandre Trogneux (57), the first lady’s nephew and godson, agrees to be photographed, but refuses to talk about the presidential couple. “We’ve made it a golden rule,” he says. “We don’t talk about them and they don’t talk about us.”Fabien Dorémus (32) heads the political book section of a shop in central Amiens. Macron’s Révolution sold more than 400 copies there, an “enormous” number, Dorémus says. He had no desire to read it, and dismisses the book – and Macron – as “all slogans and clichés”. A former journalist whose local online newspaper failed for lack of funding, Dorémus is close to the far left party France Unbowed.\u0026nbspSince Macron’s election, Dorémus says, “I’m not optimistic for workers, pensioners and people who need public services. I am very optimistic for the rich.”The bookseller mentions various left-wing grievances against Macron, arising from a handful of disparaging remarks since 2014: Macron referred to slaughterhouse workers who were losing their jobs as “illiterate” Macron told a heckler wearing an anti-Macron T-shirt, “The best way to buy a suit is to get a job” Macron called protesters against his labour reforms “slackers” and accused strikers of wanting to foutre le bordel, or wreak havoc.It’s hardly “let them eat cake”. But the president has been hanged and burned in effigy by protesters. “You have to put yourself in the place of the people who get told they are slackers and freeloaders,” Dorémus says. “He’s contemptuous of the lower classes. People started hating him because they feel disrespected.”Another criticism, made by Macron’s former teachers, is that his speeches are often so long and intellectual that they can be difficult to follow.And attempts to control the president’s image can be counterproductive. The novelist Emmanuel Carrère was given exclusive access to the president and first lady. In two interviews with Macron, there was “one really strong, beautiful sentence”, Carrère wrote in the . “And this really strong, really beautiful sentence was off the record. In its place I was given permission to use a perfectly dull, perfectly formatted variant.”In the course of a day in President Macron’s home town, there is not a single photograph of him to be seen.Brigitte Fouré, the city’s mayor, tells me the poverty rate is two percentage points higher than the national average, and 80 per cent of inhabitants qualify for social housing. Amiens is ided between disadvantaged north and middle-class south. It was ruled by a communist mayor for 18 years in the 1970s and 1980s.Macron spent less than 17 years in Amiens, Fouré notes. He “went up” to Paris nearly a quarter of a century ago. “People here don’t know him. A lot of people are proud that the president is from Amiens, but that’s it. There has never been a real relationship between him and the city. There is no emotional tie.”On a beautiful spring day, the Élysée Palace feels light years away from dreary Picardy. The top-floor office of a close presidential adviser has a view over the gardens and the Eiffel Tower in the distance.Macron’s entourage is comprised mostly of fervently devoted young men with backgrounds similar to his own. No one at the Élysée, other than the president, can be quoted by name. “Our rule is that no one gets inidual credit for anything,” the adviser explains.The adviser reportedly thought up the slogan used by Macron when Trump pulled out of the Paris accord on climate change, “Make our planet great again!” But he refuses to confirm this. “We work collectively. Everything we do belongs to the president.”The adviser counts a resurgence of French pride as Macron’s greatest achievement so far. “It’s been a long time since the French have been proud to be French, in the eyes of the world,” he says. Though it contradicts my experience in Amiens, the statement rings true. Most people in the professional milieus of Paris adore Macron and are proud of his presidency.A few doors from the president’s office, the adviser lists Macron’s “important victories”: the revision of the labour code and the taxation of capital investments the overhaul of the country’s education system changes to the EU’s posted workers directive ending the giant squat at Notre-Dames-des-Landes and dismantling the nuclear reactor at Fessenheim. The last two issues had festered for decades. “They seemed impossible for any preceding majority,” the adviser says.Macron is doing as much for the disadvantaged as for the rich, the adviser insists. “We have increased basic payments to the poor, the disabled and the elderly. We’re decreasing social charges on lower salaries. The pendulum has swung much more towards the least advantaged than the most privileged.”So why isn’t that message getting through? Why do polls indicate that a majority consider Macron the “president of the rich”?For one reason, the adviser says. “He was an investment banker. What’s more, at Rothschild the most symbolic bank in the world. For many people, that proves his competence. The thing that makes him hated by some is the reason why he is respected by others.”Because Macron worked for four years as an investment banker, “everything he does that is perceived as right-wing or for the rich is blown out of proportion”, the adviser says.“And everything he does for the underprivileged, that would be seen as left-wing, is discounted. It’s a problem of perception.”Opinion polls can be read two ways. An Ifop-Fiducial poll published on April 10th gave Macron a 55 per cent approval rating, high for France, 11 months into a presidency. But a BFM poll published four days later showed that 44 per cent of voters are “disappointed”.Nine years of piano and the rigour of France’s best schools have honed Macron’s powers of concentration. On April 17th, he took questions from MEPs in Strasbourg for three hours, without notes, without so much as jotting down a question – a regular performance for Macron.“He is someone with a great capacity of attention and concentration,” says Monjou. “People who’ve met him often tell me they were struck by the intensity with which he looks at them, as if, for the time they are with him, they are all that matters.”“When you talk to him, it is as if he is downloading your brain,” says a former cabinet minister who sometimes advises Macron.Geraldine Byrne-Nason, now Ireland’s Ambassador to the United Nations, is doubtless the Irish official who knows Macron best. She became friends with the future president when both were “sherpas”, responsible for briefing and accompanying Irish and French leaders to EU summits, between 2012 until 2014. Byrne-Nason represented the taoiseach’s office, Macron the Élysée Palace.“We spent hours and hours in corridors through the night while the heads of state and government were locked in meetings,” Byrne-Nason recalls. “Emmanuel would be one of my first points of repair. If you’re going to be there for seven hours, you want someone interesting to talk to.”Byrne-Nason calls Macron “an insider-outsider” who has mastered the system but is able to regard it with detachment. “He has a healthy disrespect for bureaucracy, and Brussels is the home of process and procedure,” she says. “In that regard, we were kindred spirits. There was a slight impatience with the weight of slow-turning wheels.”Macron was particularly understanding of Irish difficulties during the bailout, Byrne-Nason says. She believes he was responsible for support offered by then president François Hollande.Byrne-Nason sent glowing reports about Macron’s potential to Dublin, long before he became a presidential candidate. Last September, she listened to what she calls his “extraordinary speech in favour of international co-operation and law” at the UN General Assembly. “It was poetic. It was powerful. It lit up the place.” Ireland could have signed off on every word, Byrne-Nason says, calling Macron “a superstar president who generates both respect and influence here amongst the 193 countries of the UN”.If Macron were Irish, he might be a hybrid of President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: part poetic intellectual, rooted in left-wing Christianity and fascinated by ideas part dynamic young liberal, determined to make the economy flourish.When Christian Monjou was Macron’s teacher at Henri IV, he says Macron talked a lot about the Fabians, the centre-left British intellectuals who founded the London School of Economics. The Fabians believed in “the inevitability of gradualness, the idea that everything that is gradual you won’t be able to go back on,” Monjou says. “It is totally anti-French, with our tradition of revolution, not evolution.“French political life is saturated in ideology,” Monjou continues. “With Macron, there is something you might call empirical or pragmatic. It’s familiar to an Anglo-Saxon, but it stands out in France. I suspect this slightly Anglo-Saxon approach may come from listening to me for three years.”Macron’s adviser stresses he is more than a mere pragmatist who would be content to solve one problem after another. “The two legs of Emmanuel Macron are action and reflection,” he says. “He always does both.”Macron’s en même temps mantra seeks to reconcile irreconcilabables, such as liberalism and social protection. The challenge is most obvious in his self-described “humane but realistic” immigration policy. Measures such as the Collomb circular, which authorises police to search emergency shelters for illegal migrants, have alienated some of Macron’s closest allies.In 1997, Macron’s spiritual father Paul Ricoeur delivered a lecture titled Foreigner Myself. Ricoeur cited Leviticus, about “the stranger that dwelleth with you”, and the Gospel of Matthew, which says: “I was a stranger and you took me in.” Opponents of Macron’s tough immigration policy say he has betrayed Ricoeur’s ideals. The criticism must sting, but Macron believes that unless he calms fears of unlimited migration, extreme right-wing populists will continue to gain ground, in France and across Europe.The necessity of ending the “society of status” in which family background, education and profession determine all aspects of one’s life, “gives coherence to everything we are doing”, says the presidential adviser.Philippe Aghion, who teaches economics at Harvard, the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, has greatly influenced the president’s economic thinking.Contrary to Thomas Piketty, the French author of the best-selling Capital in the 21st Century, Aghion and Macron believe that increasing social mobility, not high taxation, is the most effective way of reducing income inequality.Aghion wants to wean France off its post-second World War reliance on the Keynesian welfare state, in which government spending stimulates demand. He is inspired by John Maynard Keynes’s exact contemporary, the Austrian-born economist and Harvard professor Joseph Schumpeter, who believed that innovation and technical progress are the basis of a prosperous economy.Aghion’s theories underlie Macron’s reform of the French labour code last year, and the ongoing reform of professional training. It is, Aghion admitted in an interview, a liberal economic policy. But, he insists, it is also a social policy.Schumpeter believed in creative destruction, “which means you constantly have new jobs replacing old jobs, new firms replacing old firms”, Aghion says. It’s a hard sell to a French public that craves security and is adverse to change.Aghion advocates Danish-style “flexicurity” that combines labour market flexibility with unemployment benefits and retraining for laid-off workers. “In a nutshell: innovation, social protection and social mobility. That’s the triangle you want to achieve,” he says. Listening to him is like hearing Macron speak.Macron’s parents were left-leaning agnostics who did not baptise their children. At the age of 12, probably under the influence of his surroundings at La Pro, Macron asked to make his First Communion. A black-and-white photograph provided by one of his teachers, Gérard Banc, shows the future president making his profession of faith.Macron’s intellectual affiliation has been with the Christian left, with Ricoeur and Esprit magazine, for which he wrote a half-dozen articles, and whose board he sat on. French media interpreted gestures at Macron’s campaign rallies as signs of mysticism, for example when he asked his followers to “show benevolence”, or ended rallies Christ-like, with outstretched arms. On the night of his election, he concluded his speech in front of IM Pei’s glass pyramid at the Louvre with the words, “I will serve you with love”.During his evening with the Presidential Press Association, I asked Macron if, 28 years after his baptism, he still has faith. Personal belief is a taboo subject in secular France. Embarrassed laughter rippled across the room, but he addressed my question.“I believe in something we don’t see, yes,” Macron said. “I have faith in the generic sense of the term. If one doesn’t believe in one’s lucky star, in good fortune, in one’s country, one doesn’t do what I’m doing. I believe in a form of transcendency.”Following Macron’s April 9th speech to French bishops, leftists and Freemasons accused him of attacking la laicité, which has been France’s official policy of state-enforced secularism since 1905.“We share the confused feeling that the link between church and state has been damaged, and that it is as important to you as it is to me to repair it,” Macron said.\u0026nbsp The purpose of laicité was “certainly not to deny spirituality” he argued. \u0026nbsp“For biographical, personal and intellectual reasons, I have the highest opinion of Catholics.”There is something Jesuitical, indeed monklike, about Macron. Unlike his predecessors, he shows no need to eat, sleep or chase women. Asked what has been the “greatest trial” of being in office, the French president said he has “measured the weight and the solitude and the end of innocence” that come with power.“I do not think it is a trial,” Macron continued. “The French have authorised me to do what I committed to do. One thing is certain. There is no respite, which may explain why I sometimes look pale. I do not feel authorised to enjoy any form of leisure. I take time to reflect. I read and write. But in the times we live in, there is no room for respite. That may be the trial of power, though I don’t live it as such. There is undeniably a form of asceticism.”Macron sees his rise to power as the result of a troubled epoch. “I don’t forget where I come from and why I am here today,” he said. “I am the fruit of a form of brutality in history, of a break-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy. If I forget that for one moment, it will be the beginning of the trial.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3475713.1524770096!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"conservatives can hide from customs union debate but can they run","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLabour Brexiteer Kate Hoey: “I feel a little alone today,” she said to a nearly deserted House, as MPs stayed away from a debate on the customs union. Photograph: Andy RainEPAIt is acknowledged on all sides as the crunch question surrounding Brexit right now, but when MPs held a debate about the customs union on Thursday, most of them didn’t show up. The government benches were almost deserted, with empty rows of green leather where the loudest Conservative Brexiteers usually sit, and junior treasury minister Mel Stride manning the front bench.None of the DUP’s 10 MPs were present, leaving North Down’s Sylvia Hermon to represent Northern Ireland – and unionism – alone. Antrim-born Kate Hoey, a Labour Brexiteer, referred to her absent friends as she spoke in favour of leaving the customs union.“I feel a little alone today,” she said.Instead of risking defeat on a non-binding motion, government whips told their MPs to abstain on the vote and to feel free to take the afternoon off. It’s a technique they have used a number of times in response to opposition motions since Theresa May lost her parliamentary majority last year, and it annoys the Speaker but saves the government’s blushes.On its own, Thursday’s vote changed nothing, but the debate will have alarmed the whips as they watched hitherto shy Tory rebels speak up in favour of the customs union. Ten Conservatives have already put their names to a pro-customs union amendment to a Bill next month, and Thursday’s debate suggested that more could join them – possibly enough to ensure the government’s defeat.May reassured Eurosceptic backbenchers this week that she remains committed to leaving the customs union, a red line she laid down in her first Conservative conference speech as leader in October 2016. She repeated the pledge in her Lancaster House speech in January 2017 and it has survived each major iteration of her government’s Brexit policy. The backbenchers said they were reassured by the prime minister’s latest renewal of the vow, and Jacob Rees-Mogg said this week that it would be political suicide for a Conservative government to agree to remain in a customs union.\u0026nbspMay’s problem is that she has promised to keep trade as frictionless as possible, partly because of the impact on British industry of any friction in the EU-wide supply chains used by big manufacturers. She has also promised to avoid a hard border in Ireland and ruled out any new trade barrier between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.The EU has rejected both of May’s customs proposals, and many in her own government are contemptuous of the option she is believed to favour – a customs partnership that would mean Britain collecting tariffs on behalf of the EU on imports destined for the European market.The second option, a customs arrangement now known as maximum facilitation or “maxfac”, would use technology and trusted trader schemes to make customs controls less intrusive and time-consuming.Brexiteers are suspicious of the customs partnership, which they fear could be adapted into a customs union in all but name. Under one scenario, Britain could agree to adopt a common external tariff with the EU for manufactured goods only. Services, which account for 80 per cent of the British economy, are not covered by the customs union, but new potential trade partners would probably want access to the British market for their agricultural exports.The island of Ireland is already treated as a single territory for phytosanitary standards, and passengers flying into Belfast from London often remark on agricultural hygiene notices at the airport. The DUP insists that Northern Ireland must not be treated differently from the rest of the UK in matters of trade after Brexit.But could they be persuaded to accept an arrangement that is close to the status quo on agriculture? And if not, how plausible is their threat to topple the Conservative government?Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, it is difficult to trigger a general election if the government doesn’t want one – and it is safe to assume that May is in no rush to reacquaint herself with the electorate. If May loses a confidence vote in Parliament, Jeremy Corbyn would have a chance to try to form a government before an election is called.Next week’s local elections could be almost as important as events in Parliament in determining the behaviour of Conservative MPs over Brexit. If Labour has its biggest victory in London for almost half a century, as polls predict, Conservative backbenchers may find unpalatable compromises on Brexit a little easier to swallow.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3475759.1524772343!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"may under mounting pressure to keep britain in customs union","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritain’s home secretary Amber Rudd  in the House of Commons  in London on Thursday. Photograph: Getty ImagesTheresa May was under mounting pressure last night to keep Britain in a customs union with the European Union after Conservative rebels joined opposition MPs to call for a change in her government’s policy. MPs backed a non-binding motion in favour of a customs union, with Conservatives abstaining to avoid a vote.Ten Conservatives have already signed a binding amendment to a trade Bill next month that would oblige Britain to remain in a customs union. Other Conservatives spoke in favour of last night’s motion, suggesting that the rebels could defeat the government next month.The prime minister this week restated her determination to leave the customs union and the single market when Britain leaves the EU. But MPs warned that her pledge was incompatible with promises to keep trade frictionless and avoid the return of a hard border.Labour’s Yvette Cooper warned that any new infrastructure on the Border, including cameras, represented a potential threat to peace in Northern Ireland.“The concern relates to what happens around the Border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, and the introduction of new infrastructure at that Border, especially such symbolic infrastructure, and especially anything that would increase the sense of there being targets for dissident organisations. We do not want them to become more active and have more to focus on,” she said.Antrim-born Kate Hoey, one of a small number of Labour MPs who backed Brexit, said that nobody was talking about a return to large, intrusive border structures but the issue of the Border was being used in an attempt to thwart Brexit. She criticised Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and said the Government ought to be helping Britain to achieve a good deal that would also benefit Ireland.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“Varadkar and the Irish Government should get in there and use their position to get the European Union to see some common sense. Such a small proportion of total European Union trade relates to the Republic of Ireland, yet the Irish Government have got into a position where it is their country that the European Union is listening to,” she said.Earlier, Downing Street issued a sharp correction after home secretary Amber Rudd appeared to cast doubt on the government’s determination to leave the customs union. Answering questions from journalists at Westminster, Ms Rudd said she would “not be drawn” on whether Britain could still be in a customs union after Brexit.“We still have a few discussions to be had in a really positive, consensual and easy way among some of my cabinet colleagues in order to arrive at a final position,” she said.After Downing Street insisted that the government’s position had not changed, Ms Rudd tweeted her own clarification:\u0026nbsp“Of course when we leave the EU we will be leaving the customs union.”The House of Lords last week backed an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill calling on the government to explore the option of remaining in a customs union with the EU.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph launches next phase words chosen brand campaign","story":"The  has launched the second phase of the Words Chosen Well brand campaign which aims to showcase its award-winning quality journalism and raise brand awareness.The campaign started with a new television advert debuted during the commercial break of Channel 4’s Gogglebox on Friday 20th April. Created by adam\u0026ampeveDDB  in collaboration with The ’s in-house marketing and creative teams, it builds on the success of last year’s campaign with a bigger and bolder creative that utilises important cultural references and leans on some of the most emotive and impactful events of our times, highlighting iconic moments when words have been considered and chosen well.The ’s new campaign seeks to demonstrate the influence and importance of the spoken and written word, and the role that quality journalism plays in providing news, insight and analysis.

In practice, this means the infection is resistant to all commonly used antibiotics.The figures have emerged as Lord O\u0027Neill, the former Goldman Sachs banker who led a government-commissioned review into superbugs, accuses senior ministers of a lack of leadership on the issue. Lord O’Neill, former commercial secretary to the Treasury, said the Prime Minister, Theresa May, had allowed the issue to fade and that actions promised had not been taken.Lord O\u0026#39Neill has urged senior ministers to do more to tackle the threat of superbugs“It is disappointing to see that the UK government’s global and national efforts to fight AMR seem to have faded,\u0026quot he saidWriting exclusively for the  Lord O’Neill said that the UK was once seen as a leader in the field but that May had allowed the issue to slide.“The government should put this part of \u0027global Britain\u0027 back at the top of its priorities,” he writes. “There has been a lot of talk, but no action.\u0026quotLord O’Neill’s review warned that if left unchecked antibiotic resistance would kill 10 million people and the world economy could lose up to $100 trillion by 2050.Antibiotic resistance | The true cost in Britain and around the worldOfficial figures suggest antimicrobial resistance claims the lives of 5,000 people a year in the UK, though experts have argued the real figure is at least double that. Getting global figures on the problem is difficult but reliable estimates suggest 700,000 are already dying each year – one person a minute.Lord O’Neill also attacked the major pharmaceutical companies for doing little to counter the problem, despite signing up to the Davos Declaration in 2015, where they pledged to combat the threat.He wrote: “Since then, no major pharmaceutical company has taken any fresh action.”Lord O’Neill said that since investigating the issue the number of reports of antibiotic resistance was rising faster and “in more places than we ever dreamt of.”.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}There has been a lot of talk, but no action.Lord O\u0026#x27NeillIn addition to the ‘super gonorrhoea’ case the PHE figures, obtained under a Freedom of Information request, show 29 people suffered from pan-drug-resistant-infections from Pseudomonas bacteria.Pseudomonas is a bug often found in soil or water (hospital sinks are tested for it) that usually affects people with a weaker immune system such as cancer patients, newborn babies, people with diabetes or patients with severe burns.Up to 11 per cent of Pseudomonas bacteria are now resistant to ciprofloxacin, an antibiotic commonly used in combination with others.A further six patients suffered pan-drug-resistant Klebsiella infections. New antibiotics to treat multi-drug-resistant Klebsiella infections were introduced last year in light of rising resistance, said Professor Peter Hawkey, a public health and bacteriology expert at the University of Birmingham. \u0026quotBut they don’t work against every strain,\u0026quot he said.Antibiotic resistance | Global consumption fuels spread of superbugsProf Hawkey added that the cases show antimicrobial resistance is not a hypothetical or future threat but a real one currently affecting patients in British hospitals.\u0026quotThese are organisms which are resistant to most antibiotics and then you’re in a tricky place,\u0026quot he said. \u0026quotThe threat is very real. These figures are a wake up call,” he said.The pan-resistant infections recorded by PHE were from gram negative bacteria: rod-shaped bugs with thinner cell walls than their gram positive counterparts.Gram negative bacteria, some of which live in the human gut, are fast becoming resistant to antibiotics and are known as an emerging global threat. The government aims to halve the number of healthcare-associated gram-negative bloodstream infections by 2021.Prof Hawkey said pan-drug-resistant-infections are much more common in other areas of the world with lax surveillance and poor infection control, and these will spread to Britain.He said: \u0026quotWith huge movement in populations people are coming back to the UK with these bugs in their guts. If you get it and you’re given the wrong antibiotic, you will die.\u0026quotDr Susan Hopkins, deputy director for AMR and healthcare acquired infections at Public Health England, said: “While there is only a small number of bacteria identified that were resistant to a number of treatments in recent years, they serve as an example of the threat antibiotic resistance poses to public health.\u0026quotMadlen Davies is a reporter with the Bureau of Investigative JournalismProtect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Bill Gates launches hunt for holy grail in flu fightKhalifa Haftar makes triumphant return to Libya after rumours of his deathTeenager Natalie Cormack falls to her death from Magaluf balconyBarn conversions pushing bats into churches, bishop says Prince Louis is named after his grandfather and great-grandfather\u0026#39s mentor, Lord Louis MountbattenGrim down south: Southern England could become wetter than the North and Scotland, Met Office saysUK \u0026#39better off abandoning Brexit\u0026#39 if May fails to leave customs unionWhy women prefer to marry men with a strong hand gripRelatives of Hither Green burglar Henry Vincent jailed for conning elderly man out of £6kInside the Korea summit: the hidden meanings behind a carefully choreographed display of unityPhone and broadband users to receive alerts when their contracts endComment: ‘You have a new memory’ – is digital amnesia ruining our holidays?What\u0026#39s in a name?

As a result, the Museum believes that the image breaches the competition rules, which state that ‘entries must not deceive the viewer or attempt to misrepresent the reality of nature’.”The museum called on five experts - two of its own mammals experts and a taxidermy specialist, and an external South American mammals expert and anteater researcher.“Evidence examined included high resolution photographs of a taxidermy anteater that is kept on open display at a visitor centre at the Portão do Bandeira gate, one of the entrances of the Emas National Park - the large park where The night raider was taken.The anteater in the awarded image was compared to the taxidermy anteater in the photographs received by the Museum.Animals found in strange places“The five scientists, working independently of each other, all concluded there are elements of the animal\u0027s posture, morphology, raised tufts of fur and patterns on the neck and head that are too similar for the images to show two different animals. The experts would have expected some variation between two iniduals of the same species.“The Museum also considered the responses to questions put to the photographer Marcio Cabral, who cooperated fully in the investigation, and who supplied RAW image files which were taken before and after the winning shot was taken, none of which included the anteater.“Mr Cabral did provide an explanation as to why he had no other images of the anteater. He also provided a witness who claims he saw the live anteater. Mr Cabral strongly denies that the anteater in the image is a taxidermy specimen.”Mr Cabral, a professional photographer based in Brasilia, said: “\u0026quotUnfortunately, I do not have another image of the animal because it is a long exposure of 30 seconds and ISO 5000.\u0026quotAfter the flashes were fired, the animal left the place, so it was not possible to make another photo with the animal coming out of the place that is totally dark.”In his original citation, Mr Cabral said he was setting up a photograph of bioluminescent click beetles on the termite mount when the anteater wandered into shot as a “surprise bonus”.Bill Gates launches hunt for holy grail in flu fightKhalifa Haftar makes triumphant return to Libya after rumours of his deathTeenager Natalie Cormack falls to her death from Magaluf balconyBarn conversions pushing bats into churches, bishop says Prince Louis is named after his grandfather and great-grandfather\u0026#39s mentor, Lord Louis MountbattenGrim down south: Southern England could become wetter than the North and Scotland, Met Office saysUK \u0026#39better off abandoning Brexit\u0026#39 if May fails to leave customs unionWhy women prefer to marry men with a strong hand gripRelatives of Hither Green burglar Henry Vincent jailed for conning elderly man out of £6kInside the Korea summit: the hidden meanings behind a carefully choreographed display of unityPhone and broadband users to receive alerts when their contracts endComment: ‘You have a new memory’ – is digital amnesia ruining our holidays?What\u0026#39s in a name?

Rohan Deb Roy says we must rethink research and practice to escape this dark pastSir Ronald Ross had just returned from an expedition to Sierra Leone. The British doctor had been leading efforts to tackle the malaria that so often killed English colonists in the country, and in December 1899 he gave a lecture to the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce about his experience. In the words of a contemporary report, he argued that “in the coming century, the success of imperialism will depend largely upon success with the microscope”.Teenage vandals sentenced by judge to read history booksRoss, who won the Nobel Prize for Medicine for his malaria research, would later deny he was talking specifically about his own work. But his point neatly summarised how the efforts of British scientists was intertwined with their country’s attempt to conquer a quarter of the world.Ross was very much a child of empire, born in India and later working there as a surgeon in the imperial army. So when he used a microscope to identify how a dreaded tropical disease was transmitted, he would have realised that his discovery promised to safeguard the health of British troops and officials in the tropics. In turn, this would enable Britain to expand and consolidate its colonial rule.Ronald Ross at his lab in 1898 Calcutta (Welcome Collection)Ross’s words also suggest how science was used to argue imperialism was morally justified because it reflected British goodwill towards colonised people. It implied that scientific insights could be redeployed to promote superior health, hygiene and sanitation among colonial subjects. Empire was seen as a benevolent, selfless project. As Ross’s fellow Nobel laureate Rudyard Kipling described it, it was the “white man’s burden” to introduce modernity and civilised governance in the colonies.But science at this time was more than just a practical or ideological tool when it came to empire. Since its birth around the same time as Europeans began conquering other parts of the world, modern Western science was inextricably entangled with colonialism, especially British imperialism. And the legacy of that colonialism still pervades science today.As a result, recent years have seen an increasing number of calls to “decolonise science”, even going so far as to advocate scrapping the practice and findings of modern science altogether. Tackling the lingering influence of colonialism in science is much needed. But there are also dangers that the more extreme attempts to do so could play into the hands of religious fundamentalists and ultra-nationalists. We must find a way to remove the inequalities promoted by modern science while making sure its huge potential benefits work for everyone, instead of letting it become a tool for oppression.When a slave in an early 18th-century Jamaican plantation was found with a supposedly poisonous plant, his European overlords showed him no mercy. Suspected of conspiring to cause disorder on the plantation, he was treated with typical harshness and hanged to death. The historical records don’t even mention his name. His execution might also have been forgotten forever if it weren\u0027t for the scientific enquiry that followed. Europeans on the plantation became curious about the plant and, building on the slave’s “accidental finding”, they eventually concluded it wasn’t poisonous at all.Instead it became known as a cure for worms, warts, ringworm, freckles and cold swellings, with the name Apocynum erectum. As the historian Pratik Chakrabarti argues in a recent book, this incident serves as a neat example of how, under European political and commercial domination, gathering knowledge about nature could take place simultaneously with exploitation.For imperialists and their modern apologists, science and medicine were among the gracious gifts from the European empires to the colonial world. What’s more, the 19th-century imperial ideologues saw the scientific successes of the West as a way to allege that non-Europeans were intellectually inferior and so deserved and needed to be colonised.A racist caricature of European scientists visiting Africa. The severed head on the right is that of Ronald Ross (Welcome Collection)In the incredibly influential 1835 memo Minute on Indian Education, British politician Thomas Macaulay denounced Indian languages partially because they lacked scientific words. He suggested that languages such as Sanskrit and Arabic were “barren of useful knowledge”, “fruitful of monstrous superstitions” and contained “false history, false astronomy, false medicine”.Such opinions weren’t confined to colonial officials and imperial ideologues and were often shared by various representatives of the scientific profession. The prominent Victorian scientist Sir Francis Galton argued that the “the average intellectual standard of the negro race is some two grades below our own (the Anglo Saxon)”. Even Charles Darwin implied that “savage races” such as “the negro or the Australian” were closer to gorillas than were white Caucasians.Yet 19th-century British science was itself built upon a global repertoire of wisdom, information, and living and material specimens collected from various corners of the colonial world. Extracting raw materials from colonial mines and plantations went hand in hand with extracting scientific information and specimens from colonised people.Leading public scientific institutions in imperial Britain, such as the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew and the British Museum, as well as ethnographic displays of “exotic” humans, relied on a global network of colonial collectors and go-betweens. By 1857, the East India Company’s London zoological museum boasted insect specimens from across the colonial world, including from Ceylon, India, Java and Nepal.The scientists who used this evidence were rarely sedentary geniuses working in laboratories insulated from imperial politics and economics. The likes of Charles Darwin on the Beagle and botanist Sir Joseph Banks on the Endeavour literally rode on the voyages of British exploration and conquest that enabled imperialism.Sir Hans Sloane’s imperial collection started the British Museum (Paul HudsonWikipedia)Other scientific careers were directly driven by imperial achievements and needs. Early anthropological work in British India, such as Sir Herbert Hope Risley’s Tribes and Castes of Bengal, published in 1891, drew upon massive administrative classifications of the colonised population.Map-making operations including the work of the Great Trigonometrical Survey in South Asia came from the need to cross colonial landscapes for trade and military campaigns. The geological surveys commissioned around the world by Sir Roderick Murchison were linked with intelligence gathering on minerals and local politics.Efforts to curb epidemic diseases such as plague, smallpox and cholera led to attempts to discipline the routines, diets and movements of colonial subjects. This opened up a political process that the historian David Arnold has termed the “colonisation of the body”. By controlling people as well as countries, the authorities turned medicine into a weapon with which to secure imperial rule.New technologies were also put to use expanding and consolidating the empire. Photographs were used for creating physical and racial stereotypes of different groups of colonised people. Steamboats were crucial in the colonial exploration of Africa in the mid-19th century. Aircraft enabled the British to surveil and then bomb rebellions in 20th-century Iraq. The innovation of wireless radio in the 1890s was shaped by Britain’s need for discreet, long-distance communication during the South African war.In these ways and more, Europe’s leaps in science and technology during this period both drove and were driven by its political and economic domination of the rest of the world. Modern science was effectively built on a system that exploited millions of people. At the same time it helped justify and sustain that exploitation, in ways that hugely influenced how Europeans saw other races and countries. What’s more, colonial legacies continue to shape trends in science today.Imperialist Cecil Rhodes planned a railway and telegraph line to connect Africa (Alamy)Since the formal end of colonialism, we have become better at recognising how scientific expertise has come from many different countries and ethnicities. Yet former imperial nations still appear almost self-evidently superior to most of the once-colonised countries when it comes to scientific study. The empires may have virtually disappeared, but the cultural biases and disadvantages they imposed have not.How to fix all of your sleep problems with scienceYou just have to look at the statistics on the way research is carried out globally to see how the scientific hierarchy created by colonialism continues. The annual rankings of universities are published mostly by the Western world and tend to favour its own institutions. Academic journals across the different branches of science are mostly dominated by the US and Western Europe.It is unlikely that anyone who wishes to be taken seriously today would explain this data in terms of innate intellectual superiority determined by race. The blatant scientific racism of the 19th century has now given way to the notion that excellence in science and technology are a euphemism for significant funding, infrastructure and economic development.Because of this, most of Asia, Africa and the Caribbean is seen either as playing catch-up with the developed world or as dependent on its scientific expertise and financial aid. Some academics have identified these trends as evidence of the persisting “intellectual domination of the West” and labelled them a form of “neo-colonialism”.Not all international collaborations are equal (US Army AfricaFlickr)Various well-meaning efforts to bridge this gap have struggled to go beyond the legacies of colonialism. For example, scientific collaboration between countries can be a fruitful way of sharing skills and knowledge, and learning from the intellectual insights of one another. But when an economically weaker part of the world collaborates almost exclusively with very strong scientific partners, it can take the form of dependence, if not subordination.A 2009 study showed that about 80 per cent of Central Africa’s research papers were produced with collaborators based outside the region. With the exception of Rwanda, each of the African countries principally collaborated with its former coloniser. As a result, these dominant collaborators shaped scientific work in the region. They prioritised research on immediate local health-related issues, particularly infectious and tropical diseases, rather than encouraging local scientists to also pursue the fuller range of topics pursued in the West.In the same study, 60 per cent to 70 per cent of the scientists based in developed countries did not acknowledge their collaborators in poorer countries as co-authors in their papers. This is despite the fact they later claimed in the survey that the papers were the result of close collaborations.International health charities, which are dominated by Western countries, have faced similar issues. After the formal end of colonial rule, global health workers long appeared to represent a superior scientific culture in an alien environment. Unsurprisingly, interactions between these skilled and dedicated foreign personnel and the local population have often been characterised by mistrust.For example, during the smallpox eradication campaigns of the 1970s and the polio campaign of past two decades, the World Health Organization’s representatives found it quite challenging to mobilise willing participants and volunteers in the interiors of South Asia. On occasions they even saw resistance on religious grounds from local people. But their stringent responses, which included the close surveillance of villages, cash incentives for identifying concealed cases and house-to-house searches, added to this climate of mutual suspicion. These experiences of mistrust are reminiscent of those created by strict colonial policies of plague control.Polio eradication needs willing volunteers (Department for International DevelopmentFlickr)Western pharmaceutical firms also play a role by carrying out questionable clinical trials in the developing world where, as journalist Sonia Shah puts it, “ethical oversight is minimal and desperate patients abound”. This raises moral questions about whether multinational corporations misuse the economic weaknesses of once-colonised countries in the interests of scientific and medical research.The colonial image of science as a domain of the white man even continues to shape contemporary scientific practice in developed countries. People from ethnic minorities are underrepresented in science and engineering jobs and more likely to face discrimination and other barriers to career progress.To finally leave behind the baggage of colonialism, scientific collaborations need to become more symmetrical and founded on greater degrees of mutual respect. We need to decolonise science by recognising the true achievements and potential of scientists from outside the Western world. Yet while this structural change is necessary, the path to decolonisation has dangers of its own.In October 2016, a YouTube video of students discussing the decolonisation of science went surprisingly viral. The clip, which has been watched more than 1m times, shows a student from the University of Cape Town arguing that science as a whole should be scrapped and started again in a way that accommodates non-Western perspectives and experiences. The student’s point that science cannot explain so-called black magic earned the argument much derision and mockery. But you only have to look at the racist and ignorant comments left beneath the video to see why the topic is so in need of discussion.Inspired by the recent “Rhodes Must Fall” campaign against the university legacy of the imperialist Cecil Rhodes, the Cape Town students became associated with the phrase “science must fall”. While it may be interestingly provocative, this slogan isn’t helpful at a time when government policies in a range of countries including the US, UK and India are already threatening to impose major limits on science research funding.More alarmingly, the phrase also runs the risk of being used by religious fundamentalists and cynical politicians in their arguments against established scientific theories such as climate change. This is a time when the integrity of experts is under fire and science is the target of political manoeuvring. So polemically rejecting the subject altogether only plays into the hands of those who have no interest in decolonisation.Alongside its imperial history, science has also inspired many people in the former colonial world to demonstrate remarkable courage, critical thinking and dissent in the face of established beliefs and conservative traditions. These include the Indian anti-caste activist Rohith Vemula and the murdered atheist authors Narendra Dabholkar and Avijit Roy. Demanding that “science must fall” fails to do justice to this legacy.The call to decolonise science, as in the case of other disciplines such as literature, can encourage us to rethink the dominant image that scientific knowledge is the work of white men. But this much-needed critique of the scientific canon carries the other danger of inspiring alternative national narratives in post-colonial countries.A campaigner during a March for Science protest in Melbourne (Wikipedia Commons )For example, some Indian nationalists, including the country’s current prime minister, Narendra Modi, have emphasised the scientific glories of an ancient Hindu civilisation. They argue that plastic surgery, genetic science, aeroplanes and stem cell technology were in vogue in India thousands of years ago. These claims are not just a problem because they are factually inaccurate. Misusing science to stoke a sense of nationalist pride can easily feed into jingoism.Meanwhile, various forms of modern science and their potential benefits have been rejected as unpatriotic. In 2016, a senior Indian government official even went so far as to claim that “doctors prescribing non-Ayurvedic medicines are anti-national”.Attempts to decolonise science need to contest jingoistic claims of cultural superiority, whether they come from European imperial ideologues or the current representatives of post-colonial governments. This is where new trends in the history of science can be helpful.For example, instead of the parochial understanding of science as the work of lone geniuses, we could insist on a more cosmopolitan model. This would recognise how different networks of people have often worked together in scientific projects and the cultural exchanges that helped them – even if those exchanges were unequal and exploitative.But if scientists and historians are serious about “decolonising science” in this way, they need to do much more to present the culturally erse and global origins of science to a wider, non-specialist audience. For example, we need to make sure this decolonised story of the development of science makes its way into schools.Students should also be taught how empires affected the development of science and how scientific knowledge was reinforced, used and sometimes resisted by colonised people. We should encourage budding scientists to question whether science has done enough to dispel modern prejudices based on concepts of race, gender, class and nationality.Schools need to teach the non-Western history of science (Wikipedia Commons)Decolonising science will also involve encouraging Western institutions that hold imperial scientific collections to reflect more on the violent political contexts of war and colonisation in which these items were acquired. An obvious step forward would be to discuss repatriating scientific specimens to former colonies, as botanists working on plants originally from Angola but held primarily in Europe have done. If repatriation isn’t possible, then co-ownership or priority access for academics from post-colonial countries should at least be considered.This is also an opportunity for the broader scientific community to critically reflect on its own profession. Doing so will inspire scientists to think more about the political contexts that have kept their work going and about how changing them could benefit the scientific profession around the world. It should spark conversations between the sciences and other disciplines about their shared colonial past and how to address the issues it creates.Rohan Deb Roy is a lecturer in South Asian history at the University of Reading. theconversationor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship“We are going after the money,” Boris Johnson promised after being questioned on the absence of specific measures to impose sanctions and financial penalties on the UK assets of Russian oligarchs closely aligned to President Putin. But when pressed by MPs on why decisive action was not being taken, the foreign secretary replied: “This is not a country where we in the government can say ‘Oi! We think this so-and-so deserves to have his or her collar felt’. This is not how it works.” While Theresa May may yet impose sanctions against Putin-supporting billionaires in response to the attempted murder of the Russian spy Sergei Skripal, her government’s track record has been marred by procrastination and prevarication.   Privately, the prime minister regards the exploitation of London as a haven for dirty Russian money as a serious problem. She once listened in stunned silence as a senior MI6 officer briefed her on the activities of Russian organised crime and certain oligarchs in the UK. And in 2016 she authorised the National Security Council to review why and how wealthy Russians buy property in London. But she has been nervous about taking action. For the past three years she has dithered on implementing a legally-enforceable register that will force all foreign companies that own UK property to disclose the identity of their owners.Russia claims Skripals poisoned using toxin possessed by UK and USRussia has been spying on the Skripals for at least five years- UKRussia stock market crashes after US imposes sanctions on oligarchsFreezing property assets is the key to inflicting pain on the Russian state and its compliant plutocrats. Since 2004, £190m of UK property has been subject to criminal investigation as suspected proceeds of corruption. The London property market has been skewed by laundered money, as The Independent revealed exclusively in 2014. Prices are being artificially driven up by wealthy, influential, foreign men who want to hide their assets in the UK.Multi-million pound payments are accepted without their origin being questioned. Oligarchs hide ownership behind anonymous shell companies registered in secretive jurisdictions while a London address offers a veneer of legitimacy and prestige that helps launder reputations as well as cash. Transparency International estimates that Russians account for £729m of the £4.4bn acquired in UK property via what it regards as “suspicious wealth”.There is no suggestion that all London property bought by Russian oligarchs is derived from illegal or criminal sources. For some Russian plutocrats buying luxury property in London is a symbol that they have been accepted by the British establishment. This is illustrated by the eleven bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square that Oleg Deripaska, regarded as one of Putin’s favourite oligarchs, snapped up for £17m through an offshore company registered in the British Virgin Islands in 2003 and now worth £45m.Oleg Deripaska’s 11-bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square is seen as a symbol of acceptance by the British establishment (Alamy)Built in the 1820s, it was formerly the home of Sir Henry “Chips” Channon, society host, Conservative MP and notoriously indiscreet diarist. It was designed for entertaining royalty and diplomats with its grand staircase, Madame Récamier sofas and flamboyant decor. When Harold Nicolson arrived at the house for dinner, he exclaimed: “Oh my God, how rich and powerful Lord Channon has become.” The equally grand and historic mansion Beechwood House, set in 11 acres of land in Highgate, north London, was bought by the powerful oligarch Alisher Usmanov in 2008 for £48m from the Emir of Qatar. Usmanov is a major shareholder in Arsenal football club and has amassed a £14bn fortune from metals and commodities and has long been regarded as a pro-Putin figure. And his fellow football-loving oligarch Roman Abramovich owns houses on Kensington Palace Gardens and Chester Square, Belgravia, and apartments on Eaton Square and Manresa Road, Chelsea.  One Hyde Park, one of the wealthiest residencies in the world, was famously bought up by Russian oligarchs (Alamy)It is not just prestigious houses that attract Russian billionaires. The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return for their cash, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship.  Since 2008 iniduals have been able to obtain “golden visas” if they invest as little as £2m in a UK business. And for £5m, they gain the right to become a UK resident on a temporary basis and then, after five years, a British citizen. By 2014, almost 700 rich Russians had paid for entry using this method, with Roman Rotenberg, son of Putin’s former judo partner Boris Rotenberg, being the most prominent example. He owns a mews house on Cadogan Lane in Belgravia.The government is taking some action to stop London becoming what David Cameron described as a haven to hide “dodgy foreign cash”. The National Crime Agency (NCA) is investigating a list of wealthy iniduals, not just oligarchs, to assess if they have used the UK to launder their fortunes.An estimated 149 iniduals are restricted on their travel and ability to conduct business in the UK. And the Unexplained Wealth Orders is now law, whereby the NCA can demand that the oligarch explain the origin of his wealth. But the problem with this order, according to a Russian businessman, is that the inidual in question could too easily lie about his source of wealth and instead produce a document that shows his fortune was based on, for example, share idends. Roman Rotenberg gained entry to the UK using the ‘golden visas’ method (Getty)Boris Johnson protests that the government cannot act directly against the pro-Putin brigade because it cannot interfere in criminal investigations. But it could make specific changes to the law, notably an amendment to the Sanctions and Money Laundering Bill, which would give Magnitsky-type powers to freeze the UK assets of relevant iniduals, including intelligence agents or other officials who have abused human rights.  The government could also implement the register of inidual owners of foreign and offshore companies that own UK property. But that bill has been delayed until 2021 and campaigners smell a cover-up after the government announced that one reason for the delay is that the Business Department has commissioned research on the impact of the register on investment decisions. “This is a crucial moment for the UK’s future trading relationship with the rest of the world, and we must proceed with as good an understanding as possible of the potential impacts on legitimate inward investment,” said foreign office minister Lord Ahmad. Skripal attack aftermath – in picturesSkripal attack aftermath – in picturesInvestigators in protective clothing remove a van from an address in Winterslow near Salisbury in Wiltshire, as police and members of the armed forces continue to investigate the suspected nerve agent attack on Russian double agent Sergei SkripaA police officer on duty near the protective tent which covers the bench where a man and woman were apparently poisoned with what was later identified as a nerve agent, in SalisburyMilitary in protective clothing prior to removing vehicles from a car park in SalisburyPersonnel in protective coveralls and breathing equipment cover an ambulance with a tarpaulin at the Salisbury District HospitalHome Secretary Amber Rudd visits the scene of the nerve agent attack in SalibsuryMembers of the emergency services in hazard suits fix the tent over the bench where Sergei and Yulia Skripal were foundOfficials in protective suits check their equipment before repositioning a forensics tent A poice officer stands guard outside a branch of the Italian chain restaurant ZizziDetective Sergeant Nick Bailey, who assisted the Russian ex-spy targeted with a nerve agent, was also hospitalisedSergei Skripal days before he was exposed to a mystery substance that has left him fighting for lifeSergei Skripal speaks to his lawyer from behind bars seen on a screen of a monitor outside a courtroom in Moscow.Yulia Skripal, who is thought to have been poisoned along with her father, Sergei SkripalProgress to legislation has thus been painfully slow. An insight into why political rhetoric has not resulted in legislative action can be gleaned by the recent flotation on the London stock exchange of the Russian energy company En+, then owned by Deripaska and chaired by former Conservative energy minister Lord Barker. For it revealed a fundamental dispute between MI6 and the financial regulators on how to make oligarchs who park their assets in London more accountable and transparent.MI6 and the prime minister’s national security advisor, Sir Mark Sedwill, were furious with the Stock Exchange and Financial Conduct Authority for failing to consult them and conduct the required due diligence of En+. Their main concern was about whether Rusal, a subsidiary of En+, had been manufacturing aluminium powder used by Russian arms firms for military purposes. Rusal adamantly denied it – yet its own website previously indicated that the defence industry was among the users of the type of aluminium powder it manufactured.Sir Mark Sedwill was furious when the required due diligence of En+ was not carried out ahead of its flotation on the London stock exchange (Getty)The En+ group could be a candidate for new sanctions as the Russian state-owned VTB Bank is a major shareholder with a 4.35 per cent holding, while Deripaska is known for being close to the Russian President. Leaked US diplomatic cables described Deripaska as “among the two to three oligarchs Putin turns to on a regular basis” and is “a more-or-less permanent fixture on Putin’s trips abroad”.Indeed, when the US imposed sanctions on seven oligarchs and the 12 companies they own or control last week, shares tumbled. Deripaska was among those affected, as was Rotenberg.  Still, Britiain cannot follow suit. And the anger of National Security officials and MI6 En+\u0027s flotation last year stemmed precisely from their belief that it typified the complacent approach to Russian money in London, which the infamous oligarch Boris Berezovsky once told me was “70 per cent dirty”. The inability to impose sanctions is similarly emblematic.The London Stock Exchange has long been a vehicle for Russian companies and oligarchs to raise money in shares and bonds – an estimated $200bn (£140bn) since 2004. Last summer, Russia’s largest gold producer Polyus, controlled by Suleyman Kerimov, a Russian senator awarded the Order of Merit by Putin, raised $879m. There are now 57 predominantly-Russian companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, more than anywhere else outside Moscow.   The wealthiest Russian oligarchs who call London homeA little-noticed loophole to avoid sanctions is that Russian sovereign debt is permitted to be sold in London. “We are allowing Russian sovereign debt to be sold in the UK and that debt is being used to reimburse Russians to bring back their money onshore in Moscow terms,” said the Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. “As that gold is moving towards Moscow, we are quite extraordinarily enabling those bond and debt auctions...This is one of those areas where sanctions on businesses are being compensated by the Russian state.”Just hours after Theresa May’s retaliation against the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, Gazprom issued a $750m eurobond in London and the following day the Russian government joined in by issuing a $4bn bond in the capital. Within hours, the Russian Embassy issued a revealing tweet: “Business as usual?”Could the nerve-agent attack in Salisbury be the unwitting catalyst for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London? (Getty)But the irony is that it is the attempted assassination of a Russian spy and double agent living in Salisbury and the murder of Russian businessman Nikolai Glushkov in Surrey that could be the unwitting catalysts for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London.Mark Hollingsworth is the author of “Londongrad – From Russia with Cash’’ or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Colin Drury delves into the inside story of the battle to save 17,500 trees being felled in a single cityJenny Hockey still shivers when she remembers the moment, almost 18 months ago, she was woken by police hammering at her door. It was 5am. When she looked outside, she momentarily wondered if a terror incident was unfolding.“It was that kind of scene,” the 71-year-old says. “Multiple cars, officers swarming everywhere, flashing lights. We had no idea what was happening.”It was 17 November 2016 and, under the cover of darkness, officers from South Yorkshire Police had descended on Sheffield’s Rustlings Road, one of the city’s most sought-after addresses. Cordoning off the street and banging on doors, they ordered residents to get dressed and move their vehicles or have them towed away. Within the hour, Hockey, a retired sociology professor, would become one of three neighbours arrested and locked up for eight hours.227-year-old tree planted by George Washington pulled down by windBut this dramatic pre-dawn raid – described by Nick Clegg, then the local MP, as like something “you’d expect in Putin’s Russia” – was not carried out in search of terrorists or criminals.Rather, it was in support of council contractors hired to chop down eight street trees, which residents had spent more than a year petitioning to save.Amid the confusion, Hockey and two others – including another woman in her seventies – attempted to stand under one of these century-old limes, only to be detained. All charges were later dropped.“We wanted to protect something we loved,” she says. “And our right to do that – our democratic right – was taken away, really, by state force. It was so horrible and disempowering.”Indeed, by the time the trio were freed, the trees which had always overlooked their homes were no more.Contractors cut down the final tree in Rustlings Road (PA)Yet a bigger battle was just beginning: one which has since spread across the city, seen mass protests and riot police on suburban streets, and ultimately revealed an astonishing secret plan – hidden within a £2.2bn PFI contract – to cut down almost 20,000 street trees…Sheffield has long boasted of being Europe’s greenest city – in part because a third of it sits in the Peak District. But it is also due to the sheer number of trees that line the roads. Some 36,000 of them arch over highways and footpaths.But around 2015, talk of what the Woodland Trust called a “tree massacre” started to emerge.Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a highways improvement scheme  (PA)The eight limes in Rustlings Road were not the only ones marked for the chainsaw. Under then-redacted clauses in a £2.2bn contract, Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a vast highways improvement scheme being undertaken by the infrastructure giant Amey.Company and council both said – and still say – such felling was necessary. Targeted trees, they argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing irreparable damage to roads and footpaths. Every one taken down, they added, was being substituted with a younger sapling: “We assess every single tree and only replace them as a last resort,” says Darren Butt, account director with Amey, today.Targeted trees, the council argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing damage to roads and footpaths (Sheffield Tree Action Group)Yet, as this felling increased, questions started to be asked. There was shock when two cherries commemorating Second World War heroes disappeared one day. At Christmas, a row decorated with charity festive lights were hacked back – with fellers cutting through wires and all.A feeling spread that perfectly healthy and safe trees were being chopped unnecessarily. A suspicion grew that the policy was actually about increasing Amey’s profit margins. Over the length of the company’s 25-year highway maintenance obligations, so ran the theory, a newly planted sapling is far cheaper to look after than older, larger arboreta.“People were going to work in the morning and coming home to entirely different-looking streets,” says Paul Selby, a city resident and leading member of Sheffield Tree Action Groups, known as Stag. “It was ecological destruction carried out, in secret, by a multinational company with the explicit support of the local authority and the police.“And people were angry. These trees were part of their lives and they didn’t want them taking. These weren’t anarchists or hardline activists from other towns. They’re Sheffielders furious they hadn’t been given a voice in what was happening in their streets. So they came out and fought to be heard.”Almost 6,000 trees have been chopped down. But in the face of overwhelming and increasingly nationalised pressure, a pause on felling was announced last week.Sheffield City Council has put this down to the “dangerous tactics” of protestors. Yet the support in favour of Stag – both within the city and from names including Jeremy Corbyn, Michael Gove, Ken Loach and Jarvis Cocker – probably had something to do with it too.Hopes are now high the whole policy can be reconsidered. “We don’t take anything for granted,” says Selby, a civil servant with the Department for Work and Pensions. “But, after so long fighting, surely dialogue is now the sensible way forward.”Tensions rose, with fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidation (Sheffield Tree Action Group)Certainly, it has been a troubled road to here: the irony perhaps being that this all started with a real city victory.In 2012 the government handed Sheffield £1.2bn to improve its roads, an economic godsend for a place locals had taken to calling Pothole City. Amey – a subsidiary of the Spanish company Ferrovial – won the work contract, promising to upgrade and maintain every highway, pavement, bridge, subway and street light for 25 years.“This is work that is good for everyone living here,” says Paul Billington, director of culture and environment with the city council. “It is already bringing investment and opportunities back into the city because it is making our infrastructure world-class.”Replacing damaging or dying trees, he argues, is key to that success continuing. Doing it now, he adds, is important because, as a 2007 survey showed, a large majority of trees are so old that to delay action would store problems for future generations.“No one disagrees that dying or damaging trees should be looked at – if they really do fall into those categories,” says Alison Teal, a Green Party councillor in the city. “But this went beyond that. We still didn’t know how many were due to come down but everywhere you looked, these magnificent trees were disappearing.”Demonstrations were civil enough to start with. People at home would spot Amey vans and go out to stand under targeted trees so they couldn’t be axed. Others started taking the bus to work, leaving their cars blocking access to endangered arboreta.Cups of tea were offered while people stood about. They debated the merits of the trees: their beauty, the environmental benefits, the wildlife. Occasionally, they talked about their favourite. An endangered elm in the Nether Edge area ended up being shortlisted for the 2016 England Tree Of The Year Award.Yet things hardened after the Rustlings Road raid (“In hindsight, it was poorly handled,” says Darren Butt). While many still supported the replacement scheme, opinion started to harden in favour of the so-called tree-huggers.

Stumps of trees already cut were painted blood red as a mark of anger. Stag supporters – now numbering in their thousands – took to organising daily spotter patrols and flying pickets.“When someone saw an Amey van near an endangered tree, they put a message in a WhatsApp group or online, and whoever was available would go and protect that tree,” says Teal.In this way dozens of limes, cherries, oaks and birches across several neighbourhoods were saved.But as tensions rose – with both fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidation – police started to appear.Jenny Hockey (left), Freda Brayshaw and a third neighbour were arrested and locked up for eight hours (PA)At one demonstration in leafy Chippinghouse Road in January 2017, nine people were arrested, some while stood in their own gardens. None were ever charged. At another picket last month, a specialist police protest removal unit turned up. It was the first time it had ever been deployed on South Yorkshire’s streets.Arrest numbers grew – yet there were vaguely comedic elements to many. A 57-year-old woman was detained after blowing a pink trumpet, while a retired couple – Dr John and Sue Unwin – found themselves being questioned by CID officers (and later cleared) about the suspected poisoning of a cup of tea they gave a feller.“It sounds like the plot from an Agatha Christie novel,” Dr Unwin told the Daily Mail.One 73-year-old was detained for intimidation. Alan Simpson, a retired firefighter and great-grandfather, says: “I’ve never been in trouble in my life and was there with my wife. I don’t think I could have cut a less intimidating figure if I tried.” His charge, too, has been dropped.“If it wasn’t so serious,” says James Whitworth, cartoonist on local newspaper The Star, “it would be farcical, and I mean that literally: there is enough material here to make an actual farce.“As a cartoonist, it’s a dream because the whole thing is so ridiculous. You think you can’t possibly say anymore on the issue – and then they arrest a woman for blowing a plastic trumpet. But as a city resident: I’m pretty neutral but, really, maybe leave our trees alone?”Local newspaper cartoonist James Whitworth’s take on the Sheffield tree massacre (James Whitworth)As news of the ongoing demonstrations spread, meanwhile, concern grew it was damaging the city’s reputation. When Sheffield was left off The Sunday Times Best Places to Live list this year, authorities blamed the campaigners: “it is regrettable the increasingly extreme actions of a small number of protestors is having this impact,” a council spokesperson declared.Demonstrators themselves were not above ridiculous assertions either: at a packed council meeting, one compared Amey’s workers to Nazi guards, just doing their jobs.Lavender and tea tree oils could be giving boys breasts, study warnsChina reassigns 60,000 troops to plant trees in bid to fight pollutionHow the Japanese fought suicide in the ‘Sea of Trees’For now, however, the potential turning point arguably came in March when a freedom of information request, asked by Paul Selby, forced the council to reveal it had indeed asked for 17,500 trees to be chopped down. The figure was so astonishing all three city MPs – all Labour – called for a rethink.In a disastrous interview on local radio, council cabinet member for environment Bryan Lodge – who declined to be interviewed for this piece – denied the figure was a target but could not explain what it actually was. Days later the suspension of felling was announced.What happens next is the question the city is asking itself.“We’ve already lost 6,000 trees,” says Selby. “Of course, there are some that should come down if they really are dying or doing irreversible damage to footpaths. But all other solutions should be sought first. Trees are a sign of a civilised city. We should be doing everything we can to save them.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Others were able to log in but, when they did, some or all of their account details had disappeared.Customers have also reported that they could access other people’s accounts, including account numbers, sort codes and transaction histories.TSB apology after customers complain of online banking ‘data breach’​TSB could not say how many people were still locked out of the service or when the problems would be fully resolved.The ongoing IT disaster began with botched upgrade work on Friday, but has developed into one of the worst technology failures to hit a UK retail bank and has left many of TSB’s 1.9 million customers furious.Some said they were falling behind with bill payments.Others said they were worried their money had simply disappeared.Many customers expressed frustration that the bank was not being clear about what had happened.That came after Paul Pester, CEO of TSB, tweeted on Wednesday morning: “Our mobile banking app and online banking are now up and running. Thank you for your patience and for bearing with us.”Our mobile banking app and online banking are now up and running. Thank you for your patience and for bearing with us.MPs demanded answers from TSB on Tuesday. Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury Committee, said: “The reports of unauthorised transactions, access to other customers’ accounts and failures of in-branch services have all the hallmarks of an IT meltdown.“This is yet another addition to the litany of failures of banking IT systems. Potentially, millions of customers could be affected by uncertainty and disruption.“It simply isn’t good enough to expose customers to IT failures, including delays in paying bills and an inability to access their own money.”A spokesperson for the Financial Conduct Authority said on Tuesday that the watchdog was “aware of the issue and liaising with the firm”. A spokesperson for the Information Commissioner’s Office said: “We are aware of a potential data breach in relation to the TSB and are making enquiries.”Mr Pester said on Tuesday that he was “truly sorry” about the problems caused. “We’re still seeing issues with access to our digital services,” he added. “One of the steps we need to take to resolve this is to take our mobile app and online banking down for a few hours.“We did this at around 10.30 this morning and we hope to be back up later this afternoon.”The problems stemmed from a switch to a new online banking system. TSB had rented the technology behind its app and online banking from Lloyds Banking Group since the two companies split. Over the weekend, TSB moved customers to a new platform which experienced some teething problems.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

That is what Diana did with victims of Aids and landmines and very effective she was too,” the former politician continued. “Rights are the business of politicians and pressure groups and never more so than when they are controversial.”“Second, what a week for any royal to join in the argument when the Commonwealth conference was in full swing, the position of Prince Charles as its future head was in delicate negotiation and some of its bishops were voicing concern about their countries being pressurised by Theresa May on the issue of LGBT rights.

In the absence of such an agreement, the United States will not again waive sanctions in order to stay in the Iran nuclear deal”, Mr Trump said at the time.During a visit to Washington this week, French president Emmanuel Macron worked to persuade Donald Trump to preserve the deal. But Mr Macron conceded he faced slim odds of succeeding.“My view – I don’t know what your president will decide – is that he will get rid of this deal on his own, for domestic reasons,” Mr Macron told reporters.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Can he think of any example of any government he has seen where they have done that?Mr Clarke joked in reply: Not deliberately - accidentally several times.1.15pm Kenneth Clarke says all his colleagues in the Government and the House of Lords are in favour of staying in the customs unionMr Clarke added that while the UK may be leaving the customs union there needed to be a customs union or a replica of it.He continued that the UK needed to be able to need negotiate trade agreements with other countries which Britian cannot do in the customs union.1.00pm: Yvette Cooper says the motion calls for an effective customs unionDetailing her vision for a customs union agreement, the Labour MP said it would be for frictionless trade without tariffs.12.45pm: Business think tank hits back at claims made by Yvette Cooper in the House of CommonsIn an email to the Express Callum Crozier, policy director at leading northern business think tank, Policy North said: If the UK remains in the Customs Union, we will be unable to negotiate independent trade deals with other countries. People will then rightly ask in what way we have left the EU. This debate is simply an attempt to frustrate Brexit and undermine the referendum result.\u0026ldquoIf we do not leave the Customs Union, there is no point in leaving the EU. Being \u0026lsquoout\u0026rsquo of the EU but having to abide by its tariffs and being unable to strike new trade deals with the rest of the world defies logic.\u0026ldquoThe North of England economy is worth over \u0026pound300bn and makes up 19 per cent of total UK output, but it has the potential to be so much more after Brexit, as long as we leave the Customs Union.\u0026ldquoWith 90 per cent of global growth over the next 10-15 years set to be from non-EU countries, it makes no sense to lock ourselves out of these lucrative markets.\u0026ldquoPolicy North has proposed establishing free ports in the North post Brexit. There are currently no functional Free Trade Zones in the UK because membership of the Single Market and Customs Union effectively prevents us from creating them.

lines on Brexit were crossed.Mr Dodds told the Conservativehome website: \u0026ldquoIf, as a result of the Brexit negotiations for instance, there was to be any suggestion that Northern Ireland would be treated differently in a way, for instance that we were part of a customs union and a single market and the rest of the UK wasn\u0026rsquot ... for us that would be a red line, which we would vote

anti-Unionist policies as have a Conservative Government doing it by a different means.Meanwhile Labour\u0026rsquos shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer accused the Prime Minister of delaying the showdown over the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Bill because she fears a humiliating defeat.Government data indicates the decision to rule out a new customs union with the European Union could cost the UK economy \u0026pound24 billion by 2033.Sir Keir said: Over the past few weeks it has become abundantly clear that Theresa May is unwilling and unable to put the country\u0027s interests first during the Brexit negotiations.She has wasted 12 weeks of the Brexit negotiations delaying a Commons vote on the UK negotiating a customs union with the EU for fear of a defeat.In light of the Government\u0027s own impact assessments and the lack of progress on any new trade deals, any economic case for ruling out a customs union has collapsed.The Prime Minister is now solely focused on internal party management and masking the isions within her government.But Brexit minister Suella Braverman said Labour\u0027s support for a customs union would leave the UK shackled to Brussels, taking rules set by the EU and unable to strike trade deals.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has backed a customs union but only if the UK had a say in future EU trade deals.Mrs Braverman said: The supposed safeguards that Corbyn talks about are impossible to achieve and will get laughed out of town.She said Labour was more interested in frustrating the process and playing politics than they are in delivering a successful Brexit.Labour Home Affairs Committee chairwoman Yvette Cooper and Treasury select committee chairwoman Ms Morgan said in a joint statement: We both believe the case for a customs union is overwhelming \u0026ndash for the sake of British manufacturing, international trade, smooth borders and Northern Ireland peace.Additional reporting and initial liveblog by Nicole
