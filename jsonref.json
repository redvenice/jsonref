More than a third of Northern Ireland’s population hold an Irish passport, according to latest official figures.While applications plunged amid overseas travel restrictions during pandemic lockdowns, fresh data from the Department of Foreign Affairs shows numbers rebounding.Already this year, 24,643 people were issued with Irish passports in the North through Northern Ireland Passport Express (NIPX), which is available at post offices in the North. This is more than 400 every day. The figures do not include Irish citizens in the North who apply for their passports directly from Dublin.If the trend continues it suggests more than 150,000 Irish passports would be issued in the North by the year end.This would eclipse, dramatically, the 107,937 issued through NIPX in 2019 – the last full-year figure before coronavirus prevented international travel for most.Issued passports during 2019 in the North soared 27 per cent from the previous year (84,855). This continued a pattern of rising Irish passport applications in the region against declining British applications following Brexit. Official figures show there were 110,506 applications from Northern Ireland for a UK passport in 2019. This was down from 119,298 the previous year, in a continuing 15 per cent slide in such applications from people in the North over a five-year period.LockdownDespite the virus grounding most of the world’s aircraft since the outbreak began, 56,709 Irish passports were issued in the North last year, up almost 16 per cent from 48,911 in 2020, when the first pandemic lockdown was imposed in Ireland.Aggregate figures for the decade 2012 to 2022, to date, show 660,427 Irish passports issued in the North, about 35 per cent of the region’s 1.8 million population. Under the Belfast Agreement, Irish and British governments recognise the birthright of all people in Northern Ireland to identify as either Irish, British or both. There is also a right to dual citizenship and people can carry Irish and British passports. Observers have suggested the surge in Irish passport applications, against a decline in British, is down to increasing pragmatism among the North’s unionists since the United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union. An Irish passport allows them to travel freely within the EU. The Democratic Unionist Party’s Sammy Wilson has previously said he gets “quite a lot” of loyalist voters in his constituency who ask him to sign off on their applications for Irish passports. The East Antrim MP said he encourages constituents going on holidays to opt for an Irish passport as it is a quicker process and negates restrictions imposed on British citizens in the EU as a result of Brexit.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"alan kelly departure why and why now","story":"Tipperary TD Alan Kelly announced during an emotional press conference that he was resigning as Labour Party leader after his colleagues lost faith in his ability to deliver.

Photograph: Alan Betson Wearing their glummest “this hurts us more than it hurts you” expressions, Alan Kelly’s solicitous assassins walked him out to the microphone, silently surrounding him while he announced his resignation as leader of the Labour Party.There was no way out for Alan Kelly.“Once the lads came to me, I think, within seconds I said: ‘Yeah, let’s just work this through.’”So, “the lads” had come for him. That’s heavy-duty stuff.The shock resignation on Wednesday night was one of the strangest sign-offs ever witnessed in Leinster House. When deputy Kelly appeared as usual at Leaders’ Questions, nobody suspected it would be his last. Or that there was a reason for the discernibly stricken faces of Duncan Smith and Seán Sherlock sitting directly – and clearly uncomfortably – behind him.It is why Kelly suddenly seemed on the verge of breaking down in the middle of asking the Taoiseach about the Russian ambassador. There was something about the unexpected pause followed by this deep, shuddering intake and powerful exhalation of breath which made people look up take notice.The irony of Kelly urging the Government to expel Yury Filatov while he had just been expelled from the leadership of his own party was lost.But that was all. Clues after the event always seem so obvious. Alan’s final question to the Taoiseach, leader to leader, was about the possible amalgamation of the GAA, the Ladies Gaelic Football Association and the Camogie Association.If, as he hopes, it happens, “will the Government give them a few bob?” Given all the issues, domestic and international, he could have raised, this was the one he chose to go out on. He even managed to mention his local GAA club (Portroe in Tipperary) where his daughter plays both codes.Lighthearted banterDeputy Kelly clearly enjoyed putting the question to Micheál Martin and they had some lighthearted banter, even if an amused Ceann Comhairle wondered about its relevance to the subject of promised legislation.Another clue after the event. A strange valedictory choice, but then, very little seems straightforward about the manner of Alan Kelly’s departure. Yet.It was mid-afternoon before word leaked that the politician known as AK-47 had been decommissioned. Labour had managed to keep this news under wraps – no small achievement in the Leinster House gossip sieve, even for a parliamentary party so shrunken in size there aren’t that many people left to spill the beans.Journalists, blindsided by the development, scrambled for the backstory.But they weren’t the only ones caught on the hop. “This was a surprise to me,” admitted Alan, who sounded both shocked and upset at what was happening.Did he leave of his own accord or was he pushed? Why did he go? Who did the pushing? Why now?And the biggest conundrum of all, the one which had everyone baffled. Was brash Alan “power is a drug” AK-47 Kelly really going quietly? Like, really?Yes, he was, officially confirming his resignation at a hastily convened press conference on the Leinster House plinth in the sympathetic presence of his concerned colleagues who took him out. There, standing broken-hearted in the middle of their Do Not Escape Doughnut, he said he was resigning as leader of the Labour Party because they told him to go.He didn’t want to go but he “accepted the decision immediately” after the unnamed “lads” arrived to tell him they had lost “collective confidence” in his leadership.Division bellsAs the Dáil’s ision bells rang out, they weren’t only tolling for the Wednesday night votes. Kelly was deeply upset. His voice began to waver from the moment he began talking, buckling when he spoke of his lifelong involvement “literally” with Labour.“Becoming leader of the Labour Party was the best day of my life,” he declared, voice cracking again. The people who ousted him looked so distraught one had to wonder why they got rid of him in such a speedy and clinical fashion.Throughout his highly emotional speech, Kelly kept referring to his uncomfortable-looking party colleagues as “lads” and to the journalists as “lads”, as if this was some minor little hiccup on the road to oblivion. Sure, he was going for a few pints with his colleagues later on, he revealed.First round on AK-47. “Here’s your pints, lads, and I’ve put those knives you stabbed me in the back with on the tray as well.”Alan’s “fantastic” wife, Regina, was there to support him. “She would be fantastic, lads, she’s from Kerry.” He broke down again while talking about his family and his political team. They weren’t present. “They would have been up here with me if this had happened tomorrow,” he ruefully sighed. But the lads didn’t allow their departing leader the small luxury of timing and softening his departure.All we know is that Kelly didn’t want to go but he went when he was politely asked. He feels hard done by and wanted to lead the party into the next election. He is very sad, but accepts his fate. Why? What did the lads bring him to make him capitulate so easily, particularly when he so patently did not want to go anywhere?Earlier in the afternoon, the talk in the Dáil was all about the war in Ukraine and rising inflation here.“Breaking news!” barked Mick Barry, who has a flair for the dramatic, although we’re fairly full up on that particular front at the moment.No big news there, indicated the Taoiseach. “I said that this morning.”Magnificent impressionIt certainly came as news to the socialist TD for Cork North Central, who declared he’d only found out in the last hour. “Wow! Wow!” marvelled Mick, doing a magnificent impression of president Mary McAleese when she heard Queen Elizabeth saying her few words in Irish at a State banquet in Dublin Castle.But not so fast with your 5.8 per cent, Mick.If the Taoiseach wanted news, his colleague Richard Boyd Barrett had a fresh gobbet to impart.“Yeah, well, what is breaking news as well as that is . . .” the war in Ukraine and the sanctions are likely to produce an additional 4 per cent inflation on top of the current rate. “On top of that, right? So we’re looking at potentially up to 9 per cent inflation now.”Any more breaking news?“Hold me beer,” is probably what Alan Kelly wanted to shout as he sat alone in the Dáil chamber listening to Boyd Barrett and Barry trade revelations. He was, after all, nursing some big news of his own.It took a few hours for a tearful Kelly to confirm his news.And so it was, with Leinster House lit up in the blue-and-yellow national colours of Ukraine, the county colours of Tipperary, Alan Kelly began caretaking duties until a successor is selected.“So, lads, Leo will be taking questions from me tomorrow in the Dáil.” No doubt this time the lads will turn out in force to support him.Our own Harry McGee tweeted: “The whole scene reminded you of Nabokov’s famous story: Invitation to a Beheading.”And People Before ProfitSolidarity’s Paul Murphy graciously tweeted: “Nice to get some good news in a generally pretty grim situation.”"},{"url":null,"title":"rebuilding mica homes to cost between 150 000 and 420 000 a house","story":"Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien asked the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland to estimate average rebuilding costs for mica-affected homes based on ‘independent, standalone construction’ Rebuilding thousands of homes affected by mica will likely cost the Government between €149,688 and €421,470 for each house, surveyors have said.However, homeowners will still be left with planning and engineering fees, as well as having to stump up the cost of damaged home contents such as carpets, curtains, furniture and domestic appliances.Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien asked the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland (SCSI) to estimate average rebuilding costs for mica-affected homes based on “independent, standalone construction”.Muscovite mica, a mineral, has led to apparent defects in building blocks used in at least 5,000 homes in the northwest, causing cracks to open up in thousands of buildings. The Cabinet last year approved an enhanced scheme to cover repairs or rebuilding for affected homes.In its report published on Thursday, the SCSI said costs of storage, septic tanks, materials salvage, boundary walls and fences as well as outbuildings, such as garages, will not be included in the Government’s grant scheme.It drew up a model, based on eight different house types, typical of about 7,500 homes in Donegal and Mayo that are affected by the defective concrete blocks.The society estimated a two-bedroom terrace estate house (88sq m) would cost €149,688 to rebuild, a three-bedroom semi-detached estate house (98sq m) €165,620 and a four-bed semi-detached estate house (113sq m) €193,456.A four-bed detached estate house (113sq m) would attract a grant up to €200,688 under the calculations, a four-bed single rural bungalow (180sq m) €317,880 and a four-bed single rural dormer (195sq m) €308,685.At the higher end of the scale, a four-bed single rural two-storey (210sq m) would cost €339,150 and a five-bed or more single rural two-storey house (270sq m) €421,470.The Cabinet’s grant scheme includes a €420,000 cap on the level of support on offer, up from €247,500 under a previous version of the scheme.The Mica Action Group along with Opposition politicians have previously called for the sliding scale to be dropped, claiming homeowners would not get 100 per cent redress.They will also be forced to contribute tens of thousands of euro to rebuilding their houses, they warned.It is expected Mr O’Brien will likely adopt the measures suggested by the SCSI."},{"url":null,"title":"smith and %C3%B3 r%C3%ADord%C3%A1in rule themselves out of labour leadership race","story":"On Wednesday night Alan  Kelly confirmed his decision to resign in a statement delivered outside Leinster House.

When it comes to leadership, any contender had to believe in themselves and that it was the right time. “It’s not the right time for me,” Mr Smith told RTÉ’s News at One. “I don’t believe I’m the best candidate.

He acknowledged that the party had not made the progress he would have liked in opinion polls under his leadership. Mr Kelly said that the party’s TDs and Senators had come to him this week to say they were no longer confident in his leadership.The Labour Party was in a fight for its survival, to build back public trust. The decision to approach Mr Kelly followed weeks of meetings, but the move was not orchestrated, Mr Smith said. The action was going to have ramifications as party members were not happy.Several party sources said Ms Bacik is the likely next leader, with one saying she is the “only candidate”.

Britain and the West have been plunged back into what, at best, will become a lengthy new Cold War and clash of civilisations.For the first time in more than 30 years, we face a truly existential threat. Our enemy is a hostile state armed with nuclear weapons, a large conventional army and led by an empire-building psychopath: the danger to the European powers is orders of magnitude greater than the very real risk posed after 911 by al-Qaeda and Islamic State.This new conflict will almost certainly be long, complex and extremely expensive. It won’t be like fighting the Taliban, or Saddam Hussein, or lone wolf actors. It will require us to relearn strategies, tactics and virtues at odds with the hyper-emotional performative stupidity and instant gratification of the Twitter era. Our elites will need to reprogramme themselves psychologically, economically and militarily, read some history, become more serious and austere, and knuckle down for a lengthy fight.I’m not sure they are ready for the challenges ahead. So far, while the West has successfully launched an economic blitzkrieg on Russia, hammering it far more comprehensively than expected, Putin hasn’t retaliated with counter-sanctions and export restrictions. He may yet decide to do so, cutting off energy, fertiliser or precious metal supplies. Such a move would be suicidal for his regime, but would wreak devastation in the West, forcing the imposition of rationing, three-day weeks and speed limits as we scramble to find new sources of oil and gas.But even without an actual embargo, Europe and Britain are already facing an energy shock similar to that caused by the 1973 Arab oil crisis, the 1979 Iranian revolution or the 1990 First Gulf War. Household energy bills could hit £3,000 a year when the next price cap is set, and the price of petrol is rocketing: a recession is no longer inconceivable. Coming so soon after the damage and higher inflationary pressures caused by Covid, tens of millions of people face gradual impoverishment. The political consequences could be severe.Yet all of this pales in comparison with the dawning realisation that we are about to return to the nuclear anxiety that gripped a generation of children between the 1960s and 1980s. The chance of an atomic Armageddon – either because of a calamitous miscalculation by an unstable, desperate Putin, or indirectly if a collapse of the Russian regime triggers a fire sale of weaponry – while still low, is the highest it has been since before the Reagan-Gorbachev Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty was signed in 1987.Russia is merely the first of the authoritarian states to openly declare its hand: there will be more wars, invasions and egregious violations of sovereignty. A nuclear Iran would surely launch a calamitous attack on Israel or the Gulf China might in time seek to invade Taiwan North Korea is run by a madman nuclear Pakistan may one day go rogue, and so on.One significant consequence of this abrupt shift in the world order is that the post-Cold War peace idend will no longer pay out. We will need to spend more on defence. We must turbocharge our economic growth with supply-side reforms, not just to bolster living standards but also to compensate for the costs of deglobalisation and to generate the resources required to fight authoritarian powers. We will require a sensible energy policy: like in the 1970s, we have been caught out, this time by our idiotic decision, driven by green zealots, to shut down domestic production of oil and gas without building the nuclear capacity required to supplement renewables.The greatest immediate change will need to come in defence expenditure. The Integrated Review needs itself to be immediately reviewed. The Nato target of 2 per cent of GDP is fine in peacetime, but laughably low when a new iron curtain is descending on Europe and we need to deter, contain and frighten rogue regimes worldwide.The peace idend after the collapse of the USSR was worth at least 2 per cent of GDP. Britain’s defence spending was around 7 per cent of a much smaller GDP in the 1950s, and remained around 4-5 per cent between the late 1960s and late 1980s. Boris Johnson will need to bite the bullet: we must urgently increase spending back to 3 per cent of GDP, and conceivably to 3.5 per cent if we want to be Europe’s leading military power. I don’t say this with any relish: I’m not a militarist. But there are no other responsible options, and increased spending will also have to be accompanied by radical procurement reform to ensure billions aren’t wasted.Britain’s peace idend has been spent more than once, primarily on pensions and the NHS. With the tax burden already at an all-time high, the economy cannot take VAT going from 20 to 25 per cent, or an extra £40 billion increase in national insurance. This would condemn us to a zero-growth economy, which would be morally and geopolitically indefensible.The post-Blairite era of social-democratic largesse must end: the state needs to refocus on its core function of defending lives, liberty and property. We require less redistribution, and enhanced resilience. This implies large spending cuts. The social care plan will need to be abandoned, the pensions triple-lock axed, the NHS reformed and numerous wasteful subsidies, pseudo-levelling-up policies and other programmes and handouts ended.We have prevented the free market from supplying cheap energy, so the state will have to foot a huge bill. Britain needs at least five more Hinkley Point C-style nuclear power plants, at a cost of £110 billion. The best way to pay for this is to scrap HS2, write off the cash already spent and sell off all its land and assets. Uneconomic grand projets are an obsolete self-indulgence at a time of war.Yes, Russia is staggeringly weak, a decaying nation with a population much less than half that of the US, and a GDP far lower than that of New York state. But it has nuclear weapons and needs to be deterred and eventually defeated. We must also send a signal to China, a country that is immensely richer and more sophisticated than the Soviet Union ever was, that the West is serious once more. This is a new Cold War, and we must urgently contain the authoritarian powers at war with liberal democracy.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Vladimir Putin wants to \u0026#39seize the whole of Ukraine\u0026#39Politics latest news: Russian oligarchs allied to Vladimir Putin may be stripped of British citizenshipBritain\u0026#39s new immigration system has proven Remainers wrongNicola Sturgeon is saying nothing about Scottish Investment Bank boss’ mysterious exit‘Peacemaker’ or casual observer: what China could do nextRussian convoy\u0026#39s advance on Kyiv hampered by cheap tyres and Ukrainian mudMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"number long covid symptoms britain almost 200000 month","story":"The number of people suffering long Covid symptoms in Britain has jumped by nearly 200,000 in a month, with 35 to 49-year-olds now the most likely to report ongoing problems.The latest data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that 1.52 million people – one in 41 – were experiencing at least one symptom four weeks after recovering from an infection, an increase of 15 per cent from 1.33 million last month.People in their mid to late 30s and 40s were the most likely to be impacted – a reflection of how many working age younger groups became infected during the omicron wave.Nearly a million people in Britain said long Covid was negatively affecting their daily lives, while 685,000 said they were still experiencing symptoms more than a year after recovering from the virus.The figures show that 1.1 million (71 per cent) had been struggling with symptoms for at least 12 weeks since an infection.Self-reported long Covid is defined as symptoms persisting for more than four weeks after a first suspected virus infection that could not be explained by something else.Although it is still not fully understood, many people continue to experience debilitating symptoms after a Covid infection, including extreme tiredness, shortness of breath, chest pain, memory problems, insomnia, heart palpitations, dizziness and joint pain.Fatigue continues to be the most common symptom – experienced by 51 per cent of those with self-reported long Covid in the ONS survey – followed by shortness of breath (35 per cent) and loss of smell (34 per cent), with a quarter of people continuing to experience loss of taste and having difficulty concentrating.Some 281,000 (18 per cent) reported that their ability to undertake day-to-day activities had been limited a lot by symptoms.The ONS said prevalence was greatest in people deprived areas, those working in teaching and education, social care or healthcare, and those with another activity-limiting health condition or disability. These groups also align with those most at risk from Covid in general.Women were also found to report more symptoms, although studies have shown that they are generally better at spotting symptoms for most illnesses. More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Vladimir Putin wants to \u0026#39seize the whole of Ukraine\u0026#39Politics latest news: Russian oligarchs allied to Vladimir Putin may be stripped of British citizenshipBritain\u0026#39s new immigration system has proven Remainers wrongNicola Sturgeon is saying nothing about Scottish Investment Bank boss’ mysterious exit‘Peacemaker’ or casual observer: what China could do nextRussian convoy\u0026#39s advance on Kyiv hampered by cheap tyres and Ukrainian mudMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"oligarchs turning russias new tsar","story":"It is a sure sign that all is not well in the court of Vladimir Putin when some of the country’s more prominent oligarchs dare to question the wisdom of his decision to invade Ukraine.The relationship between Mr Putin and the cluster of billionaire businessmen who control a significant proportion of the country’s wealth has, historically, been conducted on a transactional basis. In return for not involving themselves in the Russian autocrat’s political agenda, the oligarchs are, by and large, allowed to pursue their commercial interests without undue interference from the Kremlin.Thus, high-profile oligarchs of the ilk of Roman Abramovich, the multi-billionaire owner of Chelsea football club (now up for sale), who previously served as governor of the remote Russian region of Chukotka, have been able to carry on generating wealth, confident in the knowledge that they have the Kremlin’s backing.This elite group, though, is also well aware of the risks they run if they are foolhardy enough to involve themselves in Russian politics. Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who was believed at one point to be the country’s wealthiest man, discovered this to his cost when he made the mistake of taking Mr Putin to task over rampant corruption in the highest echelons of the Russian government.Back in the summer of 2001, when I first met Mr Khodorkovsky in Moscow, he came across as a friendly and energetic inidual who had a genuine interest in promoting Russian democracy. When I subsequently saw him again at the end of last year, he seemed nervous and introverted, wary of making eye contact, presumably the result of the years he spent in a remote Russian penal colony for daring to challenge Mr Putin’s regime.Other oligarchs who have crossed swords with Russia’s megalomaniacal leader have not been so lucky. Boris Berezovsky, a former business associate of Mr Abramovich who fled to London after becoming a vocal critic of Mr Putin, was found dead in mysterious circumstances at his Berkshire home in 2013 – a death his supporters still insist was the work of Russian security agents.Given the very well-documented perils of crossing Mr Putin, therefore, it has been surprising to see prominent Russian oligarchs appearing to take issue with his decision to invade Ukraine.By far the most high-profile oligarch to break ranks has been Mikhail Fridman, one of Russia’s richest men, who was born in the Ukrainian city of Lviv. In a letter to his staff, he wrote: “I am deeply attached to Ukrainian and Russian peoples and see the current conflict as a tragedy for them both.” He declined to comment further, saying that to do so would place his employees in Russia and Ukraine at risk.Mr Khodorkovsky, who has mainly kept his silence since being released in 2013, showed no such reticence in a rare public appearance, denouncing the Russian leader as a “madman”, insisting: “We are not dealing with a sane person.”Even Mr Abramovich, long regarded in Western circles as a Putin loyalist, may not be all that happy with the situation in Ukraine – although it was his daughter Sofia who posted an anti-Putin meme on social media.If Mr Abramovich has not directly criticised the Kremlin over Ukraine, his prominent position has seen him undertaking an unofficial mediation role. A supporter of the campaign against anti-Semitism, Mr Abramovich reportedly enjoys the trust of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, some of whose Jewish ancestors were murdered in the Holocaust.In a week when Russian forces saw fit to bomb the site of Kyiv’s Babyn Yar Holocaust memorial, which marks where the Nazis massacred 34,000 Jews, Mr Abramovich’s spokesman confirmed that he was asked by Ukraine for his help in achieving a peaceful resolution, and that he has been attempting to do so.While Mr Putin still shows no inclination to pull back from his murderous assault on Ukraine, Mr Abramovich’s quiet diplomacy suggests that, at least as far as some Russian oligarchs are concerned, they have more to offer than simply helping to prop up Mr Putin’s tyrannical regime – a consideration Western leaders might want to take into account as they weigh their next round of Russian sanctions.With their vast wealth and close ties to the Kremlin, Russia’s army of oligarchs is an obvious target as the West seeks – quite justifiably – to inflict maximum damage on Russia for its unprovoked assault on Ukraine.This, according to Forbes, has led Russia’s 116 billionaires to lose more than $126 billion between them since the conflict began – losses that will undoubtedly cause many oligarchs to question their unwavering loyalty to the Kremlin.Certainly, with their country facing financial ruin, the oligarchs are better placed than most Russians to ask, either openly or in private, whether Russia’s interests continue to be best served by having Mr Putin remain in power.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Vladimir Putin wants to \u0026#39seize the whole of Ukraine\u0026#39Politics latest news: Russian oligarchs allied to Vladimir Putin may be stripped of British citizenshipBritain\u0026#39s new immigration system has proven Remainers wrongNicola Sturgeon is saying nothing about Scottish Investment Bank boss’ mysterious exit‘Peacemaker’ or casual observer: what China could do nextRussian convoy\u0026#39s advance on Kyiv hampered by cheap tyres and Ukrainian mudMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"tudor women not just henry viiis wives looked","story":"Henry VIII was never a man of Catholic tastes. He may have married six times, but the women he chose, with the exception of Anne Boleyn, were decidedly similar in the way they looked – at least to judge by their portraits. The recent discovery that a painting long believed to represent Catherine Parr, Henry’s sixth wife, is actually a portrait of Catherine of Aragon, his first, has led curators at Hever Castle to a bold conclusion. Henry VIII had a “type”.  The king married the Spanish widow of his late brother Arthur in 1509 when he was 17 and she 23. Catherine was said to be a woman of beauty and ‘agreeable and dignified manners’. Henry certainly had no objections on that front. Catherine had thick auburn hair and pale skin, both qualities much admired in Tudor England. Catherine Parr, who married Henry in 1543, just a few years before he died, was also auburn-haired and pale-faced. A contemporary portrait by the artist William Scrots shows her to have had elegantly arched eyebrows, delicate features and hazel eyes. Like Catherine of Aragon, who in the Hever Castle portrait has boldly painted lips and cheeks, she has an elegantly small nose. This is not the first time the two women have been confused. A portrait at Lambeth Palace thought to show Catherine Parr has similarly been reanalysed and declared to be a likeness of Catherine of Aragon. Meanwhile, the identification of a portrait miniature by Hans Holbein, believed to capture Catherine Howard, was thrown open to question last year, with an art historian suggesting that the sitter was actually Anne of Cleves. One major difference between Catherine of Aragon and Catherine Parr would have been difficult to capture in portraiture. While the former was rather short and of a healthy build – a miniature shows her to have had a positively fleshy face and blue eyes – the latter was willowy and the tallest of Henry’s wives. Parr’s height would have given her an advantage at a time when women were admired for extra inches. Mary, Queen of Scots was striking at almost six feet tall.  But there is no escaping the fact that the Hever Castle portrait is highly stylised. No Holbein, it is comparatively flat and lifeless, making Catherine of Aragon look less like a human than a porcelain doll. Her fair hair and pale skin have been highlighted intentionally because they were believed to reflect inner purity and cleanliness of soul. Such was the fashion for both that even women outside the court resorted to lightening their flesh and tresses with serums and balms. Venetian Ceruse, a white foundation of white lead and vinegar, was liberally applied to the face, and sulphur and saffron were similarly used for bleaching and blonding. An artist’s paintbrush had the potential to do an even better job of it. This is a portrait painted to reassure a king prone to paranoia. The painting indeed takes on fresh meaning when one looks at it in light of Henry’s ensuing love life. Anne Boleyn, the woman he left Catherine of Aragon for, was her antithesis in many ways. Far from being fair and ‘pure’, she was unique among Henry’s wives for being ‘Brunet’ (brunette) with dark eyes and possibly a sixth finger on one hand. Although described as ‘not one of the handsomest women in the world’, Boleyn had wit and allure, for she was able to use her eyes, it was said, ‘with effect’.  Given how their relationship ended – Boleyn was the first of the wives to be beheaded – it makes psychological sense that Henry should have reverted to type. Jane Seymour, the next in line, had fair hair and blue eyes. Poor Anne of Cleves, while described as ‘of middling beauty, with a determined and resolute countenance,’ famously disappointed Henry, who declared her ‘nothing so fair as she had been reported’.  It may well be that Henry was rather unimaginative where looks were concerned. He wouldn’t be the first man to go after the same type of woman repeatedly, especially if certain attributes held the promise of an easier life, and lived up to existing conventions of beauty. Women outside the aristocracy may have faced fewer pressures to conform, but many were drawn to emulate the styles of the royal court nevertheless, thereby helping to perpetuate them. To suppose that hair and colouring were the top of the king’s agenda, however, when there were things like alliances and wealth to be considered, would be naive.  The similarity of many of the portraits instead illustrates just how simply women were viewed by some artists in line with expectations of the time. It is often said that a true portraitist captures the soul of their sitter, but the opaque and often ageless women preserved down the centuries did not so much have their souls painted as whitewashed, an effect that went deeper than any solution of lead and powder they applied to their faces. The irony of course was that royal women were always watched, Elizabeth I once commenting, “A thousand eyes see all I do.” It took a brave artist, and an understanding audience, to see them truly as they were. Daisy Dunn’s new book, Not Far From Brideshead: Oxford Between the Wars, is published on 31 March.

Former minister Sir Desmond Swayne moaned about the added bureaucracy caused by the UKaposs departure from the bloc in a fiery contribution in the Commons. Boris Johnson has repeatedly claimed he got Brexit done but there have been ongoing issues for firms caused by sweeping changes to trading rules. Businesses have faced extra red tape on the trade of goods and services since Brexit as the UK is no longer bound to the EU.Speaking in the Commons, Sir Demsond said: UK aid promoted trade in Africa by making borders seamless through digitising all the administrative processes.  Is that on our agenda for trade with the EU at all  Itaposs monstrous that weaposre filling in forms. Trade minister Mike Freer replied: We aim to have the best border in place by . SNP Business spokesperson Stephen Flynn told the Mirror: While itaposs good to finally see some Tories wake up to the reality of their own disastrous Brexit, it would be betterthey channelled their anger into pushing their bosses for support for businesses – which are struggling in the face of a Tory cost-of-living crisis and the long-term economic damage caused by Brexit.” Sir Desmond, a staunch Brexiteer, once appeared to fall asleep in the Commons when Tory grandee Ken Clarke gave a speech attacking the Governmentaposs Brexit legislation. He later blamed an early morning swim in the Serpentine for his lack of attention. Sir Desmond previously raised eyebrows when he suggested voters should be able to elect racists and misogyniststhey wanted to.The New Forest West West MP, who previously “blacked up” as soul singer James Brown for a fancy dress party, told the Commons last year that he hoped his constituents would never elect a racist or a misogynist - but he defended their right to do so.Speaking during a debate triggered by Boris Johnsonaposs attempts to rip up sleaze rules, he said: The principle of democracy is undermined by the requirement that we may be required to subscribe to behaviours to promote certain attitudes. I hope that my constituents never elect a racist or a misogynist, but they have a right to do so. At the time, a Downing Street spokesman said the PM had not seen the comments but said Mr Johnson had made it clear that there was no place for racism whatsoever in our society and that remains his position.

The top Tory praised the BBC and other outlets in an emotional moment offering heartfelt thanks and admiration for reporters on the frontline of the conflict.Her comments marked a sht in tone from her ongoing criticism of the BBC, which she has previously accused of favouring strident, very left wing, often hypocritical and frequently patronising views that turn people away.” At last yearaposs Conservative party conference, Ms Dorries questioned whether the BBC will exist in a decadeaposs time as she accused the broadcaster of an elitist approach.She also warned in January that the next licence fee settlement - which will run to the end of  - “will be the last”.In a Commons statement, Ms Dorries said Vladimir Putin was now in a social and sporting Siberia of his own making and it is causing him real pain. She said cultural sanctions were the third front in the Ukrainian war as she laid out the long list of sporting and cultural bans slapped on Russia. Ms Dorries became emotional when she praised all the journalists in Ukraine who are risking their lives to bring us unbiased and accurate news. She said: Iaposd just like to offer my heartfelt thanks and admiration to all of those journalists working for the BBC, the ITV and other news outlets who are risking their lives to bring us unbiased and accurate news from a live war zone.We will keep ratcheting up the pressure on Putin and I will use all the levers in my department to ensure that he is fully ostracised from the international community. It comes as the BBC said the audience of its Russian language news website had more than tripled its year-to-date weekly average, reaching a record .m people in the last week. Ms Dorries said the BBC is a great British global brand in need of protection, adding: Iaposve always said it was a polar bear on a shrinking ice cap. And we need to review the funding model in order to protect the BBC, and what is best at the BBC, which includes the World Service. She also commended citizen journalists in Ukraine who were bringing to the world the horrors of what is happening on the ground.  The Culture Secretary told MPs she had written to social media firms Tik Tok and Meta, Facebookaposs parent company, to demand they prevent access to state-owned television network Russia Today in the UK. She said Putin must not be allowed to exploit our open and free media to spread poisonous propaganda into British homes. She added: That is why I wrote to Ofcom last week urging them to examine any potential breaches of the broadcasting code. Ofcom has since opened  investigations into RT, and they are now reviewing whether to revoke RTaposs licence entirely. In the meantime, those investigations have been taken over by events and I was very glad to see yesterday that the channel is now officially off air on British televisions, after it shut down on Sky, Freeview and Freesat. She also said that English football had reached a turning point after having tolerated the investment of Russian kleptocrats for far too long. Ms Dorries called on allies to form a joint position banning Russia from participating in international sporting events. She is set to host sports ministers from the US, Australia, Germany, Poland, Netherlands, Latvia, Italy, Finland, Czech Republic, Norway and Canada for a summit on Thursday. It comes after a U-turn by the International Paralympic Committee to ban Russian and Belarusian athletes from the Beijing Winter Paralympics.

However the Government previously ordered Conservative MPs to vote against the amendment to the Health and Care Bill. The legal requirement should get a second chance to be added to the bill on Thursday and is scheduled to be debated in the House of Lords. Andrew Goddard, president of the Royal College of Physicians, said: “I have dedicated my career to working in the NHS, a service that I am fiercely proud of, and yet it scares me to wonder what might happen should I need care as I get older.  “There simply aren’t enough doctors to go round, not least within geriatrics. “The workforce crisis we’re facing is largely down to an astonishing lack of planning. “All successful organisations rely on long-term workforce planning to meet demand and it’s absurd that we don’t do this for the NHS and social care system. The Government needs to accept the amendment and make workforce planning a priority.” The NHS in England has a record number of advertised vacancies of around ,. NHS staff and bed numbers per , of the UK population are known to be some of the lowest when compared to other developed nations. The Office for National Statistics forecasts that our ageing population means there will be more than  million over s in the UK by . Yet there is no independent public assessment of how many NHS and social care staff will be needed to meet that demand. There are a record . million people on the NHS waiting list in England but no official published analysis on how many of which staff will be needed to clear the backlog.The amendment has cross-party support including from ex-Tory Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, ex-NHS England boss Lord Simon Stevens and Tory Peer Baroness Dido Harding. Sir Simon Stevens has labelled the Government’s refusal to create a duty to publish NHS workforce data as “flying blind”. Baroness Harding, as then-chair of NHS Improvement, was commissioned in  by the Department of Health and Social Care to develop an NHS People Plan. “It did not contain any forecasts of workforce numbers,” she previously explained. “Why was this  It was not because the work was not done. It was. And not even because the Government disagreed with the numbers. “There are no forecasts because we could not get approval to publish the document with any forecasts in it. “My experience is clear. Unless expressly required to do so, Government will not be honest about the mismatch between the supply and demand of healthcare workers.” The #StrengthInNumbers campaign to get the amendment included in the upcoming Health and Care Bill comes after Tory MPs voted against it in the House of Commons in November .The amendment has been re-tabled by Baroness Cumberlege with support from Labour and the Liberal Democrats.The Royal College of Physicians estimates that % of consultant posts went unfilled in , mostly due to a lack of applicants. There are , ‘full time equivalent’ registered nurse vacancies in the NHS in England, a vacancy rate of .%. Skills for Care estimates that .% of roles in adult social care were vacant in   with the number of filled posts falling for the first time since March . The British Medical Association estimates the UK is , doctors short compared with the average in other OECD nations. The Government has previously repeated the line that it has record numbers of people working in the NHS.

The result reflects the world’s horror at the illegal actions of Vladimir Putin which has led to the slaughter of countless innocent lives.The words of condemnation must now be matched by a further tightening of the screw on Russian business and finance. The UK Government has acted swtly in cutting off banks and banning Russian planes from our airspace but has lagged behind the US and the EU in imposing other sanctions. Unlike Brussels we have still to freeze the assets of the members of the Russian Parliament. Dozens of Putin’s cronies and high-ranking military have yet to be targeted. The Tories have allowed London to become the world’s laundromat for Russian dirty money. They have also taken millions in donations from people with ties to the Kremlin. If they are serious about putting pressure on the Russian regime they should widen sanctions andthe donations. The longer they take to act, the more the suspicion grows that they are still in thrall to the oligarchs.  The best of us While Vladimir Putin has shown the worst of humanity with his brutal invasion, the public response to his vile actions has shown the best of humanity. Millions of people have donated to charities to help the people of Ukraine and the hundreds of thousands made homeless by the war. Some volunteers have even driven to the Polish-Ukrainian border to deliver much-needed medical supplies, food, clothes and toys for children. Their compassion has never been more necessary.

There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing by Ms Chernukhin, who is a British citizen and has been legally entitled to make political donations since .The Mirror understands the first payment was for a table at the party’s notorious Black and White Ball fundraiser, where wealthy benefactors can rub shoulders with senior ministers and MPs while Boris Johnson rattles his donation tin to bolster party coffers.The second donation is understood to be a successful bid in the event’s auction, where the party sells access to cabinet ministers to the highest bidder.Ms Chernukhin has repeatedly paid for access to successive Prime Ministers ministers in the auction, including a cosy night out with Theresa May and a tennis match with Boris Johnson.Last yearaposs event saw an hour playing cricket with Rishi Sunak sold for £, - while a karaoke session with Foreign Secretary Liz Truss raised £,, though it’s not currently known what Ms Chernukhin’s cash bought her.In total Ms Chernukhin has given almost £ million to the party - and is the biggest female political donor in British history. The £, brings her total donations to the central party and inidual Tory MPs for  to £,. At Prime Ministeraposs Questions, Labour MP Bill Esterson called on Boris Johnson to agree to hand the £ million donated by Ms Chernukhin to charity.I know he doesnapost want to tar everyone with Russian links with the same brush, and neither do I, he said. But leaked documents show that Vladimir Chernukhin received  million from a Russian member of Parliament, an ally of Putin who was later sanctioned by the United States.Mr Esterson said this was an opportunity for the PM to end speculation over conflicts of interest and showing solidarity with the Ukrainian people. The Prime Minister responded to say it was vital to demonstrate that this is not about the Russian people, it is about the Putin regime.Vladimir Chernukhin served as Mr Putinaposs deputy finance minister in the early s, although the Conservative Party has said he had since fallen out of favour with the President.In , Ms Chernukhinaposs lawyer said: Mrs Chernukhin has never received money deriving from [the Russian MP referred to by Mr Esterson] or any company related to him.

Ukraine will prove the fatal, final mistake by a fascistic gangster who egotistically believed his own invincible propaganda after strategic triumphs in Crimea and Syria, and the  Trump and Brexit blows delivered to the US and UK. Vlad the Invader’s twitchy finger on the nuclear trigger and the offer of Potemkin negotiations are both signs even he fears this is an impending personal Armageddon. This is fuelled by brave Ukrainians fighting heroically and Russians courageously protesting “No to War”, which is inspiring resistance around the world. Supplying anti-tank, helicopter and aircraft missiles strengthens defenders and weakens attackers already suffering punishing losses. Britain, the rest of Europe and the US finally uniting over economic and cultural sanctions will eventually bankrupt the Putin machine and perhaps drive a deep wedge between the tyrant and his billionaire cronies who enjoy opulent luxury wherever they please.  And China abstaining instead of vetoing a UN Security Council motion by the US condemning the brutal invasion emphasised Putin’s isolation, as a new ally quickly distanced itself from an ageing, deranged dictator. The bloody conflict could still belong: reducing Ukrainian neighbourhoods to rubble, inflicting unbearable heartache and costing countless lives. What is becoming clearer, however, is that Putin is also likely to be one of the victims. But let’s not buy charlatan Boris Johnson’s propaganda that he is suddenly an international statesman, a Prime Minister orchestrating the resistance. Johnson let Putin walk all over him and Britain, with oligarchs smirking unconcerned whenever ruling Conservatives, reliant on Russian-linked money, talked tough then acted soft.Charismatic, cool-headed, defiant Ukrainian Volodymyr Zelensky is what a real leader looks and sounds like. Germany’s centre-Left Olaf Scholz is also rising to the occasion, standing up to Putin at considerable financial expense. A European Union that Johnson ripped Britain from as part of a career move was firmer on sanctions until shamed Johnson started running to catch up. Locking out Ukrainian refugees fleeing terror unless they apply to be fruit pickers is disgraceful and inhuman, when Poland, Romania and Hungary open their borders. Why not seize the spacious British properties of Russian oligarchs to house Putin’s casualties  I’ve watched and known Johnson for longer than the  years Putin has misruled Russia. So I’m aware of the cynicism of the great charlatan. From coronavirus to Brexit, our daily politics newsletter is there to guide you these turbulent times. The newsletter is sent out twice daily with the latest UK  world politics news, along with leading opinion and analysis.You can sign up here.  The first casualty of war is Partygate, with Johnson relieved that the shells and missiles are effectively providing a smokescreen. If he’s hit by a fine, the PM will pray it is today. Now wouldn’t be the moment to remove a lawbreaker in Downing Street, his apologists will argue. They’d be wrong, of course. Chamberlain was dumped by MPs to be replaced by Churchill during the Second World War then, before Japan finally surrendered, the country swapped Churchill for Attlee. Labour leader Keir Starmer will inevitably receive less airtime than the PM but should have calculated that he must be constructively critical rather than mercilessly pummelling the Tory rogue. War in Europe might save Johnsonnot an invaded country or Putin.

Helen Phillips, , claims she visited the GP  times over four years with ious dferent symptoms, but was never sent for a scan. She said: She said: I had  separate face to face or phone consultations and a iety of reasons were given.I was never offered a scan, yet the headaches were so bad I wanted to pull my eyeballs out.I knew something was wrong but didnapost know what  I could do. Helenaposs headaches became so severe sheaposd vomit and pass out - but it wasnapost until the mum from Selby, North Yorkshire, went for an eye test that she discovered the cause. For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here She recalled: My quality of le and health slowly deteriorated, to the point of being incapable of doing anything due to tiredness. By November  I was living like a zombie. After booking the eye test for .am, Helen says she was in the hospital by .pm. The optician noticed shadows and doctors later told me I had Grade  Olfactory Groove Meningioma, a slow growing, non-cancerous type of brain tumour, she said. I was so close to losing my sight and being paralysed.  I was like a zombie and the doctors at York said that I shouldnapost have been able to walk into the hospital. A week after receiving her terrying diagnosis, Helen had the tumour removed - and thankfully she didnapost need chemo or radiotherapy as it wasnapost cancerous. But doctors decided it was too risky to remove the entire tumour as part of it had become entwined with her optical nerves. Helen said: I have -% of the tumour left in and I now have annual scans to check for any regrowth or change.A year on from the operation, Helen has joined support groups of other people in the same situation and says sheaposs learned a lot. She thinks itaposs common for her symptoms to be mistaken for something less serious. When I look back itaposs easy to see the symptoms, she said. I suffered with flu-type symptoms, headaches and I couldnapost cope with noise, even the radio would drive me mad.I had unexplained aches and pains, vomiting, dizziness, tinnitus, bowel issues, anxiety, loss of sense of smell, hand tremors, tiredness and fainting. Helen gradually lost interest in socialising and lost her motivation - until she finally received her diagnosis. Looking back on when she was ill, Helen says her husband Duncan was her rock. For  months he did everything around the house and with the horses and other animals we have, she said. I was sleeping so much, I had no capability or interest in doing anything and that was really hard on those closest to me. She added anger and anxiety caused by the brain tumour impacted her relationships with loved ones.  None of us had any idea the real reason and I am angry that I suffered for so long because doctors failed to spot what was really going on. Helen added: I didnapost have depression, I had a brain tumour and it was infuriating to not get answers. My symptoms were constantly blamed on peri-menopause and I feel that I wasnapost taken seriously. She urged anyone who has experienced similar symptoms to push for a CT scan when they visit their doctor - and added the Brain Tumour Charity offers excellent support. It is so important to read this and be aware of symptoms and effects of a brain tumour. Low Grade Meningiomas are more common in women and especially women aged over . Now in recovery, Helen is able to enjoy her le again and is even able to work part time. She said: I am grateful to be alive, I have a new lease of le. I was numb and living in a zombie state.Do you have a real le story to share  Email jessica.taylor@reachplcMy skin was grey and I felt leless but now Iaposm back to my old self.

The RSPCA said its intake of bunnies has increased by a third with nearly  taken in last year, compared to  in .Vanessa Cunningham, director of care  veterinary Services at Wood Green, The Animals Charity, told how hers and other shelters are also at full capacity after seeing nearly a % increase. “Rabbits have been the most neglected pet species in the UK for many years, which has only been exacerbated by the overwhelming volume of rabbits that were bred and purchased during the pandemic,” she said.  “Many owners have now realised how much space and hard work rabbits require, or things have gotten out of controlthey inadvertently brought home an un-neutered male and female pair who began breeding.”There are an estimated , rabbits kept as pets in the UK. Google searches for ‘Rabbits for sale’ rose from , in April  to , in April .

RSPCA rabbit welfare expert Dr Jane Tyson said: “Despite rabbits often being perceived as an ideal ‘starter pet’, they actually have very complex needs and are one of the most neglected pets in Britain. “They also have long le spans of around - years so are a big commitment for a family. “It means sadly the RSPCA deals with many calls about bunnies where they have been neglected or abandoned each year.  “When rabbits are bought on impulse, an owner may not realise how complex they are to care for and what a commitment caring for rabbits can be. “Whilst they can be hugely rewarding pets full of personality, they also need lots of stimulation and - crucially - space to ensure their welfare needs are being met.” The RSPCA says that anyone who has done their research and is certain they can provide the time, space, money and care, to please consider adopting one of the many rescue rabbits in need of a home instead of buying.  These include Storm and Betty are a pair of bonded rabbits who have been looking for a home at Great Ayton Animal Centre near Middlesbrough for two months.

Squishy is one of eight bunnies at a rehoming centre in Worcester, which has a list of  waiting to come in, while Paprika is at the Leybourne Animal Centre in Kent, also full to capacity with rabbits.  How to look after bunnies Rabbits need lots of space.

Jordan Joseph Baker, , from Minffordd in Gwynedd, had been living in Surferaposs Paradise, a seaside resort in Queensland with his girlfriend Erin, having previously travelled around America working in summer camps and living his best le. But he died after climbing to the top of a church and falling through a skylight, an inquest in Caernarfon was told. Jordan had always wanted to live in Australia, with his family saying he was living his dream and was very happy, reported NorthWalesLive. On the day of the tragedy, in February , Jordan had been out with his friends watching a surfing competition before going out for drinks. They were walking back towards the hotel where one of the group, Mitchell Phillpotts was staying, when Jordan and Mr Phillpots decided to climb to the top of a church. Speaking during the hearing Mr Phillpotts said that he couldnapost say how the decision came about to climb the building but said that Jordan climbed on to the roof of a small building next door to the church, before they both made their way to the roof of the church. He told of how the pair climbed up together and stepped over a skylight on their way up before sitting at the top of the building for around  minutes . He said: He started to follow me back down. On the way back down, I stepped over the skylight as we had done on the way up. I donapost remember hearing anything, we were just talking at the time and then I didnapost hear him talking anymore. I turned around and he had fallen through the skylight. I donapost remember hearing glass break. Mr Phillpotts broke the door to the church to help Jordan who was on the ground unresponsive, before shouting to a friend to call the emergency services. Jordan was pronounced dead at the scene and the postmortem, carried out in Australia before his body was repatriated, showed that he sustained multiple injuries. In a statement read out during the inquest Jordanaposs mother, Jill Mawson, called her son as an amazing person who could was always full of energy and enthusiasm. She said: We want to remember our Jordan, not for how he died but for how he lived. He loved le and was an amazing son, grandson, brother, nephew, partner and friend. He was loved and adored by all who were lucky to know him. Jordan was so full of energy and enthusiasm and had a zest for adventure - he was happiest when climbing mountains, surfing and snowboarding. He loved getting to know people and had a genuine interest in peopleaposs lives and loved listening to peoples stories. His main goal was always to help anyone who needed help and support and he showered us all with his love. His smile could light up a room and his kindness and ability to see the best in everyone is what we are most proud of. He will always be our shining star and the love for our boy is forever strong. Acting senior coroner Katie Sutherland concluded that Jordan had died as the result of a tragic accident and went on to say that his death had been both unexpected and unintended. Ms Sutherland said: It brings home how tragic some things can end up. Jordan had clearly been living his best le and doing that he wanted to do. These are very tragic circumstances.After his death a Gofundme page was set up by his sister, Alicia Baker, along with the Jordan Baker Foundation with the idea of making a positive dference in peopleaposs lives.More than £, was raised in Jordanaposs memory through the site.An Instagram page - JB Travelling Tributes - was also set up with the family encouraging anyone that was influenced by Jordan to write his initials or a tribute to him on a rock, pebble, shell or leaf and leave it in a location while on a hike, visiting a beach, seeing a new city or travelling somewhere new. The picture of the tribute would then be added to the Instagram page to inspire others to travel and enjoy le in the way that Jordan did.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Inquests\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Privacy-loving Rosie and Christopher Taylor-Davies have lost a High Court battle after the roof extension Simon Cook built sparked complaints from the husband and we.They claim they have been forced to live in darkness with the curtains drawn after neighbour installed a Velux window facing directly into their bedroom from his substantial home next door. Mr Cook was not a party to the case, which was an attempt by judicial review by Mr and Mrs Taylor-Davies to get the council to take action against him. The couple said the fact the window did not use frosted glass meant they had to resort to getting undressed behind a bookcase, the only point on their top floor where they could not be seen from his new window.  And to add insult to injury, married dad Mr Cook installed a blonde mannequin dummy in the window, making it appear that it was watching over their home. At the High Court, a senior judge said it showed Mr Cook did not take his neighboursapos privacy concerns seriously, but ruled that he had not breached planning rules by installing an openable window with clear glass. The court heard Mr Cook had applied for planning permission for the rooflight and a dormer beside it as part of extensive works to his home, in Dover House Road, close to Richmond Park, in . The work involved a roof extension with dormer windows on both sides and at the back, but Mr and Mrs Taylor-Davies objected to elements of the project, calling the windows an invasion of their privacy. The Velux directly overlooks our bed, they said, claiming that they would be overlooked day and night on their top floor, where they sleep and shower, and Mrs Taylor-Davies studies for her PhD in embroidery.  In February , the local council, London Borough of Wandsworth, gave Mr Cook planning permission for his extension, but laid down conditions that the dormer window should have obscured glass and be non-opening. However, council planning officers waived those rules for the Velux, because it faces the sky and would have less impact on neighbours. Challenging the councilaposs decision not to take enforcement action to make Mr Cook obscure the rooflight glass, their barrister Stephen Whale argued before High Court judge, Mrs Justice Lang, that the window had robbed them of their privacy. The neighbouring houses are on a slope so that Mr Cookaposs is higher than theirs, meaning that anyone looking out of the rooflight would be able to see directly into the Taylor-Daviesapos top floor, including a clear-sided shower box. But despite knowing of their concerns, their neighbour had added insult to injury by sometimes positioning a blonde mannequin in the window, facing out onto their property, he continued. It serves to give the impression, as presumably he intends, that there is a person at the window overlooking their property and invading their privacy, he told the court. It only adds to their distress. The overlooking of their property and the invasion of their privacy as a result of the Velux window is very distressing to them.There is no good reason for the Velux window to have clear glass or be openable as there is another window very close on the opposite wall. There would be no loss of amenity to Mr Cook were the Velux window to have opaque glass and be non-openable. The only thing the Velux window overlooks is the top floor of the claimantsapos house. The barrister said the council had been wrong in refusing to take enforcement action against Mr Cook in relation to the window. Giving judgment, Mrs Justice Lang said: Mr Cook periodically installs a mannequin in the roof light which gives the impression that there is a person at the window looking out at [the claimantsapos home]. This suggests to me that he is not taking the claimantsapos concerns seriously, and so he is unlikely to maintain obscuring film voluntarily. But she said there was nothing in the planning conditions obliging him to obscure the rooflightaposs glass. They only required Mr Cook to obscure his new dormer window, she said. She also noted that Mr Cook had added an obscuring film to part of the rooflight, although adding that it could easily be removed. The couple, both New Zealanders, moved into their home beside Richmond Park  years ago and raised a family there.Mrs Taylor-Davies, , is a costume designer, who has worked in TV, film and theatre, as well as winning a local council award for her campaign to make protective scrubs for medics during the Covid- pandemic.Her husband, Mr Taylor-Davies, , is a technical consultant and software designer. Speaking from his home after the court hearing, Mr Taylor-Davies said the mannequin is no longer at her station by the window. Weaposve lived here for more than  years, but we might have to move out because of all this, he explained. We canapost take a shower or get dressed without being overlooked, he said, adding that their only option was to keep the curtains drawn. Itaposs essentially like living in darkness, he said.

Sean Williams wrote: It has double yellow on both side  What are they expected go down there  Chris Steele quipped: Good job they’ve put double yellows there.  And Rachel Ashley had this suggestion: Whoever put the yellow lines there, it needs to be a red route. Some drivers not familiar with Hanley’s roads have nearly been caught out by their sat-navs which have directed them to turn up the street. The Taxpayersapos Alliance has previously dubbed the lines as aposan unnecessary use of resourcesapos. Chief executive John OaposConnell told StokeonTrentLive in : “Anyone with commonsense can see that this was probably an unnecessary use of resources.  “Council tax is a huge bill for families and they wonapost be pleased to see it spent in this way.apos But at the time Stoke-on-Trent City Councilaposs highways department defended the double yellow lines on Bird Cage Walk which were put there around  years ago. Councillor Daniel Jellyman, cabinet member for regeneration, transport and heritage, said: “These double yellow lines were put down around the turn of the century. When they weren’t there, people actually parked on the road and left items there. The lane is clearly not accessible all the way along to most cars, but it is accessible some of the way and motorbikes, scooters and service vehicles can and do gain access to the entire . “If only one side of the road had double yellow lines, there would be nothing to stop a motorbike, for example, parking on the other side effectively blocking the public highway. “Although they might look a bit peculiar at first glance, experience has taught us that these restrictions are necessary. It is not uncommon to see this type of thing across the country.

Grace, , frantically fought to have her pet released back to her after being informed of the drastic decision five days in but was told because sheaposd signed him over she no longer had any say, she claims. Battersea said staff had concerns about Bearaposs behaviour during his brief time in its kennels and allegedly explained they didnapost have the time or resources needed to train him properly to a satisfactory level. Itaposs understood the dog did not bite or attack any people or animals while at the charity.Have you had a similar experience  Let us know at webnews@mirror It’s not what I wanted to do in the slightest but I physically had no other option, Grace told the Mirror, explaining why she gave him up. It’s gut-wrenching that I put my trust in a place that’s very well known and I have never heard a bad thing about Battersea until now. Within five days they’ve completely ruined a potential le. Bear had another  yearsnot more, and they’ve taken that away from him. During a routine inspection, months after the family adopted Bear, their landlord decided he could no longer stay at the property, classing him as a security dog, despite him being a regular pet. Grace, from Cambridgeshire, had looked at moving out so she could keep Bear but said she couldnapost afford anywhere  that allowed pets.After failing to persuade her landlord to re-consider and being unable to find a suitable adopter, she heavy-heartedly opted to move him to Battersea on January . On January  she was informed he would be put to sleep and he died on January . Grace said she understood Bear was a victim of abuse prior to her adopting him and would often get scared and bark at strangers. Dog behaviourist Blake Clark had one session with him when the family originally took him in and told the Mirror he was anxious but not remotely dangerous.Referring to how quickly a decision was made about Bear, Blake said heaposs worried it is a common thing.He believes staff possibly misunderstood Bearaposs initial reactiveness for aggression and the dog may have then simply become the victim of atick box exercise. For me, they didn’t understand behaviour for this to happen. For me, something’s gone massively wrong, he said. Grace said when she fought against the decision she was told they donapost have the time or resources to give Bear the amount of kennel training he needed, which she said rings alarm bells. She explained on signing him over Battersea assured her putting a dog down was a last resort and they have an unlimited time [for] training them.Basically, all the promises they’d made to me that he would have plenty of time, they didn’t give him that all, she said. Grace believes part of the issue was Bearaposs breed despite the charity assuring her during the intake process they donapost discriminate. They told me they didn’t get chance to do an assessment with him...so I don’t understand [how] in five days they’ve come to that conclusion. In an email the day after he arrived - seen by the Mirror - Grace says a staff member told her Bear was nervous but they would do everything they could to help him. Grace described Bear as very jumpy and he took a while to settle when faced with new people or in new environments. But that he was an amazing, kind, beautul, gentle dog. I have seizures and he was actually alerting me when I was going to have a seizure. He would go and get someone  to help orno one was around he would keep me safe, she said. Due to Bear being legally the property of Battersea once signed over, Grace and Blake claim they found it almost impossible to come to a compromise. Blake - a dog behaviourist for  years - offered to adopt Bear himself, or even travel down to London regularly to train him for free, but said he kept being met with barriers until it was too late. Grace said she was told releasing him would be dficult due to restrictions imposed - but they did not elaborate. It was very backwards and forwards about their policies, she said. In the email telling Grace the dog would be put to sleep - also seen by the Mirror - a member of staff referred to signicant concerns about Bearaposs behaviour. They said when attempting to take him out of his kennel to a secure exercise area he displayed strong reactions to staff on-site from a distance as well as dogs - but failed to give any specics.  The email went on to say in the following days he continued to display concerning reactions, which included growling and dficulty in recovering from those reactions even in low pressure situations and environments. It added the behaviour and kennel management teams discussed the issues and having considered all the options available to us we have come to the dficult decision to put Bear to sleep. Blake said some dogs are too far gone to be helped due to too much trauma and cannot overcome their aggressive behaviour - but doesnapost believe Bear was in that category. There’s a dference between reactive and aggressive. He was reactive in a sense that he would bark a lot and sometimes lunge but he has never bitten anyone before or during his time at Battersea, he said, having spoken to staff there. But on attempting to find out more about Bearaposs brief spell at the charity, he was allegedly told it was a data protection issue.Grace went on to say, when she dropped Bear off at Battersea, he barked at a behaviourist and they said donapost let him near me, take him back, dashing out of the room after a few seconds. She said staff then told her to walk Bear to his kennel herself. The day after Battersea informed her Bear would be put to sleep she was told heaposd been moved to a aposcaution kennelapos away from other dogs and was no longer allowed out for his daily exercise or other activities. I feel that when I took him down to the kennels they’d already made their mind up about what they were going to do, Grace said. When Grace requested she be given his ashes she was told that it is not something they normally do as they conduct multiple cremations at a time. Grace said: I got Bear after a very hard time for myself, so me and him were very attached - we had an amazing bond. You feel as though they are your child and I’ve let him down. Blake said he believes there needs to be big changes going forward across the rescue sector. I think rescues need to take time, obviously, maybe change the environment of a kennel because essentially kennels haven’t really changed in the last  years. He said they must do more to mimic the home environment so dogs feel at ease and have a fair chance, while those thinking of adopting puppies must first understand the work and patience needed. A spokesperson for Battersea said: There is no maximumof stay for any animal in our care. Our staff work with every animal to understand whether any problem behaviours can be resolved with time, training and care, and are determined to achieve a positive outcome. Regrettably, despite our best efforts working with Bear, he did not show signs of improvement and his signs of aggression towards people and other dogs increased. When a dog in our care shows signs of stress in kennels, we will consider every option available, including the possibility of sending a dog to stay in a foster home. Unfortunately, this option was not possible for Bear due to the worrying behaviour he consistently displayed around new people. They said a contact of Graceaposs visited Battersea and offered to foster him but the team felt it would not be responsible of them to allow it. The spokesperson said it was agreed Grace could reclaim himshe agreed to seek behavioural advice from an expert and take precautions. After two days considering her decision, Bear’s owner informed us that she would not be able to take him back and staff explained that Bear would be put to sleep as previously discussed. His owner agreed that this should happen as soon as possible. Grace said this conversation was after their decision email was sent and she felt pressured to agree as she was worried about Bearaposs quality of le in the aposcaution kennelapos. The spokesperson said the percentage of dogs in the charityaposs care put to sleep in  was  percent, compared to  the year before. However, they failed to provide a full breakdown. They also did not provide any specics regarding Bearaposs worrying behaviour or exactly what their policies are which would support opting to put a dog to sleep within five days.

Kate has teamed up with her stepmother-in-law Camilla to launch a new childrenaposs book club on the Duchess of Cornwallaposs Reading Room website, which has also just launched.To mark the occasion she told of her favourite childrenaposs books - including one that features a character that shares the same name as Princess Charlotte. Among Kateaposs recommendations is Charlotteaposs Web, which she says is loved in our house for obvious reasons and describes it as a charming story about friendship, loyalty and love.  Another is Stig of the Dump, which Kate reveals was recommended to her by her dad Michael and says resonates with her as she loved spending time outdoors, making dens, digging, discovering and making things out of odds and ends as a child. Kate also recommends the Katie Morag Series by Mairi Hedderwick, which she describes as captivating as well as the book Feelings, which she says is a wonderful way to help children understand and recognise their feelings and emotions. Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up .The final book on the list is The Owl Who Was Afraid of the Dark, which Kate says is a comforting story to help children face their fears and grow in confidence with the help of others.Kate is already known to be a fan of this book, as last month she read it when she appeared on CBeebies Bedtime Stories.  The book, by Jill Tomlinson, tells the story of baby barn owl Plop, who is helped by others to grow in confidence and overcome his fears. At the end of the reading, she added: “Wow, what an encouraging tale. “We can all feel scared sometimes just like our little owl friend Plop, but as Mrs Barn Own said, ‘It’s better to find out about the things that scare us before we make up our mind’. “And with the help of others, we can often face things that worry us. Now it’s time for bed. Night night and sleep tight.”Meanwhile, Camilla has long been an advocate of literacy and reading and last week exclusively wrote in the Mirror about the books she likes reading to her grandchildren.Among them is Gangster Granny - a story about a grandmother who plots to steal the Queen’s Crown Jewels from The Tower of London.

However, it seems a lot of thought actually goes into what Kate wears and she sometimes sends secret messages with her choices.And it appears when she and Prince William visited Wales earlier this week, she made a special effort with her earrings. The earrings were simple gold hoops that stood out against her bouncy, voluminous hair.  And it turns out they paid tribute to the place she was visiting - Wales - as they were made by a small Welsh jewellery brand called Spells of Love. The brand was founded by Hayley Jones, who runs the company with just her sister-in-law, and says each of her pieces is designed and ethically crafted with love and intention.

She told the Mirror: It was so lovely to see Her Royal Highness wearing them, it still feels very surreal!  I called my mum straight away, who then called all my family. It was incredibly exciting. She looked beautul and I am honoured to have Her Royal Highness wear our design. And not only was it a boost for Hayley, but she also says the impact itaposs had on her business has been amazing, with the earrings selling out within a day. She added: As a small business it has really helped put my company on the map. I have received orders from countries I would never have expected would ever know about my brand. It has helped my business immensely, Iaposm so grateful and honoured to have Her Royal Highness wear a design. Kate and William visited Wales in order to mark St Davidaposs Day - St David is the patron saint of Wales.During the trip, they learned about the importance of the agricultural industry for rural communities and how they celebrate the history of local regions.

Londonaposs underground system has already suffered walkouts over the course of the past week. Every line was impacted by a full strike on Tuesday, whilst many lines ran on a reduced service on Wednesday.Today, commuters can expect severe delays across all tube lines once more, as the RMT have announced a second day of full-scale strikes. “If you can, consider working from home on strike days,” advised London Underground bosses. However not everyone has such a luxury, and for those people — alternative routes are necessary. Here are the best ways to get about London when the tubes are down... Todayaposs tube strikes will take place from midnight until midnight. There will be further strikes tomorrow, March th, however these will be less severe and will mainly impact commuter times. How can I travel around London during strikes  Overground, train and tram services Although the underground will have severe delays, other TFL services will remain running. This means that the overground, trains and tram services will be working as normal. “Services will be running normally but will be busier than usual. Allow more time for your journey and consider alternatives,” says TfL. “If you are using services from stations also served by the Tube, check before you travel for possible station closures.” River buses  Often overlooked, the river bus can be a clever way to travel across London above ground whilst avoiding packed roads. Commuters can move across the capital from south to north, and even east to westusing the affordable river bus system.You can find TFLaposs river bus map online and use the strikes as an opportunity for a more exciting commute. Buses London buses will be running as expected on strike days, but commuters should factor in cramped conditions and longer waits as buses fill quickly and traffic jams cause delays. E-scooters Some London boroughs are trialling out e-scooters. These rentals are a clever and legal way to ride electric scooters around the city. You can catch a ride on these fun bike alternatives in:Camden City of London Ealing Hammersmith  Fulham Kensington and Cha LambethRichmond upon Thames Southwark Tower HamletsWestminsterSantander bikes Cycling is often quicker than catching the tube, and for those who donapost own a bike — Santander rentals are available across the city. There are  docking ports across London, and the fare is very reasonable . According to TFL, you should never be over  meters from a Santander bike port whilst in the city.Taxi Taxi services will be oversaturated with bookings, and traffic will be tense — so book at your peril. Allow more time for journeysyouaposre going by cab.

Michael decided to take out a funeral plan with the Hull-based Heavenly Services after friends recommended the company to him,GrimsbyLive reports .But the company fell into financial trouble in October following the sudden death of its founder and director Simon Woolston with branches in Hull, Bradford, Leeds, Scunthorpe, Grimsby and Bridlington forced to close.  Michael, , said he paid £, into the funeral service plan on Wednesday, June  last year, which included a cremation and for his ashes to be ed to his family. He said he has tried to get a refund from Heavenly Services but was told that because he paid in cash, he would be unable to recover the amount. Michael told Grimsby Live: I feel sick to death. I didnapost want a big fuss and just wanted to sort out my funeral. I can no longer afford my own funeral now because I donapost have that sort of money to put by now. That was everything I had. I have no-one to bury me or burn me. I have absolutely nothing. I suffer badly with anxiety and depression. Iaposm on medication three times a day just to keep me under control. They have left me with nothing but sadness and pain. Iaposve had to accept it because I have no choice. Michael is taking care of his mother who is seriously ill after having two strokes and developing Parkinsonaposs disease. The added stress has taken its toll on him and his -year-old mother. He said: Every time I see my mum, I just tell her that I donapost know whataposs happened. I donapost want to add any worry to her on top of what sheaposs already going through.  Mum suffers badly with health issues now along with a couple of strokes. Iaposm with her three times a day to make sure sheaposs cared for. She doesnapost need this added stress either. Itaposs so dficult because I donapost want to be that person who has a pauperaposs funeral because of this funeral service that has left me in the lurch. Itaposs just not right and now I canapost afford to be buried. Michael is just one of many customers struggling to get funeral money repaid.Bernard Skerrett, , died in October having contracted Covid- as well as suffering from Parkinson’s and an asbestos-related disease.Nikki McLoughlin, Bernardaposs daughter, told Hull Live that her parents had arranged cremation plans back in . After her father had passed away in October, a woman from Heavenly Services told her they were to aposcease trading with all the assets being frozenapos. The woman then suggested Nikki should find new funeral directors. An elderly couple said in October they were left in limbo and feared they could lose £, after paying up front for two cremation plans through Heavenly Services. The couple –  and  years old – said they had not heard what is happening with their cremation plan and whether they would get a refund. An insolvency firm last week all but confirmed to Hull Live that customers will not get their money back. Letters were sent out by insolvency firm Auker Rhodes informing customers Heavenly Services was to enter liquidation. Auker Rhodes said all company assets would be recovered and sold for the benefit of creditors. Humberside Police started an investigation in November after confirming they had received complaints from customers who had been affected by Heavenly Services.They told reporters today that their aposinvestigation into these reports continuesapos.

Long before Meghan married Prince Harry, she was an actress, best known for her role as paralegal Rachel Zane, on the legal drama series Suits.Meghan also starred in an episode of the US TV series, Castle, in , in which she plays Charlotte Boyd, a woman who is linked to two of her murdered friends.

IMDb to the rescue! It was Meghan Markle! Not only that, it was ironically a fairytale themed episode, and in her first scene she was dressed as a princess. I think Castle would describe Meghan Markle being in the episode based on fairytale characters princesses a bit ironic, said a third viewer. As another person put: Meghan Markle was on an episode of Castle, which was produced by ABC Studios, which is owned by Disney, which is why Archieaposs birth certicate doesnapost just reveal that she is a princess but a full-on Disney princess thank you for stumbling into my Ted Talk. When Meghan first started dating Harry she was determined to keep things on the down-low while she worked outhe was The One. And the pair successfully did that for five months, before the secret was out and their perfect, private bubble burst. When the press found out about them, the realisation that this was aposher new leapos terried Meghan, claims royal journalists, Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand. In their unofficial biography Finding Freedom, the authors said: Prior to meeting Harry, the only times she experiences cameras were on a set or on a red carpet. Shortly after the news broke, a photographer from an LA-based photo agency had scaled the fence into her back garden and waited for Meghan by her car, hoping to get a picture before she headed out to run errands. Meghan was terried and called the police. aposThis is how itaposs always going to be, isnapost it apos, she said to a friend.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

Dan was enjoying a cup of tea at his open patio door at around pm when he was shocked to see a “big, round light” floating in the sky, Cornwall Live reports.He claims the object, which appeared much bigger to the naked eye, moved “faster than any satellite” and changed direction in a way that defied physics. “It looked like it was on fire,” Dan said, “But there’s no way it was a meteor or anything. It changed direction, horizontally in front of me then changed direction again out to see.  “I was just hypnotised, staring at it wondering, what the hell. “Then I went to get my phone, which took me about  seconds,” and by the time I got it out I could only get three small lots of footage. “I thought: ‘that’s some sort of weird bloody spacecraft.’” Dan said it appeared much larger to the naked eye than his video and images look. He also explained that the floating object moved around “very quickly,” much more so than any boat, plane or satellite.“I couldn’t get my head around it,” he continued, “It just looked like the bloody sun. It was huge. “Whatever it was, could have better technology, might have been in space going the speed of light. I wouldn’t bother it. “Never seen anything like it in my le.” Photos taken of the orb show it to be orange, slightly distorted-looking, and video footage taken by Dan shows it looking to be moving across the sky.  Askedhe’d ever seen what he thought to be a UFO before, Dan said: “There was one thing, actually, about  years ago, it was around here too- with my mate in a field.“It was winter, there was definitely a spacecraft. “I’ll admit we did have a smoke, and I said ‘Ollie look at that’. Went up and down, doing a triangle. Then it just went woosh away.” Dan said he felt sympathy for people who spot these sightings because they often get mocked on social media. However, he insisted that people who leave such comments would change their mindthey saw something like what he did.

Norovirus is highly contagious and causes vomiting and diarrhoea, but normally does not last much more than a couple of days.The virus spreads very easily in public places such as hospitals, nursing homes and schools where tiny particles of vomit or excrement enters a persons nose or mouth.The advice comes after routine surveillance in England shows that the number of outbreaks caused by the vomiting bug has increased in recent weeks.  From the four week period from end January to February, numbers are on the increase in educational settings and in care homes. Norovirus is highly infectious and causes vomiting and diarrhoea but usually passes in a couple of days. It is easily transmitted through contact with infected iniduals or contaminated surfaces. The increase in reported outbreaks was initially in educational settings, particularly in nursery and childcare facilities, with % more incidents reported to UKHSA than would be expected. Reports of norovirus outbreaks in care home settings have also increased in recent weeks, with a rise from  reported in week to  reported in week of .  While outbreaks reported in care home settings overall remain below pre-pandemic expected levels, it is likely they will continue to increase in the coming weeks, they say. Professor Saheer Gharbia, Gastrointestinal Pathogens  Food Safety Directorate, UKHSA, said: Norovirus, commonly known as the winter vomiting bug, has been at lower levels than normal throughout the pandemic but as people have begun to mix more, the numbers of outbreaks have started to increase again. Symptoms include sudden onset of nausea, projectile vomiting and diarrhoea but can also include a high temperature, abdominal pain and aching limbs.The six main symptoms Vomiting Watery diarrhoea Feeling sick Aching arms and legs A high temperature A headache How to reduce the spread of norovirus:Stay at homeyou are experiencing norovirus symptoms, the UK Health Security Agency say. Do notto work or send children to school until  hours after symptoms have cleared. Also avoid visiting elderly or poorly relatives, particularlythey are in hospital or a care home. Wash your hands frequently and thoroughly with soap and warm water. Alcohol hand gels don’t kill norovirus. When an infected person vomits, the droplets contaminate the surrounding surfaces. A bleach-based household cleaner or a combination of bleach and hot water should be used to disinfect potentially contaminated household surfaces and commonly used objects such as toilets, taps, telephones, door handles and kitchen surfaces. If you are ill, avoid cooking and helping prepare meals for others until  hours after symptoms have stopped, as norovirus can be spread through food contaminated by the virus when food is handled by symptomatic people infected iniduals. Wash any contaminated clothing or bedding using detergent and at °C, andpossible, wear disposable gloves to handle contaminated items. What to doyou have norovirus You are required to isolate by yourself at home until  hours have passed since the last time you were sick, doctors say.The NHS warned: “Stay off school or work until you have not been sick or had diarrhoea for at least  days.This is when youaposre most infectious. “Do not visit hospitals or care homes during this time.” The virus can survive outside the body for several days on contaminated food and so it is important for people to wash their hands regularly, especially before eating. People are most infectious from when symptoms start until  hours after all symptoms have passed. You may also be infectious for a short time before and after this.

Since Harry and we Meghan Markle quit as senior royals and started a new le in Calornia in , the prince has only ed to Britain twice. Both of those times he came alone with Meghan staying at home with son Archie, who also hasnapost ed to the UK since moving to the US. Meanwhile, the coupleaposs eight-month-old daughter Lilibet, who was born in Calornia, has never been to Britain - nor has she met her great-grandmother the Queen or grandfather Prince Charles.Later this year, Harry is releasing a tell-all memoir that is promised to be accurate and wholly truthful.Sources say there is a tsunami of fear within royal circles about what Harry will say in the bombshell book.And royal author Tom Bower says given the upcoming book, he doesnapost think Harry willto the UK this year.

He told Closer magazine : I think Harry won’t come back because he knows he cannot face his family, and be pleasant with them, knowing what he’s written about them in that book.“That book will have a lot of casualties and cause a lot of hurt. It will really deliver, as Harry knows it has to, to justy the money he’s been paid to do it. How can Harry come back and pretend it’s all fine  The worst of what he will say is yet to come.” Last month, Mr Bower, who is currently writing a biography of Meghan, also claimed she has no plans toto the UK as Britain is a lost cause for her. Writing in the Sun, he said: At the moment, Meghan’s ultimate destination is unclear, but she certainly has the backing to make a bid to star as an American politician. In parallel, Britain is a lost cause for the Sussexes. In truth, I suspect Meghan no longer cares whether she is welcome in London. She has no intention of ing. However, he does point out that while public opinion about Meghan in the UK might not be favourable - in the US she is still admired. He adds that Harry and Meghanaposs mini-tour of New York last year was deemed a success and that she has solid support among Democrats, minorities and the young.Mr Bower is one of the countryaposs most well-known biographers, having released in-depth unauthorised le stories of famous figures like Richard Branson and Boris Johnson.He also isnapost a stranger to writing about royal figures as he released Rebel Prince: The Power, Passion and Defiance of Prince Charles in .Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Prince HarryMeghan MarkleRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Putin raised the awful spectre of nuclear confrontation because he’s losing, or at least not winning as easily as he expected. His calamitous miscalculation in invading Ukraine is backfiring badly now, and the world is uniting against him. He faces a battle at home too, as anti-war protests swell in Moscow and other cities. The pressure on Putin must be intensied, never relaxed, until he has withdrawn the last of his forces from the country he attacked.  And then he must face judgement. He must be held to account for an unforgivable assault that will cost many lives on both sides, including civilians. Many more are being forced to flee their homes in terror. Britain has sent military equipment and is picking up speed on sanctions but much more can be done to help Ukraine. Oligarchs close to Putin must be pursued relentlessly.

Traditionally, royal mothers didnapost breastfeed their babies, but all that changed when the Queen welcomed her own children, as royal historian Amy Licence told .Royal breastfeeding mothers are a relatively new phenomenon, Licence explained. Historically, most royal mothers did not always believe that breast was best. In fact, in some cases, it was considered at best an inconvenience, at worst, downright harmful. Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up. This meant that the majority of royal babies were handed over to a wet nurse . As for why royals avoided breastfeeding, Licence explained that: Royal women were often little more than symbolic figures, delivering child after child to secure a dynasty. This was particularly important in times of high infant and child mortality when the production of second, third and fourth sons was crucial.Breastfeeding offers a degree of contraceptive protection, so with their babies being fed by others, Queens were free to resume their duties and begin the process of conceiving the next heir. The Queenaposs daughter-in-law Princess Diana also decided to breastfeed as well, and later the Duchess of Cambridge. Princess Diana insisted on nursing William and Harry herself, Licence revealed, adding that both Kate and Prince William frequently mentioned they were keen to take a hands-on approach with their little ones.The Queen also had a big influence on Prince Louisapos official name. William and Kateaposs youngest child was born on April , , and the proud new parents named him Louis Arthur Charles. Like his older siblings, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, Louis doesnapost have a surname and is formally known as His Royal Highness Prince Louis of Cambridge.But his HRH title was far from certain thanks to a longstanding rule put in place by King George V, reports the Express.In , he set out guidance on which royals were allowed to have titles. It was decided then that only those closest to the top of the line of succession would be automatically granted titles. King George V decided that only the sovereignaposs children would automatically become a Prince or Princess, as well as any grandchildren born through the male line. But great-grandchildren were not included. So the Queen stepped in and overturned this for Prince George, and for all of William and Kateaposs children. If the Monarch didnapost make the change, itaposs likely that Louis would have been Master Louis Cambridge or Master Louis Windsor instead.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

After a milder week with the mercury rising during the day widespread freezing temperatures are set to hit in mid March.Brits will need to wrap up warm as a apossnowbombapos is expected to bring as much as four inches of snow an hour for parts of central and northern Scotland, according to weather maps for March .There will also be flurries theof the country continuing for over a week with more than  centimetres falling on March , as the cold snap sweeps in from Scandinavia and across the North Sea in what is dubbed the “beast from the east”. It will also be bitterly cold with -C temperatures on March  in Scotland and it will drop below zero for the whole country. Polar winds are currently causing icy temperatures across Eastern Europe which is making conditions worse for the thousands of refugees who are fleeing Ukraine following the Russian invasion.BBC weather forecaster Chris Fawkes said: “Looking at the weather charts for next week and the area of high pressure starts to slip across Scandinavia and into west Russia.“What happens is that we start to develop easterly winds so the should be a fair amount of dry weather and sunshine but cold winds will develop as the week goes by.”  Before that looking to the end of this week it is set to be milder and wet. Met Office forecaster Clare Nasir, looking at Thursday, said:A windy start to the day across eastern Scotland from clearer skies across Shetland, even some sunshine before we see some clouds and rain. Patchy rain for eastern Scotland and then this band of persistent rain particularly on the upfloats of the higher ground.  By this point you can see some drier weather coming in across the south east of Northern Ireland, west Wales, the west country eventually seeing even some brighter weather and certainly some slices of sunshine for the south east of England. This will migrate to East Anglia during the afternoon. So this band of rainis fairly slow moving.” UK forecast for the next  days Today: Largely cloudy, with outbreaks of rain in many western parts, slowly moving east to be replaced by clearer skies already in far west. Some sunny breaks in eastern, especially southeastern parts. Windy at first in the north. Mild, especially southeast. Tonight: Rain continuing to slowly move east, clearer skies following with a few showers for western coasts. Light winds, frosty under clearing skies with chance of patchy freezing fog by dawn. Friday: Cloudy with further rain for many eastern areas, sunny spells and isolated showers in the west. Showers possibly heavy for a time in the southwest. Light and iable winds. Outlook for Saturday to Monday: Further rain across central and eastern areas. Dry, where with some sunshine. Drier conditions developing more widely on Sunday and Monday. Colder than recently, with patchy overnight frost.

Marian van Overwaele, , had refused to pay a bill relating to a bridalwear business she ran in . Her debt soon spiralled to £, and she was was subsequently made bankrupt in . Now, the long-running legal wrangle over £m Knockderry Castle in Argyll Scotland, has concluded as officers took control of the building on behalf of trustees. She has spent the last two decades appealing attempts to have her removed but earlier this year she lost her bid to take the case to the Supreme Court. Mrs van Overwael was not there when the eviction took place but her family insist the fight is not over. She transferred ownership of the mult-million pound mansion to her brother George Amil and has continued to live there with him.He spoke outside at the A-listed castle and told the BBC : This is our house. I paid for it. I worked hard in this house. This decree is not against me. We just ended up homeless, I donapost know where we are going to go now. It is a giant miscarriage of justice, someone has been sequestrated for £ that was already paid, but the whole matter is a conspiracy and a cover up. It is so bad and a shame. We are going to keep fighting.  Mrs van Overwaele transferred ownership of the mult-million pound mansion to her brother and has continued to live there with him. In September , sherf officers and police arrived to evict Mrs van Overwaele after costs related to her bankruptcy spiralling to £,. However, the pensioner appealed the eviction notice and was given more time to pay. Judges at the Court Of Session upheld an earlier decision last July to allow the bankruptcy trustee, George Lafferty, go ahead with the eviction. The law lords ruled against Mrs van Overwaele and her brother because the pair failed to attend court without proper excuse. They had claimed they were unwell, but this was not accepted by the court, with the pair going on to appeal the ruling.

Lily Nova, , from St Louis, Missouri, US, says she had her first encounter at the end of  after taking up astrophotography to cure lockdown boredom.But the encounters did not stop there, with Lily now claiming the extraterrestrial beings visit her on a daily basis. Theyaposve approached her in all manner of spacecraft, including metallic ships, black triangles and orbs that move in an unearthly way, she claims. She also says she knows what some of the beings look like.  She first started getting into astrophotography in the summer of  during the lockdown which eventually led to her first encounter with aliens just a few months later, in November. She said: My first encounter with aliens and UFOs was very intense. I went outside for some fresh air one night and I immediately locked eyes with bright light hovering over the neighbourhood.I started investigating and realised it was a UFO. Seconds later I looked away briefly and when I looked back there was a second craft that was much closer.I could actually see the triangular shape of the craft. The UFOs did some impressive manoeuvres to show me that it wasnapost a regular aircraft before they disappeared above me. It really spooked me because aliens and UFOs arenapost something I have thought about much before. It was a total reality shting experience.A couple of months later I had my second encounter. After that, it kept happening more frequently and now I am having experiences daily. During my encounters I have also been able to see what the beings look like. One of the first beings I saw was a girl with light blue skin. She had no hair, but she was very beautul. She was wearing a skin tight grey suit and I saw her ship mates standing behind her in the same unorm. I have also seen another group of beings with light blonde hair, fair and glowing skin and bright blue eyes. I believe they send images of themselves to me through telepathy. I think they are easing me into an introduction as it would be such a shocking experience for any human to have an alien walk up to you. Lily believes that the aliens were testing the waters with her after her first shocking encounter as she says they were motioning towards her and knew she was recording. She thinks that they then gave her some space to process the experience before appearing to her again.  Lily added: My encounters have been very close from the start. I could not believe what I was seeing, it was groundbreaking and it piqued my interest in astrophotography even more. I needed to find out as much as possible. I abandoned my career as a nutritionist because it was overtaken by my passion for finding out more about UFOs and aliens. Itaposs not something I ever expected to happen.The shock of my encounters with the UFOs eventually turned to comfort as I had more and more experiences.It felt like I was developing a relationship with them.These experiences have changed everything for me. It has totally changed my view of the world and I have learnt so much about the cosmos and other beings. I have been focusing on spreading awareness of what I have found. Lily now believes that she can invite these experiences with aliens and UFOs when is she is in a relaxed, open and blissful state of mind. She says that she has even developed a sixth sense and intuitive gut feeling for when they are going to appear to her. Lily added: Whenever I am out doing my creative passion, astrophotography, this is when I believe I can make contact and invite these encounters. During my first initiated contact, where I have invited them instead of them just showing up, I even received a vision of being on the space ship and of the ships crew members. I have been out with a friend who is experienced in meditation, and we set our intention for them to appear to us, and within five minutes of getting out the car, a bright golden orb appears and was moving around to our questions. Since the shock wore off, I just feel joy, love and peace. They are such beautul and positive experiences, sometimes I even ball my eyes out crying while itaposs happening. I believe that they come to me because I believe in them, I am open-minded and I am welcoming towards them. It has been fascinating to learn about the universe and to create the incredible connection that has been formed.

I guess we’ll never know! “It is starting to fade now and we’re sure she’ll be back to her wonderful white colouring soon. “But we loved her golden paws so much that we decided to name her Marigold as it looks like she’s got her gloves on for a spring clean.” The “sweet but sensitive” pooch is looking for a quiet home with patient owners who can give her lots of time and space so she can settle into her new le. Rachel added: “As Marigold was a stray we know very little about her and we don’t believe she’s lived in a home before. “So she’ll need owners who can give her time to settle. “She can find meeting new people quite scary but eventually builds up the courage to say ‘hello’. “Once she gets to know you and trusts you she enjoys attention. “When she first arrived she had no idea what to do with toys so we don’t think she’s ever had her own toys before. “But she’s learned to love squeakers and really enjoys a good game of fetch. “Marigold is such a sweetheart and we’re sure she’ll bloom in the right home. “If you can give her a chance, you’ll be rewarded with a loving companion to share your le with.” If youaposre interested in rehoming Marigold - or any other animals at Bath Cats and Dogs Home - contract their team on   or email them via rehoming@bcdh.org.uk.

Despite the major mistake, the woman has been trying to see the positive side of her tattoo, and confessed that her brother once also made the same mistake when he was little, so the spelling error does actually have meaning as an inside family joke. She added: When we were little, my brother signed my dad up for a magazine subscription and spelt his name like this so itaposs kind of like an inside family joke.  When I told my mum about it she was like aposyeah and now the tattoo has even more meaning.aposAnd Kimberly has no hard feelings toward her tattoo artist - who texted her an apology as soon as he found out what heaposd done. She said: Iaposm not upset. I texted the tattoo artist and he was like, aposOh my god, Iaposm so sorry!apos Mumaposs name [Kristian] looks perfect and beautul. We were so super focused on getting that spelling right thataposs how we glazed over the misspelling of my fatheraposs name. These things happen. Itaposs not just the spelling mistake that has people talking in the comments either, as the error now makes the name look like it says something  entirely - with people seeing Thor, Thorn, and Thon in the cursive lettering. Other commenters, meanwhile, just wanted to share their sympathy with Kimberly. One said: I’m glad it all worked out!

The vessel was in breach of EU sanctions on implementing massive sanctions, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said. The move came as western states are implementing massive sanctions, including asset freezes, against Russia for invading its neighbour Ukraine.The incredible ship is valued at £m, according to VesselsValueMr Sechin is a long-term ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, and was in  described as the second most powerful man in Russia.Follow the latest updates from Ukraine in our live blog  A separate near- million luxury yacht owned by Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov has also been seized, by German authorities, Forbes reported. The Dilbar, which Mr Usmanov purchased in , has the largest swimming pool ever installed on a yacht. The -metre Amore Vero arrived in La Ciotat on Jan  and was due to stay there until April st for repairs, the finance ministry said in a statement, adding that the vessel was subject to the new sanctions. But on Wednesday, customs officers noted the yacht was taking steps to sail off urgently, without the repair works being over, the statement said, adding that the officers therefore decided to seize it.  The finance ministry said the yacht belongs to a company whose main shareholder is Sechin, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin. The superyacht was built by Oceanco in the Netherlands and delivered to its owner in , according to yachtcharterfleet. It says its onboard features include a beauty salon and gym. It sails under the flag of the Cayman islands, according to Eikon data. Thank you to the French customs officers who are enforcing the European Unionaposs sanctions against those close to the Russian government, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said in a Tweet.At least five other superyachts owned by Russian billionaires have arrived in the Males, according to ship tracking data. Separately, French authorities on Thursday also seized a Russian-owned cargo vessel in the port of Lorient, Brittany. The Russian invasion of Ukraine will get worse as major cities come under more indiscriminate bombing, French President Emmanuel Macron fears following a phone call with Vladimir Putin. The warning came during a day of continued attacks on cities including Kyiv and Kharkiv, which have suffered intense damage. Attempts to seize both cities have failed so Kremlin forces have instead resorted to heavy bombing, causing thousands of civilian casualties.

But by the time I was on the case, the disease was spreading closer to home # in forests near Loch Carron, Ross and Cromarty.Phytophthora, ominously meaning #plant destroyer#, is a genus of fungus-like organisms containing around  known species with a worldwide distribution.The genus, which includes the pathogens that cause potato blight and sudden oak death, has been responsible for massive crop failures, economic loss and environmental damage.Phytophthora are called #fungus-like# since they behave like fungi but dfer from them, and from all animals and plants, in several key features of their reproduction and chemical makeup.This places them in an ill-defined group of misfits called protists, which also includes amoebae, kelp and slime moulds.Phytophthora pluvialis was discovered in Oregon USA in , where it resides in soil and watercourses, and mainly infects Douglas fir.Its recognition in Cornwall during  was the first identication of this particular Phytophthora species in Europe.Thought to have arrived here on imported live plants, its spores germinate in water and can be spread, for instance, on shoes, tyres and animal paws.The pathogen infects a iety of trees, including western hemlock, Douglas fir and several pine species, causing needle shedding, shoot dieback and lesions on the branches, trunks and roots of infected trees.Forestry and Land Scotland and its policy section Scottish Forestry took rapid action # surveillance to detect infected forests, restrictions on the movement of timber and trees, and asking the public to report suspicious tree lesions.But since the European climate is ideal for P pluvialis to thrive, and its favoured trees are commonly grown here, like so many other plant pathogens, it seems likely that this one is here to stay for the long term.Forestry and Land Scotland asks foresters and the public to be vigilant for signs of Phytophthora pluvialis.Anyone who thinks they might have spotted signs of the disease should report it using the online TreeAlert system on the on www.forestresearch.gov.uk website."},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead pupils serve up success","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowLochgilphead Joint Campus hosted a successful first badminton championship in the first week of February, with  players taking part.S : girls, Tegan Stewart and boys Liam Cook S girls, Emma Plummer and boys Rhys Coffield Senior girls, Jasmine McPhie and boys Archie MacColl-Smith.PICS:Receiving their trophies from head teacher Ann Devine are senior winners Jasmine McPhie, left, no_a_LHS_badminton and Archie MacColl-Smith no_a_LHS_badmintonDoubles action in full swing in the school gym. no_a_LHS_badminton"},{"url":null,"title":"kilberry loop sportive announced","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowThe popular Kilberry Loop Sportive will take place on Saturday August  this year.Organised by Mid Argyll Triathlon and Cycle Club and local man John Hardie, the -mile open road event starts and finishes in Tarbert.Registered as an event with British Cycling, the fun, friendly Kilberry Loop Sportive is targeted at every level of cyclist.

This is particularly good advice for anyone with a veg plot.A sowing plan of what seeds and how many to sow each month is key to successful growing and means you won#t be throwing out unwanted seedlings and that your flower and veg beds will be full all year round.A word of warning about sowing direct into the ground at this time of year there may be a few sunny days to enjoy outside but the soil can still be chilly, making germination and survival hard.Sowing indoors is a better option. Not only does it provide a warm environment for germination, but seeds and seedlings are easier to protect from pests. If you can find some environmentally sound sowing trays and containers, rather than using plastic, that#s even better. Paper and cardboard pots can be packed snugly in a tray which avoids over handling and makes them easy to water.Small seeds should be scattered sparingly on the surface of compost filled seed trays then covered with a sprinkling of sieved compost. If the seeds are big enough to handle, you can sow them inidually into cm pots. The quantity should be according to the instructions specied on the seed packet, but usually for small seeds between five and  seeds per pot. For plants that grow long roots, such as peas or beans, you can put them into a compost filled cardboard toilet roll tube and, once ready, they can be planted outside, tube and all.Most seeds will germinate and grow in a warm setting such as a greenhouse, cold frame or on a sunny windowsill. You should keep them damp by using a mist spray to start with before moving onto a watering can with a fine rose nozzle.Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots. Simply ease out a clump of seedlings with an old cutlery fork or dibber and # handling only the leaves to avoid damaging delicate stems and roots # gently tease them apart. Drop inidual seedlings into a five-centimetre compost filled newspaper pot ensuring the lower leaves are above the compost level. Once you see roots appearing from the bottom of the pot, it’s time to pot on to a bigger pot before planting outside once the weather and soil warms up.If you are growing your own veg, now is a good time to sow first early potatoes. These can be planted from mid-March, however planting times will y across the country according to temperature and risk of frost. Early potatoes grow well in the ground and in containers such as potato grow bags or old compost bags. You should plant your chitted potatoes with the shoots facing upwards in soil with plenty of well-rotted organic matter, approximately cms deep and cms apart.Once stems are about cms tall, they will need earthing up by drawing soil around them to create a cm high ridge, to protect against frost and keep growing potatoes covered. Good ieties of early potatoes are: Swt # good for containers, white skinned and white fleshed Annabelle # nutty flavour with firm waxy yellow flesh and Maris Bard # white flesh with good #new potato# flavour and drought resistance.Spring seems tantalisingly close in March, particularly as work in the garden starts to get going again.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring usually arrives by mid-March and the frequent sunny days provide the opportunity for an increasing range of gardening tasks.

The proposed three per cent increases for fees and charges are also far lower than current inflation rates.#It is also important to remember that the council itself will have to manage increased costs and pressures in terms of service delivery.#The budget also agreed to raise Argyll and Bute#s council tax by three per cent in April.Councillor Currie said: #Like many other Scottish councils we have followed the Scottish Government’s guidance in relation to the three per cent rise in council tax. It is a decision we have considered extremely carefully and taken with some reluctance.#In the current climate, this is undoubtedly one of the decisions over which we have deliberated the longest. Ensuring families who need it are still able to receive the support was of the utmost importance.#The delivery of the £ rebate to thousands of households is a key element of this. We can also look carefully at how we distribute our share of the £ million funding support for people on lower income, announced just a few days ago.#Councillors also backed plans to spend £, on street lighting, and £, on new litter bins across the area, as part of the authority’s budget for the year.Also part of the budget will be £, to keep seasonal public toilets open all year round, and £, to suspend off-street parking charges for the two weeks before Christmas.Staycation funding for the area will also be boosted by a further £, while investment in the area’s roads will rise to £million, with a further £, allocated to active travel.Speaking about the opposition#s proposal for an entrepreneur business improvement fund to provide support to small to medium businesses Councillor Lynch said: #The pandemic has impacted on the council, tourism, businesses and people. We are all aware that tourism is an economic driver for Argyll and Bute.#It is essential that we invest in the Argyll and Bute brand to maximise the tourism opportunities. It needs to recover, and businesses need to recover to pre-pandemic levels.

Jaminet missed the conversion.A challenge by Jaminet on Stuart McInally then had the Scots fans raging. Initially, referee Karl Dickson allowed play to continue but after checking with the TMO awarded Scotland a penalty and ruled that was sufficient sanction.Ali Price appeared to be over for Scotlands first try, in spite of a high tackle but the ball had not been grounded.Scotland were now camped in the French  and from Nick Haining’s surge, Price fed former Southern Knight Rory Darge who crashed over for his first try for Scotland on his first start. Russell converted.Scotland then missed a great chance when Chris Harris threw a miss-two pass to Stuart Hogg but, agonisingly the ball spilled it forward and a golden try chance was lost for Scotland.Just before the break France extended their lead when Fickou beat the tackles of Price and Haining to touch down at the corner flag and Jaminet converted from the touchline.France extended their lead shortly after the break when a kick forward bounced awkwardly into the path of Jonathan Danty who ran in for the bonus point try. Jaminet grabbed the extras..removePenaud then romped in for try number five and although Jaminet missed the conversion everyone knew the game was lost.France added a sixth try in  minutes after Romain Ntamack’s cross-field kick, found Penaud who had a simple task.Scotland did pull back a try at the death after Blair Kinghorn’s break was rounded off by van der Merwe, who dotted down his tenth try for his country.

He said: “Those who serve our country in the armed forces are truly the best of us. It is absolutely right that non-UK service personnel are given the recognition they deserve.

I know that non-UK personnel have been an integral part of these operations.“It is vital that those serving or who have served in our armed forces feel valued. I am pleased to see the UK Government taking more steps to make this happen.“Last week’s update to immigration rules will also encourage personnel to consider staying in the armed forces for longer,

busy schedule for us.Regarding plans to demolish flats in a sensitive area of the town, as reported in last week#s front page article #Have a say on planned Dalintober demolition#, these are iconic buildings in terms of the aesthetic value they bring to the town#s outstanding seafront location.I fully understand the need to reduce housing stock, in line with a declining population, but previously demolished buildings in adjacent areas – Saddell Street and Queen Street – are now unsightly gap-sites.Local opinion is important, given what has happened in the wake of recent housing demolition. There is concern, often heard in local conversation and frequently discussed on Facebook, of what might happen in the latest round of town planning.To be fair, plans are afoot to replace the same with modern housing – probably less stock to suit the demands that exist in the town at the moment – however, it is really important any proposed build be sensitive in design to suit this prime parkland location, an area fronting onto Kinloch Park and town#s seafront Esplanade.I share this concern, given the results of previous demolition, but also hope any future plans will include thoughts to increase housing stock, this in line with greater employment opportunities and rising population levels.I am appealing to people throughout the region to support my Right to Food Bill proposal before the consultation closes on Wednesday February .In the wake of Ofgem#s eyewatering increase in the energy price cap last week, which will see already struggling households having to wrestle between paying for heating or paying for food, the Right to Food has never been more needed.If the SNP and the Greens hadn#t played party politics and kicked my Bill back, we could have already been working on ensuring the Right to Food is enshrined in Scots law.Instead, we are having to re-consult at a time when the country is already grappling with a cost of living crisis.On Thursday, Ofgem announced that from April the energy price cap would rise  per cent to £, – that is an extra £ households will have to find just to keep their homes warm and the lights on.Forthcoming increases to the interest rate and rises in National Insurance payments will exacerbate the situation.It is heart-breaking. I have had food bank helpers in tears saying we can#t wait another year for the Right to Food to kick in. People need help now.Food bank volunteers need assurance that the invaluable support they provide in their communities will end one day, when wages and benefits are adequate enough for proud families to be able to stop using the food banks.New statistics show rising homelessness across Scotland. Food bank use is soaring. Illnesses of the past like rickets and malnutrition have reappeared.In a rich nation like Scotland, in the st century, this is appalling. It#s Dickensian.People are struggling right now – it#s time the First Minister stops commentating on the cost of living crisis and starts doing something about it.She could start by allowing her MSPs to support my proposal."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week february 11 2022","story":"I was excited to see Seville oranges in the grocers.

Avoid plantingthe ground is frozen or extremely waterlogged.Your planting hole should be no deeper than the roots, but at least three times the diameter of the root ball.It#s a good idea to soak bare-rooted trees for about  minutes before planting.Place the tree in the planting hole so the first flare of roots on the stem are level with the soil surface. If you plant the tree too deep, it can result in rot and disease.You may need to insert a stake for top heavy or larger trees.

You can also sow outdoors, but use cloches or small poly tunnels until next month when the soil has warmed up. They will also provide your lettuce seedlings with protection from birds and slugs.Good ieties to start now include cut-and-come again Salad Bowl – oak leaved, high yield with green and red ieties a cos such as Lobjoits Green – dense, crisp heads with self folding leaves or the small butterhead Tom Thumb – perfect for growing in small spaces, it matures early and has a mild taste.Prepare for spring by carrying out basic maintenance.As the Royal Horticultural Society says, this month there are signs of the approaching spring, with bulbs appearing and wildle waking up as light levels and temperatures increase.There#s plenty to do indoors this month to prepare for the season ahead.Outdoors, as the garden comes to le, it#s time to prune shrubs and climbers, such as wisteria, as well as evergreen hedges."},{"url":null,"title":"driver woes derail oban golfer bobs title bid","story":"The honorary Machrihanish Golf Club member finished tied in ninth place at the Ras al Khaimah Classic on the final leg of the DP World Tour#s Desert Swing, building on his solid performance over the same course the previous week.After carding an almost flawless opening round of  on Thursday, Robert suffered a cruel piece of bad luck before his Friday round after the face of his driver cracked during his warm up on the practise range.Speaking after carding a  on Saturday, following his  on Friday, Robert said he struggled with his replacement driver.#Unfortunately, my driver cracked on Friday morning and I#ve not got the perfect replacement but no-one does,# said the left-hander.#Off the tee, I#m trying to find my golf ball.

describes the proposals to axe music tuition as #catastrophic# and urged the council to re-consider.He wrote: #I feel it would be disastrous for the area to lose this essential musical training, not only to the local people whose lives are enriched by music, but also for the tourism on which so much of the local economy depends.#Campbeltown and the surrounding district is famed throughout the world for its traditional music and it would be very unwise even to consider implementing measures which would effectively bring this reputation to an end.#He added: #I am lending my strongest support

The scenes from Paddington to Windsor were impressive, especially the arrival at Windsor and the unforgettable journey to St George’s Chapel.To those people in Kintyre, so far from the television

As a result, some of the nation’s fish and chip shops are now struggling for survival.As they are not protected by the energy price cap, chip shops are now facing huge rises in energy costs. Some members of NFFF have reported electricity bills going up from £ to £, a month.The NFFF is urging the government to reconsider its planned  per cent increase on VAT in April, which is an added concern for the industry.The spiralling costs hitting fish and chip shops include a  per cent rise in the cost of cod since October,  per cent rise in the cost of haddock in the last year,  per cent rise in the cost of mushy peas, and  per cent rise in the cost of batter.Industry leaders now say that chip shops will have to raise prices to survive but many could be forced out of business.In , East Coast was crowned one of the UK’s  Best Fish  Chip Takeaways for the second year running – the only chippy in Edinburgh and the Lothians to make the list.The accolade followed an extensive search by trade publication Fry Magazine to find the chippies serving up the finest fish suppers amid the ongoing challenges of the Covid- pandemic.Mr Crolla runs the Musselburgh takeaway and restaurant with his we Katia, and his family have been serving the local community for nearly  years.He said: “By teaming up with the National Federation of Fish Friers we hope to do our bit by encouraging people to support their local fish and chip shop around Scotland during these extremely challenging times.“Our family has been proudly serving the local community with quality fish and chips for nearly  years, but the spiralling costs battering our industry are putting all that at risk.“We won’t compromise on quality, but these external factors will inevitably mean a rise in costs for us and our customers.”Andrew Crook, president of the NFFF, added: “We are in unprecedented times where we are seeing high levels of inflation, and food inflation is even higher.“Most of the supplies we use in the fish and chip industry have increased drastically in price and we are expecting this to continue for some considerable time.“Other products are simply not available, and we have seen suppliers move away from the sector.“Fish and chip shops like East Coast in Musselburgh do feel the effect of these increases more than most cuisines as our margins are much tighter. The price of fish is comparable to steak in supermarkets.“As a result of this, and our commitment to ensuring a high-quality, good-value product, we may regrettably be forced to review our prices to reflect the rising costs our industry is facing.”"},{"url":null,"title":"mothers-day-chocolate-gifts-can-buy-year-including-hotel-chocolat","story":"And theres plenty to choose from!

Musselburgh is one of  golf courses to have hosted the oldest golf championship in the world, which this year celebrates its own milestone with The th Open Championship being held at St Andrews in July.To mark the th anniversary of golf at Musselburgh, Musselburgh Old Course Golf Club– which later this month celebrates the th year of its re-founding in  – is hosting a series of events across , ending with a gala dinner in the town in September.This Saturday, members of MOCGC will contest the club’s th Anniversary Stroke-play Championship. On July , more than  golf clubs and foundations from across Scotland have been invited to participate in an -hole tournament on the Old Course.Sir John Foulis of Ravelston’s game  years ago was referenced in The Golf Book Of East Lothian, compiled and documented by John Kerr, M.A, F.R.S.E, F.S.A.Scot, the Minister of Dirleton, which was published in .Golf may have been played by royalty at Musselburgh even earlier than . Mary Queen of Scots was reported on her indictment in  to have played golf ‘at Seton’, most likely at Musselburgh, while her son King James VI was also reported to have played golf there.Musselburgh’s Old Course has left a “lasting legacy” on golf in many factors. The accepted diameter of a golf holewas the width of the piece of drainpipe used at Musselburgh to cut the holes. This was adopted by The Royal and Ancient Golf Club in  as the official measurement requirement for all golf holes, as they standardised the rules of golf.The Old Course is also regarded as the birthplace of competitive women’s golf. As early as , the local fishwives were reported to have indulged in golf on their days off. In , the club that later became Royal Musselburgh sponsored a women’s golf competition on New Year’s Day with prizes – a fishing basket and silk handkerchiefs.Perhaps the most famous of the many golfing families to have been based at Musselburgh were the Park family. Willie Park Senior, born in Wallyford, was the first winner of The Open in , and went on to win it a further three times. His brother Mungo won the first Open Championship played at Musselburgh in , while Willie Park Junior was a two-time winner, including in , the final year that Musselburgh hosted The Open.Steven Hill, captain of Musselburgh Old Course Golf Club, said the anniversary was “a momentous day” for everyone connected with the course, adding: “To be captain of our club in this historic year is a tremendous honour for me.“While our club only dates back  years, in that time we have helped to restore the Old Course to its former glory. The history of Musselburgh Links is precious – the members of our club recognise our role as protectors of this ancient course, and hold its traditions very dear to our hearts, including continuing to play hickory golf here.“We are immensely proud that Musselburgh is one of only  courses in the UK to have hosted The Open and it is fitting that, in the same year when The th Open Championship is played at St Andrews, our course can also celebrate a signicant milestone.“Most of our members grew up playing on the Old Course. In this anniversary year, we want to secure a lasting legacy for golf here by encouraging the next generation of local golfers to experience Musselburgh Links and become part of its future. We also welcome visitors from across the world to visit and join us in our celebrations.”Angela Howe, director at The RA World Golf Museum, said: “The Open has been played at some of the world’s most historic golf courses and Musselburgh is undoubtedly one of them. As one of the three prestigious venues, with Prestwick and St Andrews, which played host to the early days of The Open and the home course of the great Park family among others, it has a rich golfing heritage. It’s wonderful to see this remarkable milestone being celebrated in such fitting style throughout the year.”Michael Beamish, captain of the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, said: “The Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers has written records stretching back more than  years. Originally based in Leith and, since , at Muirfield, the club grew and flourished during the period when Musselburgh Links was its home.“Musselburgh Links was the home of The Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers from  until . In , The Honourable Company built a clubhouse in Golf Place at the west end of the Links and throughout this period both the town and the nine-hole course played a leading role in the development of the rapidly growing game of golf. Musselburgh and the Links have a long, important and distinguished history and deserve the title ‘The Cradle of Golf.’“The Honourable Company would like to congratulate the clubs at Musselburgh Links and the affiliates involved in managing and maintaining the course, enjoyleisure and East Lothian Council, for such a wonderful golfing legacy, and send very best wishes for the th anniversary celebrations.”John McMillan, Provost of East Lothian, said: “The Old Course has a very special place in both East Lothian and Scottish golfing history.

His impact on the world of dance since the s is unparalleled, not only for the choreography, which had all the precision of ballet training with a decidedly post-punk attitude, but for his close collaboration with artists, designers, costumiers, and musicians. He took that to a dferent level.The exhibition brings all of these together. Curated and organised by the Barbican in London it had to close after just one month due to Covid restrictions, so the team who brought it together from archives and newly commissioned pieces is more than pleased that it will have a full run at Scotland’s design museum.Florence Ostende, Curator of Cosmic Dancer also believes that: “The VA in Dundee is the perfect location, even down to the architecture. The building has the idea of movement and motion, so it’s a perfect home.”That idea of conveying movement throughout the exhibition was vital adds Ostende.“When you work on a dancer or choreographer the materiality of what should be on display is challenging. It’s dferent from a painter or a sculptor – how will be visitors experience the strength of his work over several decades  How can we make it immersive  Not to replicate a theatre but to understand how he has been incorporated every element into his work.”Ostende adds that working with the VA in Dundee led to the decision to make part of the exhibition free in the foyer. “It was a generous proposal from the team there and it goes further to it being accessible to everyone.”Perhaps the most accessible part of Clark’s work to the uninitiated is the music. He was one of the few artists that was given permission by David Bowie to use his music. Bowie also attended performances in New York.The I Am Curious Orange was a collaboration with post-punk pioneers The Fall and he also collaborated with Scritti Politti. However, classical composers such as Stravinsky and Satie were also a part of his work.“His relationship to pop culture and music is particularly relatable,” says Ostende.“Much of the understanding of his work has been rooted in the s club scene, so when we opened initially, we wonderedthat would be our audience. Of course we had that, but the amount of young people who came to see it – that was beyond our expectations. “The exhibition has films, sculptures, paintings, costumes and photographs from his collaborators, alongside rare archival material, placing Clark within a wider cultural context.Also his groundbeaking work with filmmakers such as Peter Greenaway and Derek Jarman, fashion designers  including Vivienne Westwood, Alexander McQueen, Gucci and Pringle of Scotland.Kate Coyne is Associate Director of the Michael Clark Company and was a dancer there for more than  years, first auditioning at  but deciding to work with other companies before finally finding herself back there.“I was about  when I joined – at  I would have been too young for the work Michael was doing. I needed experience – in dance and le.”Coyne and Ostende have been working closely together on the exhibition together with three researchers, not a huge team for the scale of the exhibition.Maybe more than anyone  Coyne is qualied to talk about the uncompromising costumes that Clark has commissioned throughout the years.“They are certainly challenging for the dancers,” she laughs. “He likes to see how someone will rise to the challenge. There are certain looks like the David Bowie jackets for come, been and gone that were very restrictive but I think they informed the movement and they did look really sharp.”The coming together of dance company and gallery was key to making this as representative to Michael Clark’s breadth of work, she believes.“I think that Florence being an art curator has worked so will,” she says. “She could really inidualise each of the artists but also tie them to Michael in the most incredible way.”And Michael himself  It seems that he was involved in initial conceptual phase but then stepped back and allowed the team to get on with it.“Of course Michael is the key part of it but he was keen not to put his stamp on what it should be.”Michael Clark: Cosmic Dancer runs from Saturday, March , to Sunday, September  .

Those affected are being informed. There are further staffing challenges in adult social work and Occupational Therapy.Ms Green continued: “The closure of any service is as a last resort, but we have no choice to ensure we can safely manage to run our residential care facilities. The situation will be monitored closely and as soon as we are in a position to reopen safely then we will let everyone know.“Our care staff and the families of residents have done an outstanding job in keeping this virus at bay and out with our care facilities up until recent times but given the widespread transmission and the reduction in restrictions it has meant it was almost inevitable that this was going to happen at some point.”Staffing challenges are also being felt across the Leisure and Culture service, with some gym and swimming pool sessions and exercise classes being cancelled. The council-run St Magnus Café, Community Centre, and Town Hall have also been affected by closures and reduced opening hours.A plan has been agreed to ensure some level of service continues at the popular cafe during this challenging period and is being trialled this weekuntil the end of March, opening from .-.

This would involve giving no assistance to the vessel.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I’m not sure Ted Lasso helped. I haven’t watched the show, but I get it.“People hate hearing the word ‘soccer’. I’ve used the word football since I was a professional football player.“I think more and more in the States we’re adapting to what the game here is in England and our connection with what this league is and what the culture of the sport is in this country.“I can understand they think we don’t have the experiences that can be created here in Europe. Frankly, they’re right.”💬 𝗝𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗲 𝗠𝗮𝗿𝘀𝗰𝗵: “The process has been incredibly smooth, because the people have been so amazing. I’ve worked with some incredible teams, but this team here is remarkable.” pic dLCXuZcV— Leeds UnitedMarch , Marsch, a former player with Major League Soccer sides DC United, Chicago Fire and Chivas USA, started out in management as assistant coach of the USA national team under former head coach Bob Bradley.Bradley’s short-lived spell in charge of Swansea in  also did little to address the misconception.After managerial spells at Montreal Impact and New York Red Bulls, Marsch guided Salzburg to successive Austrian league and cup doubles before a brief stint at Leipzig.He said: “It was reason I came to Europe, the reason I learned German. It’s the reason I’ve tried to adapt. This is the fth country I have coached football in.I believe in believe.— Ted LassoJanuary , “It takes me out of my comfort zone every time and challenges me to grow and develop and learn new things. I’m very open to that, I’m very cognisant of the fact that I’m not perfect and I don’t want to be.“All I can say is the only way I know how to do things is to go all in, give everything I have to believe in who I am, to believe in the people I work with and to try to maximise what we are every day.“I findyou can do that effectively, you can be incredibly surprised with the human spirit and what you can achieve.”Marsch added, self-mockingly: “So, that sounds like Ted Lasso, I think, from what I have heard.”Marsch has  games to keep Leeds in the top flight after a string of heavy defeats.Leeds sit th in the table, two points above the relegation zone, after losing five of their last six matches.The Whites have conceded  league goals this season, while the  they have shipped in February is a new top-flight record for a calendar month.Marsch, linked with the assistant’s role at Manchester United late last year having worked under the German at Leipzig in the   season, is under no illusions about the challenge he faces in replacing Bielsa.He said: “I understand what a big job it is and how important it is to the fans and the community here.“I’ve followed football history for years. I’m very aware of what this is.“Clearly I’m emotional and excited and I just want to channel that energy into things that can help the team.”Leeds confirmed Marsch will be assisted by incoming pair Franz Schiemer and Cameron Toshack, while Under-s coach Mark Jackson has been promoted to the first-team coaching staff.💬 𝗝𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗲 𝗼𝗻 𝗕𝗮𝗺𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗱: “He was in training today.

Sarah was wonderful and we miss her all the time.“Over the past year we have been overwhelmed with the kindness shown to us, not just by family and friends, but by the wider public.“We are immensely grateful to everyone for their support, it has meant such a lot to us and has comforted us through this terrible time.“Sadly, Sarah is not the only woman to have lost her le recently in violent circumstances and we would like to extend our deepest sympathy to other families who are also grieving.”Groups of women in London and Glasgow have said they will be marching to show “solidarity” with Ms Everard’s family on Thursday evening.Marches are due to take place from pm on Clapham Common in south London, near where Ms Everard was abducted, and at Kelvingrove Art gallery in central Glasgow. vw,vw,px, px\"Sarah’s death sparked vigils and protests Ms Everard, , was raped and killed by serving Met officer Wayne Couzens as she walked home in south London on March  last year.He was handed a whole-le term in September.A non-statutory inquiry has since been launched – led by Dame Elish Angiolini – who is looking at how Couzens was able to work as a police officer for three dferent forces despite concerns about his behaviour.Following this, there are plans for a second part that would look at wider issues in policing.Our thoughts are with Sarah Everards family and loved ones.One year on we remain deeply disgusted and shamed that a Met police officer was responsible for Sarah’s appalling murder. pic ocqwgpdlB— politan PoliceMarch , The Met has also commissioned its own review of the culture and standards at the force, including Couzens’ former unit – the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command.The past year has seen a number of high-profile alleged stranger murders of women, including the deaths of PCSO Julia James and teachers Sabina Nessa and Ashling Murphy.Another case saw labourer Valentin Lazar, , jailed for le for beating -year-old Maria Rawlings to death after a chance meeting on a bus.On Thursday evening, a walk will take place in south-west London, which organisers The Urban Angels said is in memory of “victims of gendered violence”.The group, which aims to make society safer for women and non-binary people, wrote it is a “chance for us all to stand in solidarity and show that we both demand and support change”.The event will begin at Clapham North Underground station at pm and will finish at the Clapham Common bandstand, near where Ms Everard went missing and the location of a socially distanced vigil held in her memory last year.A statement from the Met released on the anniversary said: “Our thoughts are with Sarah Everard’s family and loved ones. One year on we remain deeply disgusted and shamed that a Met police officer was responsible for Sarah’s appalling murder.”Prime Minister Boris Johnson and London mayor Sadiq Khan also paid tribute to Ms Everard, and said they wanted every woman and girl to feel safe on the streets.Mr Johnson said: “Like everyone , my heart goes out to the family and friends of Sarah Everard today. The circumstances of her death were truly horrying and I cannot imagine the pain they have suffered over this past year.“It is unacceptable that so many women and girls still fear and face violence and abuse, and perpetrators must be held to account for their actions.

Niamh CampbellTwitterEmailMarch   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThe Period Products Bill, which will make period products freely available in public spaces, will be enacted through the Department for Communities.The law is aiming to make period products available in schools, colleges and public buildings in Northern Ireland.Before the Executive collapsed following’s Paul Givan’s resignation as First Minister, it had not nominated a government department to take responsibility for the legislationSDLP MLA Pat Catney, who championed the campaign, had asked the Department of Health to take ownership, but it said that while supporting the general direction of the bill, the matter falls outside of the scope of its remit.Read MoreBill to combat period poverty introduced to NI AssemblyHomeless Period Belfast unites with artist Nuala Convery to repair period mural after it was defacedIn a statement seen by the BBC, the Department for Communities said its minister, Deirdre Hargey, had agreed to take the lead on the Period ProductsBill given the importance of this issue.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up This is an important step in the right direction towards free period products, it added.Minister Hargey will work to ensure this important piece of legislation is completed in this mandate.On Thursday, it was confirmed that the bill will move through to the consideration stage in the Assembly next week, during which MLAs will debate amendments to it.The Assembly is set to dissolve in less than three weeksahead of May’s election, so the timeframe for the bill to complete all necessary remaining stages at Stormont before then will be tight.If it does get the backing of MLAs before then, it could potentially be the final piece of legislation to be completed in the current mandate.Mr Catney commended young activists who have supported him as the bill sponsor and he also thanked the Stormont education committee for their “diligent work” on it.“Over the last  months I have listened to the compelling stories of women who have suffered the indignity and deep distress of period poverty,” said the Lagan Valley MLA.I have heard from people who have missed school or work because they can’t access period products, people who have been forced to use unsuitable alternatives including toilet paper or cloth and those who just can’t afford the cost of these vital healthcare products.“I am pleased that I will now be able to bring the bill to the Assembly for its consideration stage next week. This is an example of the power of positive politics and what we can achieve when we put people first.”A survey conducted by the SDLP last year further found that % of respondents struggled to afford or access period products during menstruation, % had been forced to use sanitary products for longer than advised or used unsuitable alternativesand % had missed work or school as a result of their period or limited access to period products.Related topicsPat CatneySDLPDepartment for CommunitiesMichelle O#NeillMore On Pat Catney PremiumSuzanne BreenOpinionSF’s Michelle O’Neill in pole position to land Stormont’s top job... but it’s not a done deal yetSDLP MLA Cara Hunter thankful for support after speaking out about brain tumour PremiumAndrew Madden’s weekly political spin: From the ‘Northern Irish psyche’ to ‘fake news’Watch: SDLP MLA serenades Derry’s Guildhall with Danny Boy PremiumMaze site upkeep has cost £.m since Most ReadSchools# Cup semi-final: Campbell College cruise past Wallace High School to set up St Patrick#s Day decider against rivals MethodyLisburn luxury property oozing modern style includes home gymDUP councillor quits party to back Easton for election in MayBallymacbreenan Schoolhouse: Dream Lisburn home was well worth the -year waitNeighbours tell of distress after -year-old man dies in Dunmurry stab horrorTop Videos\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news fec .ece AUTOCROP wh beccbdc.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news fec .ece AUTOCROP wh beccbdc.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayVideo: Woman arrested as murder investigation launched following west Belfast stabbingPlayThe mother of Belfast schoolboy Noah Donohoe has urged the PSNI to release all the information relating to her son’s death.PlayVideo: Inside Northern Ireland#s only non-ROC Nuclear bunkerLatest Northern IrelandPolice not seeking to withhold answers on Noah disappearance, PSNI chief saysNewry man#s tractor collection could fetch £, at auctionExplainer: What is the situation with Nato and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine Mapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageWoman accused of partner’s murder a victim of domestic violence, court toldLatestRussia accuses BBC of ‘playing role undermining Russian stability and security’Mother sends breastfeeding products to Poland to help Ukrainian mothersCo-op Food removes Russian-made vodka from shelvesDavid Goodwillie banned by council from entering Clyde FC’s stadiumUkrainians at solidarity ceremony thank Britain and worry about homeland,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

They come with promised long-battery le and durable design to encourage users to keep their phones for longer, while still offering the expected advantages of a modern smartphone, including quality screens and cameras.It#s getting those fundamentals right and really establishing in our users# minds what the value that a Nokia brings is. We don#t want to get caught up in this sort of arms race for spec that#s going on around the rest of the industryAdam Ferguson, NokiaUnveiling the phones at the Mobile World Congresstech show in Barcelona, Mr Ferguson said they were inspired by Nokia’s reputation for reliability and durability from the first wave of mobile phones in the s.“It’s getting those fundamentals right and really establishing in our users’ minds what the value that a Nokia brings is,” he told the PA news agency.“We don’t want to get caught up in this sort of arms race for spec that’s going on around the rest of the industry.“There are plenty of other people that can do that – you want a few extra megapixels here at this price point or you want a few extra bits of frame rate on your refresh rate on your screen, fine, I’m sure there’s someone who can deal with that for you.“But actually, you want a device that’s going to go the distance that you know you can rely on, with a lot of these fundamental principles done in the best way possible.“That’s what we’re trying to stand for and bring back into the market again, and obviously, we’re served very well by the fact that that is a lot of what the Nokia heritage was about in the first place.”Since reviving the Nokia phone brand in , HMD Global has launched a string of smartphones and more basic feature phones, gradually re-establishing the brand in the market.It now has a number of distinct ranges from premium smartphones down to entry-level feature phones and has found success in the mid-range market, too.HMD Global has just reported a sixth straight quarter of profitability, and Mr Ferguson said smartphone revenue rose % last year, which he said was partly down to “getting those fundamentals” of durability and longevity right.“Theyare less flashy and less exciting than some of what other people are turning up with, but at the same time this is going to be one of our ious growth areas people moving from feature phones into smartphones who are wanting something that’s really reliable,” he said.“They are used to devices that really durable and robust that have batteries that last days, and we’re making sure that these devices deliver that in the smartphone category as well.” Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletter Receive todays headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.

He has previously labelled the proposals to move the four wards as ldquototally unacceptable.Mr McGrath contends there is no historical, cultural, economic or educational link between Downpatrick and Comber or Newtownards, areas currently in the Strangford constituency that would be in the proposed Strangford and Quoile constituency.He said other political parties have made their stance clear via their respective submissions to the Commission, but was left ldquoaghast with Sinn Feinrsquos response which indicated that it was content with a number of areas including Malone Heights, Roughal Park, the Strangford Road, Ardenlee and Saul Acres developments and all of Saul and Strangford being removed from South Down to form part of the suggested new constituency.ldquoThe net result would be residents on either side of the Saul Road voting in dferent constituencies and I cannot comprehend the rationale for this, said Mr McGrath.The MLA said when he makes his presentation today, he will make it clear to the Commission ldquoin no uncertain terms that the proposal to move the four Downpatrick wards and much of Crossgar, Annacloy and Teconnaught into the proposed Strangford and Quoile constituency is ldquounacceptable.He added: ldquoLet us retain our links with places like Castlewellan, Newcastle and the wider South Down area and do not use Downpatrick as a scapegoat for their attempts to address wider electoral issues in Belfast or other parts of the North..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"150th anniversary of Downpatrick church  ","story":"THE Roman Catholic Archbishop of Armagh is to speak in Downpatrick to mark the th anniversary of St Patrickrsquos Church in the town.Archbishop Eamon Martin will celebrate mass on March th as part of a special St Patrickrsquos Novena mdash nine days of prayer mdash in the church where generations of Catholics have worshipped since .Poor Clares Sr Martina Purdy and Sr Elaine Kelly mdash who pioneered St Patrickrsquos Camino walk in Downpatrick two years ago mdash will help launch the Novena at the invitation of parish priest Fr John Murray.On March , Sr Martina and Sr Elaine, a former BBC correspondent and a former barrister respectively, will share their faith story, entitled lsquoOur Friend Patrickrsquo.The Dean of Down, the Very Henry Hull is also to take part in an ecumenical celebration on March  while the Bishop of Down and Connor, the Most Rev Noel Treanor, will celebrate Sunday mass on March .Fr John Murray, PP, said the St Patrickrsquos celebration would remember all the thousands of people who have attended mass and celebrated the sacraments in the church in St Patrickrsquos Avenue since its foundation.ldquoIt is an occasion to give thanks for those countless lives of witness and faith and to look forward to the future with confidence and hope in Christ, he said.ldquoIn , Fr Patrick OrsquoKane and the parishioners of St Patrickrsquos could not have imagined the events of two world wars and the rise and fall of Communism, the Second Vatican Council and the many other huge milestones that have come to dominate the landscape that is the th century.ldquoThey could not have imagined that  years after the church was built that we are just emerging from a pandemic.

They help to develop the museum and its collection and act as its ambassadors within the community. Members organise relevant activities as well as supporting the museumrsquos own programme of events.These activities include lectures, tours, literary and musical events, for social, educational or fundraising purposes. The Friends make grants, from their own funds or by acting as a conduit for other grant-aiding bodies who are unable to give money directly to the Museum. Such grants are for curatorial or educational purposes.At the inaugural meeting of the Friends in  the curator, Dr Brian Turner, spoke briefly about the work of the museum and plans for the future.He emphasised that community support and participation was vital and was at the root of everything the museum stood for.The first committee was elected with Patrick Forde as chairman, Dr Maurice Hayes as vice-chairman, Conac Hanna as treasurer and Noel McCann as secretary. Other committee members included Professor Ronald Buchanan, Frank Maxwell and Wendy Osborne. Since then, many other local people have given their time and skills through the committee.The Friends come from all parts of our community and even further afield. The main source of income is through annual subions, with occasional gts. However, there is also some capital as a result of a direct grant from the Northern Ireland government in . This was given in recognition of the Friendsrsquo potential for improving community harmony through peaceful exploration of our common cultural heritage. It is estimated that they have given the museum about pound, towards a great iety of projects during the last  years.However, perhaps more important is the long-term commitment the Friends have shown to the museum. They give their time, goodwill, skills, knowledge, experience and advice, on a voluntary basis, to help the museum in many ways. With their close association to the Museum they have witnessed the reduction in staff and understood the impact of the proposed restructuring.Friends in the art world, such as Richard Croft, Betty McCord and Jim Manley, have supported the museum by generous donations of their own work. Some have used their contacts to acquire works with large discounts whilst others have been able to alert the Museum to items for sale in auctions.The Friends donated Mixed farm, Slievenaman, an oil painting by Tom Carr, to mark the th anniversary of the museum, in . In , they donated Mourne Hayfield, a watercolour by Chris Dearden, to mark the th anniversary of the museum.They also purchased Silent Valley, a watercolour by Jim Manley, in , Landscape, Tyrella, an oil painting by Daniel OrsquoNeill, in  and part funded Down Cathedral and Southwell School, tempura on board by Patric Stevenson, in .The pieces of glass made by Alison Lowry, and which can now be seen at the entrance to the Cell Block, was part funded to mark the th anniversary of Friends. The inidual pieces are representations of objects associated with the lives of prisoners held in this building. The Friends also supported a residency for Australian artist Christina Henri commemorating women prisoners transported from Down Gaol.Friends with musical connections have organised tin whistle classes. The Friends also paid for a local harpist to play in galleries on summer Sunday afternoons and for the choral society at a Christmas event.Keen gardeners have brought plants into the museum to sell and opened a private garden to visitors to raise money.Car boot sales were another popular method of fundraising and the museum courtyard provided a useful venue for several organised by the Friends.Technical, photographic and conservation projects have benefited over the years from the Friendsrsquo assistance. Equipment and materials included a laminator, scanner, digital camera and archival storage. A drone pilot course was funded.The loan of St Patrickrsquos Head shrine from another museum was only made possible by its prior conservation, which the Friends paid for. One of the most important projects was the initial cataloguing of the D J McNeill Collection, by means of a placement, largely supported by the Friends.Young people have been encouraged to enjoy learning about history by Friendsrsquo funding for prizes for school competitions, poster packs for schools, and programmes for The Young Archaeologistsrsquo Club. The Education Service was assisted by the purchase of a photocopier and replica pots for children to handle.Publications have always been an important part of the museumrsquos work, in disseminating information about the collection, for setting objects in their historic context and most importantly, their relationship to people. To this end, the Friends have match-funded the annual Down Survey, - and .They assisting with the publication of two townland maps, which were freely distributed to schools and community groups. Books included A man stepped out for death, Thomas Russell and County Down, a collaborative publication to mark thebicentenary of the United Irish Rising of  and Aspects of Audleystown by Brian Turner, a book designed to help iniduals and groups study their townlands. They initiated, researched, wrote and published a recipe book, Food for Friends, in ,with all profits going to the Friends.Many facets of the High Cross project were supported by the Friends, including filming the whole project and the making of the replica High Cross. Restoration of St Patrickrsquos Cross and the interpretation  were financially supported.Exhibitions have benefited from the Friendsrsquo support in recent years with a major contribution to the extension at the back of the site was signicant.

The conversion took UCD into a -point half time lead.The second half was dominated by Ballynahinch with the wind at their back and a big crowd roaring them on.Their maul was proving to be a real weapon and Kyle McCall was again the beneficiary with a try after  minutes after a superb maul.Tommy Donnan then had what seemed a certain try disallowed after another excellent maul, but when flanker Olly Loughead barged over on the hour mark to close the gap to eight points the home faithful could sense a famous win.However, UCD scored with their only attack of the second half through scrum half Richie Fahy to give the students some breathing space.Despite laying siege to the line, all the home side had to show for the last quarter was a penalty try with two minutes remaining and the students held on for victory and virtually assured their Division A status for -.Ballynahinch look destined for a nail-biting two-legged play-off against UCC to decide who goes down, but will hope to play themselves into better form over the final few weeks of the season.All support welcome at Garryowen this weekend.Ballynahinch : Nacho Cladera Crespo, Tom Stewart, Kyle McCall, Cormac Izuchukwu, Tom Martin, Tommy Donnan, Olly Loughead, Bradley Luney, Conor McAuley, Greg Hutley, Aaron Cairns, Ryan Wilson, Rory Butler, Ronan Patterson, Conor Rankin, David Cooper, John Dickson, Kyle Gill, Gareth Gill, Ruari Meharg, Yasser Omar..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Dougan goal cancels out Sam’s strike in derby  ","story":"THE local derby between Drumaness Mills and Killyleagh YC ended in a stalemate in quite horrendous conditions on Saturday.The Mills, who are currently on the back of a strong run of form and had won well at the reverse fixture a few weeks ago, would have been confident when welcoming old rivals Killyleagh for their Premier Division clash.The match at Meadowvale began at a high pace with lots of commitment shown by both sides in an effort to secure an early foothold in the game.In the early exchanges Rory Mason, Adam Keaney and then James McGivern all had half chances which they would have expected to have done better with.Somewhat against the run of play and with  minutes on the clock, Killyleaghrsquos Sam Carson rled the ball high into the top right hand corner of the net from the edge of the box with the home goalkeeper, Marc Reid, rooted to the spot. A fine goal at any level.Killyleagh were noticeably revitalised and buoyant following their goal, however, clever work from Callum Dougan on halfway sent Adam Kearney through in search of an equaliser with  minutes on the clock but he blazed over with the goal at his mercy.Killyleaghrsquos Conor Hamilton was becoming more and more influential in the game and continued to probe and prompt throughout, although he will be rueing his miss when he seemed better placed to score to put his side further ahead.On  minutes Rory Mason broke at pace and found Dougan, who forced a smart save from Aaron Carberry in the Killyleagh goal. Kearney, following up, trickled the rebound towards goal before it was hacked to safety before crossing the line.The Mills continued to press and a surging run down the right from Ben Campbell resulted in a fine ball across the face of goal but without anyone reacting it went out for a throw on the far side.Killyleagh had a corner in the th minute and in an example of the conditions, the now swirling wind took the ball directly out of play and with that the referee blew his whistle and brought the half to a close.Half-time: Drumaness Mills FC  Killyleagh YC .Clearly unimpressed with his sides first half showing, Drumaness manager, Mark Kerr, made two changes at half-time. Off went Rory Mason and Adam Kearney to be replaced with Eoin Rooney and Keegan Domican.As the game settled after the restart on  minutes, Campbell blazed a half chance over when well-placed following a corner for the home side.The next attack did bring the equaliser the home outfit craved. The ball fell to the feet of Callum Dougan after a Mills attack down the right looked like coming to nothing and he despatched it to the back of the net with aplomb. The clock ticked by with  minutes gone and both sides were now level.On  minutes Daniel Bell replaced Conor Carew in the engine room for The Mills and as the game heated up and became quite frantic around the  minute mark, McGivern was booked for two strong challenges in quick succession.As the game entered the final few minutes, Marc Reid made a top level save with an acrobatic reflex to push the ball onto the roof of the net when it didnrsquot seem possible showing shades of Gordon Banks.The away team were now pushing hard for the winner they craved and were blown up for an offside call on  minutes with Naseem Ouldhamiat through on goal.As the dust settled and a level of calm was restored the referee blew for full-time.A local derby which was keenly contested throughout and a draw was probably a fair result on the balance of play..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"First half nightmare for Ballynahinch at home  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH lost out to Portrush on home soil in their latest Ulster Intermediate League encounter at the weekend.lsquoHinch began strongly and on the attack from the first whistle as Alex Millar was quickly able to play the ball out from the back and up to Matthew Martin.The Ballynahinch player played the ball up to Kyle Patterson on the left wing, who was able to slot the ball in off the back post to put his side on the scoresheet.Portrush were quickly on the counter attack down the right-hand side only to be stopped by Ashley Brown and lsquokeeper Aaron Donnell.Portrush were determined to level the game and were able to slip the ball from the baseline through a crowded circle before putting the ball in at the back post.Leslie Harrison played the ball out to Scott Leetch on the right, who was able to pass up to Craig Harkness and over to Michael Carney and Jason Campbell up front.They were able to create chance after chance, but were denied by the Portrush lsquokeeper and their defence.lsquoHinch came out in the second quarter looking to add to the scoreline.

The part of the track closest to the residents will be some - metres away.But Shan Slieve Drive householders say that is too close.

allocation of funds and thus enrich the educational experience offered to our pupils, said Mr Hanna.ldquoWhat was not said, of course, was that the Government had tired of the antics of the teaching unions and their demands for better promotion prospects and smaller classes, and it decided to off-load the problems, via LMS, on to inidual schools who now have to take the decision about class size, the number of teachers to be employed and their levels of pay, he added.SEAFORDE ndash A new phase in the drive to plant one million new trees in Northern Ireland was officially launched at a

An initial , bricks will be available.The initiative allows people to purchase bricks mdash priced pound each mdash to invest in the future of Loughinisland GAC and fast-track plans towards building a more modern environment at the club.Each purchased brick will be fitted with a stainless steel plaque placed on a frame which will be prominent on the gable wall of the clubhouse.The plaque can be inscribed with a name, family name or business and location to be displayed forever as a reminder of those who contributed to the success of the plans.When development work has been completed the wall will be moved to a secure site close to the new pitches.For more information on the pitch or to submit a feedback form email loughinislandgacnewpitch@gmail.Alternatively, feedback forms can also be filled out on the clubrsquos website by visiting http:www.loughinislandgac..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Matthew gets his second highest score from judges  ","story":"LOVE Island heart-throb Matthew MacNabb has got through to the final six of RTErsquoS Dancing With The Stars mdash and is dating a new girlfriend.The Downpatrick man impressed the judges on Sunday evening with his strong Paso Doble for its ldquogreat characterisation.The dance with professional dance partner Laura Nolan is inspired by the movements of a Spanish matador and bull.The  year-old gave a passionate performance in the dramatic dance to the song, Live and Let Die by Wings in the showrsquos Big Band week played by the RTE Orchestra.He told the Recorder: ldquoI loved this week.

We should not be having a war in a modern European society.Mr Poxon said he met many of his daughter-in-lawrsquos relatives and friends whwen she married their son in  mdash the couple met while at university in Nottingham mdash and that Olga and her parents attended a Christmas Eve carol service in Down Cathedral last year.He also revealed that he and his we were members of the Belfast Philharmonic Choir which sang in the city of Lviv in western Ukraine some time ago.ldquoBoth at Markrsquos wedding and in Lviv we met many Ukrainians and today our heart goes out to them, he said.ldquoMany of those people who we met sang to or danced with may well be standing in fields, villages, towns or cities with weapons in their hands, hiding in shelters or fleeing for their lives to the borders of friendly states.ldquoIn Lviv we met Marta who was our guide to the city. She spoke passionately, but without malice, on the history of Ukraine and how over its history it had been occupied by Poland, Nazi Germany and Russia.ldquoDuring our tour she took us to a church where we saw strings of white paper doves ascending to heaven, each one representing a le lost in the conflict since , and a board of photographs of young men and women who had also given their lives for their country.

Land at the rear of Russell Park is not deemed a flooding risk.Late last year, politicians said they are keen to see a wide-ranging development plan for the town centre location and while they accept that it may not be possible to deliver everything that will be in the blueprint at the same time, they want to aim high and also target potential funders to finance what will be an ambitious project.Downpatrick area councillors met with senior council officials last week to discuss proposals for the development of the park with the focus on maximising the opportunities that Dunleath offers.It has been agreed that a paper detailing plans for the new skateboard park and pump track will be outlined at a forthcoming meeting of the local authorityrsquos Active and Healthy Communities Committee.A working group has been set up to oversee the future of the park and its members have taken a close look at the existing sports pitches, with many keen to provide at least one G or G pitch which would provide a facility that could be used all year round.Downpatrick councillor, Oonagh Hanlon, described the development plans for Dunleath as ldquoexciting and praised the local authorityrsquos sensible approach to maximise its potential.She also conceded that while parts of the park present challenges as they are included within a flood plain, there is agreement aiming local politicians on the way forward.ldquoWe need to press ahead with what is achievable in the short term at Dunleath Park, whilst keeping an eye on a longer-term strategy. I am pleased that Downpatrick area councillors can work collectively for progress in the area, she added.Itrsquos understood that details of Downpatrickrsquos first ever parkrun event are being finalised and that once the date of the K event has been confirmed, the event will become an annual event for runners of all abilities.Hugely popular across the globe, those working to bring the event to Downpatrick say it has the potential to provide the local economy with a boost, bringing in many competitors from outside the town.Downpatrick Town Committee is behind the ambitious plan for the new parkrun which it believes will bring the local community closer together and may encourage people who have never run before to get out and enjoy themselves in an event where there is no time limit and no one finishes last..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Recovery is possible to restore bond with you and eating food  ","story":"WITH the pandemic dictating to us over the last two years, there has been an increase for those struggling to manage their dficult feelings, sudden le changes, isolation and trying to gain a sense of control mdash which has resulted in an increase of cases for the treatment of eating disorders.Eating disorders, or a disordered pattern of eating, can arise when a person uses food to cope with painful situations or uncomfortable feelings.Problems with food develop when it is used for emotional rather than physical reasons, such as feelings of anxiety, anger or guilt. The food serves as a stress reliever and in many cases initially the person is not aware of what they are doing.In this day and age of dieting, health and fitness, it is sometimes dficult to ascertain the dference between someone who has an eating disorder and a person who is simply weight conscious.The main ingredient present in a person with an eating disorder is the use or abuse of food to cope with dficult feelings, whereas a weight conscious person may simply want to lose weight for a wedding, an occasion, to fit into an outfit.It is the psychological and emotional implications that separate the weight conscious person from the person with an eating disorder. Unfortunately, some embarking on a weight loss trail start out innocently to lose lsquoa few poundsrsquo, however over a period of time a personrsquos brain and body chemistry can be affected by the diet they have chosen and as a result the brain and bodybecome impaired.Possible causesThere is no single cause for eating disorders, as there are many factors pertaining to them. The common thread seems to be a supersensitive nature, low self esteem and an inability to respond appropriately to uncomfortable feelings.The good news is recovery is possible and a person can restore their relationship with themselves and with food. All iniduals have their own unique personal issues that contribute to their eating disorder, so treatment has to be tailored to the iniduals specic needs, personality and lestyle.Who develops disorders Anyone can develop an eating disorder, regardless of age, sex cultural background, etc, and it is not unusual for an eating disorder to surface in middle age. Research suggests that there may also be a genetic disposition to eating disorders and a link to certain personality types.However, there are certain factors pertaining to eating disorders and anyone can develop a disordered pattern of eating. A traumatic event, disordered perception, being abused, being bullied, a long term illness, a death, negative influences from a family member or a friend can all have a part to play in the symphony that can create issues around food.What are the categories There are several categories of eating disorders. However the main culprits are anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder and other related disorders.These disorders centre around extreme or potentially dangerous eating and weight control behaviours which include binge eating, starving, purging, chewing and spitting and over exercising.There are two less known eating disorders mdash night eating syndrome and orthorexia nervosamdash as well as further categories under the title of EDNOS , but today Irsquod Like to explore the three most common types of eating disorder.AnorexiaThe first case of anorexia was in  in France and the first paper on anorexia was written by Sir William Gull in .Anorexia is the relentless pursuit of low body weight either by curtailing food intake or restricting particular foods thought to be fattening. This can result in emaciation and the risk of collapse or death.Some people exercise compulsively to burn off the lsquoperceivedrsquo excess of calories from the small amount theydo manage to eat. The focus based on food is an attempt to cope with control and to feel some sense of power in their lives.It is not about simply wishing to be slim like models in magazines. Starvation causes the disorder to take control and this alters brain and body chemistry that results in further distortions, in thinking and emotional reasoning. As the illness takes more of a hold, a person starts to become exhausted as their energy levels are compromised due to lack of nutrition. This, together with an increase in negative energy, may account for the heaviness they feel.In all cases this heaviness is mistaken for fatness, hence they engage in a constant struggle to keep losing weight. It is a war on food that must be maintained despite the already severe weight loss that the person has incurred.Anorexia checklist:Weight loss in a short space of timeLoss of periods for womenFeeling cold all the timeDizzinessDry, rough, pale discoloured skinSevere restriction of foodFood rituals, such as chopping food into small pieces, counting bits of foodBloated stomach Loss of bone massMood swingsPerfectionistic attitudesInsecuritySelf-worth becomes based on what is eaten or not eatenIntense fear of gaining weightDistorted perception of body shape, weight, personality and amount of food eatenRigid and obsessive behaviourWearing baggy clothesAvoiding companyIn some cases some take laxativesBuzz from starving ndash sense of power or worthConviction that they are OK despite concerns of otherAs you can see, the above have far reaching effects on a personrsquos health and well-being, and as suchleft untreated can be fatal.The long term effects can lead to women becoming infertile or have dficulty getting pregnant. There is also a high risk of developing osteoporosis for both men and women.BulimiaThe term Bulimia nervosa literally means lsquoox hunger of nervous originrsquo. This hunger is driven by an emotional need that food cannot alone fill. Usually this person feels this void or gap or emptiness and they seek to use food to fill it. Unfortunately, as many find out, the emptiness cannot be filled by food, as it is emotional, physical and spiritual.Sufferers characteristically binge eat or over eat and end up feeling bloated, worse, too full. After their eating episode they then vomit and or take laxatives in a bid to prevent themselves from gaining weight. Others also over exercise in a bid to burn unwanted calories. As with anorexia, control and the abuse of food to cope are also present.Bulimia usually follows dieting and starts later than anorexia mdash in late adolescence. It may follow anorexia. It can continue for many yearsleft untreated, thus many older women have the illness. The period after childbirth is another time when women are at risk.Bulimia is also associated with low self esteem, lack of confidence and over-evaluation of weight and shape, and a need to control weight. Bulimic behaviour is very addictive as, while vomiting and exercising the brain releases endorphins, chemicals which are the bodyrsquos natural pain killers.The ritual confers a sense of emotional release, so what starts off as a way of controlling calories, becomes a way of getting this emotional release ndash which will be repeated whenever a person feels emotional or physical stress.Bulimia checklist:Frequent weight changes.Sore throat, swollen glands, tooth decay, bad breath.Preoccupation with an overestimation of body shape and weight.VomitingLaxative abuseRigid and harsh exercise regimesFear of putting on weightDepressionMood swingsElectrolyte and fluid imbalancesPoor skin condition and hair lossLethargy and tirednessHeart palpitationsInternal organs damageUncontrollable urges to eat vast amounts of foodAnxiety, guilt and shame attached to self and behaviourFeelings of isolationBuzz from vomiting, sense of release reliefBuzz from perceived weight lossEasy weight gain.Again, like anorexia, the above can have a far reaching effect on mental, emotional, physical and spiritual well being. In extreme cases bulimia causes heart failure because when a person induces vomiting, they lose potassium from the body.Potassium is a mineral which regulates the sdrenal glands, the nervous system, the heart and energy levels of the body. The adrenal glands in the body are responsible for handling stress effectively. Other dangers include rupture of the stomach, choking, drying up of saliy glands.Binge eatingLike bulimia, binge eating disorder has only recently been recognised as a distinct condition. It was in  that it was first acknowledged as an eating disorder in its own right.BED is very similar to bulimia in all respects, except that the person does not purge to dispose of unwanted calories. It is believed that there are more people suffering from BED than anorexia or bulimia.People who binge or overeat and who do not purge usually struggle with their weight, although not all are overweight. Being overweight , of course brings with it the risk of a host of other physical illnesses and most sufferers feel depressed, out of control and ashamed of their behaviour.Binge eating checklist:Binging in secretEating very rapidlyEmotional eatingCanrsquot stop when had enoughSensing the eating behaviour is not normalEating despite feeling very fullsometimesFeeling out of control when eatingShame, depression, guiltCompulsive eating when not hungryFantasies about being a better person when thin.As many people with weight issues are judged by society, a supportive and nurturing environment is necessary in order for the inidual to feel safe. Here again, education is a vital component of recovery from any eating disorder. Therapeutic interventions work at both physical and emotional levels to deal with the urges, cravings, to change eating habits, look at thought patterns and rules, becoming more emotionally resilient. Ultimately treatment is available that helps each inidual become empowered, recover and move forward with their lives.If you have any queries or would like to arrange an appointment please call   or email empower@post www.empowercounsellingni.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Top dancer Anna qualifies for World Championships  ","story":"LOCAL Irish dancers have proven themselves to be a step above the rest once again.Members of the Crossgar-based Scoil Rince an Chroiacute dance school enjoyed plenty of success at the Kelly Hendry Feis in Newcastle upon Tyne and the Mid-Ulster Grades Feis in Dungannon.Thirty-five dancers from the school took to the stage at both locations with dancers excelling in both the grades system and championships.The school ed home with  first places,  top five places and a host of trophies and sashes.The schoolrsquos success comes of the back of a very successful Ulster Championships in Ballybofey in October.Anna McGlew qualied for the World Championships to be held in Belfast at Easter and Sean Gordon achieved fth place, reaching a podium place at his first Ulsters, having only started to compete four months prior.Teacher Briacuted McKinney said: ldquoWhilst acknowledging the ious pandemic-related challenges brought to us in  and early this year, the great class spirit and support for each other helped drive our ious success both last year and this year to date.Co-teacher Maura Davidson commented: ldquoThe results are down to the commitment, dedication and support from our dancers and families.The school now prepares for their first championship feis in Downpatrick later this month and the World Championships at Easter.Classes continue weekly at the studio in Crossgar.

Teaching, and hence learning, relies on communication, the essential verbal and non-verbal communication between child and teacher cannot take place behind a mask. All those non-verbal cues which teachers use to gauge understanding are being lost.A child’s capacity to express feelings and emotions is being affected by being masked. Some children cannot make eye contact and can’t sleep, clear signs of psychological distress and of course, impacting on their capacity to learn. Referrals to schools’ counselling services have rocketed.How can it be healthy for a child to wear a mask six or seven hours per day How can we justy a measure which has no benefit to children and accept the damage to their education, mental health and social development It is long past the time to end this abuse of our children.Hugh McCarthy, , Newtownabbey——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Prior to being in Lurgan, the organisation’s administrative base was located in Dublin and Belfast.The Royal Black moved out of Brownlow House in  to temporary premises in Loughgall, beside the Museum of Orange Heritage at Sloan’s House.Now, the institution is looking forward to taking up residence in their own purpose-built administrative centre.“The opening of our new headquarters will be a landmark day in the history of the Royal Black Institution,” said Rev Anderson.“This project has been one of the biggest and most important ever undertaken by the Imperial Grand Black Chapter of the British Commonwealth.“The need for our own headquarters was discussed and agreed in , we purchased the Loughgall building in , renovation work began in May , and I’m delighted to say we’re ready to cut the ribbon on Saturday, April .“It has been a long road to get to this point, and there have been many challenges along the way. “We had originally hoped to open the building in , so that the unveiling would form part of our celebrations for the centenary of Northern Ireland. However, the Covid pandemic wreaked havoc with our work schedule. But we were fairly relaxed about the delay as our focus was always about completing the building to a high standard rather than rushing to a completion date.“There are so many people to thank for all their hard work but I would like to take this opportunity to pay special tribute to the contractors, Weir Bros Construction, for their professionalism and attention to detail, and to our own clerk of works, Edgar Patterson, and quantity surveyor, Keith Anderson, and the entire Royal Black HQ project team, for their passion, commitment and expertise over the last few years.“Thanks to the efforts of everyone involved, we now have modern headquarters from which we can proudly maintain our stand for the Reformed Faith and strengthen our Christian and charitable outreach.”The building itself has an interesting history. At one stage it was a public house known as the Rock Tavern. Afterwards, a temperance advocate, Cecilia Cope, turned it into a coffee house. A later inhabitant was Field Marshal Sir Gerald Templer, a senior British Army officer and former chief of the Imperial General Staff, who fought in both world wars. In more recent times it housed a popular antiques business.The grand opening will also include the opening of a ‘Leaders’ Legacy’ exhibition on the lives of past sovereign grand masters, and the unveiling and dedication of a bust of Sir Norman Stronge. Sir Norman Stronge was a former sovereign grand master who led the institution from  to .A hero of the Somme and a senior Ulster Unionist politician, having served for  years as speaker of the House of Commons of Northern Ireland, he was murdered in January  when an IRA gang burst into his home, Tynan Abbey in Co Armagh, and shot dead the -year-old, together with his only son, James, also a member of the institution.Loughgall  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularOil prices NI: Why are home heating oil prices rising across Northern Ireland  motorists ‘engaged in anti-social behaviour’ in NI townWhere to drop off items in Northern Ireland to help refugees who are fleeing UkraineRussia invasion of Ukraine: Sinn Fein ‘must step back from pro-Putin propaganda’ say DUP and UUPWATCH: Ukrainian forces are now armed with new ‘built in Belfast’ NLAW anti-tank bazookasMost PopularNI Running prodigy Emer McKee sets new world record at -yearsBest Aldi dupes : top perfume, skincare, beauty, makeup, cleansing balm products from Lacura to le Creuset best backpacking tents UK : lightweight, one-person tents ideal for hikingBest inflatable hot tubs : blow-up spa hot tubs, from -person, to Laz-y-Spa Hot Tub, Intex and CleverspaBest pancake pans UK : from non-stick to cast iron, these pans will produce perfect pancakes every time                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisUkraine CrisisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Jazz is something which lends itself to beginning at an early age. It is very dficult, it is the highest level of musical expression.“It requires the technique and the discipline of the classical musician, but the main part is the improvisation and your personality as a musician. It is a lelong quest.“It is very dficult to start in jazz as an adult. We have never really had any jazz education here in Northern Ireland.“It hit me thatthere was ever a scene formed and musicians are going to stay in this country, then there needs to be some form of education and it needs to happen at an early age.”He added: “Many musicians get to a good level and they can’t find work, there is not really a scene here or a large pool of musicians to work with.“The young people who are part of the first Jazz Juniors ensemble are from classical backgrounds, folk backgrounds, singer-songwriter backgrounds.“It is a small group of nine people from throughout the country.

They say that the beach is a sand and shingle beach and has a reputation for being one of the cleanest in the region. There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityAs reported exclusively on our sister site The National on St Davids Day, the Cardf Capital Regiongroup of local authorities has bought the site of Wales last coal-fired power station for £ million. CCR says it is committing £. million to the project in total, which includes the purchase price.The other £. million will be spent on \"demolition, remediation, and re-development\".The contracts have now been exchanged between Cardf Capital Region and energy giant RWE, the seller. The distinctive Aberthaw Power Station as seen from the air. Photo: Siriol Grfiths The Cardf Capital Region have released a proposed \"master plan\" for the redevelopment of the site, which they say \"will take several years to come to fruition given the nature of and complexities involved in the transitioning process\".In sum, CCR says it will:Support the production of renewable and green energy projectsProvide an accompanying battery storage facility to support the green energy projectsProduce a zero-carbon manufacturing cluster which will include green hydrogen production facilitiesProvide a green energy innovation centre to promote innovation, growth, knowledge and community interaction with the zero-carbon future of WalesBe responsible for the development and maintenance of a bio-erse ecology park which will include a visitor centre, providing amenities to the local communityCreate the correct conditions to support industrial de-carbonisation and future giga-plant facilities.Cardf Capital Region also says the project has \"the potential to create thousands of direct, indirect and induced jobs, along with local supply chain and upskilling benefits\", though no further details were supplied as to what that means in practical terms. An artists impression of the Aberthaw Power Station site created by London real estate giant, Reef Group for Cardf Capital Region The master plan of the site produced by London real estate giant Reef Group on behalf of Cardf Capital Region The CCR goes on to say that it will \"maintain a strong commitment to engage and involve local community stakeholders in order to develop an open, inclusive and participative ethos as soon as the commercially sensitive considerations have been addressed.\"There are areas of the site which require ongoing custodianship, in respect of nature, bioersity and managing the overall ecology of the site, which will be best achieved in partnership with community.\"The Aberthaw nature reserve. The lagoon is where the ancient Aberthaw harbour was situated before it was destroyed to make way for the power station. Photo: Siriol Grfiths The group also says that its redevelopment plan will \"commit to safeguarding and developing the Nature Reserve, working with colleagues in the Vale of Glamorgan Council to ensure effective plans are put in place. In the interim, whilst plans are worked through, commitment is given to ensure this ecologically valuable component of the site is protected and, wherever possible, further enhanced and augmented\".However, Cardf Capital Region, despite promising to work with local residents in the future, stops short of making specic reference to concerns raised by members of the nearby community recently. Those concerns centre around what will happen to the  metre high pulverised ash mound, the sea wall being breached by the tide, and problems with traffic due to poor local transport infrastructure. The long Aberthaw Power Station ash mound, m high. The smoke stack can be seen in the background. Photo: Siriol Grfiths \"Well believe these plans when we see them,\" Paul Turner told The National. He has been living in the shadow of the power station since  and says that since then, he and his we Sara have seen many ideas come and go, including nuclear power and tidal energy. \"Everybody who lives near that site knows how toxic it is. The ash tip is full of asbestos from when they demolished the original A power station. And the site gets flooded whenever theres a spring tide or a storm, ask anyone who has worked there. Thatll only get worse as the years go by.\"Will £ million keep the tide from drowning that site  Id say RWE are laughing all the way to the bank.\"The Climate Central Coastal Risk Screening Tool predicts that the site will be under water by , with flooding reaching as far inland as St Hilarys There are similar concerns from Barry Town Councillor, Dennis Clarke: \"The ambition for the Vale to access clean, green, high value employment is commendable but this site could not be sold to private industry. The likely reason the site was regarded as unsaleable might be the cost of dealing with tidal flooding, clearing the signicant level of contamination, removing the slag heap, identied as dangerous by RWE.\"Its well known that the road access is completely insufficient, especially bearing in mind the Vale and the Welsh Government persist in supporting a too large, unviable development at Model Farm\"I hope the CCR releases the papers that will show why they believe this site is suitable for any development beyond reinstating what was in place before the power station was built.\"A map produced by London real estate giant Reef Group in  depicting so-called major assets nearbyIn its statement, the CCR describes the Aberthaw site as having \"strong strategic links with other major assets, including Bro Tathan Business Park, Cardf Airport, and the overarching St Athan Enterprise Zone – one of the few sites in the UK capable of accommodating large-scale lithium-ion battery production\".Last month, the Welsh Government was accused of having let a proposed gigafactory project at St Athan \"slip throughfingers\" by Welsh Conservative South Wales Central MS Andrew RT Davies. It followed an announcement by car battery manufacturer, Britishvolt, that it was creating a factory in Northumberland, whereas St Athan had been its original preferred location. March  : Aberthaw Power Station as photographed from the Wales Coast Path. The site is currently badly flooded in the wake of recent storms and spring tides. Photo: Siriol Grfiths CCRs plans make no specic reference to tidal energy at Aberthaw either, despite the group having earmarked the site as being \"perfect for that type of facility\" last summer. By October , it was also reported that a new commission was being set up to explore building a barrage across the Severn estuary for tidal energy CCR is a part of that commission. However, a statement supplied by Welsh Government Economy Minister, Vaughan Gething, does moot the possibility of tidal energy: \"The proposed plan for Aberthaw is positive news which fits well with our commitment to develop tidal lagoon projects and support ideas that can help Wales become a world centre for emerging tidal technologies\".Mr Gethings enthusiasm is echoed by the UK governments Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales, David TC Davies, who is the Conservative MP for Monmouth: \"The UK Government’s investment in the Cardf Capital Region will deliver thousands of jobs at Aberthaw and help put Wales on course for an economic recovery from the pandemic.\"The current s of the Cardf Capital Region - including any activity at Aberthaw - will eventually move into the new South East Wales Corporate Joint Committee .Three other Corporate Joint Committees will cover the rest of Wales in the south-west, the north, and the central area of the country.This article originally appeared on our sister site The National. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

While most children aged  to  will have mild diseasethey contract COVID-, some may experience symptoms which last longer than just a few days. Vaccination of children in this age group has been shown to help prevent the small number of hospitalisations and intensive care admissions that can occur in this age group. It has also been shown to help provide short-term protection against non-severe disease. Dr Jillian Johnston, Joint Interim Assistant Director in Health Protection at the PHA, said: “We know the COVID risk for young children is less than for older people, but we also know the vaccine is very safe, has already been used extensively around the world, and there is no evidence that it causes any long term issues. When you look at the risk of COVID- against the risk of the vaccine, it’s more beneficial for children to receive the vaccine. It not only boosts the child’s immunity against the risk of severe disease, but helps protect more vulnerable or older family members in advance of any potential future wave of COVID-.” A new specially-designed children’s formulation of the Pfizer BioNTech COVID- vaccine has been approved for this age group and it’s given at a lower dose compared with that used in iniduals aged  and above . Like all children’s vaccines, this approval was given following a robust review of data showing that it is safe and effective to use in this cohort. Clinical trials have shown that this vaccine was highly effective at preventing COVID- in children, protecting them and also reducing the chance that they transmit the virus to others, including family members who may be more susceptible to severe consequences of the infection. Dr Johnston continued by saying: “In Northern Ireland, childhood vaccination programmes have consistently achieved high coverage and we hope that parents will be supportive of this roll out and get their child vaccinated. Vaccination is the most important thing we can do to protect ourselves and our children against ill-health. Evenyour child has already had COVID-, it is still important to get them vaccinated, as being fully-vaccinated can offer them the best protection from the virus and severe disease.” From Wednesday  March  you can make an appointment for your child at a children’s vaccination clinic in your local Health and Social Care Trust using the online booking system at:covid-.hscni.net get-vaccinated. You may be able to attend without an appointment. Dr Johnston concluded: “COVID- has not gone away. Getting vaccinated provides the best protection for both the child and their family. Children will need two doses of the vaccine, usually  weeks apart, to get longer-lasting protection. If your child has tested positive for COVID-, you should normally wait  weeks from the test for your child to have their first or second vaccine.” For further information for parents on the COVID- vaccine for  to  year olds visitpha.site all-s Or to find out where your nearest COVID- vaccine clinic is, visitvaccinations.covid-.hscni.net location-search  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_bbabacabef   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fbbafc   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
