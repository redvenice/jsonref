An armed police officer on London Bridge as officers deal with the terror attack in June 2017\u0027I have formed the view that consideration ought to be given to legislating for further offences of possession of the most serious material glorifying or encouraging terrorism.\u0027The coroner said it would be wrong to criticise the investigation into Butt before the attack, calling the work of MI5 and police \u0027generally thorough and rigorous\u0027.But he made a series of suggestions to police and security chiefs about how they could work more closely and ensure that tips from the public and foreign services are properly shared and communicated.The report also found MI5 must try to improve its systems for ongoing investigations into terrorist suspects.         Traders and visitors pause for a minute\u0027s silence at London\u0027s Borough Market on June 14, 2017The report said: \u0027Although MI5 must be able to prioritise and ert resources at times of greatest demand, the suspension of priority investigations is a matter of legitimate public concern.\u0027Accordingly, the systems for suspending such investigations - including the criteria for suspension, recording of suspension decisions and systems for re-building intelligence after suspensions - should be specifically considered in the continuing work of review and improvement.\u0027That work should also give consideration to the potential value of flexible systems for scaling back, rather than necessarily suspending, investigative work at times of high demand.\u0027The attack came just three months after 52-year-old Khalid Masood mowed down pedestrians on Westminster Bridge with a hired car before stabbing police officer Keith Palmer to death.         Imams and other religious leaders hold a vigil near the scene of the attack on June 7, 2017 And questions were raised in the London Bridge inquests about why there were no security measures in place to prevent vehicles being used as weapons, with barriers only installed on the bridge in the immediate aftermath.The coroner identified \u0027weaknesses\u0027 in the systems for putting such measures in place and suggested authorities should take steps to address the concerns.He also said action should be taken to reduce the risk of rented vehicles being used in terror attacks, which could include automated checking of rentals against lists of SOIs.Home Secretary Priti Patel has until January 10 to respond to the report, setting out details of action taken or proposed, or why no action will be taken.          The chief coroner published a series of recommendations today in the report released todayHelen Boniface, a senior associate at solicitors firm Hogan Lovells, who represented six families in the inquest, said: \u0027We are pleased the Chief Coroner has recognised the risks presented by hateful extremism and terrorist propaganda, possession of which must be taken seriously, and the ease by which large vehicles may be hired by terrorist suspects.\u0027The response on the night by many was commendable, especially members of the public who stayed to assist.\u0027But failings and delays were also seen and the coroner identifies this through his report.\u0027The emergency medical response to those who died in the Boro Bistro area remains disappointing to our clients, with no London Ambulance Service personnel entering this area until many hours after the attack.\u0027  "},{"url":null,"title":"Arizona toddler bonds zombie doll","story":"Share this article A man\u0027s voice is heard saying, \u0027Give him a kiss, Leo\u0027, whereupon the youngster tries to do just that. However, his \u0027kiss\u0027 is more like a bite over the doll\u0027s mouth.

Concrete residential blocks, hotels, civic centres and monuments shot up across the country in a show of power from a state between two worlds, western democracy and the communist east. Photographs by Marko ĐuricaReuters. Written by Ivana Sekularac.Genex Tower is unmissable on the highway from Belgrade airport to the centre of the city. Its two soaring blocks, connected by an aerial bridge and topped with a long-closed rotating restaurant resembling a space capsule, are such an unusual sight, the 1977-build tower has become a magnet for tourists despite years of neglect. The tower is one of the most significant examples of brutalism – an architectural style popular in the 1950s and 1960s, based on crude, block-like forms cast from concrete.Brutalism was popular throughout the eastern bloc but the former Yugoslavia made it its own – seizing on it as a way to forge a visual identity poised between east and west. Interest in the style is soaring – particularly since a 2018 exhibition in New York’s Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) called Concrete Utopia: Architecture in Yugoslavia, 1948-1980.“We have dozens of people every week interested in taking our Yugo tour around city landmarks built from the 1950s to 1980s,” says Vojin Muncin, manager of the Yugotour sightseeing agency which guides tourists around the Serbian capital in Yugos, the former Yugoslavia’s once ubiquitous car. “Genex Tower is among the most interesting sight. People see it on their way from the airport and it immediately draws their attention.” Today one of the pillars is empty, while the other is residential. The rotating restaurant was last open in the 1990s.After the second world war, socialist Yugoslavia led by Josip Broz Tito set out to reconstruct a land destroyed by fighting. Initially allied to the Soviet Union, Tito broke with Soviet leader Joseph Stalin in 1948. Residential blocks, hotels, civic centres and monuments all made of concrete shot up across the country. The architecture was supposed to show the power of a state between two worlds – western democracy and the communist east, looking to forge its own path and create a socialist utopia.But after Tito died in 1980, and economic crisis took hold, the new elites sought to distance themselves from the socialist regime, including its architecture. In 1991 the series of wars began that led to the collapse of Yugoslavia.“Now enough time has passed (since Yugoslavia fell apart) and people have begun to appreciate the architecture of Yugoslavia,” says Alan Braun, lecturer at Zagreb University’s architecture faculty. He explains that the style was unique because of its visible influence from the west, reflecting Yugoslavia’s unique position. Residential areas were planned to have enough parks, cinemas, swimming pools and even parking space.Keen to capitalise on the interest, Belgrade authorities are now considering opening parts of another masterpiece of Yugoslav brutalism – the Palata Srbija (Palace of Serbia) government building, which is currently only open once a year.The Palata Srbija building hosted former world leaders such as US presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford and Russian leaders Nikita Khrushchev and Leonid Brezhnev. Each of the former Yugoslav republics had its own salon with a central room called the hall of Yugoslavia.Furniture and carpets were custom made and prominent artists produced paintings and mosaics. The outside of the building is concrete, but the inside is marble. Its centrepiece is a crystal chandelier beneath a 19-metre dome weighing more than nine tonnes. “It is a shame to keep such a master piece away from the eyes of the public,” said Sandra Vesic Tesla, curator of the building.Other examples of Yugoslav brutalism include the huge memorials commemorating the struggle against fascism by Tito’s partisans, often placed in dramatic rural settings. Many of those pieces of art remain in disrepair, such as the monument to the uprising against fascism in Petrova Gora in Croatia.However, the Tjentiste memorial, commemorating the killing of 7,000 people by the Nazis was renovated last year. Miodrag Zivkovic, the 91-year-old sculptor of the 19-metre-high concrete Tjentiste memorial, was among the first artists in the former Yugoslavia to use concrete.“It is stable material, resembling stone but it is easier to work with,” he said. “For every project back in those days there was a national contest, and artists from all over the country had the opportunity to apply, and that competition produced quality.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db3d01e346b86a9ae21a5d1e4ddf5673acbc1989/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6dec88a9a57f80ae52053e90f8130cb4","title":"how philip pullman lyra won the world","story":"As His Dark Materials comes to TV, the prize-winning children’s author Katherine Rundell looks at how a scrappy girl became one of literature’s best-loved charactersI first read Philip Pullman’s His Dark Materials trilogy as a young teen it felt like a revelation. The books had a rough-textured animal-breath closeness that I had rarely encountered before, and at the heart of that was a small child, swift witted and loose handed with the truth, throwing mud at rival children, and her soul companion, her daemon Pantalaimon. I decided there and then, with all acknowledgements to the glory and joy of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, of Sophie in Diana Wynne Jones’s Howl’s Moving Castle, of Malorie Blackman’s Sephy Hadley in Noughts \u0026amp Crosses and of Roald Dahl’s Matilda, that the greatest heroine in British children’s books was Lyra.There is good evidence that many people of my generation felt the same. Pullman now shares with Shakespeare, Jonathan Swift and Philip Sidney the distinction of having invented a popular English-language name that has become so popular it’s now part of the lexicon. We owe the name Vanessa to Swift, who gave it as a piglatinish nickname to his lover Esther (Esse for short) Vanhomrigh, and Pamela (originally pronounced, originally, Pameela) to Sidney. Shakespeare has at least two the first sighting we have of Miranda (from mirandus, meaning wonderful) is The Tempest, and Jessica, probably in an Anglicisation of the Old Testament Hebrew name Iscah, first appears in English in The Merchant of Venice. And last year, 362 new Lyras were born.The name came, originally, from a misunderstanding. Pullman told the New Yorker: “There was a hymn I particularly liked called ‘Jesus Christ Is Risen Today, Alleluia’ … And under the number of the hymn, printed in small italics, was usually the name of the author. In this case, the name there was Lyra Davidica.” It was, he thought, a good name. “In fact, what Lyra Davidica means is the ‘harp of David’. ‘Lyra’ is a Greek word for a musical instrument like a harp.”Where did Lyra herself come from? She has, I think, DNA from many places: from the tricksters in old English ballads, from William Brown and his Outlaws, from the orphaned Cinderella (not the Disney one the versions from the 17th and 18th centuries, who had wit and guile and an edge of ruthlessness on their side. In Giambattista Basile’s La Gatta Cenerentola, Zezolla murders her stepmother by chopping off her head with the lid of a trunk.) Pullman told me: “Lyra just came to me as she was. I didn’t change a bit, or alter anything to her advantage. Having taught in middle schools for 12 years or so, I was well aware that there was a Lyra in every class. The point I always make, when asked about it, is that Lyra is not special. She’s ordinary, not to say common. But it’s the qualities she shares with so many real girls that help her when she finds herself in extraordinary circumstances.”So Lyra is in some ways utterly commonplace: solid legged, dirty nailed, a liar without much concern about the consequences of her lies. That ordinariness is what makes her so vivid despite the fact that the witches have a prophecy about her, she doesn’t have, unlike Harry Potter, any particular magic: she has nothing in her that makes her uniquely suited for her task ahead. She is made, not born, a hero. As Pullman says, “I’m an old-fashioned existentialist in some ways: existence precedes essence, and I’ll fight anyone who says different.” It takes work, the books tell us, to become a heroine: strenuous effort, constant attention to the world, a willingness to peel back the layers of your own heart.But of course she is also not ordinary, because she has in her possession a compass-like device that can tell the truth, one of the loveliest inventions of children’s fiction, alongside Tolkien’s ring and Rowling’s pensieve: an alethiometer (from the Greek aletheia, truth). Her ability to read it gives her, in the world of the book, an extraordinary authority that most children are denied. She is able to transcend that one factor of childhood that I found hardest to bear: the sense of disfranchisement from a world that extends so far beyond your understanding as to be painfully opaque. I read with a fierce hunger to see the world I hated, above everything, not understanding.I think a true hero or heroine needs to have both something we want or covet (for instance, a princedom in Denmark a fairy godmother) and something that we are (tormented by our own uncertainties transformable). Lyra has both in Pantalaimon. The daemons – animal manifestations of the human soul – are the reason the books pulse with life: they have, after all, twice the usual amount of life in them. I am often asked, by children I meet at school visits or book festivals, what would be my daemon? It became to a whole generation of readers a kind of taxonomy of self-definition (I think mine would be something that seeks to be up high: a squirrel, or a bird of the less glossy kind. Be wary of people who say “a leopard”: they do not know themselves.)The thing I wanted most, though, changed over the course of the books. By The Amber Spyglass, the final book in the trilogy, what I wanted was not the alethiometer, nor even a daemon, but the love. Lyra falls in love with Will Parry, and finds herself stunned. Their love is physically felt: “I want to kiss you and lie down with you and wake up with you every day of my life till I die.” Sexuality, and the adult love that comes with it, is in Pullman’s world something to cherish: something, seen in its true light, more astonishing and surprising even than riding over snow on an armoured bear. Pullman said in an interview a few years ago that, if the book is a version of Paradise Lost, “what I wanted to do was represent the fall as entirely good. It is good for people to know things, to grow up, to become sexual beings.”And Lyra’s love allows her a different kind of seeing: it is the transformative vision of her love that allows her – without giving away the plot – to save Pullman’s world. That is, perhaps, the final reason Lyra has been so loved: she is in part Pullman’s longhand philosophical proof of an argument at the heart of all three books of the trilogy: notice. Lyra and Pan’s eyes are everywhere. She is curious above everything. It is the core demand of the books: pay loving attention to the world. We owe the world our ferocious attention, to fail at that would be the true fall.I’ve been writing children’s books for more than a decade now when I go to speak at schools, irrespective of country, the children’s questions are often the same. (“Where do you get your ideas from? Do you ever get stuck? How much money do you make? Do you write with a pen?” These all seem entirely fair questions to me, and in fact are what I long to ask other writers.) But recently at a festival in Italy, I met a more than usually philosophical group of 12 year olds. They asked: “What is the colour of happiness?” and “What one thing would you change about your life?” – like being interviewed by a gang of small, glitterpen wielding Kierkegaards. The last question was, “What is it you are trying to do when you write?” and I thought of His Dark Materials. As a child those books felt to me like food. So what I am trying to do is informed profoundly by that: I want to build stories that feel like nourishment. His Dark Materials stands as a testament to what children’s books can be: three books that add up to a feast.• His Dark Materials begins on BBC1 at 8pm on 3 November. Katherine Rundell’s most recent book for children, The Good Thieves (Bloomsbury), is out now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e2c666cc5fa4a02f7e0758552ed809e09aa789f/0_283_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aed2b3e5dca00e442507239369f3af4e","title":"tips links and suggestions what are you reading this week","story":"Your space to discuss the books you are reading and what you think of them Welcome to this week’s blogpost. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.First up, an admirable post from steevieb, who has had a change of heart about Elizabeth Strout’s Olive Kitteridge:Some time ago (years) I began reading Olive Kitteridge. Just couldn’t get on with it though, got bored with the small town America bit. Last week I decided to give it another go, I am so glad I did, totally blew me away, beautifully written, I loved every page so much that I immediately bought Amy and Isabelle, which to me was even better. How I could have been bored by it (Olive K) the first time around is a puzzle. Moods, I guess.Tom Mooney has also been rereading some classics:Hemingway’s The Old Man and the Sea, not for the first time. It is wonderful, perfect even. I found some of it a little tougher to read this time, particularly the killing of the sharks (I had been reading a LOT of Cormac McCarthy around the time I read it before so was likely very desensitised!) but it stands up magnificently to repeated reading.I must be in the mood for old stuff as I also recently reread The Swimmer, John Cheever’s glorious masterpiece of a short story. It’s one of my all-time favourites and shows what a sharp writer he was.Night Waking by Sarah Moss has satisfied BobHammond2:Set on the fictional Scottish island of Colonsay, academic Anna is trying to juggle the challenges of motherhood, marriage, her academic career and a fair amount of sleep deprivation - and then a mystery around a baby’s skeleton buried outside her house on the island. Overlaid on top of this is a separate timeline where we see, throughout the book, a series of letters written by a midwife sent to the island back in the late 1800s to improve infant mortality. So, Moss has a lot to juggle but she does it brilliantly and the two separate stories and all the loose threads are brought together at the end of the book for a very satisfying conclusion.fuzzywuzz has enjoyed The Body by Bill Bryson:What a marvellous adventure I have been on, taking a tour of the various organ systems within a human being. Although I studied biochemistry and physiology in my student days, I have learned some interesting new things and revisited already known facts.What I particularly like about Bryson’s style here is that he has taken some complex subject areas such as immunology and transfusion science and distilled them into something which can be mentally digested by those without a scientific background and does so without patronising the reader.ID673795 has enjoyed Caravan of the Lost and Left Behind by Deirdre Shanahan:The story of a woman traveller and her son returning from chaotic lives in England to live on a traveller’s site in Ireland with her father, where she also hopes to find her daughter, left there as a baby. The landscape is beautifully described and the story very sad but in the end hopeful.BanjoGuru has just finished But Beautiful by Geoff Dyer “which I enjoyed a lot”:I was expecting straight biographies of some jazz greats, but it’s an altogether stranger beast - part imagined, part true, full of shifting perspectives and illusions and some really perceptive and evocative prose. I can recommend it if you like jazz, or even if you don’t.Now this is a funny and wise book. The quips and cultural insights are ridiculously true. Especially about the X and Y generations. Professor Chandra himself is a true delight … I found myself asking, “So who IS this smart guy who wrote this fine book?” That’s when you know it’s a good’un. This book is smart, hilarious, and best of all ... kindhearted. Yes, filled with an open hearted way of looking at the people we love and our struggles as well as struggles of our world and culture today.Finally, MarGar65 has just finished Penelope Fitzgerald’s Innocence:I loved it. I am so glad her books have come into my life! What an observant author ... What trust she places in us as she unfolds her stories. She refuses to bend to the expectation of a happy ending. I fear I am running out of To-Be-Read Fitzgeralds ... This is most alarming in a sense because I will run out of new Fitzgeralds, but I am relieved when I think that I can go always go back and reread them all.Going back to reread Fitzgerald sounds like an admirable idea. Just the kind of thing that should get us through winter…If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

Hope school was OK. Are you buying that? Hope you have a lovely dinner.’ That can be an encouragement – the world is a safer place than they think. And actually that transmission of kindness shows maybe there is a possibility of communication, particularly for those who are shy or withdrawn. It’s really important that they expand their experiences to learn that while they might have had really difficult experiences, there could be other people who actually can be protective and supportive.”Talking to younger childrenGetting people, especially children, to open up, and share their feelings and thoughts can be trickier than we sometimes think. But Bush suggests that the best reason to reach children is to remember that they are people, albeit a little younger than us.“Remember, children and young people are people. The reason I say that is, we like to be spoken to in an empathetic and understanding way. Most of us prefer someone to talk to us at our own eye height.“Let’s say a six-year-old child is banging two toys together. Instead of jumping to a conclusion, try: ‘Oh, I see Superman really wants to hit Batman today, what are they fighting about?’ You never know where those kinds of questions – which start with the experience of the young person, in their world, using their metaphors – can lead to. The way into it is just by allowing the person to talk in the way they want to talk.”Listen, understand, empathiseMaking sure we’re really listening, and understanding what a person is saying to us, might sound simple, but it’s all too easy to trivialise without even realising it. “The other really important thing is not to be overly reassuring, and not to dismiss things,” says Bush.“For instance, a 21-year-old comes home and says: ‘I’m having a horrific time at work. I feel bullied, I’m failing, I feel I need to just walk away, I’m really stressed.’ Someone might reply: ‘Yeah, we all feel like that’. This kind of response is so demeaning, so dismissive. It doesn’t recognise their pain and distress.“Listen, acknowledge and be understanding. The sheer amount of people who just wanted to hear ‘Wow, that sounds really difficult. I can’t believe you’re been going through that’ as a first response … They didn’t need platitudes or complexity. They just wanted to be understood.”Connections mean resilience“There’s a lot of evidence that shows that social connectedness, a feeling of belonging – particularly connecting with people who have had similar or shared life interests or experiences – is actually very protective,” says Bush. “So young people who feel like they belong, who feel they have a sense of community, and feel able to talk to others in some way, are more resilient in the face of adversity, difficulty or mental health problems.”Britain Get TalkingTo find out more about ITV’s Britain Get Talking campaign, run in collaboration with mental health charities Mind, YoungMinds and SAMH, visit itvbritaingettalking or stv.tvbritaingettalking"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d8d4b8041b8023029a8ba5770685589ad978869/0_80_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f0ab07636dc33fafd3bb735b86d9ebf","title":"us economy jobs report gm strike","story":"Labor department figures beat analysts’ expectations but show steep drops in manufacturing sector and slower hiring this yearUS employers added a solid 128,000 jobs in October, a figure that was held down by a now-settled strike against General Motors that caused several thousand workers to be temporarily counted as unemployed.The GM strike contributed to the loss of 41,600 auto factory jobs in October.

This appears to back up the Fed’s comments on Wednesday night about the economy being in decent shape and its shift in policy stance. This is more good news for equites and the dollar, but we may see bond yields higher.Richard Flynn, UK managing director at Charles Schwab, a bank and stock brokerage firm based in San Francisco, says:Today’s numbers beat expectations, but the job market has cooled significantly since last month, as slowing global growth and trade war concerns continue to fester. Despite the FOMC’s decision to cut rates a third time this year earlier in the week, US economic activity has failed to pick up meaningfully, which has aided the argument that rate cuts are unlikely to be the elixir for what ails the broader economy.Separately, larger structural issues – such as falling inflation expectations, an ageing population, and muted productivity—have somewhat diminished the effects of monetary policy.Without a comprehensive and definitive trade deal with China, we will continue to see bouts of market volatility that could undermine market confidence, impact hiring, and put pressure on capital spending intentions.Here is some instant reaction to the data.James Ingram, investment manager at stockbroker MB Capital, says:With the labour market somewhat beyond full employment, past tight labour markets have shown payroll growth tending to reaccelerate in October (for example in 2007 and 1999). Accordingly, we believe some firms likely pulled forward hiring into October. This may be holiday related. This is somewhat stronger than our estimates and suggests the underlying economy remains resilient to trade disputes and the pace of job growth remains good. A huge beat on non-farm payrolls and a figure Trump can continue to boast about with his eye on his next term. The US jobs figures have boosted European stocks further.So US employers hired more people than expected last month, despite a strike at General Motors, and hiring in the previous two months was also stronger than expected. September’s rise in jobs was revised up to 180,000.The October figure includes a strike-driven 41,600 decline in car industry jobs and 20,00 temporary census workers leaving their jobs. About 46,000 workers went on strike at GM factories in Michigan and Kentucky until last Friday, and striking workers who do not receive a pay cheque are counted as unemployed. US stock index futures jumped after the data, pointing to a good open on Wall Street this afternoon.News flash: US non-farm payrolls rose 128,000 in October, much stronger than the 89,000 forecast by economists. This means the US economy added more workers than expected.European stock markets are still trading higher ahead of the US jobs numbers, out at 12:30 GMT.Sterling has held its nerve, despite Nigel Farage’s threat that his Brexit party would fight the ruling Conservatives for every seat if Boris Johnson does not abandon his Brexit deal.Farage dismissed reports that his party would pull hundreds of candidates to avoid damaging the Tories as “idle speculation”.As flagged up earlier, today is Alison Rose’s first day as the boss of Royal Bank of Scotland.

But if Brexit is delayed again beyond 31st January, and the economy remains weak as we expect, then we still think that the Bank of England will cut rates – perhaps by 25 basis points in May 2020.More on Mike Ashley - who has called Jeremy Corbyn “a liar” and “clueless” in an interview with the Financial Times.Ashley’s spending was revealed in the annual accounts for Mash Holdings, through which the billionaire owns his businesses.You can read the full story here:And Goals Soccer Centres, the five-aside-pitch operator, has been bought by Scottish firm Soccerworld backed by private equity, saving 750 jobs, our retail correspondent Sarah Butler reports.Goals, which is part-owned by retail tycoon Mike Ashley, also admitted that it may have overstated its profits by as much as £40m as it collapsed into administration and was immediately bought out by Northwind 5s, a new company backed by Soccerworld and Inflexion Private Equity.Goals’ shares were de-listed from the London stock exchange in September after it uncovered a tax accounting scandal stretching back at least a decade.Lookers predicted profit would fall by more than two-thirds this year and announced the closure of 15 branches.

You may have noticed. The early phase of any campaign is the contest about what the election will actually be about – where the battle lines will lie. If you’re gunning for the Conservatives or Liberal Democrats you probably want it to be all about Brexit if you’re backing Labour, probably anything but. Either way, we know with certainty that underlying the tactical battles of this election will be a crucial issue: age.In the same way that class dominated many elections of the 20th century, age has increasingly come to dominate in the 21st. A voter’s age wasn’t a decisive factor in which party they opted for in the 1970s, but it has become increasingly important as a predictor in recent decades. In 2017, a 30-year-old was twice as likely to back Labour as a 70-year-old. The latter, in turn, was more than twice as likely to vote Conservative. Come polling day, our age will do a lot of work in explaining who we vote for.It is a much bigger deal than this week’s overdone row about whether the 12 December election risks students – who disproportionately vote for Labour or the Lib Dems – heading for the hills as term ends rather than doing their democratic duty. In truth, it won’t make much difference given that Christmas doesn’t come quite that early to most universities.Meanwhile, our perception of what a “younger voter” actually is probably needs readjusting – in 2017, the tipping-point age at which you become more likely to vote Conservative than Labour was 47.Understanding the nature of the age ide in voting helps parties to clarify their priorities. There’s a reason the Conservatives prioritise pensioner benefits while cutting them for young low- and middle-income families. And for Labour, the 3 million parents bringing up children in the private rented sector – living with the worry that they could be asked to move out at a few months’ notice – are a big priority and outnumber the 2.3 million students.Age isions are not just superseding class in terms of their electoral significance they are taking on more of a class feel to them by way of economic isions. Today’s thirtysomethings, for example, are living with the biggest continuing hit to their wages from the financial crisis, in part because of the sheer bad luck of when they entered the labour market.This isn’t just about demography though. Geography is crucial too. Inidual places – which are what matters in a constituency-based, first-past-the-post system – have very different age profiles, and are ageing very differently as the country as a whole gets older. Across the UK, more than 60 local authority areas have a higher average age than Japan, the country with the highest average age overall – 46 – in the world. In contrast, other parts of Britain are demographically closer to young Latin America, with 23 local authority areas having a younger average age than Chile. The average Oxford resident is, at 29, barely half the age of someone in North Norfolk, the oldest place in Britain with an average age of 54.More importantly, Britain is growing apart as it ages. Rural areas such as Maldon, Eden and Richmondshire have aged twice as fast as the rest of the UK since 2001, while at the other extreme some cities have actually managed to get younger in the last two decades. Nottingham has lost three years, while all of Newcastle, Coventry and Bristol are defying the ageing process.Older areas are ageing quickly because there aren’t a lot of babies being born in places without many women of childbearing age, while younger places are seeing migration from within the country and from abroad holding down their average ages. And yes, universities are bringing in students to keep many cities younger.Combine this demographic ergence with the growing role of age in determining which party we vote for and you begin to see the shifting electoral battlegrounds over which the election will be fought. Old and young seats are becoming the new safe seats for the Conservatives and Labour respectively, just as old and young voters are becoming their core supporters. The middle aged, not the middle class, are the new swing voters. So, age is going to be central to this election – and many more to come. That’s what really matters, not whether a few universities happen to have wrapped term up before polling day.• Torsten Bell is director of the Resolution Foundation"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96d3de68a5392bae101d1ab78f621331cb73e574/0_120_3047_1829/master/3047.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=46e1fa3f25aa59fb6b65089eb0de8676","title":"polls election brexit inequality","story":"A hard Brexit and entrenched inequality – or a nation where we can feed our kids and save the planet? It’s up to usElection night, 2017, at Harrow leisure centre was a tense affair. I had been in the borough for more than a month covering the battle for Harrow West – a Labour-held marginal that was 19th on the Tories’ target list. Labour won it in 1997 with a slim majority and had clung on to it ever since.The tension however, related to next-door Harrow East, a Tory constituency. It went to recounts, sending the Tory candidate pacing nervously in every direction. He had considered his seat safe the Labour MP for Harrow West believed his was at risk. Yet Labour won Harrow West by 13,314 votes, increasing its majority fivefold, while in Harrow East the Tory majority was reduced to just 1,757. I had been in the area to write about a seat that Labour might lose. It hadn’t occurred to me they might gain one.I wasn’t alone in this error. Labour had ploughed nearly all its resources into Harrow West. Its activists from both constituencies were grateful for the new votes but had no idea where they had come from.Today, Harrow East is the 36th target seat for Labour (Jeremy Corbyn was there earlier this week) Harrow West is 149th for the Tories, effectively off the radar but not necessarily out of the danger zone completely. After all, they are the same places they were two and a half years ago: the provenance of many of those votes remains a mystery and they could yet switch again. And much, politically, has happened since 2017 that could make them change their minds.We don’t know what the story of this forthcoming election will be. We may not know until it is over. The campaigns have only just started. People haven’t voted yet. Electability is, ultimately, decided not by opinion-forming elites but by the voters.Elections are not political thrillers. They are, or should be, about something real. Their significance should go beyond who wins, to what might change. Those two things are connected, of course, but not inextricably so. One of the reasons poor people are among the least likely to vote is because they often end up remaining poor, regardless of who wins. That doesn’t mean it doesn’t matter who wins – they could always get poorer. But nobody ever put that on a bumper sticker.Far more significant is what will change. There is more to politics than elections. The electoral conversation draws its energy from polls, gaffes, ads and swings. But none of that is particularly relevant unless it impacts people’s livelihoods, potential, challenges and life chances.It is easy to get stuck in the electoral. This particular moment is finely balanced. The situation is incredibly volatile the context unprecedented. Those who claim to know how things will turn out are simply revealing how little they actually know. Because the outcomes of elections are always of national significance, we tend to always treat them as national events – when sometimes they more closely resemble a range of electoral microclimates, each with its own ecosystem. This feels like one of those times.The truth is we don’t know who is going to win. But we do have a clear idea of why it matters. This election is about something: indeed in a sense it’s about everything. It offers as stark a choice in terms of the direction of the country, both at home and abroad, as most can remember.Unfortunately, on the issue that brought us to this point, Brexit, there may not be any clear resolution. The country has narrowly voted to do something it does not want to pay the price for doing, and which its polity has been unable to bring itself to do. The best many of us can hope for is to put whatever deal is done to a referendum and vote again. But whatever the result, that won’t resolve it. The country is horribly ided. We have voted ourselves into a mess and we’ll have to vote ourselves out of it.Pretty much every party in England and Wales has policies to deal with these issues that I can live with apart from one – the Conservatives. It’s not hard to see why they want to make this election about Brexit: they have nothing else. Their message is clear if nonsensical. “Get Brexit done” is no more a policy than “Brexit means Brexit” was a strategy. But beyond that, the best they can offer is to soften some of the worst of austerity while doubling down on the worst of everything else – from stop and search to shredding regulations.One scenario, among many, this time around is that the Conservatives lose votes, win a majority and get to pursue their agenda anyhow. That could be the story of the election: that a country with a majority opposed to the politics of poverty, greed, deregulation and austerity, a hard Brexit and entrenched inequality could not or would not unite, strategically, to prevent them. Fortunately there are a myriad of other possible stories, where we help feed our children and save the planet. We still have time to write them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f21634da5584847a093912fb1f5c2b515cb4ac81/0_198_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc3f6aadd7e1aa9e10c25f2573f78654","title":"rugby league conservatives sport elites","story":"Will the decisive battles of the 2019 general election be fought on the playing fields of the north of England? Maybe so, now that the Conservative thinktank Onward has identified so-called Workington Man and his “strong rugby league traditions” as a key target for Boris Johnson’s election campaign.The idea that “rugby league traditions” have anything in common with the Old Etonians in charge of Britain is laughable. Rugby league was actually born out of a radical revolt against the stranglehold of the privately educated over rugby. When huge numbers of industrial workers in the north of England took up rugby in the 1880s, the privately educated leaders of the Rugby Football Union tried to restrict access to the game by making it an amateur sport. “Why should we hand it over without a struggle to the hordes of working men players who would quickly engulf all others?” asked rugby and cricket international Frank Mitchell in 1897.But men working in mines, docks and factories had to take unpaid leave from work to play rugby. Amateurism meant they could not be compensated for the wages lost playing the game, so the northern rugby clubs proposed that players be given “broken time” payments.Rugby’s leaders refused. Threatened with expulsion, the top northern clubs broke away in 1895 to form the Northern Union, which would become known as rugby league.In response, RFU banned for life anyone connected with rugby league. Players were ostracised for even talking to rugby league officials. In no other sport was Britain’s class ide so starkly illustrated.Rugby league became a sport outside the establishment, with its own traditions of equality and democracy. Eddie Waring, the legendary commentator, hailed the sport as “the most democratic in the world”. Trade union leaders such as the miners’ Joe Gormley and TUC general secretary John Monks were regulars on the terraces of Wigan and Swinton.Rugby league also has a history of racial integration unique in British sport. In 1935 George Bennett became the first black international rugby league player, over 40 years before the first black English football international. In 1972 Clive Sullivan became the first black Briton to captain a national side, and led Great Britain to a world cup triumph.The sense that the game reflected wider social isions was highlighted during the 1984-85 miners’ strike, which was fought out in many towns and villages in the north where rugby league was the dominant sport. Rugby league clubs became organising centres for feeding and supporting striking miners and their families. When Rupert Murdoch’s BSkyB tried to force clubs to merge after it bought the game’s TV rights in 1995, many of those who had been on the picket lines in 1984 once again turned out to protest. “They’ve taken our jobs, now they want to take away our leisure,” was how one demonstrator expressed their anger.The attitudes that gave birth to rugby league remain strong. Hostility to the establishment and suspicion of the ruling elite, whether in Westminster or in business, has not diminished. Indeed, the strong Brexit vote in rugby league-playing regions can be seen as a protest vote against a two-party parliamentary system that has continually let down the “post-industrial” north.Unlike Essex Man or Worcester Woman, Workington Man (Johnson’s consultants appear to be ignorant of the fact that women are also rugby league fans and players) has none of the advantages of living in the economic bubble of the south of England. While dissatisfaction with Labour also runs deep, it is unlikely that traditional rugby league areas in the north of England will fall to the Tories.Although the Brexit party has picked up votes in these areas, Nigel Farage’s Dulwich College accent and golf club-bore demeanour is too great a barrier for him to make any significant breakthrough in areas where stubborn resistance to self-appointed authority is deeply ingrained.As one contemporary writer remarked about the 1895 split, northern rugby and its communities had rejected the “thraldom of the southern gentry”. There’s no reason to suspect that things will change in 2019. As Onward’s misunderstanding of rugby league traditions demonstrates, Britain remains two nations separated by huge class and cultural isions. And few things illustrate that chasm better than rugby.• Tony Collins is emeritus professor of history at De Montfort University."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/537360dd67c892ac6e341c5118478511fa26951b/0_314_2259_1355/master/2259.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d3766352307f64ddadeb4e89ed23d79e","title":"smartphones children technology mobile phones","story":"When you raise the question of not giving kids phones at all, parents balk. ‘How can we do that?’ they ask. But what alternative is there?I’ve traveled the country over the last few years talking to parents and teachers about kids and social media. I’ve heard stories about everything from non-consensually shared nudes in their schools to smartphone addiction – kids can’t seem to put their phones down, which teachers say is disrupting class time and causing innumerable fights and misunderstandings. Everybody wants to know: “What do we do?” They’re all for limiting screen time – though it’s hard, they say their kids act like addicts when you try to take away their drugs – but when you raise the question of not giving kids phones at all, they balk. “How can we do that?” parents ask. “Our kids will have no social life. They won’t be able to function in the modern world.”Leaving this received wisdom aside for the moment, let’s look at all the other things kids won’t be able to do if they don’t have a phone. They won’t be able to be part of a group chat, the site of hours of distracting discussions which arguably would be better had in person, where face-to-face interaction would elevate the quality of the conversation and deepen social bonds. They won’t be able to send or receive nudes, which has increasingly become their first introduction to the world of sex. The exchange of nudes at a young age (I’ve reported it happening as young as the sixth grade) is thankfully no longer being normalized as just a “new kind of flirting” any more, now that it has become clear that it often takes place in an atmosphere of pressure or coercion – not to mention the real danger of nudes turning into revenge porn, the source of ruined lives.Explicit content doesn’t have to be porn. It’s readily available on YouTube and across all social media platforms. A kid with a phone will inevitably see something his or her parents would be appalled to know he or she has seen. “Consumer groups caution that despite promises to police inappropriate content, YouTube continues to show violent imagery, drug references, racist language and sexually suggestive content that reaches children,” reported the Washington Post. The Common Sense Media survey reported that twice as many kids are watching mostly YouTube videos every day as they did four years ago, and the average time spent watching videos has about doubled, to an hour each day. And yes, often these are just videos of their favorite pop stars or clips from their favorite TV shows but sometimes they are videos of the most horrible things imaginable.This type of exposure is not without its emotional effects nor is the constant pressure that comes with a phone to broadcast one’s life – one’s inauthentically perfect, happy, glorious life. This pressure is particularly toxic for girls, who in study after study in recent years are seen to be struggling with rising rates of anxiety and depression and even suicide connected to the use of phones and social media.But sure, go ahead and buy your 11-year-old a phone.What could possibly go wrong?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/062e92e089021be3bd20bb1b7ad4a7c0c5e06f97/0_181_4096_2458/master/4096.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ac7c8a363bf8954a86eb237668488ea","title":"twitter mps social media political speech","story":"For over three years, parliament has been going around in circles, progressing to nowhere, consumed by debate about how to respond to the 2016 referendum decision to leave the European Union. Despite a majority of current MPs voting in support of invoking article 50 and standing for election in 2017 on manifesto commitments to leave, a majority of them have been unwilling to allow Brexit to be delivered.This impasse has led to deep frustration in parliament and in wider society, creating isions within communities and families as well as among politicians. Brexit has poisoned civil debate. It’s a boil that needs to be lanced, which is why I’ve supported the prime minister’s decision to hold a general election, even though I’d like to have seen Brexit delivered first.However, I do think that the degree of poison and unpleasantness, and the threat to our political stability, is at risk of being exaggerated. The danger to iniduals and to civil society was much greater during the miners’ strike and the three-day week in 1974.There is no real threat to civil order in the current Brexit debate. Yes, the local police have called in to my office after concerns were raised about my safety. And along with many other MPs, I’ve had security measures installed in my constituency offices and at my home. But the reality is that it’s tiddlywinks compared with the abuse I received in 1997 when I stood as a Conservative candidate. I vividly remember being chased up a garden path by a political opponent with a pitchfork – and being attacked by a dog that destroyed a pair of my best campaign trousers. And I had to take evasive action to avoid being run down by an angry adversary in his Land Rover. Politics has always been a highly charged and occasionally brutal business. Today’s abuse is nothing new.The main reason that poison is increasingly seeping into our political discourse is the exponential growth of social media. In some ways it can be beneficial for public engagement – but the damage it causes outweighs the good. Anonymous comment posted by keyboard warriors, often with a total disregard for the truth, creates a cesspit of vileness – which is why I gave up on Twitter years ago. I haven’t missed it a bit.Twitter is also the deathbed of humour, because posts are often met with synthetic outrage when the intent of the writer was actually entirely benign. That’s why so much of what appears on Twitter is mind-numbingly boring. I used it for a while but stopped about two years ago in favour of Facebook, where debate is (mostly) constructive. Of course, people should be free to share their thoughts wherever they wish – but if you don’t enjoy it, just stop doing it.The plethora of protest movements that have grown over recent years have been organised largely on social media – and give the impression that the level of civil disorder has increased. There has indeed been more “noise”, but the level of threat and unpleasantness in our country is nothing like as bad as is being portrayed in the insatiable hunger to fill news space. Yet my advice to anyone who has had enough of the cacophony is to get off Twitter.

Why had they been buried? And why were so many of them broken?After a decade of conservation and analysis, archaeologists have finally revealed their conclusions about these tantalising questions and others, with the publication of the first major academic research into what became known as the Staffordshire hoard.What they have concluded, according to Chris Fern, the lead academic on the project, reaffirms the hoard’s significance as “without a doubt one of the greatest finds of British archaeology” and casts new light on one of the most turbulent periods of early English history.The archaeologists have even tentatively identified the Mercian king they believe may have once owned the booty, and can draw a tantalising link to the dynasty of the rival Anglo-Saxon ruler who was buried at Sutton Hoo, Britain’s most famous site of the period.Dating from the period AD600-AD650, when the kingdoms of Anglo-Saxon England were battling for prominence, the Staffordshire find is in essence a “war hoard”, says Fern, consisting of spectacular items the experts believe were captured in battle by armies from the kingdom of Mercia, at the expense of neighbouring Northumbria and East Anglia.The royal treasury was probably buried in haste at a time of turmoil, but for reasons that can only be guessed at, it was never reclaimed.It includes items that are unique, such as a large processional cross that offers convincing evidence, say the experts, that Christian items were being carried into battle in this period as talismans.A curious gold and garnet item, also without parallel and referred to for years as “the mystery object”, is now believed to have been a jewelled ornament that sat on top of a bishop’s headpiece. Both were deliberately bent and desecrated before being buried.Rather than being limited to the ruler, gold weapons “must have been relatively commonplace for the warrior class beneath the king”, he says. “The poetry of Beowulf talks about huge gold treasure hoards and dragon hoards, but we always thought that was poetic license.“What this hoard really shows us for the first time is a golden age in this period of Anglo-Saxon England – and I mean that literally. This was a period when gold was suddenly much more available, and was converted into beautiful objects for the warrior elite.”Much of the past decade has been spent making sense of thousands of tiny gold fragments – about 4,600 – which Fern describes as “a case of multiple jigsaw puzzles being tipped together, mixed up and some of the parts being removed”. Some years into the project, the experts realised they had pieces of a rare gold helmet, two replicas of which are housed in museums in Birmingham and Stoke-on-Trent, which jointly own the hoard.But what of the hoard’s original owner? Certainly, there are clues. The treasure was buried in Mercia, what was to become the royal heartland of that kingdom, at a time when it was notching up significant martial victories over its neighbours.All of which may point in the direction of King Penda, who ruled Mercia for three decades until his death in AD655. Among the rivals he defeated and killed were the East Anglian kings Sigeberht and Anna, who were the stepson and nephew respectively of Raedwald, the East Anglian monarch who is believed to be buried at Sutton Hoo.“There’s nothing in the hoard that is stamped Penda Rex, sadly, so we can’t say for certain that it is Penda’s hoard,” says Fern, but it is “very plausible”, he adds with academic understatement, that the collection includes booty Penda seized from Raedwald’s immediate successors.For all the academics’ conclusions and occasionally “bold interpretations”, he stresses, the answers to many of the hoard’s questions will never be conclusively proven – “just as it is impossible with any great archaeological mystery to come up with an answer, unless you have a time machine. But that is part of the wonder of the hoard.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fdd1173c1da4ef7f960b2d40e58b0e9531ba8a60/0_0_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87b40ffc546e1cce8cbadfbde056584f","title":"are you a teacher who has left the uk to work abroad","story":"If you’re a primary or secondary school teacher who has left a school in England to teach in another country, we would like to hear from you Schools in England are struggling to recruit and retain sufficient teachers.

Think of that 1975 Helmut Newton shot of an Yves Saint Laurent Le Smoking in a backlit Paris street. The woman is wearing a tuxedo and tailored trousers with a buttoned-up white shirt, and she’s as sexy as any of his nudes, to my mind. If I walk into a cocktail party and among all the women in dresses there’s one in trousers, she’s the one I want to meet.Tricky, though, I find. I love trousers-for-evening in theory, but in reality (on me) not so much. But do you know what? I think I’ve finally realised where I’ve been going wrong. Here’s the thing: the concept of trousers as eveningwear suggests the trousers should be in some way fancy, but trousers that look nice on real women tend to be quite the opposite. A gold leather paperbag-waist pair look great on Gigi Hadid. Ditto high-waisted latex leggings. Ditto jewel-coloured palazzo pants. Which is great, fine, good for her. But when I try on any that are elaborate – even a bright colour, or an embellished waistband – I look in the mirror and, it’s not necessarily that I hate how it looks, just that I feel a bit self-conscious, and suddenly a dress seems as if it might be the answer after all.The trousers that look nice on most of us are simple trousers. You know that already. What are your favourite trousers? Maybe an old pair of jeans. Maybe a hardworking black pair you have on constant standby. Maybe a great pair of tracksuit trousers. Who would name a gold leather pair as their desert-island trousers? Nobody, that’s who. Except maybe Gigi. So it makes sense that your trousers-for-evening should be simple, too.The ones I’m wearing here are an old favourite pair from Whistles I haven’t worn them in the evening because I think of them as work trousers. But, look! Add a camisole and a pair of heels, and this is a passably dressed-up outfit – in a pair of trousers I really like and therefore feel relaxed and happy in.Admittedly, this combination lacks the drama and verve of Le Smoking. But evening trousersuits just don’t work on me. I feel as if I’m wearing an unfamiliar uniform, for a job in which I haven’t passed the probationary period. Trousers for evening can be tricky territory. But you won’t go wrong if you keep it simple.

In France, it made her a sex-symbol to rival Bardot, and her stunning beauty and style achieve something almost extraterrestrial here. She plays Barbarella, an intrepid space adventurer who is entrusted with a vital intergalactic mission by the president of Earth, which involves nursing a blind angel on a distant planet by having sex with him. Fonda carries it off with dedication and style.This satire is, in some ways, a companion piece to her 1967 comedy Barefoot in the Park. It’s a critique of the American dream, which mockingly distorts the picture-book perfection of family life portrayed in the well-known Dick and Jane children’s books, which taught generations of Americans how to read while also perhaps schooling them in conformist attitudes. Dick and Jane are played by George Segal and Fonda, a well-off couple in a lovely home who turn to crime when he becomes unemployed. The film manages to be a spin on Bonnie and Clyde while also playing on Fonda’s own radical image. She has a bizarre broad-comedy scene in which she falls over while doing some amateur fashion modelling in a hotel dining room, causing mayhem.This extraordinary cameo, hardly more than a few minutes of screen time, is destined to become one of Fonda’s most cult performances. She plays Brenda Morel, a renowned, difficult, ageing movie actor. (There’s a PhD to be written on how older female stars only get his kind of self-parodic role in films.) She furiously berates a director (Harvey Keitel) who is trying to cast her in his new film, and, in an extraordinary scene on an aeroplane, we see her succumb to a full-scale temper tantrum that involves her screaming: “You fucking bitches!” and hitting a flight attendant before having a catastrophic hairpiece malfunction.Neil Simon adapted his Broadway hit for this movie, which was a key moment in Fonda’s early success during the run of frothy metropolitan comedies that made her name. It’s easy to forget how excellent she was – and is – playing comedy, with a droll lilt to her line readings she puts the free-spirited zing into this movie, which was clearly conscious of being a bit squaresville for its day. She is Corie, a newlywed (that very dated notion) married to super-handsome but conventional Paul (played by Robert Redford, one of the few Hollywood men who could match Fonda for beauty) and yearning for him to loosen up and go frolicking in the park barefoot (a signifier for further bareness?).Fonda became a star to take seriously in this shocking movie about the Great Depression directed by Sydney Pollack. It’s a grim metaphor for the exploitation and suffering of working people, and can be seen as a forerunner of our obsession with reality TV and social-media cruelty. The setting is a dance marathon in the 1930s, in which poverty-stricken people pair up to dance for days on end – stumbling around like miserable zombies in front of a jaded and sadistic audience – hoping to be the last couple standing for a big cash prize. Fonda plays Gloria, apparently the most cynical and ruthless contestant in the running, but dealing with an inner hurt.Neil Simon gave Fonda another great comic role in this bittersweet portmanteau movie, in which she plays a tough New York professional who flies into Los Angeles on a mission to confront her screenwriter ex-husband (Alan Alda) because their teenage daughter wants to live with him, not her. She has a great confrontation scene with Alda, simmering with contempt, hauteur and a strange unresolved attraction for her ex. The film is often noted for the fact that Fonda looks sensational in a bikini – this was the seed for her bestselling workout videos. She also looks great in glasses.This 50-minute film essay about a famous news photo of Fonda meeting Vietnamese communists in Hanoi in 1972 is directed by Jean-Luc Godard and Jean-Pierre Gorin. It was originally intended as an archly ironic postscript to Godard’s film Tout Va Bien, which also came out that year (and in which Fonda acted, but fell out with the director). Letter to Jane is simply a deconstructionist essayharangue, narrated by Godard and Gorin, critiquing the photo of Fonda, and also US leftism and Hollywood stardom.Fonda had that rare thing, a female co-star billing in this smart feminist workplace comedy, in which she plays Judy, who has to get a job in a huge corporate office after her husband runs off with another woman. Like her co-workers Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton, she is oppressed, harassed and exploited by her unspeakable male boss. This is an interesting role for Fonda, who is not cast as the overtly funny character nor the explicitly sexy one. Rather, she personifies a kind of benchmark normality. Yet there is something notably powerful and real in an opening scene in which she is yelled at because she doesn’t know how to work a particular piece of equipment a moment that crystallises her rage.This is one of Fonda’s most courageous and heartfelt performances, which won her a second Oscar. It is also tied up with her activities as anti-Vietnam war campaigner. She plays the wife of a US Marine Corps officer (Bruce Dern) who leaves for service in Vietnam. Left behind, she finds volunteer work in a veterans’ hospital and befriends a wheelchair user played by Jon Voight. They begin a relationship that culminates in a sex scene – notably forthright in its day – in which Fonda’s character experiences the first orgasm of her life. It’s a movie that was overshadowed by the more macho take offered by The Deer Hunter – but it’s a fine performance from Fonda.Here is the quintessential Fonda performance, in Alan J Pakula’s psychological thriller: she is smart, beautiful, tough and haunted – in a film that, like Francis Ford Coppola’s The Conversation, embodies a proto-Watergate fear of being spied upon. And Fonda provides a new spin on the classic “shady lady” figure that always shows up in noir movies. She is Bree Daniels, a would-be model and actor who is doing escort work to pay the bills. Donald Sutherland plays Klute, the private detective spying on her because a serial killer is on the loose, and she is in danger. Fonda’s character is cool and reserved, having apparently mastered a kind of emotional numbness as part of the play-acting involved in her work, and part of her genuine alienation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5e13fa9c8f416eec59f279155383a45bfc87b1b/0_0_3500_2333/master/3500.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=882b5dd055eca6c3690c57ec133e8a58 700w","title":"nicklas bendtner book extract arsenal academy henry","story":"At the Arsenal academy it is like I have come to a different world. I have to get used to no longer being the best in my age group. Here, suddenly, there is a lot of competition.The worst bit is Tuesdays and Thursdays when we have lessons. It is like being back at school. We have all sorts of different subjects, such as press management and financial management. I thought I was done with studying and if it is possible I hate it even more than back at Amager.He has heard a story about how I was hiding underneath a table. That’s not true and I tell him that with a clear conscience: “Honestly Mr Brady, I haven’t been hiding underneath a table. This is one big misunderstanding.”That is not the only clash. Underneath Brady we have David Court. After a few months it is clear that I have got under his skin. Court can’t stand me. He can’t hide his contempt. One day I turn up wearing a baseball cap. He rips it off me and throws it on the floor and starts stamping on it with both feet simultaneously. It is like something out of a cartoon and against my own will I start to snigger. Then he shouts and jumps a bit more.When he is done I collect my cap and walk on to the dressing room. He is surely trying to put me in my place. I have to realise that I am a little shit, a big fat zero, as long as I am still at the academy and not with the first team that is his message.It’s November 2004 and the problems are mounting. I have shot up length-wise in the past few years. I am no longer one of the smallest. Rather the contrary, I have gone past 1m 90cm and I am still growing. My back is protesting as it can’t keep up. It is something to do with the nerves at the bottom of my back.One day I am called into Liam Brady’s office. I don’t expect anything to be wrong because Arsène Wenger has praised me several times when I have been training with the first team. I am wrong, though.“Look, son,” he says. “I don’t think you understand what is at stake here, and how many boys would give their right arm to have the chance you have now. I think simply that you are not ready.”I get a long speech. That I was a big fish in a small pond in Denmark. That I look at football as something I am automatically best at. That I shouldn’t be thinking about cars, expensive watches and model girlfriends. That is something you get when you deserve it and that the only way there is hard work.He is staring right at me as he talks to me. His gaze doesn’t deviate an inch. I try to stare back, to show that I am strong, but I can also feel that my eyes are welling up. My mouth opens and I can hear my own voice. I am agreeing with him. Even though I am doing more than OK I am a long way from being outstanding.“I know full well that you saw another player in Denmark but don’t drop me. It will come,” I say. Brady looks at me with a calm but penetrating gaze. “I am not sure, Nicklas. And it is not good enough to have doubt. Not at this level. You are going back to Copenhagen,” he says. “No I am not,” I say and start to cry. It is the first time I have cried in front of someone else than my parents. And suddenly I realise how much I want this. That Arsenal is my dream and that I am about to shatter the only plan I have ever made for myself. “I promise you that my attitude will change. You are going to see the real Nicklas Bendtner, I promise that,” I say.That is what he wants to hear and we agree on a compromise. I am going home to Otto Liebes Allé to rest my back and have a proper think to see if I am ready to sacrifice what is needed.In May 2005 I am able to sum up my first year in an Arsenal shirt. Since Brady threatened to cancel my contract I have made big strides forward. I have scored 12 goals in 18 games for the under-18s and five goals for the reserves. Increasingly I am training with the first team every week and sometimes I forget that I am just on trial with the big boys. During one session we are playing 11 v 11 with a maximum of two touches at a time. I am standing in a position to see Thierry Henry touching it three times. “Three touches,” I shout. Wenger’s assistant, Pat Rice, shouts back: “Play on, for fuck’s sake!”But Henry has heard me. He turns in my direction and puts his finger over his lips: “Sssssssh.” Shortly afterwards I do the same. The ball touches my heel, and then my toe before I pass it on. It is one movement but the academy player gets a free-kick against him. Of course I do. I don’t think. I just start complaining, big time. I say it should be the same for everyone.Henry tells me to shut up, this time with a lot of swear words included. And in hindsight it is good advice. But I am not taking it on. I shout back that he is the one who should shut up. He runs in my direction, confronts me, yells into my face, says all kinds of things. He totally ignores the fact that the game is going on around us.Ashley Cole and Sol Campbell get involved: “Carry on, Nicklas, keep on running and shut your mouth.”And I do. I become unusually calm. That is what happens if one of the best forwards in the world stands there and shouts at you.But that is not the end of it. After training Henry comes after me. We start talking, first in the dressing room and then in the players’ lounge. I didn’t know that he had that many words in him but he does. It is a two‑hour soliloquy about everything that is needed to get to where one wants to get. For me it is an honour. It is nice of him and not something he had to do. I soak everything up and it ends with us hugging each other.I think that’s that and that it has been dealt with. But it is not. The next month I don’t train with the first team. Not a single time. Half a year later, when I am back with the first team, I nearly start something similar again. This time it is me against Gilberto Silva. The Brazilian shouts that I should pull my finger out. He is arguably the world’s nicest man but I forget that in the heat of the moment. Instinctively I think that he should taste the same medicine, that he should shut up, but thankfully I manage to stop myself. I can still hear it: “Shut the fu … Yes-yes, Gilberto!”When it comes to choosing my agent I am more and more leaning towards a guy with Indian heritage. Ashley Cole has good things to say about him but that is not the decisive factor in the end. It just feels right to work with someone who doesn’t constantly preach common sense and long-term career planning. I hear enough about that at the academy.David Manasseh stands for something different. He is very matey even if there must be 20 years between us. Always keen on a good time. I need people like that in my life, in London as well. Even if I have some friends in the reserves – Fabrice Muamba and Johan Djourou – it can’t really compare to my time at the Danish club KB. People are not as warm here. They only think about the things that could get in the way of their dream. Not about living the dream. That is my big aim, even if that is some way away at the moment.Manasseh has expensive habits and it is a great change of environment when he picks me up in his big Bentley and drives us to one of London’s best restaurants. He knows about all the places that I hear about in the first-team changing room where I, against all rules, sneak in after training.The more I listen to them the more tempted I get. My first chat with Manasseh is at the most expensive hotel in St Albans. He says a lot of the right things. Things that I obviously want to hear when I am fighting to break through.“You have everything you need,” he says. “No one in England has your potential.” I like the guy and his big arm movements. When we sign our contract he invites me to Nobu to celebrate. Nobu is the latest fad. Japanese cuisine meets French and at the end of the evening it turns into a bar and night club. “This is the place to be,” as Manasseh puts it.I don’t know if that is my agent’s responsibility. But if it is my best that he wants then it is not particularly clever to introduce me to places such as Nobu. Because a few years later, when I have money, that’s where I go all the time.With one reserve game to go I have scored 16 goals to Arturo Lupoli’s 17. Even if I have supplied a lot of assists, many of them proper gifts to Lupoli, that is not ideal. Manasseh agrees: “You should end the season as top scorer, Nicklas. That will make everything easier.”So I go into the last game of the season with a promise to myself: I will try to finish anything that moves myself. We are playing West Ham away. They are at the bottom end of the table and we are third. In the first half I go against my own promise and give an assist to Seb Larsson. However, I get my own chances and score two goals to overhaul Lupoli at the top of the goalscoring charts.I have just turned 18 and I am the top scorer for Arsenal’s reserves. That looks good on paper.Nicklas Bendtner’s book is published by Politikens Forlag and is out in Danish on 5 November.

We need less fixtures, less competitions, more recovery. But I have been in meetings and it’s always the same. We just talk about it. I had to prioritise Ilkay Gündogan for the last game – no Kevin de Bruyne, no David Silva. Other clubs do the same.”Unai Emery says his club captain will not play a part.Mauricio Pochettino is not a happy bunny. The Tottenham manager says he is “not happy” with Argentina calling up of Giovani Lo Celso, who has only just returned to the Spurs fold after picking up a muscle injury on international duty in September. Meanwhile, Jan Vertonghen is a doubt for Sunday’s game at Everton with a hamstring injury. Érik Lamela remains injured after missing the 2-1 defeat at Liverpool, while Danny Rose will miss out through suspension.Hodgson says Andros Townsend is unlikely to be fit for Sunday after sustaining a muscle strain against Arsenal. “Leicester are coming in off the back of two good results – last weekend and the Carabao Cup,” Hodgson said. “We hope they don’t play like they did against Southampton.” You can say that again Roy ...Roy Hodgson is in talks over extending his Crystal Palace stay, with a contract that will take him beyond his 73rd birthday. Hodgson, who turned 72 in August, is out of contract next summer but the club are keen to hand him a new deal following Palace’s good start to the season. Palace, who host high-flying Leicester on Sunday, are sixth after the opening 10 Premier League matches. “I heard today that Donald Trump who is a bit older than me is planning to stay on as President of the USA for another five years,” Hodgson said. “It’s an important job, but not quite as important as being the leader of the free world.”Manchester United are offering free flights to fans for their Europa League game at Khazakstan’s Astana in late November, following Thomas Cook’s insolvency. A spokesperson said: “We have been working through a range of contingency plans to minimise the impact of the Thomas Cook situation for our supporters. We are pleased to be able to confirm that Manchester United will be operating a complimentary trip to the forthcoming match against FC Astana in Kazakhstan for those who were impacted by the insolvency of Thomas Cook.”Klopp has told the game’s bigwigs to think “about the players and maybe not their wallet” when it comes to fixture congestion. The German said he does not want to be drawn over whether clubs simply play too many games ... and then ends up flowing into a mild-mannered and passionate rant of sorts: The discussion is obvious, that it is too much. Everyone involved in the game knows. Nobody wants to touch it, nobody really discusses about it. Then Uefa decides to make the Nations League, give the successful players a couple of more intense games. People then say you need a bigger squad. The game is not made for bigger squads. At the moment there is a imbalance between the number of players in the squad, the competitions you play and a big gap between the breaks the boys need. They have two weeks off a year, in a physically demanding game. The solutions, I think there are a few possible, but the leagues have to sit and really discuss and think about the players and maybe not their wallet. We discuss it always on the back of the money we earn. Somebody has to think about how many games.”Trent Alexander-Arnold is set to make his 100th Liverpool appearance against Aston Villa on Saturday and Klopp has been effusive in his praise of the England defender, who turned 21 last month. Klopp says it’s a pleasure to work with him: He’s so young and already so experienced. It’s a wonderful story for different reasons. I know that in Liverpool everyone was desperate to have a ‘scouse’ hero making his way into the first team. When he made his first appearance he said ‘great, but it’s not about having one game, it’s about having 100’. Now we can talk about that, and there was not a lot of bad games in that 100. I wish for him to stay healthy and fit, and then the future’s bright for him and for us. He’s a great role model. He’s relaxed about that but feels responsible as well.”Right, let’s get a load of Jürgen Klopp. The Liverpool boss says Naby Keïta is a doubt to face Aston Villa, while the defender Joël Matip is still a few weeks away from returning to action. On the subject of fixture congestion in December, Klopp says the club is yet to find a solution and could send select different squads for the Carabao Cup and Club World Cup games, if need be:Where did it all go wrong for Nathan Jones? We haven’t got all day, but here are a few pointers to get the ball rolling. After 14 games, only Barnsley’s inferior goal difference prevented the most expensively assembled squad in the Championship – at more than £143m – from sitting bottom of the pile. There are more than £50m-worth of players out on loan, including the club’s £18.3m record signing, Giannelli Imbula, and Kevin Wimmer, for whom they paid £18m, indicators of where this malaise began. There will be a slew of press conferences to get stuck into shortly but first: confirmation that Stoke have indeed sacked Nathan Jones. Stoke say they will make a new managerial appointment “as swiftly as possible” but, until then, Rory Delap, Kevin Russell and Andy Quy will take caretaker charge. “I would like to thank John and Peter Coates, firstly for the opportunity to manage this football club and then for the continued support and patience throughout my time here,” Jones said in a statement. “I would also like to thank the supporters for their fantastic support. Finally, I wish the club the very best for the future.”Jürgen Klopp will be chewing the fat shortly. The Liverpool manager will likely be waxing lyrical about the several youngsters that shone, and kept their cool, in the penalty shootout victory over Arsenal on Wednesday. It was a memorable occasion for Curtis Jones, Neco Williams and Harvey Elliott and Sepp van den Berg, while the 20-year-old goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher was arguably the hero on the night. Rhian Brewster was also involved. Whether any youngsters feature at Villa Park on Saturday remains to be seen – it feels unlikely – but all enhanced their reputations.What more could you want?How high can Leicester go this season? The sense seems to be that it will again be a two-horse race for the title, with Liverpool out in front, closely followed by Manchester City but Brendan Rodgers’s side, and indeed Chelsea, are not so far behind. As Dean Smith said before Aston Villa were swept aside last weekend, City are not infallible and Liverpool, too, are not flawless. When Rodgers was asked about odds on his side winning the league shortening to around 501 following their 9-0 demolition of Southampton, he smiled and said: “We just want to finish as high as possible and I’d never put any limits on that.” Leicester travel to Crystal Palace on Sunday in search of a fourth straight win.Jürgen Klopp, Mauricio Pochettino and Unai Emery will be chatting a little later but, until then, a quick glance at the Championship. Bottom club Barnsley host Bristol City at Oakwell in Friday only’s game, before a bumper Saturday, with Derby taking on Middlesbrough and Leeds entertaining QPR. Then second-placed Preston travel to Charlton on Sunday. Amazingly, Preston’s entire starting XI last time out cost a grand total of ... £1.6m:How about these for grand plans? Crystal Palace are determined to tap into the hotbed of south London talent by building a £20m academy centre. In today’s Rumour Mill, Palace are credited with an interest in Liverpool’s Rhian Brewster but, down the line, maybe they will develop their own striking prodigy:Solskjær has heralded the October international break as a key factor in easing Manchester United back to form. The Norwegian says it was a much-needed breather before earning a draw against Premier League pacesetters Liverpool and picking up wins at Partizan Belgrade, Norwich and Chelsea.Solskjær says Marcus Rashford, Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelöf are indeed injury doubts. The Manchester United manager said the trio are touch-and-go to face Bournemouth. Steve Bruce has been bigging up Newcastle’s chances of rocketing up the Premier League. His side take on West Ham at the London Stadium on Saturday having won one of their past eight matches. As for team news, Andy Carroll could feature against his former club, while Fabian Schär and Matt Ritchie will miss out. Schär, Bruce says, could return against Bournemouth next weekend. Man United are seventh and they’ve won three games. Two or three points separate a vast amount of teams. If you put back-to-back wins together, you shoot up the table, and that has to be our aim. We’re quietly confident we can go to West Ham and get a result. I think we all feel as though we’re not far off. We’ve had a couple of magic moments by beating Spurs and Man United. The consistency looks to have arrived defensively. The front three are still settling in. We’re aware of it, we have to improve, but I think we’ll get there. The players enjoy coming in – there’s a good spirit among the group and around the training ground.”Ole Gunnar Solskjær will be previewing Manchester United’s trip to Bournemouth shortly, with the manager likely to give an update on the fitness of Victor Lindelöf, Marcus Rashford and Harry Maguire, who all picked up niggles at Stamford Bridge in midweek. Paul Pogba is sidelined until December but, by next summer, United get their hands on a new prized possession:Whet the appetite for the weekend:After some riveting cup action, back into the thick of it. First thing’s first, and as scarcely believable as it may seem, Manchester United could win a fourth successive game on Saturday, if they pick up three points at not so sunny Bournemouth. Then there’s Granit Xhaka v The Emirates part II, as Arsenal host Wolves and the small fry of Liverpool going to Villa Park. Plus, there is a 6-1 shellacking to look forward to, with Southampton determined to avoid another pasting at Manchester City. We’ll be hearing from managers and hoovering up nuggets from across the Premier League and beyond."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e378dea099cb9f4cab54be73c5272f9a783474e/0_1026_8000_4801/master/8000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ced69fca09cc072b5fe61d5ccc846c4","title":"people of tamba senegal migration photo essay","story":"People of Tamba is a project by the Italian artist Giovanni Hänninen, consisting of 200 portraits taken across the Tambacounda region in Senegal and accompanied by SenegalSicily, a series of documentaries created with the film-maker Alberto Amoretti, courtesy of the Josef and Anni Albers Foundation and Le KorsaPeople of Tamba, inspired by German photographer August Sander’s seminal work, People of the 20th Century, was conceived as a catalogue of the society of Tambacounda, the largest city in the most remote and rural region of Senegal, and the point of departure for the majority of Senegalese migration.The series portrays various professionals – from doctors and bankers to teachers and farmers – in their work environments to highlight their roles and contribution to society.This dignified series of portraits aims to counter negative and number-based reporting about migration in western media by bringing iniduals and their personal stories to the fore.M.me Ngom is one of two teachers at the elementary school in Sinthian, where about 120 children attend, and due to shortage of teachers she teaches two classes together at the same time.When Giovanni met her, Adama was picking cotton in a small family field together with her husband, her sister and two nephews. Le Korsa funded the installation of bore-wells outfitted with solar-powered pumps in each village, which provides year-round access to water and helps growing through the harsh dry season.Also featured as part of this project are architectural and landscape images of street installations of the portraits exhibited in key migration destinations in Africa and Europe, including Dakar, Marrakech, Berlin and Milan.In each location, large-scale photographs were printed and displayed across the city, where people could appreciate the pictures and see themselves reflected in their own society.The photographic project is accompanied by SenegalSicily, which is a series of short documentaries created with the Italian film-maker Alberto Amoretti. Both projects aim to explore different aspects of clandestine migration.The first documentary of the series is a dialogue between a mother, Aisadou, speaking from her village in the east part of Senegal, and her son Alpha in Sicily, who has left home to find a better future. Aisadou lives in Sinthian, a village in Tambacounda. This is where the Josef and Anni Albers Foundation built Thread, a community centre and artists’ residence.Aisadou and her son AlphaAlpha lives in Mazzarino, a small town in the centre of Sicily. Mother and son talk about their hopes and their regrets Aisadou talks of her worries as a mother and Alpha about the hardships he has faced.The documentaries each feature the experiences, dreams and reflections of migrants and their relatives who remained in Senegal. These include the monologues of Aisadou and Alpha, discussions with migrant residents of San Berillo in Catania and interviews with families of migrants who died at sea.“After screening in Sinthian, we met a man who had begun to save money to start the trip. Now we don’t know what happened to him, but what it is important is that after seeing the film, he reconsidered,” Hänninen says.The project wants to show to the young people of Tambacounda who are considering leaving a sincere account of the risks of the voyage and the reality of those who made it to Europe.Young Women of Le FoyerLe Foyer de Jeunes Filles in Tambacounda is a home for girls and young women who come to the city to attend secondary school. Coming from villages that only have primary schools, the girls find a safe place to live while they complete their education. If it was not for Le Foyer, they would have abandoned their studies and, most likely, remained in their villages and married underage. The girls at Le Foyer talk about their desire to get the training they need to help their country. They not only want to graduate, but also to become leaders of a new Senegal.Khadidiatou Nadya and Khady Camara, young women of Le FoyerKhadidiatou had to fight to get the permission from her father to finish her schooling to become a nurse. She helps the family with her small savings from her scholarship and her part-time job as tutor at the Foyer de Jeunes Filles. She is the only one in a family of 16 sons to be allowed to have access to secondary school. One of her brothers decided to leave illegally Senegal and reach Europe. At the time of the interview, he was kept in refugee camp in Sicily, waiting for papers.To help disseminate the message of the films, the Albers Foundation and Le Korsa have launched a series of film screenings and discussions throughout the Tambacounda region, specifically targeting remote and rural areas. The screenings unite families, teachers and local leaders in dialogue about the experiences of migrants, and how the financial resources devoted to migration may be better used to improve life locally.The Josef and Anni Albers Foundation and Le Korsa will display a selection of images and films from both projects at Also Known as Africa (AKAA) art and design fair held in Paris, 9-11 November 2019."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40a9120816467d5f52548bf06cd26c399bcfa57a/192_0_4334_2600/master/4334.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe3ade45ad09b1b18afce5403ec69f16","title":"bat faces landmark legal case over malawi families poverty wages","story":"Exclusive: Lawyers seeking compensation in UK for child labourers and their parentsHuman rights lawyers are preparing to bring a landmark case against British American Tobacco on behalf of hundreds of children and their families forced by poverty wages to work in conditions of gruelling hard labour in the fields of Malawi.Leigh Day’s lawyers are seeking compensation for more than 350 child labourers and their parents in the high court in London, arguing that the British company is guilty of “unjust enrichment”. Leigh Day says it anticipates the number of child labourer claimants to rise as high as 15,000. While BAT claims it has told farmers not to use their children as unpaid labour, the lawyers say the families cannot afford to work their fields otherwise, because they receive so little money for their crop.The case, potentially one of the biggest that human rights lawyers have ever brought, could transform the lives of children in poor countries who are forced to work to survive not only in tobacco but also in other industries such as the garment trade.It follows exposure of the scale and brutal reality of child labour in the tobacco fields by the  last year, which Martyn Day, a founding partner and head of the firm, said had provoked them to act. “If it hadn’t been for the , this case would not be happening,” he said.Day added: “It is totally depressing that one of the largest companies in the world, and certainly one of the largest British companies, is involved in an area where the employment of children is such a fundamental part of what happens. It has been going on for decades, and as a result of all of that the farmers of Malawi are caught in a groundhog day, where one generation after another is having to farm tobacco and is caught in a poverty trap.”Many of the families are from Phalombe, one of the poorest regions in the south of the country. They are recruited to tobacco farms in the north with the promise of food, accommodation and a lump sum in cash for their crop. Their accommodation is a straw hut they must build themselves the food is a monthly sack of maize, which is insufficient to feed the family and which is stopped before their tenancy ends. The lump sum they are paid at the end of the season dwindles often to less than half what is offered after deductions for tools and loans that the families have to take out to pay for essentials.According to the letter of claim, seen by the , last season most claimants earned no more than £100 to £200 for 10 months’ work for a family of five. Their lawyers say the work amounts to forced or bonded labour because they are misled when recruited, are afraid to leave and quickly get into debt. Children as young as three are involved in tobacco farming, the letter of claim says, often during harvest when the work can be especially hazardous. Children are particularly vulnerable to the effects of toxic pesticides, fertiliser and green tobacco sickness, from nicotine absorption while handling the leaves. Symptoms include breathing difficulties, cramps and vomiting.Some children go to school, as the law requires, but often only sporadically. Almost all work from sunrise in the fields before school and then when they get home, as well as through the weekend. At harvest time, classrooms empty.BAT is one of the most profitable companies in the world, making an operating profit last year of £9.3bn on sales of £24.5bn. Like other big tobacco companies, it has distanced itself from the farmers by commissioning a separate company to buy a stipulated amount of tobacco leaf each year. Alliance One signs contracts with land-owning farmers in Malawi, who then recruit tenant farmer families to work the fields.The lawyers, who have sent BAT the letter of claim and say they expect to issue proceedings this year, argue that responsibility for the conditions of the tenant families rests ultimately with BAT, which decides the price it will pay for tobacco leaf. In April, Leigh Day won a watershed case against Vedanta, a British mining company, which the high court held responsible for the actions of its subsidiary in polluting farmland in Zambia. That case opened the way to hold other British companies responsible for harm caused by the actions of those who work for them overseas.A report in 2011 estimated there were 1.3 million children under the age of 14 working in tobacco around the world. In 2017, an International Labour Organisation report said child labour in tobacco was on the increase and “rampant”. Day said: “If we are successful in Malawi, I would very much hope it would persuade BAT and the other tobacco companies that use very similar models to change those models and make sure people are properly compensated for the work and totally discourage children from working so they can go to school.” BAT said in a statement that it took the issue of child labour very seriously and “strongly agrees that children must never be exploited, exposed to danger or denied an education”.Simon Cleverly, the group head of corporate affairs, said BAT’s core policies “specifically state that we do not condone forced, bonded or involuntary labour and that we do not condone or employ child labour, and seek to ensure that the welfare, health and safety of children are paramount at all times”.He said BAT made it clear to contract farmers and suppliers that exploitative child labour and forced and bonded labour would not be tolerated.BAT leaf operations and contracted suppliers were required to participate in the industry-wide sustainable tobacco programme, he said, which was aligned with United Nations standards, including on child labour and income for farm workers.“As we have received a letter of claim relating to these allegations, it would be inappropriate for us to provide further comment at this time,” Cleverly said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18d3d9f5c5283ddeaec1aa4558da2e0f75663411/0_82_1733_1040/master/1733.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a1b8959612bab4a0790772aad1685fd","title":"conker contests and pumpkin picking autumn in the uk in pictures","story":"Keats called it the season of mists and mellow fruitfulness we call it an excellent excuse for a grand day out.

But I soon find out what I’m up against in this fiercely competitive sportThere aren’t many actual rock stars in the world of competitive stone skimming. But with his wiry frame, camouflage jacket and eyebrows thicker than a Gallagher brother’s, Dougie Isaacs is one. Isaacs can skim a stone 121.8 metres, further than anyone on the planet. Bottle of beer in one hand, cigarette in the other, he brings a frisson of danger to a sport that is beginning to take itself rather seriously. As one French skimmer says of Isaacs, “He doesn’t give a fuck.” To take part in a previous world record attempt, Isaacs missed his grandmother’s funeral. He has won the World Stone Skimming Championships eight times – six more than anyone else. But his last win was in 2016, and there is an influx of new skimmers on the scene who smell blood.Easdale island lies off the west coast of Scotland and has hosted the World Stone Skimming Championships since 1997, raising money for the local community. Each year, people from all over the world arrive on a 10-person ferry from the neighbouring island of Seil, to watch and take part. This year I’m one of them. My interest was piqued by an online clip of an exuberant Japanese skimmer called Keisuke Hashimoto – the winner in 2017. I take a bus from Oban to Seil, where I meet some of the event’s stars in the pub. Guy Tarring, a ruddy man in his 60s, who carries cigars and looks like Iggy Pop if he had gone into marketing instead of rock’n’roll, tells us that he has twice come second in the Old Tossers category (the event has only ever been won by Ron Long, a 75-year-old Welshman with a moustache like a paintbrush). Tarring once paid Isaacs to train him in Blairgowrie, Perthshire, where Isaacs practises on the River Ericht. He remembers one drunken night when Isaacs waded across the river and painted white lines on a wall to indicate how far his skims had travelled. Tarring says the key to a good skim is “power” and “thrust”, but then he points to his head. Ultimately, he says, “it’s about up here”.Later that day, I head to Easdale. It’s a haven of striking beauty, dotted with quarriers’ cottages. It was a bastion of the British slate industry until 1850, when a vast storm struck, flooding the quarries and devastating the island. The population dropped to four. Now, around 60 people live here. It’s the kind of place where everyone knows everyone else’s business in 2014 a baby was born on the island for the first time in 80 years.When the world championships descend, the population swells to around 1,000. “Most people come to an island like this for peace and quiet,” says Ruth Barratt, who is trying to sell the B\u0026ampB she runs. “Although we appreciate the income, it’s not something we enjoy.”Her partner, Dughall Macleod, tells me about one of the young pretenders to the stone throne – Alex Lewis, 22, who beat Isaacs in July to become the current English champion. He has also held the British championship title since 2017, and has won the Swiss and Welsh championships once each. The world championship, however, has remained elusive. “When he lost last year… oh Jesus,” Macleod says. “There was no consoling the guy.”As the sun sets, I walk down to the water for some practice. It’s frustrating to be bad at something that seems so simple. Yet each time I think I’m finished, another stone calls to me, demanding to be skimmed. I head to the pub again, where I meet Lewis. He has a tiny moustache and looks a little suspicious as I sidle up. One of the reasons he has never won here, he says, is because the rules don’t work in his favour. He can’t understand why the organisers stipulate that all stones be no more than three inches in diameter. “The organisers aren’t bothered about changing the rules because they make tons of money out of this regardless,” he says.The championships have become too successful, Lewis thinks, and should move. The island is so small that only a few hundred people can watch at a time. And when skimmers skim, they must keep the stone within a designated lane and only throw a maximum of 63 metres – the distance to the back wall at the end of the flooded quarry. At the British championship, Lewis skimmed 111 metres. “In order for stone skimming to get to the next level,” he says, “there needs to be a competition that is open-water, that can take huge numbers of attendants, that is bigger than this competition.”Lewis has investigated the science of the skim. He has done “variable tests” – throwing 50 stones of different weight and thickness drawing charts to compare movement. He throws at about five degrees to the horizontal. The first bounce should be around 10 metres from you, he says – or 18-20 metres in windier conditions. “You get a relatively flat stone that’s got a hook in it, that you can get your finger into, then when you release, you get spin,” he adds. “If you can get it so the stone lands flat on the water, you’ll do OK.”Of all the people I meet, Lewis is most alert to the money-making potential of skimming, a sport that offers no cash prizes. He recently wore a T-shirt to a skimming event that, by chance, had a photo of a chalet on it. The chalet owner got in touch to tell Lewis that if he continued to wear it, he could stay in the chalet for nothing. Lewis hates social media, but wants to be filmed by a drone and has his sights set on a photogenic place in Germany called Devil’s Bridge. As I leave, he hands me a business card. It says “Alex Lewis: international stone skimmer”.The morning of the championships arrives and I practise with some kids at the quarry. Worryingly, there is an eight-year-old here who looks more promising than me. A man turns up and launches some stones. This turns out to be Peter Szep, the defending champion. He says there’s nothing to do but try your best. “Most of the time it’s luck,” he says.I find “Old Tosser” Ron Long, who seems to be something of a media star. Long was a fireman who got caught by a collapsing roof in a hotel fire in 1992. “All of my upper-body muscles atrophied and so it was necessary to rebuild them,” he says. “Stone skimming came into it at that stage, as an upper-body activity that didn’t require too much head movement.”Long wants “full and complete recognition of stone skimming as a genuine, bona fide sport”. He believes the stones should be standardised, comparing the idea of picking your own stones to someone turning up to an Olympic javelin event with their own spear. He knows a manufacturer of decorative stone products who could do the job. “This was always a family day out before the professionals turned up,” says Dughall Macleod from the B\u0026ampB. “They take it too seriously. It’s like a bunch of Hells Angels turning up to a kindergarten.”In 2013, Lucy Wood, five-time women’s world champion, asked Max Farrand, a sports technology research technician at Loughborough University, to help her. He built a pond in the lab and they used motion-tracking technology to capture a 3D image of Wood in action. They also used force plates to examine her weight distribution and high-speed video to record her skims. “You don’t throw from your arm, you throw from your body,” Wood says, comparing skimming to a car braking with objects on the back seat. “The stone is part of your body.”The tournament begins at the quarry. A hush descends as Isaacs, a favourite here, steps up. When he hits the back wall with his first and third skim there is an almighty cheer from the 350-strong crowd. To qualify for the final, you need to strike the wall with one of your first three throws. Isaacs, Szep, Lewis, Long and seven other men do it, the highest number ever. Long’s skim is controversial though, according to Lewis, who claims it didn’t touch the wall. I came to the championships with lofty ambitions, but my first skim goes outside the designated boundary. When my next travels 43 metres, I think there’s a chance. Then my final skim goes out of bounds, too. I realise that to be a champion, you must skim as if no one is watching. I skim as though everyone is watching, and am punished accordingly.The final score is cumulative, the best possible being 189 metres (three back walls). Skim outside the boundaries even once at this level, and you have almost certainly bungled it. This is what Lewis does on his first throw, so his two subsequent back walls are academic. Isaacs, wearing a khaki jacket and a white T-shirt with the word “Bawbags” on it, hits the wall with his first throw, then skims 61 and 54 metres. Ultimately, however, Szep defends his title, clinching it with three back walls. Isaacs, joint second, will fight another day. The women’s champion is Christina Bowen Bravery, who won the English championships this year. Long, as ever, is crowned Old Tosser.“That was the toughest final,” Lewis says. With three back walls, Szep was indisputably the winner, but Lewis can’t help pointing out that he is the first person in the history of the tournament to hit five back walls. Yet still the world championship evades him.Given the differences between the Easdale event and the way other championships are run, one can understand Lewis’s frustration. But the popularity of the competition is surely linked inextricably to the island and its geography. Were they to move, they might no longer be the eccentric spectacle they are now. “It’s slightly spiritual up here,” says Tarring, looking around the island. “Great things are hard to find. This is a great thing.” 1 Find a flat stone of about 3½in. It’s best if it has a wee notch in it so you can dig your fingers in and get a spin on the stone when you release it. 2 Aim to throw it at 20 degrees to the horizontal. When you throw, try to land your stone flat on the water.3 You want the first bounce to be around 10 metres in front of you. Anything less, it won’t last the distance.4 Technique beats power every time. To get a great performance, it helps to be relaxed.5 Practise. There’s no life hack to making it as a champion stone skimmer. I skim about 100 stones a week, over two sessions. Any more and I would risk injury.• If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc5c9833432c54381ec7a1964f9b8a1bced33833/0_340_6612_3968/master/6612.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ccbd0c8fd7b51725533a17220dae1f4","title":"michael kiwanuka kiwanuka review one of the greatest albums of the decade","story":"(Polydor)The soulful singer’s third LP is timeless and contemporary at the same time, with shades of everything from What’s Going On to ScreamadelicaMichael Kiwanuka’s first two albums established him as a folksy symphonic soul man akin to Bill Withers and Terry Callier, and set the bar pretty high. This one knocks it skyward. Together with producer-to-the-stars Danger Mouse and London hip-hop producer Inflo, the British-Ugandan 32-year-old has broadened his territory to stretch from Donny Hathaway-style melancholy soul through to Rolling Stones-y gospel rock, psychedelic soul and breakbeat. There are strings and harps, samples of civil rights campaigners, Hendrix-type frazzled guitars and Burt Bacharach-type orchestrations. The dreamlike, revelatory quality is reminiscent of Marvin Gaye’s What’s Going On and Primal Scream’s Screamadelica.Unusually, in these streaming-led times, Kiwanuka is a contemplative song cycle intended to be listened to in one extended sitting, which he says is “a reaction against this fast-paced, throwaway, machine-led world”. It sounds timeless and contemporary the instrumental interludes and the stylistic and tempo shifts all hang together because of his warm, sincere vocals and fantastic songwriting. At the core is Kiwanuka’s inner battle between anxiety, self-doubt, spirituality and wisdom, which is then set against racism and rueful glances at the state of the world. Thus, killer opener You Ain’t the Problem is both an encouraging nudge to himself and a sharp put-down of attitudes towards immigration: “If you don’t belong, you’re not the problem.”Hero compares the murder of 60s activist Fred Hampton with recent US police shootings (“on the news again, I guess they killed another”), also referenced in the insistent Rolling (“No tears for the young, a bullet if you’re wrong”). Piano Joint (This Kind of Love) and Hard to Say Goodbye are beautifully pensive and Final Days ponders nuclear apocalypse. But for all its melancholy, Kiwanuka is never downbeat. There are moments – such as the “Time is the healer” gospel choir in I’ve Been Dazed, or hopeful closer Light – when positivity bursts through with such dazzling effect you want to cheer. Kiwanuka is a bold, expansive, heartfelt, sublime album. He’s snuck in at the final whistle, but surely this is among the decade’s best."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02b9df19479c3b6f148aacb3a97e6f5d8eb52d16/0_0_4500_3000/master/4500.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=574735a662de90585bce1cb670f43230 960w","title":"another hung parliament unable to solve brexit top banter john crace digested week","story":"Boris Johnson finally gets an election on the day he wanted – the worst possible one for meThere were several discordant undertones to Donald Trump’s reporting of the death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The most noticeable being the breathless, almost sexual excitement in his voice. As if the whole thing had been a snuff movie played out as a video game. But what also struck me was the US president’s description of the Islamic State leader having “died like a dog”. Because I can only assume he has no idea of the value people attach to their dogs. We got Herbert Hound eight years ago when our daughter left home to go to university – I don’t need a shrink to make the connection – and from the day he arrived I fell hopelessly in love with him. Now he’s a relatively old man, I am heartbroken at the thought he might die within the next five years. When he gets ill, he will be accorded all the medical care I would begrudge myself, and his death will be marked by a full state funeral. For essential reading on both the meaning of dogs and the meaning of life, I can recommend Anthony McGowan’s wonderful book How to Teach Philosophy to Your Dog, a series of conversations he had with his dog, Monty, while out walking together. The final chapter is a touching meditation on death and the existence – or not – of God, that takes in everything from Aristotle to Schopenhauer and leaves you suspecting dogs might already have had many of the answers all along. There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio  Than are dreamed of in your philosophy.After weeks of on-off, on-off speculation about when the general election might take place, parliament finally voted to have one in December. The tipping point had come when the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National party indicated they would be willing to vote in favour if they were allowed one last chance to vote against an election on Monday when the government had brought forward a bill under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act for a third time. After that, Labour was rather obliged to come onboard or else it would have appeared frightened of the electorate. Even then, there was some last-minute wrangling. The Tories wanted 12 December on the grounds that was the date they first thought of. Everyone else wanted 9 December because it was a date the government had not proposed. But 12 December got it, which is the worst possible day for me as it is the tail end of the week my daughter and her husband are coming over from the US for a pre-Christmas visit. So now I’ll hardly see them. Thanks everyone. With all the predictions for the 2017 election having been hopelessly inaccurate, everyone is being much more guarded this time round despite the Conservatives being well ahead in the polls. No one knows if Labour votes in the north will hold up, whether the Lib Dems will eat into the Tories or if the Brexit party will have any impact. It would be top banter if the election returned another hung parliament that was unable to resolve Brexit.The final prime minister’s questions of the parliament once again proved something that many of us had already suspected. That Boris Johnson isn’t actually very good at being a leader. He blusters, has no grasp of detail and lacks a fundamental seriousness when required. He is at best an after-dinner corporate speaker for businesses on a tight budget. Johnson may yet not prove to be the asset on the campaign trail the Tories hope. He did OK during the EU referendum because then he was only ever expected to make promises. The more lavish, the better. Now, as prime minister, he is expected to deliver on the promises he makes. And his track record on that is piss-poor, as so often he can only resort to lying. At this PMQs, he once again insisted it was the House of Commons that had blocked his Brexit bill. It hadn’t. It had passed it, but then he had sulked and pulled it. MPs have received a lot of criticism for being a “zombie parliament” but actually most have done their jobs with great integrity. The split in the Commons reflected the split in the country and many MPs have withstood acute pressure from their parties to hold the government to account. It is telling that most of the MPs who are standing down at this election – many of them women – are precisely the ones who have done their best not to let the government railroad them into poor decisions. They will be greatly missed. If you think this parliament has been toxic, the next one could be even more so as the new intake will more closely resemble the extremes of their parties.I can’t say I would be best pleased if I had been one of the guests who had booked flights and bribed their son to take care of the dog while they were away, but such considerations don’t appear to have entered Simon Cowell’s head when he chose to cancel his 60th birthday party at the last minute. Instead, he just sent out a quick note saying the whole thing was off and he might reschedule something for December and that if he did then they were welcome to drop in. Then again, December might be tricky, so it could be in the new year. Or never. Now it’s possible Simon is so riddled with insecurities that he cancelled because he couldn’t bear the thought half the people might find something better to do with their lives on the night – get their hair dyed, for instance – and he’d have loads of empty places round the table. If so, I know how he feels. Whenever I entertain at home – something I do increasingly rarely – I’m always tempted to get my cancellations in first. More likely, he’s so self-obsessed he’s unaware that other people really exist. So far, the only reason given for the cancellation is that he wants to concentrate on his work as the X Factor ratings nosee. As if he couldn’t spare four hours. My guess is that the real reason is he’s actually going through an existential narcissistic breakdown. He literally can’t bear the fact he’s 60. Something I experienced three years ago. Which is why I never even bothered to plan a party.I can only hope that if ever I found myself under investigation, the inquiry would be conducted by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. Right now, it appears to be even dopier than the Department for Transport was when Chris Grayling was in charge. Blaggers from around the world will be queuing up to fleece the DCMS for every grant going, even if they aren’t close friends of the prime minister. I’m quite tempted to put in an application myself, just so I can acquire the Lucie Rie and Jennifer Lee ceramics I covet. It seems all you have to do to get £100,000 off the department is to write down any old tosh and say you could do with some money. You just write “give us the cash” and a week later they give you the cash. It really is as easy as that. The minister in charge of the forensic investigation into how Jennifer “You’re the Mount Everest every man wants to climb” Arcuri secured the money for her no-hoper company was Nicky Morgan, who has just announced she is standing down at the next election. After what she’s just done for Boris, it can’t be long before she finds herself in the House of Lords."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bac8b173e5e40f6840d6b036d1044399599ea67e/660_434_1307_784/master/1307.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2daced8c6bc64d0631a5fbff40fe873b","title":"sophie morgan on researching her family tree we are finding a secret dark side","story":"TV presenter Morgan always had questions about her lineage.  Sue George helps her find out more than she imaginedWhen you start researching your family tree, you never know what you might find. Sophie Morgan – TV presenter and campaigner – knew very little about her family’s dark past.“We knew a few things about my mother’s side,” she says, “but nothing about my father’s.”As I delve into Morgan’s dad’s side of the family, using Ancestry, I’m soon introduced to someone whose life was punctuated with multiple marriages, domestic violence and even a proposed suicide pact.The life of John Andrew Towle (JAT senior), Morgan’s great-great-grandfather, not only highlights the absence of contraception in the 19th century and the infancy of modern medicine, but also the lack of women’s rights.JAT senior was born in Salford in 1826 and began his working life as a pawnbroker, like his father before him. JAT senior must have been energetic and ambitious, as he later became an engineer, while remaining a pawnbroker.He was married three times, the first two of which were to women who lived near him in the lively Broughton Road shopping district. His first marriage, to Catherine Dixon, took place in 1855.His second marriage, to Morgan’s two-times great-grandmother Mary Ann, took place in Paris in 1867. They went on to have six children together in the seven years they were married. Mary Ann died in 1874, around the same time their final – and her 10th – child, Octavia Ventnor Towle, was born.But it was his third marriage that was the most tumultuous. JAT senior married Jane Dunster Holliday in June 1875. But they soon went their separate ways. In her orce petition, dated August 1876, she states that he harmed her physically six weeks after their marriage, when he bruised her arm and tried to “pitch her out of the window”. Soon afterwards, he suggested that they take poison together. The litany of cruelty continued until January 1876. She finally left him after he violently pushed her and “hit her with severe blows, feeling the effects of it for some time”.At that time, orce was both unusual and expensive. The grounds for women to orce their husbands were fewer than those for men and their wives women had to prove cruelty, whereas for men, adultery on the part of their wife was sufficient.JAT senior didn’t marry again after the orce. He lived until 1914, dying aged 88.Many of his children, including Octavia, didn’t marry. Morgan’s great-grandfather, also called John Andrew Towle, finally married at the age of 49, and had his only child three years later.Unsurprisingly, Morgan was shocked to find out about her ancestor’s past. “We are uncovering a secret life, a dark side we didn’t know about, which is intriguing,” she says. “Clearly he was a very dodgy character. I wonder how the rest of the family will react? When you find out something you don’t like, how do you feel?”Meanwhile, Morgan’s mother’s side had their fair share of scandal too – from illegitimacy to fraudulent marriage certificates.Ancestry reveals that several branches of her mother’s line came from the Scottish Borders between Jedburgh and Berwick-upon-Tweed. Morgan’s great-grandmother, Ann Drummond Ferguson, lived and died in Scotland. Ann was born in August 1886 the word “illegitimate” was marked clearly on her birth certificate. However, when her mother, Agnes, married her father, John Ferguson, six months later, Ann’s birth certificate was amended to show her legitimacy.However, the illegitimacy wouldn’t have been the only thing raising eyebrows. Agnes was 30 when she gave birth to Ann, while John was just 18 – having been 17 when Ann was conceived. John clearly felt the strain of going against societal norms, as he lied about his age on the marriage certificate, listing himself as 21 when he was still 18, while Agnes, who by then was 31, said she was 30.They married in the manse (the minister’s house), rather than in church. This implies that they had a small wedding, which was quite normal because the couple were not well off.Their marriage endured, and they had another six children. However, a new family mystery emerges around Eliza Taylor Drummond – born illegitimate to Agnes two years before Ann, and not John’s child. Eliza was part of their household until 1901, but there is no trace of her after that.Finding out about her mother’s roots in Scotland made Morgan keen to visit the part of the country where her ancestors were based. “I love the idea that there’s this woman in the family who married a much younger man,” she says.The whole experience has made Morgan determined to keep searching for answers about her family’s past.“I’m so curious to take it further,” she says. “I want to go further back, and I’d like to find living relatives.”Discover your backstory by charting your family tree.

Of all the people in all the world you would not expect to see browsing clothing racks and looking for presents on a Friday afternoon it would be England’s head coach on the eve of the biggest game of his life.The middle-aged couple who persuaded him to pose for a selfie just around from the leisurewear section could scarcely believe their luck. Jones does not come across as a habitual high street browser – nor, after eight weeks of press conferences, could you blame him for not looking delighted to see the man from the  – but the caption wrote itself. England are so well prepared for the final their coach has already begun his Christmas shopping.The players seem particularly relaxed and calm, too. Barely had Jones left the shop than the internet was creaking afresh under the weight of training ground pictures of Jonny Wilkinson coaching the squad’s current captain, Owen Farrell, in the art of drop-goals. Again it was a snapshot that neatly reflected England’s state of mind. Sixteen years on from their last great golden era, sealed by Wilkinson’s immortal extra-time drop, they feel they have every base covered.This is not to say rugby’s great prize is automatically coming home to Twickenham for the first time since 2003. What is indisputable is that England have spent four years painstakingly working towards this moment. Last week against New Zealand they delivered their best performance in many years. If it all goes pear-shaped from here they can hardly blame their preparation, their management, their available budget or the weather, which has turned beautifully clear and sunny in the past couple of days.All of which explains why England, as a nation, have not looked forward this expectantly to a game of rugby in ages. In clubhouses, pubs and sitting-rooms across the land, they will be lying back and thinking of an England in which everything, in these days of political ision and intolerance, is gloriously rosy. The cricket World Cup has already been reeled in and here is a another high-profile global opportunity. If Jones’s boys come good even Ben Stokes’s compelling case to be Sports Personality of the Year may have to be reassessed.It would, of course, be pushing it to suggest the 2019 squad are anything like as well-known or feted as their 2003 predecessors were at this same juncture. The faces of Martin Johnson, Lawrence Dallaglio, Jason Robinson and Wilkinson had already been carved on Twickenham’s equivalent of Mount Rushmore before that Sydney final. Even now, if Jamie George and Elliot Daly popped out for a quick lunchtime coffee in Slough the staff member serving them would still be asking what names he or she should write on their takeaway cups.This says less about George or Daly, both starting Lions and excellent role models, as crowd-pleasing athletes and rather more about the public’s complex relationship with rugby union. There will always be those who want to read George Eliot instead and would never contemplate venturing to the Stoop or Sandy Park on an average Premiership weekend. Others still regard it as a pumped-up minority sport and will forever stick to watching Chelsea or Wolverhampton Wanderers. Rare are the days outside World Cups and Six Nations when the oval ball reaches a peak terrestrial audience or penetrates the consciousness of those who can just about recognise Wilkinson and, at a stretch, Will Carling.Nor has the Rugby Football Union always been brilliant at preaching to the unconverted, particularly since the national side crashed and burned in the pool stages of the home 2015 World Cup. What should have been the springboard to a whole new level of popularity was ultimately the biggest missed opportunity in the history of English team sport. Which is why the RFU owes a significant debt of gratitude to this current group of players, now on the verge of digging their currently cash-strapped union out of a sizeable hole by selling the game afresh to the next generation.Maro Itoje, Kyle Sinckler, Tom Curry, Sam Underhill … the fact the 21-year-old Curry is the only Englishman on the shortlist for World Rugby Player of the Year should not obscure the fact his country have an array of twinkling new stars emerging. When they last made the final in 2007, having already lost 36-0 to their opponents South Africa in their pool, no one expected much and the highest-profile fan to send a message in final week was the singer Kenny Rogers, whose song “The Gambler” had become an unlikely dressing-room favourite. This time even Prince Harry has been sending pictures of his son in an England babygro and there is far more belief, both inside and outside the camp.Much of it is based on the compelling evidence of the past couple of months. On their travels between Miyazaki, Sapporo, Kobe, Tokyo, Oita and Yokohama, Jones’s side have yet to be seriously challenged on the scoreboard. They have not just beaten all the southern hemisphere opposition put in front of them but have stuck 39 and 40 points respectively on Argentina and Australia and left the whole of New Zealand practically speechless.They have, moreover, defended with such physicality that opponents have often been unable to establish a consistent foothold in games. By the time the so-called “finishers” have appeared, the tone has already been set. Nothing – from typhoons and humidity to Brodie Retallick and Ardie Savea – has inconvenienced them for too long. Those drawing similarities between England and Saracens – serial winners in Europe and domestically in recent seasons – have been doing so with good reason.There is just one fly in the miso soup – and a substantial one at that. Virtually every World Cup final in the modern era, save for New Zealand’s spectacular dismissal of Australia four years ago – has been tight and tense. South Africa’s pack are every bit as physical as their opposite numbers and have a set-piece that has so far ground down all comers. To date the Boks have lost just one lineout in the whole tournament and have a pair of half-backs in Faf de Klerk and Handre Pollard capable of kicking any side where it hurts. Some of Pollard’s goal-kicking against Wales in the semi-final was as sweet as anything in this tournament, while the brilliant Cheslin Kolbe can make mugs of even the best defenders.While England stand within sight of becoming the first team to beat the Wallabies, the All Blacks and the Springboks at a single World Cup, it is also the case that no side has gone on to lift the trophy after beating New Zealand en route for 28 years. Listening to Pollard and his captain, Siya Kolisi, explaining how much it would mean to South Africa to replicate their triumphs of 1995 and 2007 from what was virtually a standing start two years ago was to suspect Farrell and co will have to withstand a serious barrage at some stage.These two sides just happen to be strong in several of the same areas and the Springbok bench, wryly nicknamed the “Bomb Squad”, is also as explosive as any. Kolisi, furthermore, will be winning his 50th cap, while his father has travelled out of Africa for the first time in his life to watch him play.On the face of it the game is unlikely to match the Kiwi pyrotechnics at Twickenham four years ago, with Pollard among those ruling out many “disco lights” when it comes to the Bok gameplan. The battle for gainline supremacy, however, will be a match for any dohyo, the ring in which Japan’s sumo wrestlers grapple. Slow down England’s ball consistently at the breakdown and the hungry Springboks will be in the hunt, particularly if they are a score ahead with half an hour left.If their opponents, on the other hand, display the same dynamism, precision and class which scuppered New Zealand, Wilkinson’s 11th-hour drop-goal tuition should not be required. Having originally tipped South Africa to win this tournament, it now feels as if an improving England should have just enough to reach the promised land. Do so and Jones will have supplied his adopted nation with the ultimate gift.

Yet for Jake Connor, who will make his first Lions appearance, there will be wider reasons to ensure everything goes to plan after a season he will be keen to forget thus far.“It was a nerve-wracking wait for the call-up given everything that’s happened this year,” admits the 25-year-old Connor, who will start in the centres this weekend in place of the injured Oliver Gildart. In Super League, his Hull side looked well-placed for a run at the play-offs midway through this year, before a remarkable end-of-season collapse saw them miss out. The nadir was an embarrassing defeat by Castleford, in which Connor exchanged words with some of his own teammates after being sin-binned for dissent.It left his own coach at Hull, Lee Radford, admitting he needs to calm his on-field temperament, and the player himself fearing he would miss out on a dream trip with Great Britain. “Personally I didn’t have a great season and given how things finished with Hull, I genuinely didn’t know what to expect,” he admits. “It was a nervous wait, but to get the call and try and finish this year on a high is something I’m relishing. It’s an honour to be involved and, after missing out last week, I’m keen to grab this chance with both hands.”While Connor has established a reputation in Super League for a player who can get under his opponents’ skin, it should not overshadow his mercurial talent. Capable of playing in several positions across the backline has been identified as a major strength in Connor’s game since he was a teenager at Huddersfield: but the player himself admits the utility role is something he is growing tired of.“It’s getting to the time where I need to work on one position,” he says. He will play centre this week, but the Great Britain coach, Wayne Bennett, believes he has the tools to play half-back at international level, making this a pivotal period in Connor’s fledgling career. “We’ll have to have a chat when I go back to Hull and see what the plan is there. I’m 25 now, and I need to playing regularly in one role for the good of my own game.”Yet despite such a mixed year – and constant speculation linking him with a move away from Hull – Connor will get the chance to end his season on a high: starting this weekend in the first of two Tests against the Kiwis, before a trip to Papua New Guinea. “The experience has been great and exactly what I needed,” he admits.“I know there’s a lot of history surrounding Great Britain. To play for England last year was great but this will be doubly special because you don’t know when Great Britain will come around again as a concept. I really want to make the most of it all, and try and help the guys win all three of the games we’ve got left.”The Lions were underwhelming, albeit against an impressive Tongan side, last weekend. With the squad’s senior players vocal about their target to win every game on tour, many are expecting a strong response from Bennett’s side on Saturday against a New Zealand side themselves well beaten by Australia last weekend.“It wasn’t great, that defeat, and the mood was a bit sour after but we’ve got over it very quickly,” Connor says. “You don’t come on tours like this expecting to walk into the side, but now the chance is here, it’s up to me. They’re a very strong side, the Kiwis, but we think we’ve got a pretty strong group ourselves here. Just to be still playing after how the season ended in Super League is great for me, though.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb94ceb4ed7d46326d558c30713a5dd540943dc3/749_136_3130_1878/master/3130.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=535efb7a61d45fb0a6275877faa9d4f6","title":"new zealand wales rugby world cup bronze final report all blacks hansen gatland","story":"• All Blacks surge to win in Steve Hansen’s final game• We are expanding our coverage of New Zealand.

Two tries in the opening 12 minutes from Joe Moody and Beauden Barrett rewarded timed passes and support play six days after their attack was buried under a white blanket.New Zealand’s three-quarter line was considerably more experienced than their formation in the semi-final and two of them, Ben Smith and Sonny Bill Williams, were making their final appearances in the black jersey. Smith, who scored two tries, is joining Pau while Williams, who provided a sumptuous assist, is considering offers.Wales, who had six of the side that started their grand slam match against Ireland last March, fought back to 14-10 with a try by Hallam Amos, who stepped inside Ben Smith after Rhys Patchell’s long pass, and a Patchell penalty, but the open nature of the game suited them less.Ben Smith scored two tries in eight minutes at the end of the first half. He drifted back against the flow of the defence in Wales’s 22 after Williams’s turnover, evading James Davies’s challenge and then used his pace after Aaron Smith’s long pass.When a typical Williams off-load freed his midfield partner Ryan Crotty two minutes after the restart, the outcome was settled. Ben Smith had his hat-trick ruled out because Rieko Ioane’s touch after Williams’s one-handed off-load was ruled to have gone forward.As the game lost what shape it had, Josh Adams scored his seventh try of the tournament, one short of the record, with 21 minutes to go, burrowing through a crowd of bodies. Williams had been replaced by then, along with the Wales captain, Alun Wyn Jones, a changing of the old guard."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5dd25aa7c53e73c4adb6e2a5a5fd5e1064ee22f/0_115_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39cd5db6011cc99e3f3015b3684a9977","title":"rugby world cup final watching win england south africa","story":"England and South Africa face off in Yokohama on Saturday.

Thanks as always for reading - and for getting in touch with your thoughts via email and Twitter. The dream sign-off for Gatland wasn’t to be - but as I wrote all the way back in August, before the Wales v Ireland warm-up match in Cardiff, he did not need a successful Rugby World Cup to ensure his legacy. A semi-final exit against South Africa certainly counts as a success, anyway, even if Wales can’t escape the feeling that they let a golden opportunity slip in those decisive dying minutes against the Boks.Congratulations to Steve Hansen, to Gatland, to Kieran Read and Alun Wyn Jones on being such wonderful servants to their teams and to the sport.Let’s hope the England v South Africa final proves a fitting end to the tournament. See you next time - bye for now.Here’s a piece by Paul Rees with Siya Kolisi, the first black captain of the Springboks, who will lead his team into the fray against England in tomorrow’s final:“Don’t you love this man?” says Sean Fitzpatrick, sitting next to the Welshman.“A changing of the old guard.”Read Paul Rees’ report of tonight’s match right here:If you missed it, ITV’s feature on Alun Wyn Jones from before the semi-final, made by Gabriel Clarke and team, is an absolute must-watch. Your challenge is to watch it and not get a lump in your throat when Jones looks back to his early days at Bonymaen RFC in Swansea:Alun Wyn Jones walks away from the World Cup. But not from Wales, of course. He is not finished yet.All Blacks winger Rieko Ioane has just swapped his boots in return for a Wales fan’s shirt. That’s not something you see every day. Will that lucky fan wear Ioane’s boots in the pub later? Well done to my occasional colleague Rhodri Williams for capturing this inside the stadium!All Blacks captain Kieran Read talks to Gabriel Clarke, who is interviewing people like a man possessed: “You’ve got to enjoy the moment. It’s a special time, something I’ll remember for a long time, having my family here to celebrate that last one. There’ll be plenty of time to reflect, and I guess we’ll have that feeling of not quite making what we wanted for a long time. But hey, it’s sport, and if the better team goes out there and wins, they win. I will look back fondly on my career, I’ve given it my all. There’s a few of us moving on ...it’s just a pleasure to put on this jersey and play for my country.”Paul Pritchard has been in touch on Twitter, looking ahead to tomorrow:“I’m an Englishman living in South Africa, married to a South African. So I can’t lose! But my money is on England. They destroyed NZ and if they play like that again ...”Josh Adams speaks to ITV’s Gabriel Clarke: “It was a funny one really. Credit to New Zealand, they played with a great tempo and speed and didn’t let us set in defence. A little bit poor on our part at times, some sloppy tackles, but we had a never-say-die attitude and played with a bit more ball in hand this week, and the boys enjoyed that too. We’ve got to look at the positives and start moving forward. The new era begins now, everyone is looking forward to that, but everyone has to pay respects to “Gats” for what he’s achieved for the team and what he’s done for us as a country for the past 12 years. I can’t thank him enough for giving me the opportunity two years ago.”You’ve got to wonder what might have happened if Wales had played with more ball in hand against South Africa in the semi-final. But is that too simplistic? Maybe South Africa just didn’t let them play. Certainly the counter-rucking of players like Du Toit is something that will worry England in the final when they look to put attacking phases together.Fitzpatrick on Hansen: “He’s a good man manager. Everyone’s saying - ‘What’s New Zealand doing, they must be so depressed, and calling for resignations and all this.’ No, they’re not, and why aren’t they? Because that man and this team have done everything they could to achieve their goal of winning the World Cup. And unfortunately they came up against a very good English side who beat them.”So, who is your money on for tomorrow’s final?Ben Ryan thinks England have the variation in their attacking game to get the better of the Boks:Hansen and his captain Read have a hug -And here is World Rugby’s interview with Gatland: Wales captain Alun Wyn Jones greets his children after his final outing at a Rugby World Cup:“We’ve played pretty good footy all tournament. But one bad day, you lose a game, and you miss out.” Steve Hansen speaks - and gets a rousing cheer from the stadium:Hansen collects his medal now, and waves to the crowd. Meanwhile the Welsh players take time to bow to each side of the stadium.Gatland speaks to ITV: “I was a bit disappointed at the end of the first half, to only be 21-10 down at half-time wouldn’t have been too bad, but for them to score a try right on half-time was disappointing. But look, the boys gave as much as they could. I thought for three or four players it was a game too far for them, you could see they were pretty tired...“But the guys who came off the bench gave us energy and we played a lot better second half. Defensively we were a little bit soft tonight. I think we can enjoy tonight and celebrate what we’ve achieved...I just want to say thank you to everyone back in Wales, and the support I’ve had, I’ve loved my time, and hopefully I’ll be welcome back at some stage.”It was an admirable showing by Wales, and although they didn’t win, they showed a lot of the qualities that Gatland has instilled in this team during his 12 years in charge. Josh Adams grabbed a seventh try of the tournament and he was outstanding throughout. Only Bryan Habana, Julian Savea and Jonah Lomu have scored more tries in a single tournament.Wales’s challenge is to keep improving in Gatland’s absence - he is off back to New Zealand to coach the Chiefs in Super Rugby.As for the All Blacks, they played some lovely stuff as you’d expect and signed off from Japan in style. Hansen and captain Read will be heartened to sign off with such a stylish win, even if their dream of a World Cup hat-trick was not to be.Gareth Thomas on Wales: “They were really brave. There were times they could have given up, but they dug in.”Sean Fitzpatrick on the All Blacks: “I take my hat off to them, they played very well tonight.”Meanwhile, there are huge cheers for Hansen and Gatland in the stadium.Here’s our on-the-whistle match report:It would have been great to see Nigel Owens get the final. He’s a top-class referee, needless to say, but he’s also endlessly entertaining.All over. The match ends with a counterattack by the All Blacks into the Welsh 22, and a desperate attempt to tackle Anton Lienert-Brown results in his shorts being pulled down. The referee Barnes intervenes and ends the contest with the final whistle. “Not Wales’s best performance but they played until the end,” says Shane Williams in the commentary box.Mo’unga snipes over from that five-metre scrum. A smart pass by Brad Weber on the short side finds his fly-half in space and Mo’unga darts over.Wales fan Suzie Wilde praises today’s display from referee Wayne Barnes:73 min: New Zealand put it through the hands as they move into the Wales half, including a couple of sumptuous off-loads by their captain Kieran Read. Then Mo’unga chips into space behind the Wales defence and Owen Lane is forced to touch down in-goal under pressure from the All Blacks fly-half. Now it’s a five-metre scrum for New Zealand as we approach the final five minutes.72 min: Now there is fine work in defence from Welsh winger Adams, as he tidies up a kick towards the corner and then smashes through a double tackle to relieve the pressure on his team. 71 min: Skills from Beauden Barrett:67 min: Now Wales attack - No 7 James Davies makes a strong burst on the left but he knocks on - however, Wayne Barnes takes it back for an earlier penalty. Wales kick for the corner as Gatland shares a joke up in the stands with his attack coach Stephen Jones. Wales don’t get the line-out quite right, at they try a training ground move, but keep possession through more phases with the All Blacks’ defence under considerable pressure. Jonathan Davies then tries a grubber kick, which doesn’t come off, and the All Blacks have the put-in at a defensive scrum.65 min: Front-foot ball for New Zealand now. They win a penalty for Hadleigh Parkes not rolling away, and kick for the corner. The All Blacks want to sign off from this tournament with a few more tries ...That amazing ovation for Alun Wyn Jones - he has two years left on his contract but surely he won’t be seen at the next World Cup?A top-class score with a pick-and-go by Adams from short range. That is his seventh try of the tournament - and no-one will catch him at the top of the try-scoring charts. Hats off to Wales for battling back into this one after some quicksilver rugby from New Zealand had them on the back foot in the third quarter. Adams has shown tonight that he is dangerous at close quarters with defenders as well as when he has space out on the wing. On a number of occasions he’s shown superb technique and strength to make headway in tight spaces where less powerful wingers would be driven back. Biggar converts.58 min: Now Wales come again. A blacks wall of defenders is lined up on their try line. Davies tries to dummy his way over ... then it’s a try for Josh Adams!55 min: Wales stream into the All Blacks 22! It’s their best attack of the second half so far, but an Elliot Dee pass goes astray. Now, Wales captain Alun Wyn Jones comes off to a gigantic ovation from the entire stadium. What a shift he has put in at this tournament. Miles Harrison, on commentary, says broadcasters in the media section are on their feet to applaud Jones too. Jake Ball comes on. Sonny Bill Williams and Ryan Crotty off for New Zealand, too, as Hansen makes five changes in one hit.52 min: Let’s hope this final half an hour sees Wales fight back and avoid a real thrashing at the hands of the All Blacks, who are increasingly warming to their task. Gatland and his players don’t deserve that. They just need to find a bit of continuity and perhaps the odd gap in New Zealand’s defence. Which is easier said than done, of course.50 min: A few photos from World Rugby’s Twitter? Go on then:47 min: Aaron Shingler, Gareth Davies and Dan Biggar are on for Wales now. Moriarty, Williams, Patchell are off.45 min: B. Barrett continues to look razor-sharp in possession. Now the All Blacks flood down the left wing, and Ben Smith is over for his hat-trick! Wayne Barnes wants the TMO to check first ... and it’s no try! Ioane patted an off load from Sonny Bill Williams to his left, which ended up in the hands of the onrushing Ben Smith. It’s ruled forward off Ioane’s hand. Those replays didn’t look conclusive to me - seems a touch harsh to rule it out and deny Smith a farewell treble.Graeme Simpson emails from the land of the long white cloud:“Watching live on Spark TV in NZ. There’s a one hour delay on free-to-air on TVONE, here.”43 min: Rhys Carre and Elliot Dee on for Wales.Mo’unga kicks for touch in the corner, the resulting Wales line-out is spoiled and New Zealand have their opponents under pressure early in the second half, spinning the ball out to the right. Taking two defenders out of the game, Sonny Bill Williams off-loads very nicely to Ryan Crotty who powers over the try line for his own farewell score. Smith the scrum-half was right in the thick of the action again and is making his team tick. Mo’unga converts.Can Wales fight back from 18 points down? Here we go with the final 40 minutes of both Hansen and Gatland’s reigns...Half-time reading for you.Paul Rees on how South Africa want a war of attrition in tomorrow’s final: Andy Bull on England, defying stereotypes on their march to the final: Jonny Wilkinson, who knows a thing or two about playing a World Cup final, dropped in on England training this week. Here is Gerard Meagher:And last but by no means least - Robert Kitson spoke to today’s referee Wayne Barnes back in August:See you in five minutes.We wanted flowing, running rugby and that’s certainly what we’ve had from both sides. Wales have seen a couple of errors punished in the usual style by New Zealand, but if they can get the first score after the break, there is no question they can get back in this. The All Blacks attack on the right, and a wonderful pass by scrum-half Aaron Smith finds his namesake Ben in space on the wing. He skips beyond Welsh No 9 Williams thanks to a textbook hand-off in the face, and also burns off Adams in the corner, before grounding his second try of the match. Hat-trick second half? Mo-unga knocks over the conversion in style and it’s half-time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4f47bf6d222f34cd54be4595f3ab9a7363330c2/0_25_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5beb3a1f9a538eef2f01b7121d50d661","title":"tennis wta finals karolina pliskova simona halep live","story":"Second set: Karolina Pliskova 6-0 1-2* Simona Halep: After opening the second set with an erratic service game, Pliskova reverts to type with another great hold. Along with more untouchable serving, she held with a fizzing down the line backhand winner.Second set: Karolina Pliskova 6-0 *0-2 Simona Halep: A very important hold from Halep to consolidate the break. She saved a break point by grinding Pliskova down in a long, attritional rally, but she was otherwise trying to impose herself well inside the baseline.Karolina Pliskova finished the first set with 11 winners to 3 unforced errors. Unplayable.Second set: Karolina Pliskova 6-0 0-1* Simona Halep: Halep’s coach Darren Cahill was out between sets. He told Halep to forget the first set and suggested putting more spin on the ball and getting it out of Pliskova’s strike zone.She was listening. Pliskova opens the set with a couple of errors off higher balls, then she inexplicably double faults on break point to drop serve easily. This is already a different match.First set: Karolina Pliskova 6-0 Simona Halep: Karolina Pliskova snaps a backhand down the line winner to break Halep for a third time and take the first set with a bagel. Just an incredible set of tennis from Pliskova, who is attacking brilliantly and moving to the net whenever she can. The bad news for Pliskova is that she now has to do it all over again.First set: Karolina Pliskova 5-0* Simona Halep: It’s clear that Pliskova’s form is stemming from how well she is serving so far. She holds with another easy service game, sealed with an ace down the T. Halep isn’t even playing badly. She just can’t live with this at the moment.First set: Karolina Pliskova *4-0 Simona Halep: More brilliant play from Pliskova as she moves up a double break. Early in the game, she crushed a backhand return then slipped into the net and she brought up break point with a whistling inside out forehand winner. She couldn’t convert the first break point, but a couple of minutes later she hooked a heavy forehand crosscourt and forced an error to take the break.First set: Karolina Pliskova 3-0* Simona Halep: That was a statement love hold from Pliskova to consolidate the break. Huge serving and there wasn’t much that Halep could do.First set: Karolina Pliskova *2-0 Simona Halep: Simona Halep did not play a bad service game, but she’s already down. Pliskova looks great so far. She is dominating the baseline exchanges, peppering her game with some variety and crushing Halep’s second serve. She breaks by eliciting a Halep error with some heavy forehands.First set: Karolina Pliskova 1-0* Simona Halep: Good start for Pliskova, who is serving well out of the blocks and already showing her variety. A great drop shot from the Czech early on, then she slammed down a trademark huge serve. She sealed the first game by moving to the net after a big forehand and picking off a nice volley.Simona Halep and Karolina Pliskova are now on-court. As noted earlier, not much has separated them in recent years and Halep won a particularly delightful three-set match in the Fed Cup at the beginning of the year. Let’s see what’s in store today.As for Svitolina, she has been the player of this event by far. She hasn’t dropped a single set and the big question is whether anyone in the world still has the energy, patience and weapons to hit through her defence on these slow courts.For a dead rubber including an alternate, that was a pretty entertaining match between Elina Svitolina and Sofia Kenin. Keep an eye out for 20 year-old Kenin, who has had a brilliant breakthrough year and finishes her breakthrough season ranked 13th with a huge win-loss record of 48-22 and three titles. Kenin is pretty under the radar for a young American who will have a good shot at reaching the top 10 next season.Elsewhere, Kyle Edmund has been announced as the fifth Davis Cup player for Great Britain. Here’s Leon Smith’s statement: “I’m delighted to name Kyle as the final nominated player to our GB Davis Cup team. Whilst Kyle has had a tough few months, he showed at the Paris Masters what level of tennis he is capable of producing. It’s been a difficult decision to make as Cam Norrie has had a very good year on tour and is finishing the year ranked around number 50 in the world. It’s a strong position for our team to be in when we have such high quality players vying for selection. The same is true for Joe Salisbury who is in great form and we wish him all the best for the ATP Tour finals. I’m excited about getting our team together and preparing for the finals in Madrid.”Hello! Welcome to the final day of the round robin group stages, where we have a decisive match between longtime rivals Simona Halep and Karolina Pliskova after Elina Svitolina clinched the Purple Group with a hard-fought 7-5 7-6(10) win over Sofia Kenin. Thanks to the injuries that have pillaged this event over the past three days, there hasn’t been much need to wipe the thick dust from our calculators in a desperate attempt to figure out the group scenarios. The scenario here is simple: win or die.The rivalry between Halep and Pliskova has always been good fun. Halep leads the series 7-3 and won the first three meetings without dropping a set, but Halep is 4-3 since those initial encounters. Their games contrast nicely, with Pliskova’s big serving and aggression off the ground meeting Halep’s great defence. However, Pliskova is much more patient than the average 6’2 big server and Halep has her weapons. There are always a pleasant variety of staccato points and longer, attritional rallies.The one thing they do have in common is that both players have expressed their displeasure at playing on such a slow court so late in the season. Neither could hit through Svitolina for extended periods during their earlier matches and, like seemingly everyone but Svitolina, they both seem to be feeling the physical and mental effects after another long year. With so much prize money and so many points on offer, we’ll see which player is prepared to bring their best tennis one final time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c19a81d9e08db4f27b64bd09ccc4867bc2898e6f/0_183_4151_2490/master/4151.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a926cfc2c16f3f7b51389e9b15414303","title":"chemistry review finborough theatre","story":"Finborough theatre, LondonDepression provides the tough backdrop for an intense affair in Jacob Marx Rice’s smart, flawed and compellingly acted playDepression is a subject the theatre is obliged to confront. The big question is how you dramatise it. In Reasons to Stay Alive, based on Matt Haig’s book, April De Angelis set up a dialogue between the hero’s two selves. In this new American play, Jacob Marx Rice shows what happens when a manic and a depressive fall for each other the result, while highly watchable, rarely shocked me into a new awareness.Rice presents us with two characters. Steph is a long-term depressive who, having dropped out of Brown University, works in a bar. Jamie is a high-flying Washington-based student of foreign affairs who experiences unipolar mania that leads him to obsessive overwork. The pair meet at a psychiatrist’s office, are instantly attracted to each other and start dating. But when Jamie tells Steph he is in love with her, she warns him “I’m a destructive person – it’s who I am” and that their relationship can only end in one way.The play, in Alex Howarth’s production, shows how a couple on different rhythms can bond physically and, at times, complement each other: when Steph senselessly breaks 200 glasses in her bar, Jamie’s management skills allow him to quickly repair the situation. Rice makes you like and care about the couple but never fully explores the treatment they are getting, and works on the assumption that depression is inherently incurable. It doesn’t help that much of the clinical information is gabbled into hand-held mics by the performers and is not easily comprehensible.When they are not rushing their fences, the two actors are very good. Caoimhe Farren shows how Steph slides from being a sharp, witty, self-aware figure, who announces she “grew up in a family of chemical imbalances”, into a woman who suffers from a paralysing inertia. James Mear captures equally well Jamie’s determination to conquer his mania and his guilt-ridden powerlessness in the face of his partner’s depression. But at heart the play is a love story more remarkable for its tender compassion than for what it reveals about mental illness.

Surely, the narrative goes, Harbath is a Trojan horse for the GOP, twisting and shaping Facebook’s policies in order to tilt the scales toward the Republican party in 2020.But the arguments that Harbath is making for Facebook and the arguments Facebook’s critics are making about Harbath both suffer from the same frustrating myopia: they view Facebook principally as an American company concerned with American politics. This narrow frame has distorted and degraded the debate over political speech on Facebook at a time when it is crucial to attempt to understand Facebook as a global phenomenon with globe-shaking power.Harbath’s op-ed repurposed a line from Zuckerberg’s Georgetown speech – a talking point that he’s already repeated many times in interviews, before Congress and to investors: “I don’t think it’s right for a private company to censor politicians or the news in a democracy.”I have yet to hear Zuckerberg or Harbath offer any commentary on how this policy will affect non-American members of Facebook’s so-called “community” – and that’s not for lack of trying. I’ve asked Facebook repeatedly whether it plans to have a different policy on speech by politicians or political advertisements in non-democratic countries over the past two weeks, to no avail.This isn’t just a gotcha question. It is a matter of urgent importance, and one that speaks to what to me is a much more telling aspect of Harbath’s professional history: her actual work for Facebook.A blockbuster December 2017 article in Bloomberg detailed Harbath’s extraordinary track record leading “a little-known Facebook global government and politics team that’s neutral in that it works with nearly anyone seeking or securing power”. According to the report, Harbath’s staff became “de facto campaign workers” for political campaigns in some of the world’s biggest democracies they assisted Narendra Modi in India, Rodrigo Duterte in the Phillipines, the far-right party Alternative for Germany (AfD) in Germany, and Andrzej Duda in Poland.Two years after the article’s publication, it’s impossible not to notice that democracy has been severely degraded under the regimes that the Facebook team helped achieve power.What do Zuckerberg’s bromides about democracy mean to Facebook users in Kashmir, where Modi has blocked the internet for 13 weeks and on Thursday dissolved the constitution? What do his paeans to the free press mean to Facebook users in the Philippines, where Duterte has used his office to attempt to silence an independent journalist working to expose extrajudicial killings and human rights violations? Will Facebook update its “Success Story” about playing a “central role” in the way Duda is “innovating communication between the government and the public” as fears grow that democracy in Poland is eroding under his party’s rule?The paradox here is that Facebook is more accountable to US lawmakers and reporters than it is to any other country’s. It is incumbent on American politicians and the American press to keep this in mind – and push Facebook to answer questions about how its policies will apply to the vast majority of its users.Dispatches from Silicon Valley is a weekly column of reporting and analysis from the epicenter of the tech industry.

The product is balık ekmek (“fish bread”) – fish (typically mackerel or a similar oily fish), onions, lettuce, a squeeze of lemon juice, all inside a white roll – its basic ingredients hinting at its origins, a way for fishermen to flog their excess catch after rich hauls.And while the boats have dwindled over the years – with city authorities keen to clamp down on this mostly unregulated, sometimes unhygienic trade – it’s a tradition that has been carried on by three boats moored just off Galata Bridge, which s the Golden Horn. More gaudy, golden, floating kitchens than fisherman’s skiffs, they have been operating under a municipality tender since 2007 the garsons in faux-Ottoman blazers and captain’s hats serving hundreds of Turks and tourists every day.But no more. As İstanbullus found out this week, all three boats – together forming the Balık Ekmek Turızm Kooperatifi – see their lease expire on 1 November. The owners have vowed to stay open, and a dispute first with the police, and then in the courts, may ensue. But the municipality seemingly has no plans to replace them, with designs for a “more holistic” approach to Istanbul’s historic centre. As the mayor explained to journalists, “No-one owns a permanent property in any part of Istanbul.”As a woman tells a TV camera how much she opposes the decision, the surrounding crowd burst into applause. It seems in part a confected controversy – stirred up by a media eager to show the new mayor as out of touch – and more than one resident rolled their eyes at the mere mention of the boats. Others pointed to online gossip about the darker side of it all, about the alleged connections the owners must have to have secured such a lucrative spot. But there is genuine sadness here too.Ibrahim, a retiree with jet-black dyed hair and a military jacket, tells me with some sense of fury that he comes to the boats maybe every other day. With a lunch costing just 15 Turkish lira (£2), it is, he reasons, simply the cheapest meal around. Indeed, while Istanbul’s other central districts can be prohibitively expensive – particularly for those from the city’s fringes – Eminönü has retained some popular appeal. The famous lyrics of an 1980s Turkish song even long for the days of taking a minibus around town, and “köprüde balık-ekmek yemek” – eating balık ekmek on the bridge.Which taps into something deeper too, for few places can be as ever-willing to embrace nostalgia – and the bitter-sweetness of loss – as Istanbul. Karin, who has now moved far away to the Black Sea coast, told me she lived here for years and did not go to the balık ekmek boats even once. Now, somehow, it’s the thing she misses most, the first place she visits when she returns. “There is no Eminönü without this,” she says.It is an open secret that the balık ekmek fish no longer comes from the Bosphorous strait. The Golden Horn – the point where the strait meets the Sea of Marmara and so-called for the abundance of dolphin and fish that once passed through it – no longer teems with life. It now comes from Scandinavia, via Istanbul’s wholesale fish market.It is but one small change in a city that has transformed beyond all recognition since its fishermen started selling sandwiches on the side two centuries ago. But no matter the boats’ tenuous connection to the past, for some İstanbullus, it was enough: this is the tradition now, in all its kitsch glory. As Ibrahim shouted to me, and all passers-by, ‘This is history!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99e77a4acc3ed502356fdfbfa1f212919f4f50d6/0_0_3444_2067/master/3444.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b8a61462e1730f05ac1d47567e7a1af","title":"amsterdam citizens given chance to own a piece of its golden age","story":"Architectural treasure trove up for grabs in attempt to ‘breathe new life’ into old AmsterdamAmsterdammers are being given the chance to own a piece of their city dating from as early as the 17th century.Urban renewal programmes before the second world war and in the 1960s left behind huge amounts of unwanted debris, from gables ripped from the city’s famous canal houses to monuments, ornaments and columns complete with Roman numerals.But with the knowledge that one person’s rubbish is another’s treasure, the stonework was stored in the intervening decades by the municipality in 200 huge pallets in a depot in a secret location.The city’s department of monuments and archeology has decided to take advantage of the treasure trove of architectural debris in an attempt to give Amsterdam’s golden age a second life.“It is time to reuse these parts so that we can all enjoy them again”, the municipality has announced. In its attempt to “breathe new life” into old Amsterdam, a 190-page on-line catalogue of the old stonework has been put online to allow every Amsterdammer to own a piece of their heritage.The stone has been ranked in terms of quality, from “complete gables” down to “debris”. Some of the items come with their original architectural drawings or black and white photographs showing their previous use.All the pieces are being offered free of charge but the criteria for taking ownership is stricter for pieces deemed to be of extra value because “there is more documentation left or because they are still in relatively good condition”.Today, the epitome of Amsterdam’s wealth and power during the 17th century can be seen in the rows of gabled houses along the three main canals in the centre of the city: Herengracht, Prinsengracht and Keizersgracht.Among the debris on offer is the old facade of a canal house at 126 Herengracht called ‘t Moortje, due to its Moorish appearance.Applicants must provide a convincing idea for the stoneworks’ future use to take ownership. Potential uses include art projects or new building developments. “The often special stones, ornaments, frames and, for example, columns can be a wonderful addition to, for example, a new-build project,” the municipality says.Residents have until the end of December to come up with ideas and proposals. The fragments can be collected in spring 2020 but anyone interested needs to organise their own means of transport for the stonework."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0f9d7349369607cf9584c256ed7afcac8caffee/284_617_3128_1877/master/3128.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ebb6bdb14350d46d575a734309c99564","title":"emails about russia 2018 world cup bid being offered online","story":"Anonymous Telegram account indicates emails for sale after reports emerge of dossier on how to bribe Fifa officialsAn anonymously run Telegram account has indicated that it wants to sell a tranche of emails relating to Russia’s 2018 World Cup bid, after reports that they contain a dossier compiled by Russian officials on how to bribe Fifa executive council members.The existence of the emails was first reported by the investigative website the Insider. According to the Insider, an aide to the former footballer Franz Beckenbauer promised to deliver his vote in exchange for “generous compensation for his consulting services”, later specified as at least €3m.A Cypriot Fifa executive’s vote could be bought for €1.5m, and the former Fifa vice-president Jack Warner would vote for “whoever offers him the most”, the Insider report says.There is no suggestion that the Russian officials acted on the dossier, nor of any wrongdoing by those named. Thompson, who was at the time the head of England’s rival World Cup bid, has denied his wife was offered any gifts.Warner has been banned for life by Fifa’s ethics committee, and Sepp Blatter and the former France captain Michel Platini, who are both profiled in the dossier, each received an eight-year ban from football in 2011.The emails purportedly come from the account of Sergei Kapkov, a Russian politician and former head of the country’s national football academy, and are in the possession of an anonymously run Telegram channel called BlackMirror.In an email exchange, BlackMirror told the  that it released the “samples” in order to stimulate interest from potential “acquirers”.The email containing the dossier was allegedly sent in March 2010 by Alexander Djordjadze, the head of the Russia 2018 organising committee, nine months before Fifa’s executive council delivered the 2018 tournament to Russia in a secret ballot. According to the Insider, it was sent to Igor Shuvalov, then a deputy prime minister under Vladimir Putin, Arkady Dvorkovich, an aide to the then-president Dmitry Medvedev, and Kapkov, who later became the head of Moscow’s culture department.Fifa opened an investigation in 2014, but ultimately decided there was not enough evidence of bribery to re-run the vote. Fifa’s head judge in the inquest noted that it had limited access to potential evidence and that the computers used by the Russian bid team had been destroyed after the vote.The emails were purportedly stolen from Kapkov, who left the government in 2015. Screenshots of the emails were released on the BlackMirror Telegram channel.Reached by the , the person or people behind the account avoided saying directly that they were selling the emails for money, writing instead that they would discuss “conditions” to “transfer” the archive with “potential acquirers.” BlackMirror said it didn’t have any personal reaction to the information revealed in the emails.BlackMirror did not immediately say what price it wanted for the emails, but prices for similar archives can cost tens of thousands of pounds. In 2016, the hacking group Anonymous International reportedly requested 100 bitcoin, then about £43,000, for emails purportedly from Kapkov’s account. It is unclear whether the two sets of emails are connected, although BlackMirror said it has emails dated up to 2019, indicating more recent access to Kapkov’s account.Asked how it had come into possession of the emails, BlackMirror said: “We don’t discuss technical questions.”BlackMirror said it was already considering another “release” of files, likely not related to Russia’s World Cup bid.The Insider said it had received originals from BlackMirror of the files allegedly shared between Kapkov and powerful Russian officials.Besides the dossier, they include strategy documents for a wide-reaching influence campaign among the 2018 World Cup organising committee and even large sponsors of the sporting organisation.Alexei Sorokin, the head of Russia’s 2018 bid team, told the RBC news outlet that the documents were fake and that there was never any dossier of Fifa executive committee members.“It’s nonsense,” he said, adding that Kapkov took no part in the bid process. “It seems to me that the whole thing was fabricated from beginning to end.”He also noted that Russia had answered questions during an “official investigation” into the vote and said that “all of our ‘influence’ came during open contacts”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0abc98bf4751633406a6972796036068fb8e125/452_955_5284_3171/master/5284.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=618cbcd09ebef401fe53e9bfca93df86","title":"indonesia man flogged adultery law helped draw aceh","story":"Member of religious council is publicly whipped in conservative Aceh regionAn Indonesian man working for an organisation that helped draft strict religious laws has been publicly whipped himself after he was caught having an affair with a married woman.Flogging is a common punishment for a range of offences in the deeply conservative Aceh region on Sumatra island, including adultery, drinking alcohol, and having gay or premarital sex.Aceh is the only region in the world’s biggest Muslim-majority nation that imposes Islamic law, part of a 2005 autonomy deal with the central government that ended a decades-long separatist insurgency.On Thursday, a masked religious officer lashed Mukhlis, an Aceh Ulema Council (MPU) member, 28 times on the back after he was caught with a married woman last month.Mukhlis, who like many Indonesians goes by one name, grimaced and flinched during the punishment in the provincial capital, Banda Aceh. The woman was then flogged with a rattan cane 23 times.The organisation for which Mukhlis works advised the local government and legislature on drafting and implementing Aceh’s religious law, including public flogging.It was not immediately clear what he did for the agency.The council made headlines this summer when it criticised plans to form a national women’s football league because Aceh did not have a special stadium where only female players, match officials and spectators would be present.In June, it issued a fatwa, or religious edict, against the online game PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds (PUBG), saying it insulted Islam and made addicted players violent.Flogging a council member underlined the commitment to enforcing Islamic law, said the Aceh Besar deputy regent, Husaini Wahab.Mukhlis would probably be sacked under his employer’s moral code, Wahab added.Also on Thursday, a female university student was flogged a dozen times after she was caught spending the night in a boarding house with a man, who escaped punishment because he was underage.Dozens of onlookers watched the floggings, with some recording them on their mobile phones. “I was just curious to see how it was carried out,” said one spectator, Robbi.In July, three people were each flogged 100 times for having premarital sex, while last year two men caught having sex with underaged girls were also whipped 100 times.Rights groups have criticised public caning as a cruel and inhuman punishment, and Indonesia’s president, Joko Widodo, has called for it to end. But the practice has wide support among Aceh’s mostly Muslim population."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Eamon Harrison (23) allegedly delivered trailer carrying 39 migrants to Zeebrugge PortInvestigating officers urge men to hand themselves in to PSNIRain and wind warnings in place for Friday and SaturdayKaren Harrington charged with the murder of Santina Cawley in JulyEight cyclists have died on Irish roads so far this year\u0026lsquoMs P\u0026rsquo was kept on life support for four weeks due to concerns about Eighth AmendmentAuthority said stallion seized while wandering on road and killed as fees not paidUFC fighter remained silent during short hearing while victim of attack was not present in courtConcern that \u0026lsquooutside forces\u0026rsquo are \u0026lsquopiggybacking\u0026rsquo on local protestsViolent protests forced Chilean government to cancel December\u0026rsquos COP25 meetingUniveristy president says \u0026lsquo revolution in teaching styles and philosophies\u0026rsquo is future of third-levelDublin Fire Brigade reports no injuries caused by fireworks or bonfires so far tonightGarda\u0026iacute arrested suspect after making dozens of \u0026lsquopurchases\u0026rsquo of controlled substancesMan was driver and sole occupant of car which entered sea at about 8pm Thursday nightGarda\u0026iacute appealing for witnesses following discovery of body in Tousist, Kenmare last weekBailey tells party colleagues her career and livelihood are on the lineIrish Rail calls for Se\u0026aacuten Fleming to correct record over remarks on use of card by companyThe number of GPs has been static since the start of the year, despite Government deal to improve conditionsSenior PSNI officer says QIH investigation is a \u0026lsquocritical priority\u0026rsquo for the force"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4057998.1571674594!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the irish times most nominated in newsbrands shortlist 2019","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRosita Boland with her trophy at the 2018 Newsbrands Ireland journalism awards Photograph: Simon CarswellThe  has received 32 nominations in the shortlist for the NewsBrands Journalism Awards 2019 – the highest number for a publication in this year’s competition.The NewsBrands Journalism Awards are open to any work published in print, website, online, mobile, video, audio or any other news delivery format from any NewsBrands Ireland member title.Five of the six journalists shortlisted in the Foreign Coverage category write for The : Sally Hayden Derek Scally Suzanne Lynch Lara Marlowe and Patrick Freyne.The  received four of the six nominations for Best Use of Video, citing the work of Simon Carswell, Kathleen Harris, Enda O’Dowd and Bryan O’Brien.Jack Power of The  was nominated in three categories Business Story of the Year Investigative Journalism and Young Journalist of the Year.  reporter Sarah Burns was also shortlisted as Young Journalist of the Year as was current  reporter Shauna Bowers for her past work at The Times, Ireland edition.Markets Correspondent Joe Brennan is shortlisted for Business Journalist of the Year.In the Campaigning Journalism category, The ’ No Child campaign has been shortlisted.Fintan O’Toole and Hilary Fannin are both nominated in the Broadsheet Columnist category, while in the Critic of the Year category The  has four writers shortlisted: Catherine Cleary Patrick Freyne Niamh Donnelly and Fintan O’Toole.Three  writers are shortlisted in the Features Broadsheet Writer of the Year: Rosita Boland, Conor Gallagher and Conor Pope.Carl O’Brien is nominated, along with Power, in the Investigative Journalism category.

That means agriculture, hydroelectric dams, borders,” he predicted.The future of lucrative oil fields currently under SDF control in the east is uncertain, however.While they would be a major boon for the government, which has had to rely on Tehran for much of its oil in recent years, the US sent several hundred troops back into Syria last week to guard them. Assad said he respected President Donald Trump\u0027s transparency in his bid for oil in the Middle East, a quality lacking in his predecessors, he claimed.He is the best American president, not because his policies are good, but because he is the most transparent president, he said. All American presidents ... project themselves as defenders of human rights and noble and unique American values.  The reality is that they are a group of criminals who represent the interests of American lobbies, i.e. the large oil and arms companies, and others.When is the General Election 2019 and when will we know the results? General election latest news: Nigel Farage pitches \u0026#39Leave Alliance\u0026#39 with Tories as Brexit Party launch campaignIndonesian man flogged for adultery under law his organisation helped draftSilver Spitfire pilot log weeks eight and nine: calmer skies ahead as our men escape the chaos of typhoon seasonEssex lorry deaths: Two arrested in Vietnam in connection with the deaths of 39 migrants Nicola Sturgeon: Jeremy Corbyn would cave in over second independence referendum next yearTerrorist propaganda and gruesome execution videos should be banned under new laws, London Bridge coroner recommendsComment: Donald Trump is entirely wrong about the Boris Johnson deal\tIndiana woman found dead with 8-foot python around her neck in home filled with snakesComment: A \u0026#39Unite the Right\u0026#39 campaign may be the best path to a Brexit majorityIs Britain already in a cyber war?\u0026#39None of this would have been possible without Nigel Farage\u0026#39 -  readers on this week’s top stories Nine things you never knew about Guy FawkesThe story behind Bonfire Night and Guy Fawkes: Gunpowder, treason and plotDonald Trump\u0026#39s issues with the Brexit deal - and one possible route around them Why Isil\u0026#39s new leader Abu Ibrahim al-Hashemi al-Qurayshi has inherited an empire in ruinsRevealed: The fearsome data targeting machine that will power Labour\u0026#39s next election campaign – and why some of it could be illegal\u0026#39Havana Syndrome\u0026#39 of US diplomats likely caused by paranoia not sonic weapon, study claimsSurvivors of 2015 Paris attacks publish open letter calling on France to take action on Isil in SyriaBest independent schools in the UK: Compare league table results for GCSEsBest independent schools in the UK: Compare league table results for A-levelsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"gchq 100 crack exclusive telegraph code join secret gathering","story":"Defence and Security CorrespondentMinistry of DefenceFor 100 years GCHQ has been fulfilling its mission to keep the UK safe.  Its codebreakers are the hidden heroes tackling the biggest threats to the country. And now, readers, you have a chance to try your hand at cracking a two-part code and joining me, the Defence Correspondent Dominic Nicholls, at a subscribers-only drinks reception to celebrate the centenary of this magnificent organisation.Below is a code specially created for the .

The staff of around 60 German linguists, mainly young women, were employed to live log the communications.This type of interception had never been done before for voice communications and the tactical nature of the information collected by the young women helped to protect British pilots and sailors.Tony Comer, GCHQ’s historian, told the  that the role needed people who had a good ear, could rapidly interpret and understand what was happening. They needed to “get the information out in as near real-time as possible,” he said, describing them as the “live bloggers” of their day. Abbots Cliff House is available online for nearly £2,000 a nightThe property’s current owner has already become acquainted with its rich history after being visited by several women who were stationed there for RAF decoding work during the war.Stephen Lucas, 58, claimed a bricked-up room in the basement was also reputed to hide abandoned surveillance equipment.Recalling his recent visit from the RAF decoders, He said: “They told us some stories about Churchill visiting the property - they weren’t allowed to salute him or anything - everyone was in civvies and the house was camouflaged, it was wonderful.”He added: “A lot of guests are really interested in it.”The covert past of the site has been revealed along with four others to mark the 100th anniversary of GCHQ.Director Jeremy Fleming said the past century has seen GCHQ “save countless lives, given Britain an edge, and solve and harness some of the world’s most complex technological challenges”.At the outbreak of war the Government Code and Cypher School, GCHQ’s original name, had 200 staff working at Bletchley Park and Mansfield College in Oxford.By December 1944 there were 10,000 people working at Bletchley Park and another 20,000 in outstations throughout the UK.When is the General Election 2019 and when will we know the results? General election latest news: Nigel Farage pitches \u0026#39Leave Alliance\u0026#39 with Tories as Brexit Party launch campaignIndonesian man flogged for adultery under law his organisation helped draftSilver Spitfire pilot log weeks eight and nine: calmer skies ahead as our men escape the chaos of typhoon seasonEssex lorry deaths: Two arrested in Vietnam in connection with the deaths of 39 migrants Nicola Sturgeon: Jeremy Corbyn would cave in over second independence referendum next yearTerrorist propaganda and gruesome execution videos should be banned under new laws, London Bridge coroner recommendsComment: Donald Trump is entirely wrong about the Boris Johnson deal\tIndiana woman found dead with 8-foot python around her neck in home filled with snakesComment: A \u0026#39Unite the Right\u0026#39 campaign may be the best path to a Brexit majorityIs Britain already in a cyber war?\u0026#39None of this would have been possible without Nigel Farage\u0026#39 -  readers on this week’s top stories Bashar al-Assad says Syrian regime to take back all Kurdish held areas in new interviewNine things you never knew about Guy FawkesThe story behind Bonfire Night and Guy Fawkes: Gunpowder, treason and plotDonald Trump\u0026#39s issues with the Brexit deal - and one possible route around them Why Isil\u0026#39s new leader Abu Ibrahim al-Hashemi al-Qurayshi has inherited an empire in ruinsRevealed: The fearsome data targeting machine that will power Labour\u0026#39s next election campaign – and why some of it could be illegal\u0026#39Havana Syndrome\u0026#39 of US diplomats likely caused by paranoia not sonic weapon, study claimsSurvivors of 2015 Paris attacks publish open letter calling on France to take action on Isil in SyriaBest independent schools in the UK: Compare league table results for GCSEsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/28/TELEMMGLPICT000214394992_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqhJ9OF22R61zNdPttfFPBIKsXVjD1YkuhNUMuJ1fa8FM.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"not just samira ahmed bbc treats talent appallingly","story":"Samira Ahmed has taken the BBC to an employment tribunalMessage to Samira Ahmed: it’s not because you’re a woman.

Yet the series almost immediately transcended its format to deliver a moving and very funny rumination on depression and middle-age malaise. Will Arnett plays BoJack – one time star of Nineties hit sitcom Horsin’ Around – as a lost soul whose turbo-charged narcissism prevents him getting his life together. A valentine to the Spielberg school of Eighties blockbuster, with Winona Ryder as a small town mom whose son is abducted by a transdimensional monster. ET, Goonies, Close Encounters, Alien and everything Stephen King wrote between 1975 and 1990 are all tossed into the blender by Millennial writer-creators the Duffer brothers. It was clear Stranger Things was going to be a mega-smash when Barb – the “best friend” character eaten in the second episode – went viral the weekend it dropped. Netflix’s Marvel shows tend towards the overlong and turgid. An exception is the high-kicking Daredevil, with Charlie Cox’s blind lawyercrimefighter banishing all memory of Ben Affleck\u0027s turn donning the red jumpsuit in 2003. With New York’s Hell’s Kitchen neighbourhood as backdrop, Daredevil is caked in street-level grit and features a searing series one performance by Vincent D\u0027Onofrio as the villainous Kingpin. The perfect antidote to the deafening bombast of the big screen Marvel movies. Did he do it? Does it matter considering the lengths the Durham, North Carolina police seemingly went in order to stitch him up? Sitting through this twisting, turning documenting about the trial of Michael Peterson – charged with the murder in 2003 of his wife – the viewer may find themselves alternately empathising with and recoiling from the accused. It’s a feat of bravura factual filmmaking from French documentarian Jean-Xavier de Lestrade, which comes to Netflix with a recently shot three-part coda catching up with the (very weird) Peterson clan a decade on. Stranger Things: the Euro-Gloom years. Netflix’s first German-language production is a pulp romp that thinks it’s a Wagner opera. In a remote town surrounded by a creepy forest locals fear the disappearance of a teenager may be linked to other missing persons cases from decades earlier. The timelines get twisted and it’s obvious that something wicked is emanating from a tunnel leading to a nearby nuclear power plant. Yet if the story sometimes trips itself up the Goonies-meets-Götterdämmerung ambiance keeps you hooked. 640 A Series of Unfortunate EventsThe wry and bleak Lemony Snickett children novels finally get the ghastly adaptation they deserve (let’s all pretend the dreadful 2004 Jim Carrey movie never happened). Neil Patrick Harris gobbles up the scenery as the vain and wicked Count Olaf, desperate to separate the Baudelaire orphans from their considerable inheritance. The look is Tim Burton by way of Wes Anderson, and the dark wit of the books is replicated perfectly (Snickett, aka Daniel Handler, is co-producer). If you’re curious as to how Cary Fukunaga will handle the Bond franchise, his limited series, starring Emma Stone and Jonah Hill, drops some delicious hints. It’s a mind-bending sci-fi story set in an alternative United States where computers still look like Commodore 64s and in which you pay for goods by having a “travel buddy” sit down and read you adverts. The Breaking Bad prequel is starting to outgrow the show that spawned it. Where Breaking Bad delivered a master-class in scorched earth storytelling Saul is gentler and more humane. Years before the rise of Walter White, the future meth overlord’s sleazy lawyer, Saul Goodman, is still plain old Jimmy McGill, a striving every-dude trying to catch a break. But how far will he go to make his name and escape the shadow of his superstar attorney brother Chuck (Michael McKean)? Don’t tell Channel 4 but Charlie Brooker’s dystopian anthology series has arguably got even better since making the jump from British terrestrial TV to the realm of megabucks American streaming. Bigger budgets have given creators Brooker and Annabel Jones license to let their imaginations off the leash – yielding unsurpassable episodes such as virtual reality love story San Junipero and Star Trek parody USS Callister, which has bagged a bunch of Emmys. David Fincher produces this serial killer drama based on the writings of a real-life FBI psychological profiler. It’s the post-Watergate Seventies and two maverick G-Men (Jonathan Groff and Holt McCallany) are going out on a limb by utilising the latest psychological research to get inside the heads of a motley assembly of real-life sociopathic murders – including the notorious “Co-Ed” butcher Ed Kemper, brought chillingly to live in an Emmy-nominated performance by Cameron Britton. A right royal blockbuster from dramatist Peter Morgan (The Queen, Frost  Nixon). Tracing the reign of Elizabeth II from her days as a wide-eyed young woman propelled to the throne after the surprise early death of her father, The Crown humanises the royals even as it paints their private lives as a bodice-ripping soap. Matt Smith is charmingly roguish as Prince Philip and Vanessa Kirby has ascended the Hollywood ranks on the back of her turn as the flawed yet sympathetic Princess Margaret. This drug trafficking caper spells out exactly what kind of series it is with an early scene in which two gangsters zip around a multi-level carpark on a motorbike firing a machine gun. Narcos, in other words, is for people who consider Pacino’s Scarface a touch too understated. Series one and two feature a mesmerising performance by Wagner Moura as Columbian cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar, while season three focuses on the notorious Cali cartel. Reported to be one of Netflix’s biggest hits – the company doesn’t release audience figures – the fourth season turns its attention to Mexico’s interminable drugs wars. A cloud hangs over Aziz Ansari’s future after he was embroiled in the #MeToo scandal. But whatever happens, he has left us with a humane and riveting sitcom about an Ansari-proximate character looking for love and trying to establish himself professionally in contemporary New York. One of Netflix’s early blockbusters, the sprawling soap opera updates Dallas to modern day southern Florida. Against the edge-of-civilisation backdrop of the Florida Keys, Kyle Chandler plays the local detective and favourite son of a well-to-do family. Their idyllic lives are thrown into chaos with the return of the clan’s black sheep (an unnervingly intense Ben Mendelsohn). The story is spectacularly hokey but searing performances by Chandler and Mendelsohn, and by Sissy Spacek and the late Sam Shepard as their imperious parents, make Bloodline compelling – a guilty pleasure that, actually, you shouldn’t feel all that guilty about. You can almost smell the shoddy sanitation and horse-manure in this lavish murder-mystery set in 19th New York. We’re firmly in Martin Scorsese\u0027s Gangs of New York territory, with a serial killer bumping off boy prostitutes across Manhattan. Enter pioneering criminal psychologist Dr Laszlo Kreisler (Daniel Brühl), aided by newspaper man John Moore (Luke Evans) and feisty lady detective Sara Howard (Dakota Fanning). Judd Apatow bring his signature gross-out comedy to the small screen. Love, which Apatow produced, is a masterclass in restraint compared to 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up etc. Paul Rust is Gus, a nerdish movie set tutor, whose develops a crush on Gillian Jacobs’s too-cool-for-school radio producer Mickey. Romance, of a sort, blossoms – but Love’s triumph is to acknowledge the complications of real life and to disabuse its characters of the idea that there’s such a thing as a straightforward happy ending. Hipster LA provides the bustling setting. Who says reality TV has to be nasty and manipulative? This updating of the early 2000s hit Queer Eye for the Straight Guy has five stereotype-challenging gay men sharing lifestyle tips and fashion advice with an engaging cast of All American schlubs (the first two seasons are shot mostly in the state of Georgia). There are laughs – but serious moment too, such as when one of the crew refuses to enter a church because of the still unhealed scars of his strict Christian upbringing. A high-gloss revamping of the traditional TV food show. Each episode profiles a high wattage international chef across its three seasons, the series has featured gastronomic superstars from the US, Argentina, India and Korea. A disastrous group interview in which actor Jason Bateman “mansplained” away the bullying co-star Jessica Walter had suffered at the hands of fellow cast-member Jeffrey Tambor meant season five of Arrested Development was fatally compromised before it even landed. Yet Netflix’s return to the dysfunctional world of the Bluth family stands on its merits and is a worthy addition to the surreal humour of seasons one through three (series four, which had to work around the busy schedules of the cast, is disposable by comparison). Netflix does Bladerunner with this sumptuous adaptation of the cult Richard Morgan novel. The setting is a neon-splashed cyberpunk future in which the super-wealthy live forever by uploading the consciousness into new “skins”. Enter rebel-turned-detective Takeshi Kovacs (Joel Kinnaman), hired to find out who killed a (since resurrected) zillionaire industrialist while dealing with fallout from his own troubled past. Rumoured to be one of Netflix’s most expensive projects yet, for its second run, Anthony Mackie (aka Marvel’s Falcon) replaced Kinnaman as the shape-shifting Kovacs.2140 Rick and MortyDan Harmon, creator of cult sitcom Community (also on Netflix), finds the perfect outlet for zany fanboy imagination with this crazed animated comedy about a Marty McFlyDoc Brown-esque duo of time travellers. Every genre imaginable is parodied with the manic energy and zinging dialogue we have come to expect from Harmon.Mad Men’s Alison Brie is our entry point into this comedy-drama inspired by a real life all-female wrestling league in the Eighties. Ruth Wilder (Brie) is a down-on-her luck actor who, out of desperation, signs up a wrestling competition willed into being by Sam Sylvia (podcast king Marc Maron). Britrock singer Kate Nash is one of her her fellow troupe members: the larger than life Rhonda “Britannica” Richardson.Deadpan animated satire about an idiot super spy with shaken and stirred mother issues. One of the most ambitious modern comedies, animated or otherwise, Archer tries on different varieties of humour for size and even occasionally tugs at the heart strings.Breaking Bad for those with short attention s. The saga of Walter White took years to track the iconic anti-hero’s rise from mild mannered everyman to dead-eyed criminal. Ozark gets there in the first half hour as nebbish Chicago accountant Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman) agrees to serve as lieutenant for the Mexican mob in the hillbilly heartlands of Ozark, Missouri (in return they thoughtfully spare his life). Bateman, usually seen in comedy roles, is a revelation as is Laura Linney as his nasty wife Wendy. There is also a break-out performance by Julia Garner playing the scion of a local redneck crime family.A heavenly comedy with a twist. Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell) is a cynical schlub waved through the Pearly Gates by mistake after dying in a bizarre supermarket accident. There she must remain above the suspicions of seemingly well-meaning but disorganised angel Michael (Ted Danson) whilst also negotiating fractious relationships with do-gooder Chidi (William Jackson Harper), spoiled princess Tahani (former T4 presenter Jameela Jamil) and ex-drug dealer Jason (Manny Jacinto).Netflix has been binning shows as if it is going out of fashion. But that didn’t stop Drake from persuading it to revive the Channel 4 drama about rival drug dealers in a fictional south London neighbourhood. Middle-aged Irishman Ronan Bennett captures the reality of life for many young black British people with tremendously sensitivity, while the cast is headed by Ashley Walters, Kane “Kano” Robinson, rapper Little Simz and Mercury Prize winner Dave. A police procedural adapted from a long-form magazine exposé of American justice’s entrenched misogyny sounds like nobody’s idea of a fun night in. But Unbelievable makes serious points about how sufferers of sexual assault are marginalised and victim-blamed while also drawing the viewer into a compelling mystery. Unflinching yet never gratuitous, it stars Toni Collette and Merritt Wever as hard-bitten detectives investigating a serial rapist. Booksmart’s Kaitlyn Dever, meanwhile, plays a young woman wrongly accused of crying wolf when a man attacks her in her apartment. Time becomes a loop in this sci-fi parable about a troubled New Yorker who finds herself reliving the final hours of her life over and over. Is the cosmos itself trying to tell her something? Or is she simply losing her marbles. Natasha Lyonne excels as damaged, potty-mouthed Nadia. Her improbable love interest is played by Charlie Barnett.Gerard Way’s surreal comic book has translated impressively to the screen. Umbrella Academy unfolds as a lightly unhinged anti-Avengers. A family of super-powered siblings tries to solve the mystery of the murder of their domineering adoptive father, who plucked them from the arms of their mothers and raised them to be humanity’s first line of defence. Ellen Page, Tom Hopper and Robert Sheehan head the cast in a series that plays out like a Marvel movie directed by Wes Anderson. Watch out for a cameo by R\u0026ampB queen Mary J Blige as an inter-dimensional assassin. Oscar-nominated Ava DuVernay makes a foray into television with a gripping four-part retelling of the 1989 Central Park Five case in which five African Americans were charged with the rape of a jogger in central Manhattan. This return to the world of the Jim Henson 1982 fantasy movie is very much a series of two halves. The first five episodes are a confused hodgepodge of exposition and world building. But once it settles down this prequel to the film spins a fantastic tale of puppet Gelflings and Skeksis vying for power in a feudal kingdom… a game of thrones, as it were. Westeros regulars Natalie Dormer, Lena Headey and Nathalie Emmanuel star alongside Simon Pegg, Mark Hamill and Alicia Vikander.   3340 The Haunting of Hill HouseA rare TV horror that genuinely gets under the skin. Very loosely adapted from 1959 Shirley Jackson gothic classic, Mike Flanagan’s series chronicles the adulthood agonies of a family whose childhood was traumatised by a run-in with a creepy mansion. Rather than lazy jump-scares, the series ratchets up the dread slowly yet unyieldingly. A few episodes in and you may find yourself holding your breath, so searing is the tension. To really freak you, Flanagan has also inserted dozens of hidden ghosts into the background. See how many you can spot – and good luck getting to sleep afterwards. Bonkers on a swizzle stick, this series from Brit Marling and Zal Batmanglij makes Twin Peaks look like an Only Fools and Horses repeat. Prairie (Marling) is an inter-dimensional wanderer with a strange past and an even weirder future. She recruits a group of high school students, teaching them the “movements” that permit travel across time and space. That’s the jumping off point for a meditation on existence, identity and fate. Controversially cancelled after just two seasons – and the mother of all cliff-hangers – the OA is nonetheless a sensory experience worth your time. Did we mention the talking octopus? David Attenborough provides the narration – but the real star is the stunning camerawork and general sumptuousness, courtesy of the team behind BBC mega-hits Blue Planet and Planet Earth. Shots of flamingos running across salt flats and blue whales chilling off the coast of Mexico are the perfect excuse to spring for a Netflix HD subscription. Game of Thrones exited to the strains of a thousand damp squibs imploding at once. And it’s too early to say whether adaptations of the Witcher or The Wheel of Time will be any use. But one fantasy saga worth getting your chainmail in a twist for is this kid’s animated series from Avatar: The Last Airbender director Aaron Ehasz. The setting is bog standard swords and sorcery – there are dragons, elves and magicians – but the execution is riveting. Ethnic tensions between elves and humans are compellingly drawn – and did we mention the dragons? A gothic adult cartoon based on an obscure video game does not sound enticing. Yet this baroque fever dream starring Richard Armitage (Thorin from The Hobbit movies) as the last living member of an excommunicated family of vampire hunters and Graham McTavish as a misunderstood Count Dracula (he’s upset after his wife is burned the stake) is a riveting slow burner. A third season is in production. 3840 Tuca and BertieNetflix has lately turned cancelling shows into a competitive sport. This new animated drama from the creators of BoJack Horseman was canned just two months after its debut despite much critical acclaim. In Netflix’s defence, it is rather wacky. To quote Deadline, it tells of  “the friendship between two 30-year-old bird-women who live in the same apartment building, Tuca (Tiffany Haddish), a cocky, care-free toucan and Bertie (Ali Wong), an anxious, daydreaming songbird.” The humour is surreal but, just like BoJack Horseman, the emotional beats – specifically its depiction of the central relationship – yank the heartstrings.Reality TV, the Netflix way. Imagine Bake Off with glass-blowing instead of marzipan manipulation and YouTube star Nick Uhas in for Noel Fielding and Sandi Toksvig. Ten artists test their glass blowing mastery in a series of challenges. The winner walks away with $60,000 and a residency at the Corning Museum of Glass in New York. Just like Bake Off, it’s riveting viewing even if you can’t tell a kiln from a kangaroo.   4040 Dead to MeLinda Cardellini and Christina Applegate join forces for this super-dark comedy about two women who meet at a therapy group for the recently bereaved. They strike up a natural friendship – but, as we slowly learn, each has secrets they’d rather not share. James Marsden is fantastic as the smarmy ex of Judy (Cardellini) while the behind the scenes involvement of producers Will Ferrell and Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy director Adam McKay provides a clue as to the mad-cap humour. A word-of-mouth success, it has been picked up for a second series.A cartoon about a talking horse, starring the goofy older brother from Arrested Development… on paper little about BoJack Horseman screams “must watch”. Yet the series almost immediately transcended its format to deliver a moving and very funny rumination on depression and middle-age malaise. Will Arnett plays BoJack – one time star of Nineties hit sitcom Horsin’ Around – as a lost soul whose turbo-charged narcissism prevents him getting his life together. A valentine to the Spielberg school of Eighties blockbuster, with Winona Ryder as a small town mom whose son is abducted by a transdimensional monster. ET, Goonies, Close Encounters, Alien and everything Stephen King wrote between 1975 and 1990 are all tossed into the blender by Millennial writer-creators the Duffer brothers. It was clear Stranger Things was going to be a mega-smash when Barb – the “best friend” character eaten in the second episode – went viral the weekend it dropped. Netflix’s Marvel shows tend towards the overlong and turgid. An exception is the high-kicking Daredevil, with Charlie Cox’s blind lawyercrimefighter banishing all memory of Ben Affleck\u0027s turn donning the red jumpsuit in 2003. With New York’s Hell’s Kitchen neighbourhood as backdrop, Daredevil is caked in street-level grit and features a searing series one performance by Vincent D\u0027Onofrio as the villainous Kingpin. The perfect antidote to the deafening bombast of the big screen Marvel movies. Did he do it? Does it matter considering the lengths the Durham, North Carolina police seemingly went in order to stitch him up? Sitting through this twisting, turning documenting about the trial of Michael Peterson – charged with the murder in 2003 of his wife – the viewer may find themselves alternately empathising with and recoiling from the accused. It’s a feat of bravura factual filmmaking from French documentarian Jean-Xavier de Lestrade, which comes to Netflix with a recently shot three-part coda catching up with the (very weird) Peterson clan a decade on. Stranger Things: the Euro-Gloom years. Netflix’s first German-language production is a pulp romp that thinks it’s a Wagner opera. In a remote town surrounded by a creepy forest locals fear the disappearance of a teenager may be linked to other missing persons cases from decades earlier. The timelines get twisted and it’s obvious that something wicked is emanating from a tunnel leading to a nearby nuclear power plant. Yet if the story sometimes trips itself up the Goonies-meets-Götterdämmerung ambiance keeps you hooked. 640 A Series of Unfortunate EventsThe wry and bleak Lemony Snickett children novels finally get the ghastly adaptation they deserve (let’s all pretend the dreadful 2004 Jim Carrey movie never happened). Neil Patrick Harris gobbles up the scenery as the vain and wicked Count Olaf, desperate to separate the Baudelaire orphans from their considerable inheritance. The look is Tim Burton by way of Wes Anderson, and the dark wit of the books is replicated perfectly (Snickett, aka Daniel Handler, is co-producer). If you’re curious as to how Cary Fukunaga will handle the Bond franchise, his limited series, starring Emma Stone and Jonah Hill, drops some delicious hints. It’s a mind-bending sci-fi story set in an alternative United States where computers still look like Commodore 64s and in which you pay for goods by having a “travel buddy” sit down and read you adverts. The Breaking Bad prequel is starting to outgrow the show that spawned it. Where Breaking Bad delivered a master-class in scorched earth storytelling Saul is gentler and more humane. Years before the rise of Walter White, the future meth overlord’s sleazy lawyer, Saul Goodman, is still plain old Jimmy McGill, a striving every-dude trying to catch a break. But how far will he go to make his name and escape the shadow of his superstar attorney brother Chuck (Michael McKean)? Don’t tell Channel 4 but Charlie Brooker’s dystopian anthology series has arguably got even better since making the jump from British terrestrial TV to the realm of megabucks American streaming. Bigger budgets have given creators Brooker and Annabel Jones license to let their imaginations off the leash – yielding unsurpassable episodes such as virtual reality love story San Junipero and Star Trek parody USS Callister, which has bagged a bunch of Emmys. David Fincher produces this serial killer drama based on the writings of a real-life FBI psychological profiler. It’s the post-Watergate Seventies and two maverick G-Men (Jonathan Groff and Holt McCallany) are going out on a limb by utilising the latest psychological research to get inside the heads of a motley assembly of real-life sociopathic murders – including the notorious “Co-Ed” butcher Ed Kemper, brought chillingly to live in an Emmy-nominated performance by Cameron Britton. A right royal blockbuster from dramatist Peter Morgan (The Queen, Frost  Nixon). Tracing the reign of Elizabeth II from her days as a wide-eyed young woman propelled to the throne after the surprise early death of her father, The Crown humanises the royals even as it paints their private lives as a bodice-ripping soap. Matt Smith is charmingly roguish as Prince Philip and Vanessa Kirby has ascended the Hollywood ranks on the back of her turn as the flawed yet sympathetic Princess Margaret. This drug trafficking caper spells out exactly what kind of series it is with an early scene in which two gangsters zip around a multi-level carpark on a motorbike firing a machine gun. Narcos, in other words, is for people who consider Pacino’s Scarface a touch too understated. Series one and two feature a mesmerising performance by Wagner Moura as Columbian cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar, while season three focuses on the notorious Cali cartel. Reported to be one of Netflix’s biggest hits – the company doesn’t release audience figures – the fourth season turns its attention to Mexico’s interminable drugs wars. A cloud hangs over Aziz Ansari’s future after he was embroiled in the #MeToo scandal. But whatever happens, he has left us with a humane and riveting sitcom about an Ansari-proximate character looking for love and trying to establish himself professionally in contemporary New York. One of Netflix’s early blockbusters, the sprawling soap opera updates Dallas to modern day southern Florida. Against the edge-of-civilisation backdrop of the Florida Keys, Kyle Chandler plays the local detective and favourite son of a well-to-do family. Their idyllic lives are thrown into chaos with the return of the clan’s black sheep (an unnervingly intense Ben Mendelsohn). The story is spectacularly hokey but searing performances by Chandler and Mendelsohn, and by Sissy Spacek and the late Sam Shepard as their imperious parents, make Bloodline compelling – a guilty pleasure that, actually, you shouldn’t feel all that guilty about. You can almost smell the shoddy sanitation and horse-manure in this lavish murder-mystery set in 19th New York. We’re firmly in Martin Scorsese\u0027s Gangs of New York territory, with a serial killer bumping off boy prostitutes across Manhattan. Enter pioneering criminal psychologist Dr Laszlo Kreisler (Daniel Brühl), aided by newspaper man John Moore (Luke Evans) and feisty lady detective Sara Howard (Dakota Fanning). Judd Apatow bring his signature gross-out comedy to the small screen. Love, which Apatow produced, is a masterclass in restraint compared to 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up etc. Paul Rust is Gus, a nerdish movie set tutor, whose develops a crush on Gillian Jacobs’s too-cool-for-school radio producer Mickey. Romance, of a sort, blossoms – but Love’s triumph is to acknowledge the complications of real life and to disabuse its characters of the idea that there’s such a thing as a straightforward happy ending. Hipster LA provides the bustling setting. Who says reality TV has to be nasty and manipulative? This updating of the early 2000s hit Queer Eye for the Straight Guy has five stereotype-challenging gay men sharing lifestyle tips and fashion advice with an engaging cast of All American schlubs (the first two seasons are shot mostly in the state of Georgia). There are laughs – but serious moment too, such as when one of the crew refuses to enter a church because of the still unhealed scars of his strict Christian upbringing. A high-gloss revamping of the traditional TV food show. Each episode profiles a high wattage international chef across its three seasons, the series has featured gastronomic superstars from the US, Argentina, India and Korea. A disastrous group interview in which actor Jason Bateman “mansplained” away the bullying co-star Jessica Walter had suffered at the hands of fellow cast-member Jeffrey Tambor meant season five of Arrested Development was fatally compromised before it even landed. Yet Netflix’s return to the dysfunctional world of the Bluth family stands on its merits and is a worthy addition to the surreal humour of seasons one through three (series four, which had to work around the busy schedules of the cast, is disposable by comparison). Netflix does Bladerunner with this sumptuous adaptation of the cult Richard Morgan novel. The setting is a neon-splashed cyberpunk future in which the super-wealthy live forever by uploading the consciousness into new “skins”. Enter rebel-turned-detective Takeshi Kovacs (Joel Kinnaman), hired to find out who killed a (since resurrected) zillionaire industrialist while dealing with fallout from his own troubled past. Rumoured to be one of Netflix’s most expensive projects yet, for its second run, Anthony Mackie (aka Marvel’s Falcon) replaced Kinnaman as the shape-shifting Kovacs.2140 Rick and MortyDan Harmon, creator of cult sitcom Community (also on Netflix), finds the perfect outlet for zany fanboy imagination with this crazed animated comedy about a Marty McFlyDoc Brown-esque duo of time travellers. Every genre imaginable is parodied with the manic energy and zinging dialogue we have come to expect from Harmon.Mad Men’s Alison Brie is our entry point into this comedy-drama inspired by a real life all-female wrestling league in the Eighties. Ruth Wilder (Brie) is a down-on-her luck actor who, out of desperation, signs up a wrestling competition willed into being by Sam Sylvia (podcast king Marc Maron). Britrock singer Kate Nash is one of her her fellow troupe members: the larger than life Rhonda “Britannica” Richardson.Deadpan animated satire about an idiot super spy with shaken and stirred mother issues. One of the most ambitious modern comedies, animated or otherwise, Archer tries on different varieties of humour for size and even occasionally tugs at the heart strings.Breaking Bad for those with short attention s. The saga of Walter White took years to track the iconic anti-hero’s rise from mild mannered everyman to dead-eyed criminal. Ozark gets there in the first half hour as nebbish Chicago accountant Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman) agrees to serve as lieutenant for the Mexican mob in the hillbilly heartlands of Ozark, Missouri (in return they thoughtfully spare his life). Bateman, usually seen in comedy roles, is a revelation as is Laura Linney as his nasty wife Wendy. There is also a break-out performance by Julia Garner playing the scion of a local redneck crime family.A heavenly comedy with a twist. Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell) is a cynical schlub waved through the Pearly Gates by mistake after dying in a bizarre supermarket accident. There she must remain above the suspicions of seemingly well-meaning but disorganised angel Michael (Ted Danson) whilst also negotiating fractious relationships with do-gooder Chidi (William Jackson Harper), spoiled princess Tahani (former T4 presenter Jameela Jamil) and ex-drug dealer Jason (Manny Jacinto).Netflix has been binning shows as if it is going out of fashion. But that didn’t stop Drake from persuading it to revive the Channel 4 drama about rival drug dealers in a fictional south London neighbourhood. Middle-aged Irishman Ronan Bennett captures the reality of life for many young black British people with tremendously sensitivity, while the cast is headed by Ashley Walters, Kane “Kano” Robinson, rapper Little Simz and Mercury Prize winner Dave. A police procedural adapted from a long-form magazine exposé of American justice’s entrenched misogyny sounds like nobody’s idea of a fun night in. But Unbelievable makes serious points about how sufferers of sexual assault are marginalised and victim-blamed while also drawing the viewer into a compelling mystery. Unflinching yet never gratuitous, it stars Toni Collette and Merritt Wever as hard-bitten detectives investigating a serial rapist. Booksmart’s Kaitlyn Dever, meanwhile, plays a young woman wrongly accused of crying wolf when a man attacks her in her apartment. Time becomes a loop in this sci-fi parable about a troubled New Yorker who finds herself reliving the final hours of her life over and over. Is the cosmos itself trying to tell her something? Or is she simply losing her marbles. Natasha Lyonne excels as damaged, potty-mouthed Nadia. Her improbable love interest is played by Charlie Barnett.Gerard Way’s surreal comic book has translated impressively to the screen. Umbrella Academy unfolds as a lightly unhinged anti-Avengers. A family of super-powered siblings tries to solve the mystery of the murder of their domineering adoptive father, who plucked them from the arms of their mothers and raised them to be humanity’s first line of defence. Ellen Page, Tom Hopper and Robert Sheehan head the cast in a series that plays out like a Marvel movie directed by Wes Anderson. Watch out for a cameo by R\u0026ampB queen Mary J Blige as an inter-dimensional assassin. Oscar-nominated Ava DuVernay makes a foray into television with a gripping four-part retelling of the 1989 Central Park Five case in which five African Americans were charged with the rape of a jogger in central Manhattan. This return to the world of the Jim Henson 1982 fantasy movie is very much a series of two halves. The first five episodes are a confused hodgepodge of exposition and world building. But once it settles down this prequel to the film spins a fantastic tale of puppet Gelflings and Skeksis vying for power in a feudal kingdom… a game of thrones, as it were. Westeros regulars Natalie Dormer, Lena Headey and Nathalie Emmanuel star alongside Simon Pegg, Mark Hamill and Alicia Vikander.   3340 The Haunting of Hill HouseA rare TV horror that genuinely gets under the skin. Very loosely adapted from 1959 Shirley Jackson gothic classic, Mike Flanagan’s series chronicles the adulthood agonies of a family whose childhood was traumatised by a run-in with a creepy mansion. Rather than lazy jump-scares, the series ratchets up the dread slowly yet unyieldingly. A few episodes in and you may find yourself holding your breath, so searing is the tension. To really freak you, Flanagan has also inserted dozens of hidden ghosts into the background. See how many you can spot – and good luck getting to sleep afterwards. Bonkers on a swizzle stick, this series from Brit Marling and Zal Batmanglij makes Twin Peaks look like an Only Fools and Horses repeat. Prairie (Marling) is an inter-dimensional wanderer with a strange past and an even weirder future. She recruits a group of high school students, teaching them the “movements” that permit travel across time and space. That’s the jumping off point for a meditation on existence, identity and fate. Controversially cancelled after just two seasons – and the mother of all cliff-hangers – the OA is nonetheless a sensory experience worth your time. Did we mention the talking octopus? David Attenborough provides the narration – but the real star is the stunning camerawork and general sumptuousness, courtesy of the team behind BBC mega-hits Blue Planet and Planet Earth. Shots of flamingos running across salt flats and blue whales chilling off the coast of Mexico are the perfect excuse to spring for a Netflix HD subscription. Game of Thrones exited to the strains of a thousand damp squibs imploding at once. And it’s too early to say whether adaptations of the Witcher or The Wheel of Time will be any use. But one fantasy saga worth getting your chainmail in a twist for is this kid’s animated series from Avatar: The Last Airbender director Aaron Ehasz.

But their 2006 debut – the defiantly titled Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not – is arguably the most generation-defining, by a band experiencing the kind of hype that hadn’t been seen since Oasis with Definitely Maybe. Alex Turner’s sardonic and keenly observational lyrics on songs like “Fake Tales of San Francisco” and “When the Sun Goes Down” had fans clamouring to get into their early shows. It was an early example of the power the internet would hold over the music industry – propelling them from an unknown indie band on MySpace to the top of the charts in the space of six months.Please Please Me has a rhythm to it like little else released by The Beatles. Songs like “Twist and Shout” and “I Saw Her Standing There” have an energy that reflects the youthful vim of the band themselves, who were raring to go following the number one single from which the album takes its name. Their harmonies are thrilling to hear, and this is arguably the best album for capturing the band’s raw power.335 33) Yeah Yeah Yeahs – Fever to Tell (2003)In 2003, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs stuck a middle finger up to the naysayers who scoffed that they were little more than a bunch of posers. Their debut album Fever to Tell is a bristling record loaded with New York snark supplied by Karen O’s impressive vocal turns. Nick Zinner keeps the urgency going with roaring guitar licks while Brian Chase offers earth-shaking percussion on the likes of “Date With the Night” and “Y Control”. More than trendsetters – the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were the brains behind the smartest album of that year.Kanye West called it “white crunk music”. The band themselves called it “music for girls to dance to”. And songs such as “This Fire” certainly livened things up their irresistible hooks and disco energy, as frontman Alex Kapranos turned the male gaze on its head with lyrics like “I can feel your lips undress my eyes”. Fifteeen years later and “Take Me Out” still makes you swing your hips.Blur versus Oasis is a battle music fans will be waging for decades to come, but when it comes to debut albums, Oasis emerge as top dogs. Definitely Maybe was exciting, aggressive and loaded with attitude: a 22-year-old Liam Gallagher spits and snarls over the reverb-soaked guitars of “Cigarettes \u0026amp Alcohol”, and soars on that falsetto for “Live Forever”. Among the “too cool for school” alt-rockers who spurned the glitz and glamour of fame, Oasis asserted themselves as the definitive rock and roll stars.Stefani Germanotta’s debut album The Fame brought maximalist pop back to the forefront of the late-Noughties music scene, in an industry that was desperately lacking in pop as. Lady Gaga already sounded famous and she acted famous – but that doesn’t mean her music couldn’t stand on its own. Songs like “Beautiful, Dirty, Rich” and “Just Dance” seemed to convey Gaga’s love of fame and hedonism while remaining supremely self-aware of its superficiality. To top it off, it was masterfully produced and resplendent with slick, catchy dancepop and Eurodisco influences.Kendrick Lamar subtitled his debut record “A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar”, and indeed it feels as though you’re watching the movie of his early life – such is the autobiographical nature of this record. He raps in low, furtive tones, interrupted by voicemails from his family (his mother asks him pleadingly to return her car) that reinforce the familial themes. It is family, and faith, that keep Lamar on the outskirts of a world of violence and sin. Even this early on his career you hear the virtuosity and acute understanding of rhythm – Good kid, m.A.A.d City now stands as a classic album from a rapper who chooses the power of storytelling over a cheap punchline.Not every great debut album is defined by whether the artist has landed on their “sound” by the first track. Led Zeppelin were still figuring things out when they released their self-titled debut, yet it is essential because it laid the groundwork for what they would go onto achieve the following decade. “We were learning what got us off most and what got people off most,” Robert Plant said. You had the blues and folk notes on “Babe I’m Gonna Leave You”, and the chugging rock of “Communication Breakdown” Plant’s yowling vocals and Jimmy Page’s guitar. It did the trick.935 27) The Jesus and Mary Chain – Psychocandy (1985)“It was the crap coming out of the radio that made us want to be in a band more than anything else,” Jim Reid told Rolling Stone for the 30th anniversary of the Scottish alt-rocker’s debut album Psychocandy. “Because it was like, ‘Why is everything we hear so f***ing awful?’ That was the main driving force: how bad things were.” Psychocandy was certainly like nothing anyone else released at that time. Inspired by the Velvet Underground and The Stooges, the Reid brothers loaded their debut with buzzy guitars and hair-raising levels of feedback on singles like “You Trip Me Up” and “Never Understand”. It paved the way for countless shoegaze and alt-rock bands in the decades that followed.Grace is a masterpiece, and the only album the perfectionist Jeff Buckley was satisfied with before he drowned, aged 30, in a freak accident in Memphis in 1997. Yet had Grace been the only material ever released under his name (live recordings, covers and demos were released posthumously), it would have been enough to prove he was a rare and exceptional talent. His exquisite rendering of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah”, his melismatic singing on “Grace” and the church-like hush of “Lover, You Should Come Over” – all of this and more carved out a rich legacy that ensures Buckley’s music will never fade.The whipsmart, cynical, outrageous young man on Eminem’s major label debut was a breath of fresh air – or perhaps more of a slap in the face – after a spate of soulful, conscious hip hop records. Of course, the rampant misogyny and homophobia his so-called “character” Slim Shady spat out caused uproar, regardless of how surreal the scenarios to which they were applied were.  Arguably what stands out the most on The Slim Shady LP is the sheer technical skill and lyrical ability that few have been able to match since.Not only did it lay the groundwork for so many punk, rock and heavy metal bands that came after them – but the manic rhythms and raw intensity of their power-chord ballads featured on The Who\u0027s my Generation propelled rock and roll to new heights in 1965.“Saviours of rock and roll!” “The greatest rock band since the Rolling Stones!” You have to pity The Strokes, who released their debut album under the biggest wave of hype imaginable. Yet it’s hard to deny the impact Is This It had on rock music – critics have argued that the Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand wouldn’t have existed if not for this band. They eschewed pre-programmed beats and autotuned vocals in favour of a gritty post-punk approach, and the result was an album that reinvigorated a floundering music industry, and inspired an entire generation of bands.The idea of a rap album was virtually inconceivable until Run-DMC released their full-length, self-titled debut in 1984. When he inducted them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Eminem called them “the first movie stars of rap… they are The Beatles”. Busta Rhymes proclaimed: “Run-DMC didn’t change music, they changed everything.” The trio’s aggressive yet stark tracks – like “Sucker MCS” and “Hard Times” – were a dramatic contrast against the R\u0026ampB-driven rap of the time, an approach emulated by the rappers themselves, who spurned outlandish costumes in favour of tracksuits and sneakers. As an anniversary piece in Billboard noted, “they were authentic before authenticity in hip hop was even a thing”.Brian Eno’s experimental synths met Bryan Ferry’s romantic, old-school charm on the debut album from Roxy Music\u0027s bizarre art-glam-rock outfit. There were odes to Humphrey Bogart (“2HB”) and cyber-rock jams (“Ladytron”), and songs decorated with spooky-sounding hooks that wouldn’t sound out of place in The Rocky Horror Show (the character Riff Raff even seemed to take his cues from a balding Brian Eno).Still regarded by many as his greatest album to date, Reasonable Doubt asserted Jay-Z as a master freestyle – perhaps the best of his generation – recorded in a studio he compared to a psychiatrist’s couch. At the heart of the record is a blistering duet with the Notorious BIG, “Brooklyn’s Finest”, which practically heralded the shift of focus back from West Coast hip hop to the East.Rolling Stone\u0027s Lester Bangs described the Black Sabbath as “just like Cream! But worse”, and their debut album as “a shuck – despite the murky song titles and some inane lyrics that sound like Vanilla Fudge paying doggerel tribute to Aleister Crowley, the album has nothing to do with spiritualism, the occult, or anything much except stiff recitations of Cream clichés”. The Village Voice weren’t keen either, with critic Robert Christgau condemning it as “bulls**t necromancy.” Yet this is the album that invented heavy metal. Black Sabbath arrived ready to lure fans over to the dark side with Ozzy Osbourne’s piercing, operatic cry: “My name is Lucifer, please take my hand.” Critics be damned.1835 18) Sex Pistols – Never Mind the Bollocks, Here\u0027s the Sex Pistols (1977)“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks, having caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Yet despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts and is today regarded as one of the most important punk albums in music history.Joe Strummer was a ball of rage and ambition when he and the rest of The Clash laid down the tracks for their debut album. Most of the guitar on this record was provided by Mick Jones, because Strummer didn’t think technical ability was punk enough. Yet their vision burns through on the buzz-saw attack of “Career Opportunities” and “White Riot”, raising a fist against unemployment, racism and the fat cats of industry. 2035 16) Guns N Roses – Appetite for Destruction (1987)Guns N Roses\u0027 Appetite for Destruction was the biggest thing to happen to hard rock since Led Zeppelin IV. Slash’s guitar and Axl Rose’s wild, animal howls contribute to the raw energy on songs like “Paradise City” and marked a dramatic shift away from the commercialised heavy rock that was being played on MTV at the time – proudly championing a gritty form of hedonism instead. “A lot of rock bands are too f***ing wimpy to have any sentiment or emotion,” Rose said. Not this band.Daft Punk\u0027s Homework was originally intended as “just a load of singles”, until Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo realised they had enough quality tracks for a full-length release. Each one opens with a kind of motif upon which multiple textures build and sprawl outwards – sleazy guitar hooks, G-funk whines and glittering synths. It’s the album that alerted the rest of the world to the French house music scene.Sex and poetry go hand in hand, especially if you’re a Jim Morrison fan. While few bands manage to ide critical opinion as much as The Doors, their debut album’s organ-driven rock was as tight as their frontman’s famous leather trousers. They brought theatricality to the Sixties music scene and went onto inspire as broad a range of artists as The Stranglers to Skrillex. The baroque pop stylings and lustful lyrics on “Light My Fire” proved to be a breakthrough, and helped propel them to number two on the US Billboard 200.After making a name for himself on Jay-Z’s The Blueprint as well as by producing hits for Janet Jackson and Ludacris, Kanye West spent four years recording The College Dropout. His background as a producer was obviously beneficial to his own debut, at a time where hip hop sampling was being accused of being too safe. And he subverted many other hip hop clichés, skirting round the dominant “gangsta” persona and instead finding solace in family and the church.2435 12) Pink Floyd – The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967)Pink Floyd’s debut The Piper at the Gates of Dawn stands as a classic of psychedelic rock. Helmed by an unravelling Syd Barrett – ousted a year after the album’s release – it shows the band at their most playful, with several tracks going onto become staples of their live shows. Songs such as “Bike”, meanwhile, proved the band were not averse to a good pop hook along with the acid guitars and hazy production. 2535 11) Lauryn Hill – The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998)Lauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with the immense and groundbreaking record, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around.2635 10) Dizzee Rascal – Boy in Da Corner (2003)It’s staggering to listen back to Boy in Da Corner and remember Dizzee Rascal was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk.2735 9) Beastie Boys – Licensed to Ill (1986)Hip hop’s first number one album was an incendiary, all-guns-blazing record that would send shockwaves around the music industry for years to come. Few artists release something so assertive as this – a statement of intent to middle America that demanded they fight for their right to party. Beastie Boys\u0027 Mike D, Ad-Rock and MCA would move on from the frat boy humour and “good time” attitude of Licensed to Ill, but it is that record that delivered rap against a backdrop of Led Zeppelin and James Brown-inspired guitar licks.2835 8) The Notorious BIG – Ready to Die (1994)The rapper Notorious BIG, born Christopher Wallace, had been taking part in rap battles around Fulton Street, Brooklyn since he was 13 years old, but it was only at the urging of his friends that he quit a lucrative drugs operation and devoted himself to music. Living on a knife’s edge was all Biggie Smalls knew as a kid, when he was “waking up every morning, hustling, cutting school, looking out for my moms, the police, stickup kids just risking my life every day on the street selling drugs”, as he told Rolling Stone back in 1995. The things he witnessed and experienced were poured into Ready to Die – one of the best debut albums in hip hop – delivered in his signature throaty vocals with wit and humour.At less than 30 minutes, Ramones’ debut injects their rage, their disillusionment and their frustration directly into the listener’s veins. It’s a record that spurned the posturing of Seventies rock and stripped all of the artifice away to the bare bones beneath, with songs such as “Beat on the Brat” and “Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue” proving to be as surly as the band themselves. “Our early songs came out of our real feelings of alienation, isolation, frustration – the feelings everybody feels between seventeen and seventy-five,” singer Joey Ramone said. The whole record cost just $6,000 to make.NWA unveiled their cold, menacing sound on debut record Straight Outta Compton that heralded the beginning of gangsta rap and also launched the careers of Dr Dre, Eazy-E and Ice Cube. The latter made it clear they weren’t positioning themselves as people to look up to: “Do I look like a mother***ing role mode?” he demands on “Gangsta Gangsta”. Their track “F*** tha Police” – a protest track against racism and police brutality – led to them receiving a threatening letter from the FBI, which only contributed to their growing fame.Dubbed the Banana Album for its famous Andy Warhol cover art, The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico is proof of what a band can do when they are completely fearless. With Nico – the beautiful German vocalist added to the band at Warhol’s request – you have this exquisite balance of cool femininity and fiery machismo. Sex and hedonism are everywhere on this record, from “Venus in Furs” to “Run Run Run”, but it’s not so much glamour as glam rock – gritty tales of drug addiction and raw desire. Speaking of its initially low sales figures, Brian Eno observed that, nonetheless, “everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band”. David Bowie called it “the future of music”, and 52 years later, it still feels like it.A virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Jimi Hendrix used Are You Experienced  to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”.  And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his.“Jesus died for somebody’s sins, but not mine,” go the immortal opening words of Patti Smith’s debut album Horses. There’s a heady anticipation as she speaks the lyric in a low, seductive murmur, before switching to a cocky swagger as the electric guitar line kicks in. It was a bold move, to open her debut album with a reinvention of someone else’s song (in this case Van Morrison’s “Gloria”), but Smith was unlike anything the music world had ever seen. She was a poet, who wanted to capture the literary genius of her idol Arthur Rimbaud and channel it via the raw passion of an artist like Jimi Hendrix. “She was like a wildcat, walking out with this jacket slung over her shoulder,” Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore once recalled of seeing her perform the album live in 1976. “It was life-changing.”How good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densley-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.”Unknown Pleasures is unlike any album that had been created before it – or indeed any album since. It’s mysteriousness makes it as compelling as many great works of literature indeed, our critic Chris Harvey said the spiritual force emanating from the Joy Division\u0027s record\u0027s grooves make it feel “almost Dostoevskyan”. Peter Hook’s basslines veer and thrum wildly beneath Ian Curtis’s dark mutterings that are at once urgent, detached, and strangely sexless. On “She’s Lost Control” it as though you’re hearing the band play from the end of a dark tunnel – the echoes of Curtis\u0027s voice and the ominous rumblings of that bass build and build. By the time you reach those final, shivery notes on “I Remember Nothing”, it doesn’t feel like an overstatement to call this a life-changing record.135 35) Arctic Monkeys – Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not (2006)A new wave of British guitar bands was already being pioneered by the likes of The Libertines, Bloc Party and Franz Ferdinand when the Sheffield-formed Arctic Monkeys arrived on the scene. But their 2006 debut – the defiantly titled Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not – is arguably the most generation-defining, by a band experiencing the kind of hype that hadn’t been seen since Oasis with Definitely Maybe. Alex Turner’s sardonic and keenly observational lyrics on songs like “Fake Tales of San Francisco” and “When the Sun Goes Down” had fans clamouring to get into their early shows. It was an early example of the power the internet would hold over the music industry – propelling them from an unknown indie band on MySpace to the top of the charts in the space of six months.Please Please Me has a rhythm to it like little else released by The Beatles. Songs like “Twist and Shout” and “I Saw Her Standing There” have an energy that reflects the youthful vim of the band themselves, who were raring to go following the number one single from which the album takes its name. Their harmonies are thrilling to hear, and this is arguably the best album for capturing the band’s raw power.335 33) Yeah Yeah Yeahs – Fever to Tell (2003)In 2003, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs stuck a middle finger up to the naysayers who scoffed that they were little more than a bunch of posers. Their debut album Fever to Tell is a bristling record loaded with New York snark supplied by Karen O’s impressive vocal turns. Nick Zinner keeps the urgency going with roaring guitar licks while Brian Chase offers earth-shaking percussion on the likes of “Date With the Night” and “Y Control”. More than trendsetters – the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were the brains behind the smartest album of that year.Kanye West called it “white crunk music”. The band themselves called it “music for girls to dance to”. And songs such as “This Fire” certainly livened things up their irresistible hooks and disco energy, as frontman Alex Kapranos turned the male gaze on its head with lyrics like “I can feel your lips undress my eyes”. Fifteeen years later and “Take Me Out” still makes you swing your hips.Blur versus Oasis is a battle music fans will be waging for decades to come, but when it comes to debut albums, Oasis emerge as top dogs. Definitely Maybe was exciting, aggressive and loaded with attitude: a 22-year-old Liam Gallagher spits and snarls over the reverb-soaked guitars of “Cigarettes \u0026amp Alcohol”, and soars on that falsetto for “Live Forever”. Among the “too cool for school” alt-rockers who spurned the glitz and glamour of fame, Oasis asserted themselves as the definitive rock and roll stars.Stefani Germanotta’s debut album The Fame brought maximalist pop back to the forefront of the late-Noughties music scene, in an industry that was desperately lacking in pop as. Lady Gaga already sounded famous and she acted famous – but that doesn’t mean her music couldn’t stand on its own. Songs like “Beautiful, Dirty, Rich” and “Just Dance” seemed to convey Gaga’s love of fame and hedonism while remaining supremely self-aware of its superficiality. To top it off, it was masterfully produced and resplendent with slick, catchy dancepop and Eurodisco influences.Kendrick Lamar subtitled his debut record “A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar”, and indeed it feels as though you’re watching the movie of his early life – such is the autobiographical nature of this record. He raps in low, furtive tones, interrupted by voicemails from his family (his mother asks him pleadingly to return her car) that reinforce the familial themes. It is family, and faith, that keep Lamar on the outskirts of a world of violence and sin. Even this early on his career you hear the virtuosity and acute understanding of rhythm – Good kid, m.A.A.d City now stands as a classic album from a rapper who chooses the power of storytelling over a cheap punchline.Not every great debut album is defined by whether the artist has landed on their “sound” by the first track. Led Zeppelin were still figuring things out when they released their self-titled debut, yet it is essential because it laid the groundwork for what they would go onto achieve the following decade. “We were learning what got us off most and what got people off most,” Robert Plant said. You had the blues and folk notes on “Babe I’m Gonna Leave You”, and the chugging rock of “Communication Breakdown” Plant’s yowling vocals and Jimmy Page’s guitar. It did the trick.935 27) The Jesus and Mary Chain – Psychocandy (1985)“It was the crap coming out of the radio that made us want to be in a band more than anything else,” Jim Reid told Rolling Stone for the 30th anniversary of the Scottish alt-rocker’s debut album Psychocandy. “Because it was like, ‘Why is everything we hear so f***ing awful?’ That was the main driving force: how bad things were.” Psychocandy was certainly like nothing anyone else released at that time. Inspired by the Velvet Underground and The Stooges, the Reid brothers loaded their debut with buzzy guitars and hair-raising levels of feedback on singles like “You Trip Me Up” and “Never Understand”. It paved the way for countless shoegaze and alt-rock bands in the decades that followed.Grace is a masterpiece, and the only album the perfectionist Jeff Buckley was satisfied with before he drowned, aged 30, in a freak accident in Memphis in 1997. Yet had Grace been the only material ever released under his name (live recordings, covers and demos were released posthumously), it would have been enough to prove he was a rare and exceptional talent. His exquisite rendering of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah”, his melismatic singing on “Grace” and the church-like hush of “Lover, You Should Come Over” – all of this and more carved out a rich legacy that ensures Buckley’s music will never fade.The whipsmart, cynical, outrageous young man on Eminem’s major label debut was a breath of fresh air – or perhaps more of a slap in the face – after a spate of soulful, conscious hip hop records. Of course, the rampant misogyny and homophobia his so-called “character” Slim Shady spat out caused uproar, regardless of how surreal the scenarios to which they were applied were.  Arguably what stands out the most on The Slim Shady LP is the sheer technical skill and lyrical ability that few have been able to match since.Not only did it lay the groundwork for so many punk, rock and heavy metal bands that came after them – but the manic rhythms and raw intensity of their power-chord ballads featured on The Who\u0027s my Generation propelled rock and roll to new heights in 1965.“Saviours of rock and roll!” “The greatest rock band since the Rolling Stones!” You have to pity The Strokes, who released their debut album under the biggest wave of hype imaginable. Yet it’s hard to deny the impact Is This It had on rock music – critics have argued that the Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand wouldn’t have existed if not for this band. They eschewed pre-programmed beats and autotuned vocals in favour of a gritty post-punk approach, and the result was an album that reinvigorated a floundering music industry, and inspired an entire generation of bands.The idea of a rap album was virtually inconceivable until Run-DMC released their full-length, self-titled debut in 1984. When he inducted them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Eminem called them “the first movie stars of rap… they are The Beatles”. Busta Rhymes proclaimed: “Run-DMC didn’t change music, they changed everything.” The trio’s aggressive yet stark tracks – like “Sucker MCS” and “Hard Times” – were a dramatic contrast against the R\u0026ampB-driven rap of the time, an approach emulated by the rappers themselves, who spurned outlandish costumes in favour of tracksuits and sneakers. As an anniversary piece in Billboard noted, “they were authentic before authenticity in hip hop was even a thing”.Brian Eno’s experimental synths met Bryan Ferry’s romantic, old-school charm on the debut album from Roxy Music\u0027s bizarre art-glam-rock outfit. There were odes to Humphrey Bogart (“2HB”) and cyber-rock jams (“Ladytron”), and songs decorated with spooky-sounding hooks that wouldn’t sound out of place in The Rocky Horror Show (the character Riff Raff even seemed to take his cues from a balding Brian Eno).Still regarded by many as his greatest album to date, Reasonable Doubt asserted Jay-Z as a master freestyle – perhaps the best of his generation – recorded in a studio he compared to a psychiatrist’s couch. At the heart of the record is a blistering duet with the Notorious BIG, “Brooklyn’s Finest”, which practically heralded the shift of focus back from West Coast hip hop to the East.Rolling Stone\u0027s Lester Bangs described the Black Sabbath as “just like Cream! But worse”, and their debut album as “a shuck – despite the murky song titles and some inane lyrics that sound like Vanilla Fudge paying doggerel tribute to Aleister Crowley, the album has nothing to do with spiritualism, the occult, or anything much except stiff recitations of Cream clichés”. The Village Voice weren’t keen either, with critic Robert Christgau condemning it as “bulls**t necromancy.” Yet this is the album that invented heavy metal. Black Sabbath arrived ready to lure fans over to the dark side with Ozzy Osbourne’s piercing, operatic cry: “My name is Lucifer, please take my hand.” Critics be damned.1835 18) Sex Pistols – Never Mind the Bollocks, Here\u0027s the Sex Pistols (1977)“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks, having caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Yet despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts and is today regarded as one of the most important punk albums in music history.Joe Strummer was a ball of rage and ambition when he and the rest of The Clash laid down the tracks for their debut album. Most of the guitar on this record was provided by Mick Jones, because Strummer didn’t think technical ability was punk enough. Yet their vision burns through on the buzz-saw attack of “Career Opportunities” and “White Riot”, raising a fist against unemployment, racism and the fat cats of industry. 2035 16) Guns N Roses – Appetite for Destruction (1987)Guns N Roses\u0027 Appetite for Destruction was the biggest thing to happen to hard rock since Led Zeppelin IV. Slash’s guitar and Axl Rose’s wild, animal howls contribute to the raw energy on songs like “Paradise City” and marked a dramatic shift away from the commercialised heavy rock that was being played on MTV at the time – proudly championing a gritty form of hedonism instead. “A lot of rock bands are too f***ing wimpy to have any sentiment or emotion,” Rose said. Not this band.Daft Punk\u0027s Homework was originally intended as “just a load of singles”, until Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo realised they had enough quality tracks for a full-length release. Each one opens with a kind of motif upon which multiple textures build and sprawl outwards – sleazy guitar hooks, G-funk whines and glittering synths. It’s the album that alerted the rest of the world to the French house music scene.Sex and poetry go hand in hand, especially if you’re a Jim Morrison fan. While few bands manage to ide critical opinion as much as The Doors, their debut album’s organ-driven rock was as tight as their frontman’s famous leather trousers. They brought theatricality to the Sixties music scene and went onto inspire as broad a range of artists as The Stranglers to Skrillex. The baroque pop stylings and lustful lyrics on “Light My Fire” proved to be a breakthrough, and helped propel them to number two on the US Billboard 200.After making a name for himself on Jay-Z’s The Blueprint as well as by producing hits for Janet Jackson and Ludacris, Kanye West spent four years recording The College Dropout. His background as a producer was obviously beneficial to his own debut, at a time where hip hop sampling was being accused of being too safe. And he subverted many other hip hop clichés, skirting round the dominant “gangsta” persona and instead finding solace in family and the church.2435 12) Pink Floyd – The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967)Pink Floyd’s debut The Piper at the Gates of Dawn stands as a classic of psychedelic rock. Helmed by an unravelling Syd Barrett – ousted a year after the album’s release – it shows the band at their most playful, with several tracks going onto become staples of their live shows. Songs such as “Bike”, meanwhile, proved the band were not averse to a good pop hook along with the acid guitars and hazy production. 2535 11) Lauryn Hill – The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998)Lauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with the immense and groundbreaking record, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around.2635 10) Dizzee Rascal – Boy in Da Corner (2003)It’s staggering to listen back to Boy in Da Corner and remember Dizzee Rascal was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk.2735 9) Beastie Boys – Licensed to Ill (1986)Hip hop’s first number one album was an incendiary, all-guns-blazing record that would send shockwaves around the music industry for years to come. Few artists release something so assertive as this – a statement of intent to middle America that demanded they fight for their right to party. Beastie Boys\u0027 Mike D, Ad-Rock and MCA would move on from the frat boy humour and “good time” attitude of Licensed to Ill, but it is that record that delivered rap against a backdrop of Led Zeppelin and James Brown-inspired guitar licks.2835 8) The Notorious BIG – Ready to Die (1994)The rapper Notorious BIG, born Christopher Wallace, had been taking part in rap battles around Fulton Street, Brooklyn since he was 13 years old, but it was only at the urging of his friends that he quit a lucrative drugs operation and devoted himself to music. Living on a knife’s edge was all Biggie Smalls knew as a kid, when he was “waking up every morning, hustling, cutting school, looking out for my moms, the police, stickup kids just risking my life every day on the street selling drugs”, as he told Rolling Stone back in 1995. The things he witnessed and experienced were poured into Ready to Die – one of the best debut albums in hip hop – delivered in his signature throaty vocals with wit and humour.At less than 30 minutes, Ramones’ debut injects their rage, their disillusionment and their frustration directly into the listener’s veins. It’s a record that spurned the posturing of Seventies rock and stripped all of the artifice away to the bare bones beneath, with songs such as “Beat on the Brat” and “Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue” proving to be as surly as the band themselves. “Our early songs came out of our real feelings of alienation, isolation, frustration – the feelings everybody feels between seventeen and seventy-five,” singer Joey Ramone said. The whole record cost just $6,000 to make.NWA unveiled their cold, menacing sound on debut record Straight Outta Compton that heralded the beginning of gangsta rap and also launched the careers of Dr Dre, Eazy-E and Ice Cube. The latter made it clear they weren’t positioning themselves as people to look up to: “Do I look like a mother***ing role mode?” he demands on “Gangsta Gangsta”. Their track “F*** tha Police” – a protest track against racism and police brutality – led to them receiving a threatening letter from the FBI, which only contributed to their growing fame.Dubbed the Banana Album for its famous Andy Warhol cover art, The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico is proof of what a band can do when they are completely fearless. With Nico – the beautiful German vocalist added to the band at Warhol’s request – you have this exquisite balance of cool femininity and fiery machismo. Sex and hedonism are everywhere on this record, from “Venus in Furs” to “Run Run Run”, but it’s not so much glamour as glam rock – gritty tales of drug addiction and raw desire. Speaking of its initially low sales figures, Brian Eno observed that, nonetheless, “everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band”. David Bowie called it “the future of music”, and 52 years later, it still feels like it.A virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Jimi Hendrix used Are You Experienced  to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”.  And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his.“Jesus died for somebody’s sins, but not mine,” go the immortal opening words of Patti Smith’s debut album Horses. There’s a heady anticipation as she speaks the lyric in a low, seductive murmur, before switching to a cocky swagger as the electric guitar line kicks in. It was a bold move, to open her debut album with a reinvention of someone else’s song (in this case Van Morrison’s “Gloria”), but Smith was unlike anything the music world had ever seen. She was a poet, who wanted to capture the literary genius of her idol Arthur Rimbaud and channel it via the raw passion of an artist like Jimi Hendrix. “She was like a wildcat, walking out with this jacket slung over her shoulder,” Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore once recalled of seeing her perform the album live in 1976. “It was life-changing.”How good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densley-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.”Unknown Pleasures is unlike any album that had been created before it – or indeed any album since. It’s mysteriousness makes it as compelling as many great works of literature indeed, our critic Chris Harvey said the spiritual force emanating from the Joy Division\u0027s record\u0027s grooves make it feel “almost Dostoevskyan”. Peter Hook’s basslines veer and thrum wildly beneath Ian Curtis’s dark mutterings that are at once urgent, detached, and strangely sexless. On “She’s Lost Control” it as though you’re hearing the band play from the end of a dark tunnel – the echoes of Curtis\u0027s voice and the ominous rumblings of that bass build and build. By the time you reach those final, shivery notes on “I Remember Nothing”, it doesn’t feel like an overstatement to call this a life-changing record.In the reboot, the Angels are sent on an assignment to handle\u0026nbspdangerous new technology after a whistleblower alerts them to its existence.The film will be released in the UK on 29 November 2019.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If anything, we’ve advanced even further considering our tech is far more sleeker than the clunky machinery seen in the film.Then there’s the matter of climate change.

Money editor Jenny Ross said: “This is a positive step that may help to plug the gaps created by the alarming rate of bank branch and cashpoint closures across the UK – so Link must deal with requests swiftly and aim to provide free machines for all those left cut off from cash.“But it\u0027s clear this scheme alone won\u0027t fix the country\u0027s broken cash landscape.“Appalling mismanagement by the industry and regulators has left the cash system on the brink of collapse and communities are being presented with a confusing array of schemes claiming to fix the problem.“That\u0027s why the government must intervene to protect cash for as long as it is needed.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The director\u0027s adaptation is a nonsensical, deeply convoluted disaster that wastes an enjoyably oddball cast. It\u0027s the only one of Lynch\u0027s films the director has publicly disowned. Still, hopes are high that next year’s version from Arrival director Denis Villeneuve, starring Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya, will somehow be better.  326 The Bonfire of the Vanities (1990)Fresh off the success of bestselling novel The Bonfire of the Vanities, Warner Bros bought the rights from Tom Wolfe for a staggering $750,000. Tom Hanks and Melanie Griffiths were both (mis)cast in the lead roles after director Brian De Palma\u0027s preferred choices turned him down. The filmmaker himself struggled to spin the 1990 production\u0027s many plates amid reports of rising on-set troubles that were all witnessed and documented in Julie Salmon\u0027s follow-up book, The Devil\u0027s Candy.1991 gangster film Billy Bathgate, which stars Dustin Hoffman and Nicole Kidman, did no justice to EL Doctorow\u0027s beloved 1989 novel. With the efforts of Oscar-winning Kramer vs Kramer director Robert Benton and a script by Tom Stoppard, the film had all the ingredients to become as good as The Godfather, Scarface, and Goodfellas. Instead, it was a hollow adaptation, largely because all the magic was lost with the absence of the central character\u0027s narration – a huge reason behind the novel\u0027s success.The Scarlet Letter (1995) is ranked as one of the worst book adaptations ever made and for good reason. Described by DH Lawrence as “a perfect work of the American imagination, the book was handed a Hollywood makeover that found itself the brunt of ridicule after flopping at the box office. Director Roland Joffé strayed so far from Nathaniel Hawthorne\u0027s pages that what should have been an enticing romance became an extremely throwaway erotic drama.  To be fair, few would be able to turn L Ron Hubbard’s allegedly Scientology-inspired Battlefield Earth (2000) into something decent. This John Travolta-with-dreadlocks epic has since gone down in “Worst Movies Ever” infamy, effectively ending Travolta’s mainstream movie career and destroying Barry Pepper’s before it even started.  Louis de Bernières\u0027s Captain Corelli\u0027s Mandolin was one of the biggest literary successes of the 1990s, but the 2001 film version – from the same British company that made Notting Hill – lost all traces of the novel\u0027s heart and soul. The dialogue is disastrous and lead stars Nicolas Cage (Captain Corelli) and Penélope Cruz (Pelagia) lack any chemistry. It may look pretty, but this adaptation was a complete mistake.  The beauty of HG Wells’s 1895 science fiction novella The Time Machine was lost amid all the CGI in this insipid 2002 adaptation, which was directed by Wells\u0027s great-grandson, Simon. Everything featured, including Guy Pearce\u0027s lead performance, is wooden apart from the copper time travel contraption at the heart of the story.There have been just as many disappointing Stephen King adaptations as there have been successful ones, but Dreamcatcher sits at the bottom of that list. The talent was present (Damian Lewis! Morgan Freeman! Timothy Olyphant!), but the end product never once correlates to anything at all decent. The film\u0027s late-stage swerve into monster movie territory is nothing short of dreadful.Before he took on the role of 007, Daniel Craig starred in this adaptation of Ian McEwan’s novel about people whose lives become entangled after witnessing a deadly accident. While Craig’s performance as college lecturer Joe, along with Rhys Ifans as Jed – the man who becomes obsessed with him – are convincing, the film allows little time for character development and suffers because of it.Nick Hornby adaptations don’t inherently need to be set in the UK (the John Cusack-starring High Fidelity, if you like that sort of thing, is something of a classic, after all), but they do need to translate the fussy, infuriating male neuroses of his novels. The Perfect Catch is the 2005 US adaptation of Hornby’s Fever Pitch, released a decade after Colin Firth starred in his own British adaptation, and transforms the source material into a more throwaway and uninteresting big-city romcom. Drew Barrymore, in a \u0027girlfriend’ role significantly beefed up in comparison to Hornby’s novel, is great, but watching her try and source chemistry with a shrill and unappealing Jimmy Fallon (in one of his rare, pre-talk show acting roles) is harrowing.The Da Vinci Code is a stinker of the highest order. Its sequels, Angels \u0026amp Demons (2009) and Inferno (2016), are also awful films, but the reason the initial Dan Brown adaptation ranks as the worst is because the others wouldn\u0027t have existed had this one not been so successful.20th Century Fox clearly wanted Eragon to be their answer to Harry Potter, but the terrible reviews stopped that plan dead in its tracks. Eragon is the worst kind of fantasy adaptation – one where all of the source materials\u0027 sense of fantastical vibrancy disappears during its translation to the big screen.1426 Running with Scissors (2006)Augusten Burroughs’s Running with Scissors consistently walks a dangerous tightrope between manic farce and adolescent horror tale. Ryan Murphy’s adaptation, released in 2006, collapses beneath such a task. You can see why Murphy, for his feature film debut, would be attracted to a tale of neurotic family dysfunction and sexual awakening as they are themes that crop up in many of his TV shows (Glee, American Horror Story, etc). But this adaptation is a tonal misfire from start to finish, despite the best efforts of an all-star cast that includes Annette Bening, Gwyneth Paltrow, Evan Rachel Wood and Brian Cox. It’s no wonder this sunk without a trace. In another case of Hollywood throwing money at something in the belief that will be enough, Philip Pullman’s superb His Dark Materials trilogy – or rather, the first book Northern Lights – was condensed into an agonising mess of CGI and hammy acting in 2007\u0027s The Golden Compass. Much of the blame went to the fact that Hollywood, where God is thanked above anyone else at the Oscars, would likely be uncomfortable handling material that was so critical of the Catholic church. It also suffered by trying to condense an overwhelming amount of information into the opening few scenes. A forthcoming BBC adaptation starring James McAvoy and Lin-Manuel Miranda looks far more promising.Where to start with this disaster of a film? Audrey Niffenegger’s The Time Traveller\u0027s Wife is beautifully and convincingly written, but there\u0027s nothing convincing about its adaptation. Producers thought casting two major Hollywood stars was a good idea, but Rachel McAdams and Eric Bana had zero chemistry. Cloud Atlas (2012) is by no means a disaster, but it\u0027s meandering plot lines, sketchy pacing and often questionable acting (Hanks has never been dodgier) do David Mitchell\u0027s sprawling, inventive novel a disservice. Still, it\u0027s an enjoyable Wachowskis romp that features Hugh Grant as a cannibal tribesman, so it has that going for it.Fans of The Hobbit did not expect the novel, so short and sweet and set in such a familiar and adored world, to be messed up by The Lord of the Rings maestro Peter Jackson – but that’s exactly what happened. While the trilogy of Hobbit films were a box-office success, they came under fire from critics for stretching the book\u0027s material too thin. Third outing, The Battle of Five Armies, was the worst received of all three.  The film adaptation of the profoundly moving and dark tale The Book Thief, which follows a young girl in Nazi Germany, is tonally off from the first scene. The glossy cinematography and excessively sentimental score jar with its grim subject matter and the performances verge on caricature. It doesn\u0027t help that all of the English dialogue is spoken with a German accent.No adaptation of The Great Gatsby,  F Scott Fitzgerald’s most famous work, has managed to capture the excess, glamour and underlying sleaze of the roaring Twenties. Baz Luhrmann\u0027s 2013 version was fun and arguably the best at revealing the insecurities of (a brilliant) Leonardo DiCaprio’s Gatsby. However, the flashiness of the production stripped away all of Fitzgerald’s delicate story-telling.Disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein’s fingerprints are all over this messy adaptation of Young Adult novel The Giver (2014), which attempts to fuse a sincere, thoughtful allegory with a Twilight-style love story backed up by action fresh from The Hunger Games  and a Taylor Swift cameo. By attempting to appeal to every single teenager all at once, though, The Giver loses sight of its fascinating dystopian premise and gives its eccentric cast (among them Jeff Bridges, Meryl Streep, Alexander Skarsgård and Katie Holmes) very little to do.  John Niven\u0027s Kill Your Friends is a blistering, debauched exploration into the life of a cocaine-sniffing record label agent. It passes by in the blink of an eye, which can\u0027t be said for its adaptation. The film, released in 2015, tries so hard to nail what Niven achieves so fluidly and it shows – the result is nothing short of embarrassing with the clean-cut Nicholas Hoult failing to convince as the sociopathic Steven Stelfox.2326 The Girl on the Train (2016)Although it will always exist in the shadow of Gillian Flynn’s ingenious thriller Gone Girl, The Girl on the Train is an undeniably pacy and intelligent novel. But it was completely let down by this US film adaptation. The 2016 release, starring Emily Blunt, is cheesy and lacking in nuance – and criminally takes the story away from its original gritty London setting, plonking the characters down in glossy New York for no apparent reason. The 2016 adaptation of Me Before You, starring Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin, was brutally panned by critics for being emotionally manipulative. Its bad acting and problematic premise didn\u0027t help, either. Clarke\u0027s performance as the paid companion to Claflin’s quadriplegic was in particular criticised for being offensively exaggerated.  While not the same calibre of flop as Dreamcatcher, The Dark Tower is a fine example of a botched attempt at adapting one of Stephen King\u0027s finest works. With Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey in the lead roles as the heroic and villainous characters caught in a fated tussle, it should have soared – but a rush job such as Nikolaj Arcel\u0027s 2017 film is no way to treat such an expansive piece of work. Despite magnetic performances from Saoirse Ronan and Billy Howle, this adaptation of Ian McEwan\u0027s On Chesil Beach was weighed down by a turgid script and clumsy old-age make-up. The finished product is worlds away from the McEwan adaptation that Ronan previously starred in –\u0026nbspthe Oscar-winning drama Atonement (2007).Dune was never going to be an easy book to turn into a two-hour action movie – and David Lynch’s attempt is proof that it should be best left alone.

The internet provides entirely new capabilities, and regulators need to think past the present day to ensure a level playing field.”The move follows a warning from the European Commission that there was “evidence of coordinated inauthentic behaviour aimed at spreading isive material on online platforms”, and that “malign actors constantly change their strategies”.Created with Sketch.Facebook birthday: 15 defining moments for the social network Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.On 4 Feb, 2004, 19-year-old Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg launched a website called \u0027TheFacebook\u0027 from his dorm.

Banning political ads on digital channels does feel like taking a step back to traditional media, so limiting the targeting of political ads seems like a better option for Facebook,” he told\u0026nbspThe Independent.\u0026nbsp“The question Facebook is asking is how far should businesses like Facebook be able to censor opinions and news?”Mark Zuckerberg’s secret plan to crush TikTokOne of those calling for Facebook to be more open and transparent about the spread of disinformation across the social network is the Open Knowledge Foundation, a non-profit organisation that promotes the sharing of free information.“Twitter’s decision is very welcome and sends a strong signal to other social media giants. It will go a considerable way to preventing the spread of disinformation and ‘fake news’,” said Catherine Stihler, chief executive of the Open Knowledge Foundation.However, she warned that more needs to be done to prevent disinformation campaigns from blighting the December’s election, forthcoming elections across Europe, and next year’s US Presidential election.“Facebook must act on the growing demands for greater transparency,” Ms Stihler added. “Social media giants must work to build a fair, free and open digital world.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I don’t know why. I think it’s because it’s always related to women.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“They never say feisty man, kid maybe, but I find it slightly insulting, I don’t know why. I want to find another word.”\u0026nbspScott and her co-host Matt Baker simply responded with a surprised “Oh”.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.The best TV shows of 2019 (so far) Show all 46Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Click through to see the best TV shows of 2019 (so far) “As a slightly cheesy reminder of what we love about Doctor Who – i.e. the fact it gives us an intergalactic eccentric in a big flappy overcoat shouting at Daleks  – this is a New Year treat that more than delivers” 346 Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland (BBC2)“Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland is a meandering look back over his life, career, and national identity – a “Proustian wander through Scotland”. There’s a lot of mordant chat about the weather, illustrated with shots of dark grey clouds above even darker grey lochs.” 446 The Paras: Men of War (ITV)“From the outset the production is elevated by its sensitive handling of the men – and the Paratroopers remain exclusively male – involved. These kinds of programmes have a tendency to fetishise toughness, lingering on assault courses and weaponry.”“Despite what some feared, the casting of Cumberbatch doesn’t simply flatter Cummings – the A-lister is too good a chameleon for that. But, inevitably, as he scrawls out his campaigning brainwaves on a whiteboard, there is a touch of that deductive maverick Sherlock in his portrayal of this scruffy, balding political saboteur.” 646 A Year of British Murder (Channel 4)“The programme-makers must have done much to win the confidence of so many friends and families, as they went through unspeakable personal pain but they repay that confidence with an understated and powerful film.” 746 The Secret Life of the Zoo (Channel 4)“This documentary goes behind the shrubbery to show off these animals and their s. The humans are a pretty exotic bunch too, judging by some of the lines they come out with.”“You see, saint or sinner, prince or pauper, we are all part of one race, the brotherhood of man. And the saintly and regal Danny Dyer stands as its finest ambassador.” “West believes Valjean to be “the greatest hero in all literature”, and he plays the part with all the care and intricacy such a character deserves.” 1046 Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil (BBC2)“For anyone who’s not altogether sure how British politics turned so suddenly into a rolling dumpster fire from which all exits are blocked then Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil is a necessary public service to explain exactly, and exactly how needlessly, we all came to be here.”“There’s really been nothing quite like Catastrophe on our screens before, and it deserves its cult status for the quality of everything the production team do, not least the stunning cinematography in this finale. Thanks, all. I’m glad Catastrophe died happy. “Yet again the Williams have woven a brilliantly tangled web, helped in no small part by Karyo’s quietly arresting central turn” “It is both a revisionist – and frequently batty – take on the caped milieu and a winningly knotty mystery. And it surely is the first big-budget superhero tale more indebted to Wes Anderson than to Stan Lee.” “Like all the best detective dramas, Shetland engages the audience in the very process of detection. That way we grow intrigued, and we care. And so we find ourselves sitting next to Henshall in his (prominently featured) Volvo V70 estate, sharing his thoughts, intercepting suspects and being driven off the road by unidentified enemies.” 1546 This Time with Alan Partridge* (BBC1)This Time with Alan Partridge is such a consistently strong creative achievement that fears for the future of Alan Gordon Partridge, may, once again, be allayed. Or Alayned, perhaps.” Michael Jackson has long looked like a burning tire yard. There were the allegations, the out-of-court settlements, the arrest, the trial and not-guilty verdict. But there has been nothing like Leaving Neverland” Home is a rather gentle, unobtrusive variation on the sitcom theme – but one that is built on a quite a bizarre premise. The twist is that a family who returns to Surrey from a holiday touring around France discover a Syrian refugee stuffed in the back of their SUV. Not only that, but, after a few moments of blind terrified panic about a suicide bombing, they eventually adopt him like he’s stray cat that’s just wandered in.1846 The Murder of Jill Dando (BBC)A tremendously sad, strange story then, and just as unfathomable today. Dando’s friends, family and the producer and director of the film have made a fitting and balanced tribute to her, something she deserves. I can’t really add anything to that.It is sometimes remarked that the Troubles in Northern Ireland make for an unpromising backdrop for a sitcom about adolescent kids. Well, yer man’s wrong, as they might say. Derry Girls, returning for a triumphant and exuberant second run, proves that humour, dark or otherwise, can be quarried from even the most unlikely of locations.While there are plenty of well-turned one-liners, the deeper attraction of Fleabag is schadenfreude. The character is as old as Daisy Buchanan or Lydia Bennett or Scarlett O’Hara. The best compliment to Waller-Bridge and her cast is that they find fresh clothes in which to dress these ancient monsters.2146 Road to Brexit (BBC)The Road to Brexit is easily the best thing to emerge from the whole brexit imbroglio. OK, not much competition, but still... Despite the po-faced title, you realise very quickly that it’s not yet another drama starring Benedict Cumberbatch or yet another attempt by Laura Kuenssberg to explain the inexplicable, or yet another show with the public arguing about stuff they don’t understand. Rather, it’s a very clever, very funny, very \u0027different\u0027 parcel of bollocks to Brexit.The footage is glorious, especially the side-on tracking shots of the birds and the hunting, where it is as if the cameramen were able to set up a rail along the ocean. Most spectacular of all is the sequence of a glacier collapsing into the ocean, where 75m tons of ice being sloughed off in less than 20-minutes. But at times Our Planet feels a little unfocused. Attenborough’s last big BBC series, Dynasties, won almost unbearable amount of emotional resonance through its focus on animal families. Our Planet is more of a greatest-hits parade, with overblown orchestral soundtrack and ponderous intonation. You can’t buy love, even if you pay for David Attenborough.2346 Line of Duty (BBC)Plausibility is a spectrum Bodyguard became ridiculous but Line of Duty stays just the right side, and as usual there is more plot in an hour than in whole series of other programmes. As well as being gripping entertainment, Line of Duty has become an effective examination of the relationship between the state and the inidual. The shadowy government forces are elected the organised crime gangs are fuelled by the drug trade. The police are there to save us from ourselves but can only do it if they are subjected to constant scrutiny. It’s exhausting work, policing the police.Joseph is almost never out of shot, whether seen from afar, contemplating a bottle of strong cider in a playground, or in visceral close-up, clutching his doner to his face. There are few actors you could trust with so much screen time, especially with such a pared back and naturalistic script. The fact any of it is remotely watchable is testament to Stephen Graham’s abilities. No man working in Britain today can drink a pint with more pathos.\u0027Good Omens is a hugely enjoyable, imaginative premiere, as close to Pratchett’s vision as anyone could have dared dream. And while the melancholy tone may not be for everyone, fans of the book will surely be sated.\u00272646 Years and YearsYears and Years, then, is favoured by some wit, a cornucopia of fab talent and promising characters. The dominant one as we continue our quest into the 2030s and beyond, will be Vivienne, or Viv, Rook, played brilliantly by Emma Thompson. As a bit of a long-term Emma-sceptic I was actually startled by how good she is in the role of the epitome of everything she has spent her life hating and campaigning against, for Viv is a horrifically nasty businessperson turned populist politician with the most terrifying of views. Viv Rook makes Ann Widdecombe look like, well, Emma Thompson at an Extinction Rebellion sit-in.As the series develops, it’s clearer than ever that Eve and Villanelle are more similar than they are different. Villanelle’s new vulnerability invites us to question what it is exactly she wants from Polastri. First time around she was toying with a more worthy adversary, but why now? Polastri, by contrast, is frayed around the edges, a terrible wife to her husband Nico (Owen McDonnell) and an even worse intelligence agent to her boss Carolyn Martens (Fiona Shaw). The script is still tight and the jokes are still there, as are Villanelle’s accents, outfits and abrupt killings, but without the will-theywon’t-they energy of the initial plot, it is harder to care.Timely, bleak, intelligent and compelling, Chernobyl is a triumph of a disaster.Season three\u0027s knuckle-whitening finale is far less disappointing than the last.The writing is sharp and well observed, probing the fault lines between small talk and real problems.A touching tribute to a flawed reality TV star.Despite the strength of its ensemble cast, Succession is a feat of writing above all. Although it is ostensibly a business show, you won’t learn much about the minutiae of media deals by watching it. Its key dynamic, between father and children, means that it is limited in the amount that can actually happen without risking the magic. The writers, led by the creator Jesse Armstrong, who also gave us Peep Show, weave just-about-plausible and sympathetic characters from a web of insults and backstabbing, and tight editing and camerawork ratchets up tension from a slow-moving plot.In Kathy Burke’s All Women on Channel 4, the unapologetic, effing-and-blinding, salt-of-the-earth actor meets lots of different women – from nuns to reality stars – to understand what it means to be a member of the fairer sex, so to speak, in 2019.So here we have an intriguing, but rather flawed sort of Big Brother thriller set in our contemporary world of digital snooping, near constant surveillance and (a topical touch) widespread use of facial recognition technology.Top Boy can be bleak and violent, with dialogue so naturalistic that it verges on the impenetrable, but in telling stories that rarely get heard, it asks us to think differently about the city we live in.Criminal uses its small canvas to ask big questions. The focus on these intricate dances means that after a while we begin to question the idea of objective truth, as well as the facts at hand. I have no idea if it is a realistic depiction of detective work, but it makes for gripping drama.3746 Tories at WarAfter an hour of Tories at War (Channel 4), I felt I had to get out into the fresh air and go for a walk. The foul language the visceral hatred the unbearable tensions the violence being inflicted on ancient institutions and this poor old knackered country by the Tories, as if with chainsaws and zombie knives – it was like watching my first Saw movie.3846 World on FireIn a TV world where too often we are encouraged to see the Nazis as warm and cuddly real people with emotions, it’s refreshing that they are here relegated back to pure baddies, strafing cafes, shooting surrendering fathers and generally being Nazi-ish about things.3946 Catherine the GreatAt last, an answer to the question, what could be more fabulous than Helen Mirren playing The Queen? Helen Mirren playing an empress, altogether madder, badder and more dangerous to shag. Better costumes, too.Sarah Phelps’s adaptation of crime writer Tana French’s novels finds two detectives trying to solve the murder of a young girl, with plenty of twists and turns.Romance is complicated, cathartic and messy, regardless of age or circumstance. But such uncomfortable realities are swept beneath the rug in John Carney’s rigorously whimsical new Amazon series. Modern Love is adapted from a New York Times column (it also spawned a hit podcast) and is as much a valentine to a fantasia vision of Manhattan as it is a dissection of the human heart.Damon Lindelof’s version of the beloved graphic novel is a compelling demonstration of what can happen when source material is treated with sensitivity and imagination.Arriving in the wake of Marvel’s Black Panther, the film highlights the links between the saga of the real-life Agoji women, who fought in the former Kingdom of Dahomey (located in modern-day Benin), and the all-women comic-book world protectors known as Dora Milaje.The writer Jack Thorne says his latest four-part drama, which explores the aftermath of a disaster on a small community, was shaped by the Grenfell Tower fire. Rather than overcrowded west London, his takes place in Glyngolau, a fictional run-down town in Wales. A new building project, The Light, is being built on the outskirts. It’s unclear what The Light is, exactly, which is deliberate. The point is not what it is, exactly, but what it represents: 1,000 new jobs and a rare moment of economic optimism for families who have forgotten what hope feels like.Watching Seven Worlds, One Planet, it’s hard to know what to worry about most: the future of wildlife – catastrophically imperilled by our fondness for fossil fuels, long-haul travel and convenience food – or Attenborough himself, now 93 and one of the few people that the world will listen to about the impending apocalypse. Like the species on whose behalf he speaks, his continued existence is vital for us all.Hailee Steinfeld is perfectly cast. She has a face – and a set of elastic expressions – that feels both well-suited to a period piece (as first displayed in her Oscar-nominated role in True Grit in 2010), and resolutely out of place in it. Just as Emily Dickinson was. Steinfeld crackles with charm and impropriety.Click through to see the best TV shows of 2019 (so far) “As a slightly cheesy reminder of what we love about Doctor Who – i.e. the fact it gives us an intergalactic eccentric in a big flappy overcoat shouting at Daleks  – this is a New Year treat that more than delivers” 346 Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland (BBC2)“Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland is a meandering look back over his life, career, and national identity – a “Proustian wander through Scotland”.

The foul language the visceral hatred the unbearable tensions the violence being inflicted on ancient institutions and this poor old knackered country by the Tories, as if with chainsaws and zombie knives – it was like watching my first Saw movie.3846 World on FireIn a TV world where too often we are encouraged to see the Nazis as warm and cuddly real people with emotions, it’s refreshing that they are here relegated back to pure baddies, strafing cafes, shooting surrendering fathers and generally being Nazi-ish about things.3946 Catherine the GreatAt last, an answer to the question, what could be more fabulous than Helen Mirren playing The Queen? Helen Mirren playing an empress, altogether madder, badder and more dangerous to shag. Better costumes, too.Sarah Phelps’s adaptation of crime writer Tana French’s novels finds two detectives trying to solve the murder of a young girl, with plenty of twists and turns.Romance is complicated, cathartic and messy, regardless of age or circumstance. But such uncomfortable realities are swept beneath the rug in John Carney’s rigorously whimsical new Amazon series. Modern Love is adapted from a New York Times column (it also spawned a hit podcast) and is as much a valentine to a fantasia vision of Manhattan as it is a dissection of the human heart.Damon Lindelof’s version of the beloved graphic novel is a compelling demonstration of what can happen when source material is treated with sensitivity and imagination.Arriving in the wake of Marvel’s Black Panther, the film highlights the links between the saga of the real-life Agoji women, who fought in the former Kingdom of Dahomey (located in modern-day Benin), and the all-women comic-book world protectors known as Dora Milaje.The writer Jack Thorne says his latest four-part drama, which explores the aftermath of a disaster on a small community, was shaped by the Grenfell Tower fire. Rather than overcrowded west London, his takes place in Glyngolau, a fictional run-down town in Wales. A new building project, The Light, is being built on the outskirts. It’s unclear what The Light is, exactly, which is deliberate. The point is not what it is, exactly, but what it represents: 1,000 new jobs and a rare moment of economic optimism for families who have forgotten what hope feels like.Watching Seven Worlds, One Planet, it’s hard to know what to worry about most: the future of wildlife – catastrophically imperilled by our fondness for fossil fuels, long-haul travel and convenience food – or Attenborough himself, now 93 and one of the few people that the world will listen to about the impending apocalypse. Like the species on whose behalf he speaks, his continued existence is vital for us all.Hailee Steinfeld is perfectly cast. She has a face – and a set of elastic expressions – that feels both well-suited to a period piece (as first displayed in her Oscar-nominated role in True Grit in 2010), and resolutely out of place in it. Just as Emily Dickinson was. Steinfeld crackles with charm and impropriety.The actor made similar comments in an interview with The Times in 2015, in which she\u0026nbspdenounced the use of the word “sassy” for women.Mirren was on the programme to discuss her forthcoming role\u0026nbspin the film The Good Liar, which she stars in alongside Ian McKellen.Catherine the Great\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Even one of the small number of ecclesiastical objects in the hoard appears to have been of a potentially military character.The hoard was made up of golden fittings from up to 150 swords, gold and garnet elements of a very high status seax (fighting knife), a spectacular gilded silver helmet, an impressive 30cm-long golden cross, a beautiful gold and garnet pectoral cross,\u0026nbspa probable bishop’s headdress – and parts of what is likely to have been a portable battlefield shrine or reliquary.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe extraordinarily ornate bishop’s headdress is the world’s earliest surviving example of high status ecclesiastical headgear.Dating from the mid-seventh century AD, its presence in an otherwise predominantly military hoard suggests that its ecclesiastical owner may well have been performing a supporting role on a battlefield.\u0026nbspSignificantly, the headdress bears no resemblance to later medieval or modern bishops’ mitres – and is therefore likely to trigger debate among historians as to its stylistic origins because it looks so\u0026nbspsimilar in basic design to headdresses believed by early medieval clerics to have been worn by biblical Jewish high priests and also resembles headdresses worn by pagan Roman priests.The discovery may therefore prompt scholarly speculation that the style of headwear worn by senior Christian priests in the early medieval period could have been at least partly inspired by perceived biblical precedent\u0026nbsp– or may even have been inherited from the\u0026nbsppagan Roman past.The headdress – made of beautifully crafted gold, inlaid with garnets and white and dark red glass – dates from the period when Christianity was being re-established across many of the local kingdoms that would eventually become England.It represents the status and prestige of the\u0026nbspChurch – but, significantly, it is decorated with\u0026nbsptypical pre-Christian Anglo-Saxon semi-abstract animal designs as well as seven Christian crosses.If indeed the archaeologists are right in believing it to be potentially an early-to-mid-seventh century bishop’s headdress, it would have been worn, perhaps during royal or other\u0026nbspceremonial events, by the first or second generation of clergy involved in the re-Christianisation of what is now England.The portable shrine – potentially presided over by the owner of the headdress or a similar senior cleric – was probably designed to be carried into battle on two horizontal poles (like a litter or later sedan chair) – in order to obtain God’s help in securing military victory.Only seven elements of the shrine, all made of gold, have survived.One element (probably part of a cross) bears a highly significant inscription – a quotation from the Book of Numbers. It reads “Rise up, LORD, and let thine enemies be scattered and let them that hate thee flee before thee”.Its biblical context is that of Moses uttering these words alongside the Ark of the Covenant accompanying the Israelites in their journey across the wilderness, threatened by hostile tribes. The nature of the inscription suggests that the precious shrine or reliquary (in Latin,\u0026nbsparca) had probably been used as a war talisman in the long and bitter conflicts between warring kingdoms in early Anglo-Saxon England.The ecclesiastical treasures and secularmilitary items appear to have been treated in a potentially disrespectful way before they were buried. They had been broken andor folded and deliberately bent out of shape.\u0026nbspBack in the mid-seventh century, southeast Staffordshire (the area near Lichfield where the material was found) was controlled by a powerful pagan Anglo-Saxon king called Penda.His geopolitical and military activity formed a major part of the bloodsoaked rivalry and conflict between his own kingdom (Mercia) and other, often Christian, kingdoms in other parts of England – especially in Northumbria and East Anglia.Given the probable mid-seventh century date of the burial of the treasure, it is therefore possible that it was war booty captured by the pagan Mercian king, Penda, from armies led by Christians, such as the East Anglians.\u0026nbspOne possible explanation is that the treasure was ritually buried as a Mercian pagan war trophy – perhaps even as a thanks offering to a pagan deity for delivering victory.Putting Christian material into the ground in such a way may have been seen by Penda (or an equivalent figure) as a spiritual or ideological victory over Christianity to mirror a military one.\u0026nbspThe 10-year investigation into the hoard has involved detailed scientific examination of the metalwork, exhaustive art historical assessment of the stylistic and iconographic aspects of the artefacts and research into the potential historical contexts of its burial.However, now that the material has been fully published, there is likely to be an ongoing debate as to the most likely historical narrative or narratives that led to so much gold and silver being buried almost 1,400 years ago in a field in Staffordshire.Scholars would love to know who originally owned the bishop’s headdress, the portable battlefield shrine and the golden helmet. But sadly the reality is that it may never be possible to definitively solve those particular mysteries.However, there are potential candidates for the sort of iniduals who may have been their original owners.At around the time that the headdress was made, East Anglia was being Christianised, by the area’s first bishop a French cleric called Felix. It is therefore conceivable that the headdress was commissioned by him.His successor as bishop was a man called Thomas, an East Anglian of possible Celtic British origin, and he would certainly be a candidate for the inidual the Mercians actually captured the headdress from – because he died, potentially in battle, around the time that the East Anglian kingdom was defeated by Mercia.\u0026nbspThe gilt silver helmet almost certainly belonged to an Anglo-Saxon royal figure.Staffordshire Hoard to stay in Britain for good“It potentially adorned the head of a king of East Anglia,” said one of the Staffordshire hoard book authors, archaeologist Chris Fern of the University of York.“It is even more spectacular than the famous early seventh century helmet unearthed at the Anglo-Saxon royal burial site at Sutton Hoo, Suffolk, 80 years ago.“Such helmets were the equivalents of royal crowns in Anglo-Saxon England,” said Mr Fern.But perhaps one of the most fascinating questions raised by the Staffordshire Hoard is what inspired the strikingly unusual design of the probable bishop’s headdress. Was it biblical precedent – or ancient Roman priestly headgear? If the latter, it would suggest a potentially significant additional aspect of continuity between pagan Imperial Rome and early medieval Christianity.One avenue of future research may well be linguistic rather than purely archaeological or historical.Despite the fact that\u0026nbspbishops are depicted bare-headed in Anglo-Saxon art, unpublished linguistic research by Anglo-Saxon clothing and textiles specialist Professor Gale Owen-Crocker suggests that early Anglo-Saxon bishops did indeed wear headgear known as a hufe.Her research suggests that the Latin word for a bishop’s hufe was flammeolum or flammeum. Intriguingly, the pagan Roman priests, whose headgear may potentially have been the original inspiration for the type of bishop’s headdress in the Staffordshire Hoard, were known as the Flamines – and that suggests a potential and tantalising link.The ecclesiastical material all appears to date from the second quarter of the seventh century – and to have been buried some time in the third quarter of that century.The Christian and secular artefacts are being described in full for the first time in the newly-published book\u0026nbspThe Staffordshire Hoard: An Anglo-Saxon Treasure.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe treasure is on display at Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery and The Potteries Museum and Art Gallery, Stoke on Trent. Although it is conceivable that it was interred for pagan ritual purposes, it is also possible that it was buried for safekeeping – and that its owners never returned to retrieve it.The research into the Staffordshire Hoard has been funded by Historic England.Its chief executive, Duncan Wilson, said: “The range of fascinating objects discovered has given us an extraordinary insight into Saxon craftsmanship and culture and this new monograph gives in-depth detail of everything we know about this spectacular discovery.”To supplement the newly published book, the public can now access a new online information and picture database about the Staffordshire Hoard.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

An AQI score between 0-50 is considered “good”, 401-500 is deemed “severe” and anything above 500 is termed a “severe-plus emergency” by the Indian government.Schools were ordered to suspend classes, as well as stopping any planned outdoors activities or sports matches.Diwali fireworks are not the main culprit of air pollution in DelhiLast elephant owner in Delhi hiding in city forest to evade policeDelhi riot police called in after parking row spirals into violenceDebris from Indian satellite blown up three months ago still in orbitDivided Delhi goes to polls in ‘battle of ideologies’Earlier in the day, Mr Kejriwal began the process of handing out 5 million free anti-pollution face masks at an event with school children, while blaming the crisis on the burning of agricultural waste in neighbouring states.“Delhi has turned into a gas chamber due to smoke from crop burning in neighbouring states. It is very imp that we protect ourselves from this toxic air,” he tweeted.Many media reports also blamed the smog on the lighting of fireworks for Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights, which was celebrated on Sunday.But factories, power stations and other major industrial processes also play a big part in contributing to the toxic air mix, and one which is rarely addressed by politicians.Scientists at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur said the overwhelming majority of Delhi’s pollutants come from within a 75km radius of the capital, and suggested that measures like Mr Kejriwal’s “odd-even” traffic scheme were being implemented too late.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Harry and Meghan went to Africa, with ITV, and made that trip all about their own anxieties and issues as well, without being half as engaging or sympathetic as Scarlett Moffatt.If anything, I think The British Tribe Next Door will also live longer in my memory than the royal version, not least because C seems to have got more than it bargained for with the Himba, who clearly aren’t big on marital fidelity.Some of the men are already looking to pick off Scarlett from the back of the Moffatt herd and episode one ended with this tantalising offer, from one of the women to her mum.“Betty, let us swap husbands tonight.” .So my interest in this show is now over.DAVID ATTENBOROUGH’S Seven Worlds, One Planet lived up to the usual visually stunning expectations for nearly an hour on Sunday night on BBC.A couple of cute baby animals won their struggle for le, two gender-fluid gastropods had it off at the bottom of the Antarctic Ocean and a bull elephant seal on South Georgia discovered: “cm of blubber is protection against the cold, but not from a four-ton opponent” – a bit like Tess Holliday did when Piers Morgan went for her on Twitter.The environmental message was also conveyed, in no uncertain terms, as the seas warmed, glaciers melted and an albatross chick almost got blown to buggery.Then,  minutes into the show, we were suddenly back on South Georgia, with Rolf the seasick cameraman, who was in front of the lens this time and so overcome by the fate of the penguins, and the future of the planet, he began sobbing like Rylan Clark-Neal just after Nicole Scherzinger had put him through to live shows.All the most pointless, virtue-signalling extinction rebels in the country were probably joining in with this gesture as well, even though it’s a moot point as to how close we are exactly to environmental Armageddon.What you can say with a little more certainty, though, is that the moment it starts trying to turn a David Attenborough documentary into an X Factor sob story it’s probably the beginning of the end for the BBC.THE Last Leg, Adam Hills: “Out of ­interest, what would we all dothis ­fabulous industry we’re in fell through for us and we had to go and find a job ”Have you ever considered comedy X Factor: Celebrity, Jenny Ryan: “It’s time for me to share what I’ve got with the world.”Jonathan Ross: “He’s the host of the very funny Mash Report. He’s a fabulous stand-up, Nish Kumar.”And X Factor: Celebrity, Simon Cowell to No Love Lost: “For all the doubters who thought this was going to be a car crash, you’ve proved a point.”It’s a car crash.Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “The term Martians refers to the supposed inhabitants of which planet ”Lucie: “Pass.”The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “What Champion­ship team was originally called The Wednesday Football Club ”Orchid: “Tottenham Spurs.”Ben Shephard: “Which th Century military conflict is also known as The Great War ”Ben Shephard: “In a classic novel by Johanna Spyri, what is the name of the orphan sent to live with her grandfather in the Swiss Alps ”Steph: “Anne Frank.”CHANNEL  disclaimer of the week: “Be prepared right from the very start for graphic scenes of consensual bondage, sadomasochism, dominant and submissive sexual activity, dangerous procedures which only trained professionals should try, nudity and offensive language, all of which are likely to disturb some viewers.”And what an episode of Toot The Tiny Tugboat that was.SATURDAY’S first live episode of X Factor: Celebrity was an assault on two of your senses.The show now looks like it’s set in the display ring of a Herefordshire livestock market, but sounds more like the local abattoir during “Sunday roast” rush hour.Seriously, you dub Jenny Ryan or Ricki Lake singing Stevie Nicks’ Landslide, over a Peta video, the whole country would turn vegan by Monday morning.The miracle of the night, though, was BBC Religion Editor Martin Bashir, who was comfortably worse than both those two and sang like he’d been grabbed nuts-first backstage by Vinnie Jones, yet still got saved by Cowell and Nicole Scherzinger ahead of an understandably inconsolable Olivia Olson.The explanation, I think, lies in the fact Martin brings the precious gt of comedy to X Factor: Celebrity, hopping and skipping across the stage, in his Harold Lloyd get-up, to an old Bert Kaempfert classic.It presented a critical problem, though, for the clearly smitten Cowell, who’d been on the verge of saying the wrong thing all night, but provided the perfect assist on this occasion.“If you recognise that song . . .”Then seriously well done and Danke Schoen, Martin.TV GOLD: Will Sharpe’s scene-stealing performance as Rodney the rent boy in BBC’s engrossing drama Giri Haji.The albatross chick hauling itself back on to a nest and a penguin seal stand-off, from BBC’s Seven Worlds, One Planet.

In post-Brexit Britain, the key swing voter is “Workington Man” — a typically white man over  who didn’t go to university and voted to Leave.Until recently he was dyed-in-the-wool Labour. Corbyn’s neglect of the working class means he might, for the first time, vote Tory.To win him round, the Conservatives must promise more than the economic freedoms and tax giveaways they are known for.They need to offer protection from a modern world in which liberalising economic policies, globalisation and immigration have undermined work, wages and community.Nearly three in four voters think it has become harder for people like them to make a decent living, so any manesto worth its salt will put ending low pay and insecure work at its heart.For the half of school leavers who lag behind without degrees, the Conservatives should ert funding from low quality university degrees towards technical education.The Tories also need to reassess their long-held devotion to tax cuts. While the cost of living is a problem, the level of taxation doesn’t seem to be.Two thirds of people want investment in the NHS, schools and social care rather than income tax cuts. This may be because households are squeezed more by rent, commuting and childcare than taxes.But people simply don’t believe politicians any more when they offer tax cuts. Instead, the Brexit idend should be focused on improving AEs and classrooms.Building local nurseries, bringing empty and foreign-owned homes into use, and boosting family budgets will win votes.Most of all, the Conservatives need to restore a greater sense of belonging.Think of your own town — the high street is probably in disrepair, libraries and buses have gone, pubs and post offices are closing. Crime is everyone’s concern. The social fabric is fraying and people feel it.New funding for high streets and towns is a start, but why not help communities take over post offices, pubs and football clubs when they go out of business, as we do for schools, or introduce a national civic service for school leavers Labour’s abiding strength is the basic sense that their politics is about looking out for others.But Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour cares more about ending control of immigration and re-running the  referendum than protecting working people.This is the only way he can reach into Labour’s heartlands to win seats like Wigan, Dewsbury and Workington, places that seek security and community over freedom and inidualism.Workington has never ed a Conservative MP in a general election.

Let’s hope history doesn’t repeat itself.For the past three years, our useless political class has pulled every trick to try to stop Brexit. PM Boris Johnson, desperate to end the gridlock, has now shamed these democracy-blockers into holding a general election. It’s a risky move.The electoral system is skewed against the Conservatives. Butopinion polls are right — andBoris can inspire ­voters with his optimism and brio — Brexit really might be unblocked by Christmas. At last!Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, after weeks of political constipation, took a dose of prune juice yesterday and, amazingly, reached a decision. Did you see his face afterwards  Pure relief. He hadn’t been that happy for months.Finally he had seen off the shroud-waving, do-nothing, block-everything Blairite Remainers in his parliamentary party — among them his ­deputy, Tom Watson.They had wanted to keep commie Corbyn swinging in the wind for a few more months. They were still ­moaning last night that he had blown this anti-Brexit ­Parliament’s last chance of securing a second referendum.Corbyn’s repeated refusals to go to the country were making him look like a politician who was scared of the people. Reaction on the doorsteps to his indecision was terrible. No wonder he finally caved.Butthe Labour leader ­yesterday seemed liberated, there were plenty on his ­Commons benches who were aghast at the idea of an ­election in December.“It’ll be too dark!” they wailed. “It’ll be too cold! People will be too busy preparing for Christmas! The students won’t be at university any more!”Too dark and too cold  Does that mean we should only ever have general elections in high summer It was even put about that Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill had advised Boris against calling a mid- December election because church halls would have been booked for school nativity plays.Now I’m as soft as any ­doting dad about kiddies dressing up to play Joseph and Mary but sorry, a general ­election to free our country from this Brexit impasse really might be more important.Why were some MPs so ­miserable yesterday  Most obviously, it was because lots of them think they’ll lose their seats. Anyone with a majority of fewer than , will ­probably be feeling twitchy, particularlyhe or she spent the last three years resisting the ­public’s will on Brexit.Money was another factor. Fighting an election is ­expensive for MPs. They not only lose their Westminster income once ­Parliament is dissolvedbut they also have to dig into their pockets for expenses and ­election costs.All those leaflets, all that petrol and shoe leather, all those late-night takeaways with volunteers — the sums soon add up. A Tory MP once told me that an election campaign cost him £,.But Parliament needs rebooting. At the  election, both Labour and the Conservatives promised to respect the Leave vote — and they duly won most of the seats.But Labour broke that ­promise, as the antics of ­Corbyn, Keir Starmer, Hilary Benn and Co showed. Leave voters in Labour seats are less likely to be fooled a second time.The one unknown in the election will be Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party. Could it yet lose the election for Boris by taking votes away from the pro-Brexit Tories  What an own goal that would be.Ben Bradshaw, arch- Remainer Labour MP for Exeter, called yesterday’s ­election moves “outrageous”. We were at a “critical juncture for our country”. He plainly thought that only MPs should have a say.Keep the unwashed voters where they belong, eh, Ben  Barry Sheerman, another Remainer Labour MP, professed himself “puzzled and deeply disappointed” by Corbyn’s support for an election.Sheerman feared “the elderly” would not be able to get to polling stations on a December day. Mr Sheerman himself is . If we all took his patronising attitude, we might ask how the old dearie manages to totter down to Westminster from his Huddersfield constituency every week.At such an advanced age, how does Barry remember to tie his laces, let alone make his terrible speeches in the Commons  But no one does ask that, thank goodness, because we do not treat older people like ­simpletons.On Monday Labour MP Seema Malhotra fretted about students losing their right to vote in a December election because they might have ended their college terms by then and have moved back home.  She called this “voter ­suppression”.Oh come off it. She and her Remainer mates were the only ones trying to “suppress” voters — by trying to prevent a ­clearout of this rotten House of Commons.Former Labour MP John Mann shouted: “It’d solve you — you’d lose your seat.” And not just Soubry. Lots of these anti-democrats are now at the mercy of the real bosses of British politics — the voters.I think we’ll just about ­manage to get to the polling station, don’t you Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Their “people’s vote” would be history.Boris will then pump billions into our police, schools and NHS and keep taxes low enough to carry on creating jobs, as the Tories have since .Corbyn is the least popular political leader in UK history. A dangerous fool loathed even by many Labour MPs.Some have repeatedly denounced him as an anti-Jewish racist, yet they will now knock on doors urging voters to put him in Downing Street. Their “principles” were always a pose.As things stand Corbyn is only likely to win power with the connivance of the Lib Dems and SNP.Which means both a second Brexit referendum — unless they simply order him to revoke Article  — and a second Scottish independence referendum. A Corbyn era would guarantee horric ision for years.That’s before you consider the economic meltdown inevitable in installing a Marxist in Downing Street — impacting everyone’s job, home, savings and pension.Or the chilling threat to ­national security of a hard-left anti-nuclear pacist who considers Britain’s terrorist enemies his “friends”.That’s why Labour tried in vain today to secure votes for children and EU citizens. But polls don’t tell the whole story.Each seat will be split on Leave Remain lines as well as Tory Labour Lib Dem. Those the Tories could lose are easier to pinpoint than the dozens of new ones they must win.Nigel Farage has a huge decision. Only a Boris majority will deliver Brexit. The Brexit Party can be a help or a hindrance. If Boris loses, Brexit is lost too.He has no majority to fend them off or to govern. Parliament is beyond repair.

But something even more important is at stake.Do we want to continue to live with the free-market economy that has given us wealth unimaginable a century ago  Or do we want to be sucked backwards into the failed socialist experiment that impoverished Eastern Europe in the second half of the th century and has laid waste to Venezuela Labour has yet to produce the radical manesto Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell promised yesterday but we already know there is going to be a hike in income tax for those earning over £, a year — and probably a swingeing wealth tax, given McDonnell’s past enthusiasm for the idea.McDonnell, too, has said he would expropriate ten per cent of the shares of every British company and put them in a fund supposedly for the benefit of the workers — although when you read the small print, workers would receive a maximum of £ in idends per year, with the rest going straight into the Government’s coffers.That measly £ would do little to compensate for the collapse in value of pension funds as Labour nationalised water and electricity companies at below the market value of their shares.Many of those shares are owned by funds on which you and I rely for our retirement.The Shadow Chancellor promises that under Labour, we will only have to work a four-day, -hour week, apparently with no cut in pay. We might as well put Alice In Wonderland in charge of the economy. His sums simply don’t add up.McDonnell says he will increase the National Living Wage to £ an hour.

What was meant to be a coronation nearly turned into a wake. Many Conservatives fear the polls could turn sharply again.But there is scant sign Boris Johnson will repeat Mrs May’s abysmal campaign. His three months in office have brought a change in the weather. We have a Prime Minister who exudes optimism rather than a sense of defeat.While May seemed almost embarrassed to be a Conservative and tried to out-do Labour for proposing the most unappealing tax rise — the “dementia tax” — Johnson has made the case for capitalism and conservatism.The first of those, he rightly points out, pays for the public services we all value so much.He has promised to rebuild hospitals and reverse the cuts in police numbers that took place on Mrs May’s watch.He knows the way to improve the lot of people on low incomes is not to boost benefits but to increase earnings through a higher ­National Living Wage.But he also recognises middle-income groups have suffered disproportionately from the tax system in recent years and has proposed raising the threshold for the  per cent tax rate.While Corbyn and McDonnell would undermine livelihoods by cutting working hours, Johnson’s Tories will encourage us to work and to invest — in our homes, in pensions and savings. Rather than threaten businesses with confiscating shares, he promises better infrastructure, especially broadband.Boris doesn’t just want to get Brexit done, as Remainer Mrs May did.He wants to turn it to Britain’s advantage, opening our economy to the world beyond the EU, with new trade deals to bring in investment.While Mrs May created a hostile environment for migrants, Johnson has indicated a more welcoming attitude towards those who want to come to Britain to work.But more than that, it is a battle between enterprise and overbearing State control, between having the freedom to invest for your future and having your assets confiscated, between the opportunity to work and having your working hours laid down by the Government.It is a cliche to say we face the most important election in decades.

A council parking attendant.Although the venue did hold a masked ball event — which fans think was so Banksy could attend in person without being pictured.Robert Del NajaMassive Attack songwriter Robert Del Naja, also known as D, was suspected to be Banksy — after it was thought DJ Goldie had accidentally outed him.Del Naja was a graffiti artist in Bristol before becoming a famous musician.In what would be a strange double-bluffhe was Banksy, Del Naja  was even praised by Banksy for his street art in a  interview.But in , gold-toothed Goldie was being interviewed on a podcast when he said: Give me a bubble letter and put it on a t-shirt and write Banksy on it and were sorted, we can sell it now.No disrespect to Rob, I think hes a brilliant artist. I think he has flipped the world of art over.Listeners believed the Rob Goldie referred to was Del Naja, but the singer has denied the claims.However, an even more intriguing theory also keeps Del Naja in the picture.Collective of artistsSome theorists reckon that Banksy, whose work has popped up all over the world, is actually a group of people instead of just one bloke.In , Scottish journalist Craig Williams theorised that Banksy could actually be a collective of artists working together under one name.He also said Robert Del Naja might be the head of such a group, citing his public friendship with Banksy and similarities in Massive Attack tour dates and the places where Banksy works have appeared.Williams wrote: A multi disciplined artist in front of one of the seminal groups in recent British history, doubling up as the planets most revered street artist.Now that would be cool.This idea of fictional artists actually came up again concerning the next suspect on our list.Thierry Guetta aka Mr BrainwashBanksys  documentary Exit Through The Gt Shop followed the bizarre rise of French artist Mr Brainwash.It was so far-fetched that some speculated that the whole thing was a ruse, and that Mr Brainwash was actually a character invented by Banksy.And, as part of the hoax, it was even reckoned that the seemingly oblivious artist who becomes an overnight success in the film was Banksy himself.But Mr Brainwash has continued to deny that he is Banksy or that his meteoric rise in the art-world was staged.Although he did mysteriously tell the LA Times: In the end, I became [Banksys] biggest work of art.Hooded man in MelbourneThe caped crusader was thought to have been caught in the act a second time in Australia in .A woman calling herself Mia S uploaded a clip to YouTube showing a graffiti artist spraying a wall in Melbourne.When she looks at his work, its signed Banksy, so she shouts out the famous street scrawlers name.But he tells her to f**k off and runs off into the night.Banksys publicist said the artwork was fake and the clip was a publicity stunt — but sceptics think this could be a  denial from Banksys team.Hooded man in BristolAnd thats not the only time Banksy has supposedly been caught on camera.Two years ago, grainy video footage resurfaced of a man spraying an underpass in Banksys native Bristol.It shows him arrive on a bicycle, spray the wall, and then clear off.The work — called Lights, Camera, Vandalism — was created for the Sunday Times Magazine in .Its thought a member of the artists team filmed the painting as part of the project.Robin GunninghamIn , the name Robin Gunningham emerged as the identity of a graffiti artist pictured in Jamaica, who was believed to be Banksy.Details of Gunninghams past, confirmed by people he attended school with and publicly available information, tallied with what was already known about the elusive artist.At the time, representatives for Banksy refused to confirm or deny that he was Gunningham - a Bristol native who attended the citys fee-paying Cathedral School.Then in , the plot thickened when researchers from Queen Mary University used geographic profiling to try and unmask Banksy.The technique paired locations which Gunningham had ties to with the sites of Banksy artworks, proving he was the most likely candidate.The Sun also previously reported that Banksy checked into a hotel in  under the name Robin.But despite the gallery of evidence, Banksy has never unveiled his true identity – and who the artist really is remains to be seen.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They thoughtit really looked too bad, I could just cover it with my shoes.Seeking a reversal of fortune, Ajun sought out expert advice at Shunde Heping Surgical Hospital in the city of Foshan.His doctor, Wu Xiang, said: Its very rare to see such a serious deformity having not been treated in a -year-old patient.Doctor Wu added: Other hospitals wouldve just removed his outermost extra toes. That wouldve been the easiest solution, but it wouldnt look the best.His most natural looking toe is on the outside, so we decided to migrate it inwards to its most ideal position, replacing his fth digit and creating a new big toe.Doctor Wu and his team spent nine hours in surgery to create Ajuns new left foot.The young man revealed he was pleased with the results.He said: I stopped wearing sandals outside since my third year of primary school.Ive never had a girlfriend because Im so imperfect. I never thought Id find anyone who wants to be with me.Now I feel great. Im very grateful to Doctor Wu Xiang.I think my foot is perfect. He showed me pictures of my foot after surgery, and Im very happy.Ajun is continuing his recovery at the hospital and is expected to be discharged in the coming weeks.Surgery can happen as early as one year old, but no later than six years old.

No debate.This extremism is feeding into real-le events, including the campaign for next month’s General Election. Just look at the Labour Party and its leader Jeremy Corbyn.Despite presenting himself as a kind and compassionate old bean, Corbyn and most MPs in the current Labour Party thrive on presenting society as a fight between “good” and “evil”, the “few” and “many”, with people like bankers and Tories in the latter group.At every chance they demonise anyone who strays from the progressive orthodoxy.Labour’s shouty MP David Lammy even took this philosophy so far as to compare Jacob Rees-Mogg’s hard Brexit European Research Group to “Nazis” and “apartheid”.In reality, they are simply politicians who have dferent views to him.But such extreme rhetoric has become normalised among Labour. You are either on their side of the argument, or you are a fascist.Labour’s polarised world view is encapsulated in its utterly bonkers set of policies.Any sensible government knows that economic reform takes time, and is often about compromise and improving existing structures.But Labour wants to tear everything down and start again, with private schools being top of the list — no doubt because MPs have a vendetta against Etonians.Corbyn also wants to abolish Universal Credit, despite having no tangible plan for its replacement.Universal Credit is the perfect example of where Labour goes wrong. The system has had teething issues but the answer is not to burn it down, it is to make slow improvements.There are other huge, sweeping pledges the party has made, such as nationalising the railways, water, energy and mail, seizing a ten per cent stake in every private company with more than  staff and having a target of net zero for carbon emissions by .Experts have suggested this could lead to meat being rationed, cars confiscated and the wholesale closure of industries .Who cares, though,it gets Labour in charge!Much of the reason Labour has set upon these radical policies is because shaking up the system is always incredibly exciting for the young, particularlyit looks like it might bring about a few freebies.And let’s face it, it is no surprise that millennials and their younger counterparts can be enticed.They have had a rough ride since the  financial crisis, absorbing the shock of the recession and being decades away from home ownership.It is no wonder they think socialism is the answer, especially as it plays into the woke mindset of there being simple, binary solutions to everything.This is why it is so important that young people actually take on what Obama was saying about the world.The Government has to make large numbers of deeply complex decisions, where there cannot always be winners.Almost always someone will lose out in the intricate interplay that is political decision-making.There needs to be more acceptance of a Margaret Thatcher-style realism: That le is not fair.That is something youngsters do not seem to grasp these days, believing equalities can be remedied with the magic wand of socialism.Strong, long-lasting policies do not make sexy soundbites like “For the many”, nor can they be advertised in protests outside Parliament Square.

What we do has to be secret by the nature of it.“But it’s great to be able to lt the veil on occasion, and show we’re just ordinary people, living in the same places everyone  does, and have played a key part in keeping the country safe over the last  years.”GCHQ also reveal some of the crucial intelligence breakthroughs made in them that saved countless lives.Two of World War Twos’ most important discoveries took place at Ivy Farm, deep in the Kent countryside not far from the M.There, staff cracked what strange ‘noise’ was that had been heard over radiowaves – a highly encrypted teleprinter that Adolf Hitler used to communicate with his field marshals across Europe.The site was also intercepted a fax for the first time, used by the Luftwaffe to reveal bomber squadron formations to the Japanese military so they could better attack the US Air Force.Deep in central London’s club land was  Chesterfield Street, an anonymous town house that is now home to the Bahamas High Commission.For years, it was GCHQ’s nerve centre for Cold War operations, where all soviet targets were worked on by  staff.Standing on top of the White Clfs of Dover was Abbots Clf House, where  female wireless operators intercepted VHF communications from Berlin directing its E-boats in the English Channel.Today, GCHQ has just four sites that it publicly declares – its doughnut HQ in Cheltenham, listening posts in Bude and Scarborough, and the National Cyber Security Centre in Victoria.Leading tributes to the silent spies on the service’s th birthday, PM Boris Johnson said: “GCHQ has been home to some of the brightest people in the country who quietly, and without fanfare, work day and night to keep us safe“Our centenary is a chance to celebrate those achievements and to thank those men and women who have given themselves to this work.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Children were expected to amuse themselves — parenting was not even a word.But then I discovered the books of Roald Dahl, and they transported me somewhere . It was when I first discovered the power of stories, something that has carried me through everything I have gone on to do. I could not have known then that one day I would be writing stories for kids myself. I did not wake up one day and decide to be a children’s writer.It came about when my son Ezra, now , asked me why Harry Potter did not just run away from the Dursleys, the Muggle family he lived with, when he was not at Hogwarts. His question got me thinking and it dawned on me it would be a good idea to write a book for children where they could choose their parents, which resulted in The Parent Agency.I enjoyed writing it and it was very successful, so I wrote more. I’m now on my sixth book and recently had the privilege of reading it to children at Fitzjohn’s Primary School in North London. It is called The Taylor Turbochaser and tells the story of -year-old Amy Taylor, who is disabled after losing the use of her legs in an accident.I did not consciously think, “I’m going to write about a child in a wheelchair”. For me the story comes first. I had an ide about a girl who loved cars, and thought it would add another dynamicshe was in a wheelchair because that would create obstacles and therefore make the story richer and more complicated.I do not think messages in kids’ books should be too upfront as it can make them dull — although ersity in kids’ books is important because it represents the world we live in. Amy is not defined by her disability. She is bright and sparky but just happens to be in a wheelchair. Humour is vital in encouraging kids to read. If you can turn something that is potentially a chore into a joy then you are halfway there.AS a child, I was a big fan of Cat In The Hat author Dr Seuss. He wrote: “The more that you read, the more things you will know.“The more that you learn, the more places you’ll go.”What has become a lelong love of books began when my parents read me Dr Seuss’s Grinch stories. And as a parent I continued the cycle by reading to my two daughters.You don’t need me to tell you that reading for pleasure is a good thing.It opens doors to new worlds – down the rabbit hole, through the wardrobe door – in the company of characters who will become friends for le, such as Harry, Hermione and Ron.Books fire a child’s imagination, boost their vocabulary and help set them up for the rest of their livesThat’s why we put such an emphasis on reading in schools. So it’s fantastic to see The Sun’s free Books For Schools programme.These book boxes contain a treasure trove and are perfect for a child to read independently or with their parents.We need all our children reading books for pleasure and this is a great way for them to start.As the Big Friendly Giant might say: “This is where all dreams is beginning.”You should not talk down to children when you write for them. By eight they have a pretty sophisticated sense of humour. Children are much funnier nowadays than previous generations. They have access to the internet and some very funny TV shows.The Amazing World Of Gumball, which airs on Cartoon Network, is the funniest programme ever. Children have the ability to understand complex situations and you do not need to sanitise issues because it makes you as an adult uncomfortable. They are good at filtering out things that do not apply to them and accept discomfort better than many adults do I know there are plenty of challenges when it comes to getting kids reading.My children, Ezra and Dolly, who is now , went to state schools and I know first hand as a parent the challenges that schools face with regards to having decent facilities. But access to lots of dferent types of books is vital for youngsters. Reading well makes a massive dference to their lives in every area.Then there was Roald Dahl’s Charlie And The Chocolate Factory, which I now recognise as a must-readyou want to write for kids. I am so lucky that I have been able to make a living out of telling stories, and that all stems back to the books I read as a child. Without that, I do not know what  I would have done.IT’S simple to start. All primary schools need to do is visit thesun booksforschools before Friday, November .For more information, pick up The Sun.Later this month we’ll start printing tokens in the paper for schools and parents to collect.Once they reach the target, we’ll send out a bumper pack of  Collins Big Cat books, suitable for kids in Reception and Year .Schools can register at thesun booksforschools Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailToday Patrick Tucker will deliver parcels from am to am. A -hour day. “I worked for three hours yesterday before I made a penny because of everything I’m paying out,” he says. “Often I’m working a really long day to make £ or £ profit.” The only things that stop Patrick working are when he’s gone over the mileage limit on the van – meaning he is charged more to drive it. And exhaustion. “If you’re too tired you just can’t stay awake at the wheel,” he says. “People get to a point where they can’t keep their eyes open. We shouldn’t be risking our lives to go to work.” Ken Loach’s searing new film Sorry We Missed You, is the story of millions of Patricks told through the eyes of one family, the Turners. The couple are double-waged through the gig economy – dad Ricky as a courier van driver, and his we Abbie as a ­conscientious carer whose emotionally and physically draining work doesn’t remotely fit into neat -minute visits. As the treadmill gets ever faster, the stress and financial strain builds ­intolerably, slowly pulling apart the fabric of their family.   HOSTILITY“We spoke to many Patricks making the film,” Ken says, speaking as Sorry We Missed You is about to hit cinemas. “These people never stop working, yet they can’t make ends meet.” Set in Newcastle, like I, Daniel Blake, the film carries many echoes of Loach’s masterpiece about the ­brutalisation of social security. “We felt asthe Turners could be the family on the next street, around the corner from Daniel Blake,” Ken says. “The films go together in many ways because when we were in the foodbanks researching I, Daniel Blake, we found so many there were in work – hungry because of the gig economy.” Like Tory immigration policy and the welfare state, this is another hostile environment where workers denied breaks urinate in plastic bottles. “It’s not capitalism failing, it’s capitalism working,” Ken says. Sorry We Missed You is the shameful story of so many precarious workers whose stories we’ve told in this column. The mothers working hours after giving birth or delivering parcels the day of their dad’s funeral. But most of all, it’s told in memory of the late Don Lane, the man who Ken spoke so movingly about last week on Question Time. A -year-old van driver, Don was diabetic but fined £ a day when he went to hospital appointments. On those days he earned nothing but still had to pay for his van. So, he started missing hospital appointments to avoid getting further into debt.    “He collapsed and died,” Ken says. “Now you tell me that’s justied, you tell me that’s right – that a worker is so terried to have a day off for sickness because he will be fined and he dies. That’s the gig economy, that’s what it’s doing to working people.” Loach’s genius over many years, from Kes in  to Raining Stones in  and now, has been to hold a mirror up to lives held back by exploitation and poverty. Sorry We Missed You exposes the shiny new world of the gig economy as the same old abuse of power by venal corporate interests.The film comes out today with ­critical timing – just as Britain faces a general election .This, after all, is the outsourced, zero hour Britain the Tory government has been building since .And it could be their greatest vulnerability at the ballot box because Labour has promised to radically ­overhaul the system.“Ricky is the victim of bogus self-employment,” Ken says of the film.“And the good thing is Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell understand exactly how that is working and how to put a stop to it.They also know that one way to solve Ricky’s problem is to take the post office back into public ownership and use that instead of private delivery companies. Meanwhile, for carers like Abbie, those social care jobs need to come back under direct employment, to the NHS,” Ken says. “This is what Labour will do.” "},{"url":null,"title":"tories quietly vote through change","story":"NewsTories quietly vote through change that could gerrymander general electionsLabour said the change to the annual canvass, which checks the electoral roll ahead of general elections, could hit poorer and marginalised groupsShareCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  NOV NewsIn future, councils will no longer need to send an annual canvass form by post to all households \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Instead they will be allowed to take a light-touch approach that focuses on homes most likely to have seen a change, and also uses methods like e-mails and phone calls. The move, which is expected to save £m over  years, was voted through the House of Commons - last night with no debate thanks to the backing of Conservative MPs. A watchdog said it would improve efficiency. But Labour said there is a risk poorer or under-represented groups could be left behind and the move shouldnapost be rushed through. A party source said they were only told about the vote the day before, when many MPs were on the election campaign. Only  Labour MPs were there to oppose it.   Cat Smith, Labour’s Shadow Minister for Voter Engagement, said: Labour supports reviewing the current model of the annual canvass of electors with the aim of making it easier and cheaper to administer, especially at a time when Electoral Registration Officers are facing increasingly squeezed budgets. “However, it is essential that any changes do not jeopardise the primary purpose of the annual canvass, which is to ensure that the electoral register is as accurate as possible.“We are very concerned that there is a real risk that the proposed reform will have a detrimental impact on the accuracy of the register, particularly for under-represented groups.“This is a very signicant and complicated piece of legislation that requires proper scrutiny, and shouldn’t be rushed through days before we embark on a General Election campaign.The move would not affect the December  election but would affect future elections.    The Electoral Commission said in July that the reforms should result in greater efficiency as council officers grapple with limited resources. But the watchdog warned: However, the success of canvass reform is highly dependent on new data-sharing mechanisms and careful planning and implementation activities being completed in good time ahead of the start of the  annual canvass, which will commence from July .

Louise and Philip Upton bought the Bellway property in Stafford in February for £,.But in the nine months since then, they have spotted problem after problem, reports Stoke-on-Trent Live.The couple - who have four children aged two to nine - decided to have a professional snagging survey carried out. This flagged up more than  problems, ranging from minor imperfections such as cracked tiles to things that breach building regulations and cause safety issues such as not sealing around the flue. Has your new-build dream home got dozens of flaws  Email webnews@mirror    They have been tackling a third of the list themselves. But now the family are calling for snagging surveys to be made mandatory to prevent other people going through the same experience. The Uptons say money should be held back after completion as an incentive for builders to ‘get it right’ in the first place. Louise, , said: “You fall in love with a place and don’t notice some of these things until you’ve moved in. We would never have expected this buying a new build. It’s been an absolute nightmare and you start regretting how much you’ve done and spent on it.    “We paid £ for a professional snagging survey as we had lost faith and think ‘what  have we missed’. They spent half a day here and found  things, but they hadn’t seen everything and, on top of that, we keep finding more. “You feel like you’re picky, but this is our family home and is going to be for the rest of our lives – or that’s what we thought. It’s something that was meant to be an exciting time, but it’s not. The stress that we’ve gone through has been awful. It’s been one of the worse times of my le and it’s reflected on our kids.” Philip, aged , added: “The worrying thing is the builders are under so much pressure to finish that they’re rushed, and problems stem from that.    “Although some of the issues have been rectied, we continue to suffer from obvious defects that should have been picked up and rectied before we moved in. “Because it’s new, people expect no issues. Some of the problems are petty and minor, but we want to make people aware of the experience we’ve had. “We were excited to get in and, don’t get me wrong, we still like the house now, but we are regretting it.

But there was almost an unfortunate moment during her meeting with the Pope back in  after she was given some very bad advice from her staff. Luckily her now dressmaker Angela Kelly was brought up Catholic so knew the etiquette of meeting him, and took steps to make sure she had a back-up plan for the big day. Recalling the occasion in her new book The Other Side of the Coin, she explains that the Queenaposs advisors wanted the the Monarch to wear a bright day dress for the occasion.    She writes: Straight away, I knew this would be a mistake. Having been brought up Catholic, I knew instinctively that a day dress would not be appropriate for meeting with His Holiness. She tried to warn the advisors that this wasnapost right, pointing out that the Queen had only ever worn smart black outfits for previous visits, but they werenapost having any of it. So she went straight to the Queen, saying as always, the Queen listened but the monarch went back to the advisors and decided to stick with the decision. After going back back and forth several times, Angela knew she was not going to win - but she was also not prepared to let the Queen down.    She writes: Confident in the knowledge that I would be standing my ground, regardless of what the secretaries said, I came up with a secret plan. Angela found one of the Queenaposs old outfits and asked a member of the team to create a navy copy, sending the invoice to her directly rather than via the official royal account. She also asked milliner Maureen Rose to make a hat with a detachable veil, which again was to be sent directly to her. She made one last attempt to change the Queenaposs mind before the tour. Once again, I told her that I was certain the Vatican would not have suggested that a day dress would be appropriate. I remember the Queen askingI had ever been to the Vatican before and how I could be so sure of my advice.    I hadnapost, but said the reason I knew was because I was brought up a strong Catholic and thatthe Queen turned up for such an important meeting in a day dress, where would it all end  I felt that standards would start slipping. I insisted that the Pope would not expect guests to arrive in such informal dress. When the day of the visit finally came, Angela recalls hearing a very panicked private secretary calling her name. He asked what the Queen was due to wear and she replied saying the pink number they had requested.    He askedthey had a black outfit, to which Angela lied and said no. As she had predicted, the Vatican had said that morning that the outfit had to be dark and there was a huge panic. The Queen asked to see her, and it was during their meeting that she revealed his secret planning. She pulled out the navy outfit, which the Queen liked but said it would be betterit was black.

While it is of some concern that she committed another offence in June it is relatively early into the suspended sentence.  aposaposShe has applied for her own accommodation and is due to sign for a new property next week, this is an excellent opportunity for a fresh start. “Her presentation has vastly improved since distancing herself from her ex-partner and engaging with mental health services. “Cocaine has been problematic for her and impacted her behaviour but she has reduced her use signicantly and made an appointment with the drug service.

He had time to pose for the cameras but not to talk to the staff on the frontline of our NHS. Julia Simons, a trainee at Addenbrooke’s, was prevented from telling him some home truths about the state of the health service. It is not surprising he didn’t stop to listen. She would have told him that patients are not getting the treatment they need because of nine years of cuts and creeping privatisation. And she would have told him the danger his hard Brexit plans pose to the NHS. The trade deal being proposed with the US could leave it at the mercy of American health firms.    This could push up the cost of drugs such as insulin, which are ten times more expensive in the States than in Britain. Mr Johnson is trying to con voters into believing the NHS will be safe in Tory hands. No amount of gloss and spin can hide the waiting lists at a record high, the crumbling hospitals and the shortage of staff. If the PM bothered to talk to those on the frontline he would know this.    There are already too few women in Parliament. And that number is set to fall even further after the election.

I’m guessing the people before didn’t clean the toilets much! I had tried everything, scrubbing, bleach. So for months I’ve had those loo things that coloured the water, but I could still see it. Recently I’ve been pricing up new toilets, plumbers and new floors, because the state of the loos just had to change.

Pictures show how dogs would be held in holding pens before being butchered with some even turned into bar snacks. The Cambodian slaughterhouse was processing between , and , dogs a year, according to animal welfare charity Four Paws. Dr Katherine Polak, a veterinarian at Four Paws, first heard about the slaughterhouse from local restaurants who used it as a supplier. The first thing she saw at the rural property in the Takeo province, just outside of Phnom Penh, was a dying tree with caged dogs underneath.   She told Yahoo News : “The tree was apparently in full bloom about a year ago, but it’s just been dying from all the blood and urine and faeces.“There’s a smell, there’s a stench to it, it’s really heartbreaking.” “The farmer would hit them over the head and then put their back legs into the cage,” she said. “So the other dogs would watching this, waiting for their turn.    “And then he stabs them in the throat, allows them to bleed out a bit and then he puts them in a pot of boiling water.” Selling dogs for meat often attracts a social stigma in south east Asia and Dr Polak has heard stories of the farmers being beaten to death by villagers in neighbouring Vietnam. The farmer at the Takeo province facility contacted Four Paws, pleading them to help him get out of the trade.  On October , Four Paws and Animal Rescue Cambodia entered the property and seized the surviving  dogs. These included two animals the farmer had kept since they were puppies as good luck charms. The damaged canines had been confined to cages.

success at Somerset Park came on the back of a devastating late collapse at home to bottom side Partick the week previously.And Kerr says the belief that victory over the Championship’s second-placed team has given Dundee is bigger than just three points.He told the Tele: “It was important to get past the Partick game straight away.“There was pressure on Friday night with where Ayr are in the league.“When you go to places like Ayr, with the conditions there and it being such an important game, to come away with a result is big.“It wasn’t the best of games and a good battle but to come away with three points and a good resilient performance is massive for us.”The Wasps may be at the wrong end of the table but have already shown they are a match for anybody in the ision, including a - win over leaders Dundee United just three weeks ago.They also ran Dundee close at Dens Park, missing a penalty to allow the Dark Blues to run out - victors.“Alloa showed they can play when they were up here and I saw the Friday night game against Dundee United and they played really well that night,” Kerr added.“I don’t knowUnited were off-colour that night but Alloa certainly played well.“Against us they missed a penalty and had chances so we have to be on our game.“We’re under no illusions how tough it is going to be but we need to show the same application we have shown recently, apart from the latter stages of the Partick game.“We need to show resilience, calmness on the ball and patience.“I think we are getting to that.“Being a team coming together at the start of the season we knew it would take a bit of time.“There is still a long way to go to where we want to be but we are taking strides towards that.”A part of that was winning their first three points on the road.Before the trip to Somerset Park, Dundee had just two points to show from their first four away trips.They’ve put that to bed – now they want their first back-to-back victories of the Championship season, according to Kerr.He added: “Getting our first away win in the league is a good wee hurdle to get over.“The longer those things go, the more its talked about which can be a distraction from what is actually important which is going on the park and performing.“Getting two in a row now is the aim.“Whether it’s a home game where everyone expects a win or an away game where you are going to have to dig deep, we go into it with only one thought and that is to come away with the three points. We have to have that mentality.“It’s also good to have a run of games close to one anotherthings are going well, especially after a win it’s good to bounce back with another game.”Set-pieces have been a problem area for the Dark Blues this season.

It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee.

His final visit was in the year of his death.Tarbert is believed to have been one of the earliest Royal Burghs in Argyll. An early reference as such was made in . It is also said to have had one of the earliest paved streets in Scotland.King James IV also had a close connection with Tarbert. The addition of the #keep# to the castle, part of which still stands today, was constructed at his direction.

Her partner Rebecca Taylor read music as an organ scholar at Lincoln College, Oxford before attending the Royal Academy of Music where she was a Junior Fellow and completed the MA in Piano Accompaniment.The audience were introduced to the pair with an intense piece by Mozart about burning letters and it certainly woke us up. We moved onto Schubert’s #Du Bist Die Ruh# which was beautully controlled by both singer and pianist.This was contrasted with Shubert’s angsty #Gretchen am Spinnrade# and I commend Rebecca Taylor for playing the right hand part with ease. The journey then moved through Schumann and into Brahms where the audience murmured in agreement at the rollercoaster of emotions before us.As we reached Wolf the themes took a darker turn in a short but intense piece about crying tears of blood. Swtly moving onto Strauss and Mahler the audience were given songs of simple love, a sing off between a cuckoo and a nightingale and a man in great pain which reigned the audience in with a spiritual lull.The second half opened with a stunning rendition of Faure’s #Apres Un Reve#. Through Debussy’s impressionist piece, Rinaldo Hahn’s Operatic journey and into Du Parc comforting his love with a dream like harp created by the piano.The duo then gave us a contemporary piece by Joseph Horowitz which comprised of snippets from the monologues of Shakespeare’s Lady Macbeth and the music tracks her descent into madness. It was aAs a light and fun ending we were given #I can be a sexy lady#, a piece about poor mezzos and how they always play boys and not much  in operas.

This was followed by Debussy#s Premiere Rhapsodie which was written as a test piece for a competition at the Paris Conservatoire this requires of the performer the full range of colour and technique which was deftly delivered. Finally we were given Poulenc#s last Sonata. In this, and many of his works, he was rebelling against the Impressionist style and was particularly reflected in the outer fast movements with often angular and zany writing.The second half of the programme started with the Saints-Saens#s Sonata # also his last work. Unlike Poulenc, here he was harping back to the th century#s more classical style style of composition.Their official programme ended with a highly-virtuosic rendition of Chausson#s Andante and Allegro, but we were also given a short and charming encore # one of Gerald Finzi#s three pieces for clarinet and piano.This was all chamber music of the highest quality Maximiliano#s musicality, technique, emotional expression and tonal range were exemplary as indeed were those of his accompanist, Scott.

The stress of being a youngster in the st century is enormous.ldquoWe should be investing in more play areas and green spaces instead of taking them away.ldquoThe thought of removing these playparks seems a very backwards step, a step towards a cultural desert and a future for our youngsters with more weight problems, more mental health issues and future generations unable to communicate effectively, even within their own peer groups.ldquoDo you really want to be remembered as the council who handed out iPads but took away the parks Hawickrsquos lead petitioner, Greg Dalgliesh, owner of the townrsquos Think Fitness  Less gym in Hawick, was unable to attend the meeting due to a family bereavement, soHawick and Hermitage councillor Watson McAteer presented his petition on his behalf.He told the committee: ldquo mainly local residents, parents and family members in Hawick have chosen to exercise their right to object to a proposal that would see  playparks across the Scottish Borders, including  in Hawick, the largest town in the Borders, effectively close as a result of a disinvestment of financial support from this council.ldquoThe vast majority of these people and the many who support this action through other means are stakeholders in Scottish Borders Council. They live here, they are required to pay their council tax and, consequently, they have a right to determine how that money should be spent.ldquoI quote from the petition: lsquowe believe in this instance lsquobigger and better facilitiesrsquo should not be justication to remove the smaller playparks that are situated in the ious housing estates in Hawick and the Borders.ldquolsquoIt is very clear from the comments associated with this petition and via social media these smaller parks are still well used and have been described as a safe place to play and exercise on the doorstep of many homes.ldquo lsquoNot everyone can access the likes of Wilton Lodge Park on a regular basis, and children with additional needs also find these areas too busy and noisyrsquo.Councillors discussed a number of possible actions including sending the playpark proposals back out to the public for further consultation and gauging the opinion of community councils in affected areas.In the end, councillors voted to support sending a motion to the next full council meeting, scheduled for Thursdayasking it to reconsider giving authority to officers to determine which playparks can be closed.That motion was proposed by Tweeddale East councillor Heather Anderson and seconded by Selkirkshire councillor Elaine Thornton-Nicol.A counter motion, proposed by East Berwickshire councillor Jim Fullarton and seconded by Jedburghrsquos Scott Hamilton, was also put forward, but it lost out to Ms Anderson and Ms Thornton-Nicolrsquos suggestionby five votes to three.Speaking after the meeting, Ms Wichary said: ldquoIrsquom very happy that itrsquos going to have to go back to the council to be reconsidered.ldquoIrsquom assuming, hopefully, that our petitions in both Kelso and Hawick have given them a lot of food for thought and that we wonrsquot see the closure of all the parks that were mentioned.ldquoItrsquos very clear that there are cost implications, but Irsquom quite confident that there will be some sort of compromise made.Mr McAteer added: ldquoI am delighted that the majority of the councilrsquos audit and scrutiny committee have supported the Hawick petition designed to stop the council closing a number of our playparks.ldquoTheir decision will now resulted in this matter being referred to a full meeting of Scottish Borders council where elected members

And a reminder that Im not getting any younger as I try to grow old gracefully.JCCs, now a septuagenarian, style has remained a constant.His image of the suit, shagpile black hair and sunglasses remain intact. His social realism poetic constructs seem relevant today as they did during his inception, extrapolated initially from the often nihilism and tales of social decay that earmarked punk mark one.Poetry is often a barometer of an epoch or epochs. Combining observation and the written word. JCC has become a master of mind imagery, social commentary, surrealism, and semantics and above all story telling. We get it because it resonates with us.It is us or we know someone who it references. Sometimes dystopian, often hilarious and never dull. Add the heavy Salfordian brogue the chemistry set is complete.The performance was slightly peculiar to what I was expecting.Maybe my expectations were misguided or unrealistic. There were some long periods of stand-up comedy that laboured at times.It was only when \"Johnny\" ed to his natural home of poetry recital that he got back on track. Though his joke about Billy Bragg being in crisis because he hadnt released an album in two weeks, I found amusing.But when he got back to the poetry it was a reminder why most people were here.Most poems were from the back catalogue and instantly recognisable. A greatest hit set list.JCC proceeded with Hire Car and the sharply expletive named Get Back on Drugs You Fat F***.Well it was an adult show after all.Common language for common poetry. And it never did Billy Connelly any harm. The poem insinuating it was easier to lose weight being on drugs.Beasley Street, arguably his most well-known poem received one of the best reactions of the night. Imbued with the description of a rock bottom street, a dreg of society and where everything that could go wrong did in this street. A caricature of a threadbare existentialism. Mainly bought on by social and economic deprivation.And then a natural supersession in the form of an epilogue Beasley Street Bouled recital, as the street had now changed into middle class suburbia.Next up Ive Fallen in Love with My We. A reference to marriage, the vows and marital bliss. Tongue in cheek of course.The \"bloody song\" Evidently Chickentown, was greeted with widespread applause. More nihilistic scorn and deprecation of a town, that is in a state of dys.Funny how we tend to laugh at the misfortune of others. But we do.Twat was another poem that represented consistency in tonights performance. A crowd pleaser for all times. Twat being the ultimate character assassination and castout. Bringing sporadic fits of laughter within the audience.The closing recital I Wanna Be Yours, famously adopted by The Arctic Monkeys for one of their songs, represented a slight U-turn in the writing of JCC. More linked to a character who wishes to show an undying love for someone . The positives of the human condition. Did I detect some optimism!The MacArts performance had poetry that mixes modernity with the historical. Comedic in value.When we laugh, we are laughing at ourselves. With him, not at him.

There are many people walking around freely drinking during these times.ldquoThis makes it dficult to identy those young people who are underage drinking when there are such crowds.Another wrote: ldquoIntoxication in these areas is unpleasant to witness. In all cases we are entitled not to be subject to the loudness and antisocial behaviour this leads to.On the other hand, some respondents voiced their concerns about bringing in alcohol bylaws: ldquoI think itrsquos a complex situation which deserves time and thought. Irsquom not entirely sure that reacting in a retrospective way is the best approach.ldquoI feel there are many behaviours and traditions entrenched in Scottish and Borders society around drinking habits.ldquoI feel personally that there are alternatives for many people socially that do not centre around drinking or going to the pub, such as the cinema, concerts, sports, dining out, etc., but not everyone has the imagination or willingness to explore these as valid ways to enjoy yourself.Another objector wrote: ldquoDrinking in public places doesnrsquot cause a problem in itself. Issues arise when certain iniduals drink alcohol to excess in any setting.ldquoThe problem, in my view, wonrsquot be solved by a blanket ban on alcohol in public spaces. There are already laws to prevent antisocial behaviour but they need enforced.Police Scotland also provided a detailed response to the consultation. It reads: ldquoAlcohol bylaws are used within the three other local council areas within Lothian and Borders, namely East Lothian, Midlothian and West Lothian.ldquoBy having such bylaws in force it assists Police Scotland in reducing anti-social behaviour and violence both of which are known to have an association with drinking in public.ldquoCurrently the Scottish Borders area is the only local authority area in Scotland that does not have bylaws restricting the consumption of alcohol in public places.NHS Borders, Borders Alcohol and Drug Partnership and Scottish Borders Children and Young Peoplersquos Leadership Group provided a joint response, which reads: ldquoAlcohol consumption can take place in our communitiesrsquo private space as well as within licensed premises.ldquoNot allowing people to drink in a public place will help to reduce the normalisation of alcohol being an ordinary commodity and builds communities and environments that supports a culture change and reduces exposure for our children and young people.ldquoPublic drinking can adversely affect the quality of le for residents and our communities.ldquoAlcohol Focus Scotland report that one in two Scots experience harm from anotherrsquos drinking and often this harm is experienced in public spaces .ldquoIn this study % had experienced harm to others in public places and this was mostlyexperienced by the younger age group .ldquoAlcohol bylaws can be used as an additional tool to reduce the nuisance and disorder normally associated with public drinking.ldquoLicensed premises are well regulated within the Scottish Borders and provide the opportunity to consume alcohol in a safe environment.ldquoThe Scottish Borders is the only local authority area in Scotland that does not have bylaws restricting the consumption of alcohol in public places.Councillors will now be asked whether to conduct further consultation on two options: a blanket ban on public drinking to cover the whole of the Borders, or the introduction of an alcohol ban in certain areas of the Borders. Police Scotland has indicated it would prefer the first option, to ease the enforcement of the ban.Furthermore, councillors are asked to consider undertaking a pilot scheme in specic towns, which could then be used to gather further feedback from the public."},{"url":null,"title":"golden-granny-hilde-aims-fashion-success","story":"AN archery gold medal winning grandmother at the British Transplant Games is setting her sights on fashion.Hilde Paxton from Clovenfords, who had a liver transplant shortly after her th birthday, struck the bulls-eye at Newport earlier this year.And the -year-old is already preparing to defend her title next year by raising vital funds for her Edinburgh Transplant Sports Team.Hilde is hosting a fashion show on Saturday, November  in Galashiels.She told us: \"Edinburgh Transplant Sports Team has around  members from all over the east of Scotland who take part in the Transplant Games.\"An important part of being a member is helping to raise the funds required for sending members to the British Transplant Games.\"The Colours Fashion Team will take to the Focus Centre boardwalk on the Saturday for an evening of glamour and casual wear.Included in the pound ticket price is a complimentary glass of Prosecco on arrival.As well as the fashion show, there will also be a grand raffle and a licensed bar.Tickets for Hildes fashion show, which starts at .pm for pm, are available from the Salmon Inn and Focus Centre, Galashiels, the Bridge Inn and The Gt Shop, Peebles, or The Hub in Innerleithen."},{"url":null,"title":"top-up-tap-plans-galashiels","story":"GALASHIELS is set to become the first town in the Borders to receive an official top-up tap.Scottish Water has already installed the water stations in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen, Dumfries, Dunfermline, Ayr, Oban and Fort William as part of its Your Water, Your Le initiative.As well as providing healthy drinking water, the refill taps will also reduce the number of plastic bottles which are currently in circulation.Scottish Water now want to install the top-up tap in Market Place -

That race took place over the course of last weekend.The series featured five rounds at dferent venues, and each race was set up like a car rally, with untimed uphill transition stages leading to ious timed downhill sections, the results of which were amalgamated into an overall race time. The stages ied massively in , from as little as  seconds to an absolute behemoth we endured at Laggan in April which took us  minutes to ride! The topography and trail surface dfered wildly from venue to venue but also from stage to stage, and the taped trails we raced down last weekend at Fort William epitomised this eclectic set-up.Stage  was the easiest and least technical track we have raced on all year, an entirely man-made sprint through flowing banked corners coated in compacted quarry dust. Of course you had to be careful you didn`t push too hard, it is all too easy to wreck a race run by hitting the deck on an easy stage. We assumed that the organisers were trying to lull us into a  sense of security with stage #and we were so right!Stage  started halfway down the legendary World Cup track , channelling riders through some savage rock gardens before cutting off to the right along a lung-busting fireroad before descending into another sculpted hardpack track which then erted down a horrendously muddy, freshly cut chute that was littered with roots big enough to swallow a bike wheel whole. Even walking down it was impossible.A big transition ride towards Torlundy took us to the top of stage , which was the famous Blue Crane trail running into Ridgeline. Both of these tracks are black-graded on a good day, but there is a huge dference between trying to ride these ‘for fun’ and then trying to race on them once  people have spent a whole Saturday skidding them to bits in the tipping rain! A lot of people fell foul of this stage, but we survived and we absolutely loved it.Stage  was a dferent animal altogether. We had tackled it fairly early on practice day and hadn`t had any issues with it, but the swarm of maniacs who had ridden it in the rain since our earlier visit had turned it into an absolute swamp and the ruts were so deep that I found it almost impossible to negotiate with my limited skills. Dave telling me afterwards that he had romped it didn`t help my mood one bit!The last  stages were so high up the mountain that we needed a trip on the gondola to get to them. The black graded Top Chief track is a fearsome animal that follows the best twisty bedrock line around the hill before plummeting several hundred feet straight down off it into the tree line below, where it once again becomes sanitised into a flowing, twisty and utterly hilarious serpent of a trail that had riders drting and whooping all the way to the carpark. The organisers had cleverly split the Top Chief track into two stages, as there is a long section of perched wooden boardwalk high up on the mountain that is great fun to ride but would be far too dangerous to race on. Stage  was therefore very short -taking most riders about  seconds to ride- while stage  was a  minute monster. What a way to finish a season!So how did we do David was fastest of the three of us, as he has been all season. He finished in a time of  minutes,  seconds. He races in the Senior category , so it is a tough school littered with sponsored riders and crazy kids. He finished th in seniors on the day, and th overall out of an entry of  riders. Having failed to finish the race at Laggan earlier in the year due to a mechanical breakdown, David has been constantly playing catch-up but he still managed to finish in a brilliant nd place overall in the seniors category for the season.Alex has ridden consistently all year and has managed to tread the fine line between wrecking and ruling perfectly at every round. He had one of his very few crashes on the last stage at Fort William which cost him a few seconds, but he still ed a very respectable time of : to finish nd in the Masters category. The Masters section almost always attracts the largest entry and it is full of well-heeled chargers on very expensive steeds, so for Alex to finish in th place in that championshipin his first full season is a highly respectable result.I have continually been either on par or just slower than Alex on nearly every stage of the year, and nothing changed here. I knowI`ve kept within a few seconds of him I have done just fine, and I managed my ride to achieve this perfectly right up until the last stage where a cruel puncture right on top of the hill put paid to any chances of a good result to finish the year. With  top s already in the bag for the season though , I managed to hold onto th place in the Grand Veteran`s championship which was some consolation for a day that finished with me feeling, well, a bit deflated.Competing in this series has been a brilliant experience for us. We have had some hilarious times racing our bikes through some of Scotland`s very best scenery, and we have loved camping out of the back of vans. The organisers at No Fuss Events have done an outstanding job of setting up a professionally run race series in some dficult locations and have always managed to tread the right side of a precarious line, providing us with stages that have been just barely on the rideable side of ridiculous!David Muirhead leads Alex Dickson down the rocky Top Chief track during Saturday#s practice.

A high-energy showing in Paisley saw the McFadyens-sponsored side run out convincing winners.With the match going ahead at the Kibble’s grass park despite the heavy rain overnight and during the week leading up to the game, the surface was in surprisingly good condition, allowing the Pupils to get into their attacking flow early on.Up against a home side not lacking in height and physical stature, the Pupils had to be ready to contend with some lofted early balls from back to front by the hosts, whose game plan seemed to be to get the ball to their forwards as quickly as possible, but the Pupils# defence of Fraser Wylie, Ross Souden, Ryan McConnachie and Stuart Crossan, stood up to the task well.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils quick passing and inidual pace and skill in the final third caused the hosts problems early on, and Ryan Gilchrist and Gregor McFadyen, and both had almost identical attempts to score, but snatched at their shots at the vital moment.However, the Kintyre Park side would not be denied for long, and scored after  minutes through a sharp passing move that released Gregor McFayden, who buried an arrowed shot from the edge of the box to continue his excellent goalscoring form.Then, the visitors made it - after  minutes, when an enterprising move out of defence found right-back Crossan, whose ball through to Johnny McCormick allowed the right winger to cut inside onto his left foot and release a thunderous first-time drive into roof of the net for a great goal, his second of the season.After seeing their deficit doubled, Carlton for their part put their Kintyre visitors under a bit of pressure from several corners and free kicks, but the Pupils’ defensive discipline continued to win over.Into the second half, the Pupils made it - when Donald McCallum scored another great goal, in a move started by Liam Renton, whose in-swinging corner was cleared to the edge of the penalty box where the ex-Dumbarton man McCallum made space to drive a deflected shot into the top corner of the net.At this point in the match, all three subs were used, with Ellis Robertson and Michael McKinlay replacing the excellent deep-lying midfield pairing of Ryan Gilchrist and Liam Renton, and Ross Brown entering in the fray in a direct swap with winger McCormick.The youngster Brown quickly got involved to create the Pupils# fourth goal, outpacing the Carlton full-back to draw out the last defender and square the ball across for Scott Souden to cheekily chip the ball over the home keeper into the net.The rampant Pupils completed the scoring in the th minute after hesitation between a Carlton defender and his keeper allowed McFadyen to nip in, touch the ball round the keeper to score a simple but well-earned second goal, for his brace on the day, and his fourth of the season.At the other end, the Pupils were determined to get their second consecutive clean sheet in league action, and while young keeper Alistair Ferguson spilled a deflected free kick in the latter stages, he bravely ed at the feet of the striker to smother his effort. The Pupils management noted how Ferguson’s kicking and distribution was first-class throughout the match.A Pupils spokesman said: ‘It was a great team effort, with our attacking players working together to cause problems all game. At the back, we defended high balls and direct play really well.’The Pupils are in league action again tomorrowwhen they welcome Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star.

George reminisced: ‘It was announced at a Town Council meeting that the Royal couple was scheduled to visit. It was all to be top secret, but that didn’t happen. The next morning the #secret# was ulged in a queue in one of the town’s shops and the news was out.’With a smile that showed how fond these memories are to him, George continued: ‘The Royal Yacht Britannia was anchored out in the loch and a small boat brought the Queen and Prince Philip to the quay where my father was delegated to catch and secure the rope. They were then driven to the Town Hall and there was a huge crowd present.‘Campbeltown Gaelic Choir, conducted by Mr M G McCallum who was also a councillor, had a lovely surprise for the Royal visitors. Prince Charles had just been made Prince of Wales, so the choir sang ‘God Bless the Prince of Wales’. This was very well received, and the Queen said that she had not heard it before.’George and Mrs McMillan were present at a reception given by the Town Council in the Town Hall. George remembers that he shook hands with the Queen and spoke with the Duke of Edinburgh. He said: ‘Only those invited could speak to the Queen, but the Duke moved among the gathering and spoke to some of the councillors. I was a coal miner at Machrihanish at that time and he asked me and some other miners about our work.’He continued: ‘The food and drinks were served on silver trays by waiters in tails and bow-ties. Afterwards, when the couple was taken on a tour of the town, the heavens opened and oh how it rained and rained.’A town councillor from May  to its disbanding in , and then a councillor on the District Council and the Strathclyde Regional Council, George was to meet the Queen and other members of the Royal Family on other occasions.

What is it I always do riddles when I tell stories. I think of riddles and stories as close cousins which support each other.A good brain-teasing riddle is usually fun, and children in particular love the challenge of solving a riddle, as well as making their own ones up.Irsquom often greeted with pleas for ldquoTim, tell us one more riddle when I enter a school, and Irsquom often challenged to solve a riddle made up by one of the children.They are an ancient form of learning and entertainment.The first discovered written riddles are close to , years old. They were written in Cuneorm, the writing of the ancient Sumerians.A shortened and simplied version of one of these earliest riddles is: ldquoA house you enter blind, but come out with sight. What kind of house is it  The answer is a school, although some may raise an eyebrow at this answer.Perhaps the most famous riddle from antiquity is the Riddle of the Sphinx to Oedipus, recorded in ancient Greek around the fth century BC: ldquoWhat is the creature that walks on four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and three legs in the evening The answer is a human being. When a baby we crawl on four legs, as an adult we walk on two legs, in old age we need a third leg .With my now continuous painful knee, this riddle has particular relevance for me, although Irsquom stubbornly resisting the stick!I use riddles as ice breakers in storytelling sessions and as an engagement technique because they quickly hook an audiencersquos attention since they are, by their nature, interactive.But they are also great fun to use with the children in your family.I use them to help distract and calm my younger ones when they are fractious. I use them in the morning when the kids are getting ready for school so they concentrate on them while they are getting ready.We make the riddles about the things we can see and the things we are doing, for example: ldquoTherersquos a big one and a wee one and three in between, we are two families of five, we are all going to nursery, but we are usually not seen. Who are we  The answer, of course, is my sonrsquos toes!For younger kids, itrsquos important to repeat riddles they already know the answer to. It helps them learn the riddle and how wordplay works. It also teaches them the rhythm of how they are told.My four-year-old is getting pretty good at this, although the answers to his own made-up riddles donrsquot always make sense.That doesnrsquot matter at this stage, whatrsquos important is hersquos developing an understanding of how they work and it encourages him to look for things to make riddles about.His nearly six-year-old sister likes to challenge him too.Her riddle ldquoI am short when I sit, I am long when I jump, what am I  had me thinking for some time before I got the answer: a frog.To make a riddle, think of the answer first. Then work the riddle up to the answer. It involves thinking about all the dferent qualities, uses of and parts of the answer and how they can be twisted or described dferently.For example, a shoe has a tongue but canrsquot talk, a clock has a face and hands but no body, a river has a bed but doesnrsquot sleep.Once introduced to riddle-making, children can get really engaged with it. A group of seven-eight-year-olds in a P class challenged me last week with a riddle they had made up themselves: ldquoI have a brain full of teacherrsquos knowledge, I crash without moving, I freeze while staying warm, what am I  The answer is a computer.Some riddles rhyme and it can be an extra challenge to think of a rhyming riddle, but they donrsquot have to rhyme.It really is a fun and rewarding activity to make a regular habit in the car, dinner table, on a walk or even a bedtime riddle.To help you out, there are literally thousands of examples of riddles in books, on the internet, in history, films and ones you hear. But the best ones will be those made up yourself, and the more you do it, the better at it you will become.And the benefits of riddling regularly with your family can be signicant, especially for children.

It is felt at the moment that the draft in its entirety is not acceptable until this letter is lodged and any concerns we have are taken on board.ldquoNot everybody understood everything that was involved in the draft plan but time was needed to make sure not only all the community councillors were more familiar with the draft plan but we had heard from HBCP and Haddington residents.ldquoIt was felt in the past that at community council meetings not enough time had been dedicated to it, hence the reason why Tuesday night happened.When the controversial proposals were revealed, the local authority confirmed it was ldquoexploring additional options for sustainable travel improvements in and around Haddington town centre.The new lsquoedge of centrersquo car park, dubbed a park and stride or a park and ride, would encourage people to walk or be bussed from Whittingehame Drive back into the town centre.No location has been confirmed for any new car park, although there have been concerns raised as to how it would impact upon community events such as Nungate Gala and the townrsquos fireworks.The long-stay car park at the townrsquos Tesco store, which is used by many people working in the town centre, could also become a short-stay car park.Joanna Gibson, HBCP chairwoman, outlined the grouprsquos feelings about the proposed scheme before non-community councillors were asked to leave the meeting ndash a decision that, according to East Lothian Council, was entirely down to the community council.A number of businesses feared they would not be able to operate through a y construction period. There were also worries that businesses would be forced to close and, with none moving in, it would result in a poorer High Street.Mrs Gibson said: ldquoWe do not think that this design has enough merit to counter the huge disruption of even phase one of the plan.ldquoThere were at least three plans at the initial consultations, why were none of the others considered  Perhaps within these plans we might have found a non-disruptive way to actually improve the town centre.ldquoThe shared space for events we believe will rarely be used as there does not seem to be any motivation or intentions, to our knowledge, to appoint someone to manage this.ldquoWe already have excellent event space outside the Corn Exchange offering indoor and outdoor event space and at Whittingehame Drive, and round the River Tyne where very successful community events are held.ldquoWe believe that parking is an important factor in retaining businesswe are to compete with the [proposed] new retail park [at Gateside] and survive and prosper.ldquoThis has also been the conclusion of many high street and town centre survival papers and studies worldwide.A council spokesman said: ldquoWe are continuing to develop proposals to improve the attractiveness, ality and accessibility of the town in support of the community and local businesses. This includes improved pedestrian and cycle access, as well as exploring additional options for sustainable travel improvements in and around Haddington town centre.ldquoOur priorities are to protect and enhance the local environment while supporting the local economy.

When North Berwick High School had a hair training salon, he held sessions on the basics of hairdressing.Many stories could be told about his days in the salon, like when golfrsquos The Open Championship was held and top player Vijay Singh came in for a cut.Melvin, not being a golfer, did not know who he was, but they got chatting and Vijay said he was here for golf, so Melvin very kindly recommended some of the courses his customers had told him about!During the early days, Melvin could be found at the townrsquos Nether Abbey Hotel sometimes as a customer but sometimes as the chef as he had a great love for cooking.Many happy times were spent there and many parties were had, where Melvin was given access to the kitchens and, along with friends, did the catering.For his th birthday, he cooked for  friends.He was also famous every year for his barbecues held at the National Museum of Flight at East Fortune during its airshow.Melvin liked people to appreciate his food he would make lunch for the girls who worked in the salon, just liking to see them eat and enjoy.

The River Esk snakes around the edge of the course.Prof Crofts expressed concern that dogs could easily swallow them, resulting in ldquolarge vet bills for owners.After ing the balls to the club, he has issued a call for the flood protection scheme, currently being drawn up for Musselburgh, to include measures to slow down water coming off the Pentland and Moorfoot Hills where the North and South Esk rise.Prof Crofts, of Musselburghrsquos Eskside West, a geography expert who has worked as a research scientist in Scotland, said: ldquoAlong the golf course there are very soft banks and you can see where they have been cut back, and probably there was some rough at the end of the fairway where lots of people have lost balls.ldquoWe cannot stop leaves and tree trunks being brought down the river but the speed of rise of the water level and its velocity shows that any flood prevention scheme for Musselburgh needs to look hard at measures to slow down water coming off the hills and into the river. Without this, the erection of walls being proposed in Musselburgh will not be public money well spent.ldquoMany of us feel the importance of the amenity of this stretch of the river ndash it is very fine.He said a tree planting scheme using native species should be discussed with landowners in the headwaters of the Esk catchment area, as government grants were available for such work.He said: ldquoI am talking about hundreds of thousands of trees maybe. Careful hand planting of trees is best rather than using tractors to dig ditches to prepare the land for planting as this would aggravate the problem by increasing the rate of water running off the hills. The trees would take up water from the soil.ldquoThe use of the reservoirs on the North and South Esk and the temporary flooding of the flat land along the river should be seriously investigated to store water during heavy rainfall and therefore slow the release of water into the river.ldquoIf you look at the flood issue, itrsquos caused by the river rising very fast but itrsquos made worsethere are high spring tides and a storm surge in the North Sea, and also a northerly wind across the estuary which piles the water up high and stops the river water escaping for a couple of hours either side of high tide.Professor Crofts has raised his concerns with consultants who are drawing up the Musselburgh Flood Protection Scheme and he has also made local councillors aware of his views.As for the coast, he highlighted small sand dunes which formed a natural barrier with grasses, which, below the ground level, had yards of roots acting as a natural catcher of the sand.Jackie Lambert, captain of Musselburgh Golf Club, said: ldquoThe club was unaware of the issue regarding golf balls being found on the beach near the mouth of the River Esk.ldquoWhilst, the figure of  golf balls is signicant, it is unknown over what timescale these balls have accumulated andthey are all, indeed, from the course.ldquoNotwithstanding this, the golf club will happily participate in any working group looking at the wider issues of flood protection and the environment in and around Musselburgh.

This has been done in what in what is normally referred to as the Queenrsquos Speech. It is in studying the contents we have to realise that the author, the Prime Minister, is someone not normally associated with either in-depth scrutiny or attention to detail. To put it another way the manestorsquos headlines do not represent the contents.Nothing is more evident than the claim to recruit , more police officers. Although this does not relate to Scotland nevertheless it is a prime example of double talk. In stating , more police in three years there is a suggestion being made that in the three-year period England and Wales will have this number of additional officers. However even the slightest amount of scrutiny lies bare the nonsense of this claim.To recruit this number in three years would require a Herculean task of actually interviewing sufficient, capable people to take up these vacancies. The interviewing process is long and arduous and with preference being given to graduates will present the police forces with a huge logistical nightmare. The normal fallout from the interview process can be up to  per cent so maybe , interviews would have to be carried out to arrive at the headline number.However, let us assume, in a spirit of charity, that somehow this task can be accomplished and the interviews completed and in three years , new officers will have been recruited. The average working le of an officer is  years so in three years ten per cent of the present force of , will have retired. Or to put it another way , officers will have left the force. So even recruiting , more officers had been accomplished, this would result in only a net gain of , additional cops. The headline and the detail simply do not add up. If Boris Johnson were looking to improve the service, then the solution would lie in increasing the budget appropriately. This he will not do.This is merely one example. However similar forensic investigation of all the contents of the Queens Speech will show that Mr Johnson is selling nothing other than fairy tales.George Kay, Burntisland.THE Herald poll which shows overwhelming support for the SNP at the upcoming General Electionis a mark of the trust voters have in the party which has been in power in Scotland for  years, and a growing realisation that Scotland will thrive as an independent European nation.While the SNP Government calmly carries on, the UK is into its third Tory Prime Minister in about as many years David Cameron didnt hang around after losing the EU referendum hed instigated, Theresa May soon found that Brexit didnt mean Brexit and we werent going to make a success of it and Boris Johnson eclipsed the pair of them by insisting that do or die, we were leaving the EU on October  and hed rather be dead in a ditch than ask for an extension. Neither Mr Johnson nor anyone  is leaving on October  and while he may not be in a ditch, Mr Johnson is certainly busy digging himself and his party into a hole.While a General Election may have been inevitable, the timing could hardly have been much worse, with the Christmas season getting into full swing and just over a week before the shortest day even holding it a few days earlier would have been helpful, particularly to the student population. And it is a huge blow that the amendment was not taken which, as is the case at Scottish elections, would have given voting rights to EU nationals living in the UK and enfranchised  and -year-olds, who will have to live with the consequences of Brexit without being given any say in the matter.I fear that we can expect Mr Johnsons General Election campaign to emulate the notorious Vote Leave campaign with pledges on the side of a bus et al, so it is encouraging that your poll indicates that Scottish voters wont be duped by this guiser of a Prime Minister and his Halloween tricks and no treats.Ruth Marr, Stirling.AS we gear up to a December election, the first economic assessment of Boris Johnsonrsquos Brexit deal has indicated the incredibly damaging impact it will have on the UK economy.Research by the National Institute of Economic and Social Researchhas revealed that GDP would be . per cent lower in  yearsrsquo time under the deal, leaving the UK a staggering pound billion worse off than we had remained in the EU.This is not quite the ldquosunny uplands the Brexiters have repeatedly promised.NIESR said approval of the Prime Ministerrsquos deal ldquowould reduce the risk of a disorderly outcome but eliminate the possibility of a closer trading relationship with the EU. However, despite the agreement between the EU and the UK removing uncertainty, customs and regulatory barriers would ldquohinder goods and services trade with the continent leaving all regions of the United Kingdom worse off than they would bethe UK stayed in the EU.The report also found the proposed free trade deal with the EU was slightly worse for the economy than Theresa Mayrsquos deal of last year.When voters mark their X in the box, these figures lay bare the economic future that faces the nation and the major impact that their choice will have.Alex Orr, Edinburgh EH.NICOLA Sturgeon has agreed to a General Election to further her own political aims. Has she miscalculated  The SNP is standing on a  to cancel Brexit and allow indyref but the two are mutually exclusive. If Brexit does not take place, the foremost \"material change in circumstances\" that triggered the need for indyref disappears. Many SNP supporters who still want Brexit to happen will be in the position of having to vote for a pro-Brexit party. Those wanting to remain in both the Union and the EU can find security with the Liberal Democrats. The pro-independence position is therefore weakened and even more so as the SNPs warnings on a climate emergency might boost those voting Green.The SNP hype, up until now, is for almost a total victory in all Scottish seats to be in the bag. The expectation is being ramped up, therefore disappointment is almost inevitable. Perhaps Ms Sturgeon ought to have declined Boris Johnsons invitation after all.Dr Gerald Edwards, Glasgow G.AS they say, politicians campaign in poetry but have to govern in prose. Flamboyant promises fill the airwaves, restraint only coming into play when the serious business of taking office hits home.The starting pistol for a Christmas election has been fired.This is no ordinary election where policies are put on display, allowing the electorate to vote for the party most trusted by voters. The waters have been muddied by the inclusion of Brexit on the normal agenda in the hope that the result will finally define the direction demanded by the choice of the winning party.We have two contrasting personalities leading the two main parties.Both are pale imitations of the two giants of their parties, Boris Johnson representing a Churchillian figure, Jeremy Corbyn approximating to Attlee.What cannot be denied is that this election is a battle for the soul of Britain, one side the champion of neo-liberal economics, the other verging on responsible capitalism under the guise of socialism.That is the stark choice facing the voters, who will have to wade through the murky rhetoric to work out which campaign they should choose to ensure viability for their families and personal welfare.That will mean looking beyond narrow self-interest and focusing on the broader perspective of what is better for the national interest.They will have to ignore the caricatures painted for them by the wild words of politicians hoping to depict their opponents in the worst possible light.This is a generation-defining election.Denis Bruce, Bishopbriggs.I REFER to the ongoing furore about the career of Ruth Davidson, former leader of the Scottish Conservatives .I recall from a comment that one writer made that she was resigning to spend more time with her family he also pointed out that she was actually resigning to spend more time with her constituents, which she had not actually done heretofore.As the story developed, she was really to be spending more time with her consultants, Tulchan and her own consultancy company.Ms Davidson has now agreed not to accept the role with Tulchan what she will do with her own company is not known as she omitted to properly register it, and someone  has registered the domain name. Her failure to register her own company shows a distinct lack of business sense, where the Tulchan episode just shows her lack of common sense.On a related matter the Scottish Tories are producing election leaflets with her pictureshe actually stood down because she fundamentally disagreed with the Prime Minister, Boris Johnston ndash she did launch ldquoOperation Arse about his candidacy, did she not  Strange indeed that she and the Tory Party are now punting him as hard as they can.Jim Lynch, Edinburgh EH.FOLLOWING on from your article re Ruth Davidsons pamphlet to the East Renfrewshire electorate: today I received one from our local Conservative MP, well I think it was.

After several minutes of wild acclamation, the chief comrade took to the lectern to speak. ldquoWe love you Jeremy, shouted one devotee.As Jezza progressed through his speech, the audience cheered and applauded at the end of each paragraph. At this rate, the launch threatened to stretch into the evening.ldquoLabour will put wealth and power in the hands of the many Boris Johnsonrsquos Conservatives, who think theyrsquore born to rule, will only look after the privileged few.Lines like this were met with people shouting out ldquoYes!. And at other times when the party leader askedit was not too much to ask to end the Conservativesrsquo ldquogreat rip-off on public services or that people should receive a pay rise, there was an equally forceful ldquoNo! making the even feel like a religious rally.Of course, the trick or treat launch provided Jezza with an open goal: Bozzarsquos ldquodo or die October  Brexit pledge. When the hairy Leftie referred to how the PM had insisted he would rather be ldquodead in a ditch than seek a Brexit extension, one loyal socialist shouted out ldquohooray!The comradely uplt reached its height when Jezza mentioned Labours great creation, the NHS, and his allegation of a post-Brexit ldquoTrump sell-out. When he declared the health service was not for sale the audience rose up and began to chant ldquonot for sale, not for sale.The Labour chief warned his chums that the nasty Tories would fight ldquoharder and dirtier than ever before to cling onto power. When he pledged to take on the tax dodgers, the dodgy landlords, the bad bosses and the big polluters, Jezza asked the question: ldquoWhorsquos side are you on  and duly got the expected response: ldquoYours!There was more whistling and hooting from the Lavender Hill Mob when the socialist prophet declared: ldquoTogether, we can pull down a corrupt system and build a fairer country that cares for all.Arguably, Jezzarsquos best line came when he told the comradely echo chamber: ldquoWhen Labour wins, the nurse wins, the pensioner wins, the student wins, the office worker wins, the engineer wins. We all win. Not surprisingly, it prompted another standing ovation and more cries of ldquowe love you Jeremy.After the prophet closed his speech with the pay-off line, ldquoitrsquos time for real change, the audience jumped up to offer more love and devotion to the great leader and, needless to say, ultimately broke into the chant of ldquooooooh Jeremy Corbyn.As Jezza was spiritually lted up, insisting: ldquoI love doing this job, the key question to be decided is whether the adoration inside Battersearsquos Grand Hall can be replicated across the country and convey the chief comrade into the Downing St hot-seat."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10613950.jpg?type=article-full","title":"discover-places-keeping-vegan-food-scene-thriving","story":"Tchai-OvnaHidden down a wee cobbled lane in the heart of Glasgowrsquos West End, on entering Tchai-Ovna you would be forgiven for thinking you are stepping into a Himalayan tea room or a Turkish bazar.Tchai-Ovna was founded in  by a group of Glasgow University students tired of the prevalent alcohol culture.

For example the fact that Scotland has added around a further pound billion to its debt since  and become a ldquojohnny-come-lately Europeanwill not be up for public scrutiny.Furthermore, it would appear that tactical voting will play a major part on the outcome of the General Election with a number of people holding their noses to vote for the party which can deliver or safeguard either Brexit, Remain, the Union or an independence referendum.

It is possible to win a majority of seats in Parliament, whether Holyrood or Westminster, by obtaining the votes of a minority of the electorate or a minority of votes cast this being an insubstantial basis to demand Scottish independence.William Durward, Bearsden.SO the fates have decreed that we get an early Christmas present in the form of a General Election. While the date is clear, it is less obvious for whom one should vote where one is not already a paid-up member or ardent supporter of one party or another. It has to be said that the selection of party leaders is not overly impressive. It has to be one of the poorest list of leaders promoting election campaigns in our history.For the Conservatives we have the incorrigible Boris Johnson, who has been known to be economical with the truth on occasion. For Labour we have Jeremy Corbyn, who was once vocal in his support of Venezuela. The current tragic condition of that country illustrates how dangerous the implementation of his doctrinaire socialist policies would be for the UK.The Lib Dems have the opportunistic Jo Swinson, lacking in gravitas, who sees herself, somewhat delusionally, as the next Prime Minister. For the SNP we have the doughty Ian Blackford, the investment banker, living the le of a ldquosimple crofter. His party at Westminster basically and repetitively sings from one song sheet . Do not let us forget the ex-Ukip leader Nigel Farage, now calling the shots for the Brexit Party. In spite of all the predictions of the subsequent profound adverse effects, he would prefer to leave the European Union without a deal.While not being spoiled for choice with regard to the leadership qualities of those at the head of parties and their policies, more and more I have inclined to the view that there is a case for extending the choice available on the list of candidates on the ballot paper,by adding a box to be crossed with the wording ldquonone of the aboversquo.Ian W Thomson, Lenzie.PLEASE help our memories by answering the following questions:.

Behailu Kebede, in flat , was found to be entirely blameless, having done all the right things on being woken by his smoke alarm and spotting the fire.:Clutha crash caused by pilots failure to check fuel pumps, inquiry findsHe called for help, closed the kitchen door, alerted neighbours and waited for the fire brigade. Hours later  people would be dead.What becomes more complex - and what is under dispute - is who was, then, to blame for the events of June , . There has been outrage at the suggestion the London Fire Brigade is responsible and pleas that fire fighters should not be made scapegoats for the fatal incident.At the same time there have been calls for the services chief, Dany Cotton, to resign after failures from the service to alter its \"stay put\" advice to residents inside the burning building. Sir Martins report makes clear that more could have been saved had the building being evacuated sooner.The inquirys second phase, expected to be finished in , five years after the fire, will be a deeper investigation into how the fire could have happened in the first place.Footage being shared earlier this week showed Boris Johnson in , responding to concerns raised about cuts he made to the fire service while Mayor of London, with the words \"get stuffed\". The video of the meeting, held not long before the Grenfell disaster, shows a colleague of Mr Johnson raising the issue of a lack of fire safety in housing as a result of the cuts. Get stuffed.It seems far too simplistic to blame the fire crews when, at the top, there was such utter disdain for the service and the resources needed for fire safety.:Inside Clutha pub after helicopter crash revealed as FAI rules pilot errorAt the Clutha Fatal Accident Inquiry it was clear from the start that families of the victims who died when the Police Scotland helicopter crashed through the roof of the Glasgow pub did not want the pilot to face sole blame.Instead, they wanted to know whether there had been systemic failings at the top - was there a problem with the helicopter  Had there been problems with training or management or maintenance It was a far cry from the last major Fatal Accident Inquiry in the city when automatic sympathy for the driver of a bin lorry that ran out of control on Queen Street and killed six people quickly turned to disgust as it became apparent he, Harry Clarke, had lied about previous health problems.Yet in the one case where blame did appear to sit with the man at the bottom, rather than come from the top down, Mr Clarke faced no criminal charges.While suspicion of pilot error had been an immediate suggestion and then constant explanation almost since the day of the crash, the Clutha families, and bar owner Alan Crossan, were clear that they did not simply want Captain David Traill to take the blame for the deaths of their loved ones.Captain Traills fianceacutee Lucy Thomas was represented at the inquiry, which ran from April to August this year, and her QC, Shelagh McColl, asked that Captain Traill - an \"extremely accomplished and experienced pilot\" - not be blamed for the crash.Sherf Principal Craig Turnbull could not give her what she asked for. His findings stated that the crash could have been avoided had Captain Traill followed procedure set down in the Pilots Checklist, realised that two fuel transfer pump switches were \"off\" and so not sending fuel to the supply tanks, and switched these on.Had the switches been turned on, there was enough fuel on board to feed the twin engines and the helicopter would have made it back to Glasgow Heliport.This is baldly put and stood out as unfair to the families who had heard evidence lead which gave reasons why Captain Traill might not have checked the switches and why he might not have responded as per the Pilots Checklist in response to low fuel warnings.Captain Traill was wrong to ignore the five low fuel warnings that sounded during the final flight but the court heard clear reasons - relating to issues with fuel sensors in the EC helicopter - why he might logically have ignored them.A less highlighted fact, and one important to mention, is that Sherf Turnbull also found that had Airbus included an aural attention-getter that sounded when both fuel transfer pumps were switched off, the crash might have been avoided.So, disappointment for the families with regards to blaming Captain Traill and not anyone further up the chain.Disappointment too at feeling removed from the process of the inquiry which they waited six years to attend.On behalf of Mary Kavanagh, the partner of victim Robert Jenkins, QC Donald Findlay said that those who died and their families had \"merited scarcely a mention\". It was a sentiment repeated by those loved ones who turned up day after day to the inquiry and sat, dignied, through what must have been evidence traumatic for them to hear.Some wanted questions put to the emergency services who had attended the victims. \"No evidence has been led to show what more,anything, could have been done to save them,\" Mr Findlay again. \"It is submitted that this is what people would wish to know and are entitled to know.\"Of course families wanted clear answers to their questions but, without a black box recorder in the helicopter, any answers were only ever going to be hypotheses. The sherf, too, cannot be solely motivated by pleasing the victims and relatives when conducting a fatal accident inquiry. That is not his role.For those intimately involved it is impossible to separate emotions from proceedings and emotions do not always guide us well.However, it has been acknowledged by James Wolffe, the Lord Advocate, that the FAI system must better involve the bereaved and survivors with improved information sharing. He had pledged additional funding to achieve this, and to speed up a system whereby y delays can further traumatise victims.Sherf Turnbull, in his Clutha conclusions, also highlight the issue of the impact delays have on those involved.The families of those who died in the Clutha accident are not satisfied with the outcome of this inquiry but they will perhaps be satisfied with these acknowledgements.One certainty, at the end of six years, is that the families involved deserve praise for the dignity with which they conducted themselves throughout. Those at the top must match them in a resolve to speed up and improve the system."},{"url":null,"title":"indyref2020-nationals-rally-independence---everything-need-know","story":"The event marks the first time that the paper has arranged a rally.

It is clear that these people were exploited by criminals with no care for their welfare ndash or even whether they lived or died. This devastating case brings home the brutal cost of human trafficking and exploitation.Yet we must never make the mistake of thinking that human trafficking is an unusual or uncommon crime, or one that would never happen in Scotland. In fact, there have been cases of human trafficking reported in every single one of Scotlandrsquos  local authorities. From our cities to our villages, no community in Scotland is untouched by trafficking.Worryingly, the statistics show that reports of human trafficking are growing. These victims are among the most vulnerable people in our society. They suffer the most appalling abuse of their human rights, forced to live and work in terrible conditions and under constant physical and psychological abuse. Across all the categories, the numbers in Scotland are increasing: children and adults male and female labour exploitation and sexual exploitation UK nationals and migrants.And those are only the cases we know about. Human trafficking and exploitation are hidden crimes, taking place under our noses but unrecognised.:Human trafficking action partnership at Glasgow Airport suspended lsquodue to BrexitrsquoAll over Scotland, there are women forced into sexual exploitation, coerced into prostitution by traffickers who exploit their vulnerability and lack of English language skills. Children ndash often young children ndash have been locked into houses to cultivate cannabis plants, often left for days on their own and terrorised by threats against their families. People are trafficked into Britain to work in nail bars, car washes, construction and other businesses, working in dangerous conditions for illegally low wages ndashthey are paid at all. And children are trafficked by organised criminals to work in the ldquocounty lines drugs trade.Scotlandrsquos councils are working to improve how we identy and help the victims of trafficking. As the sphere of government closest to our communities, local authorities play a key role in responding to human trafficking across the country. In Scotland, the local government workforce is over , strong ndash our social workers, licensing officers, refuse collectors and housing officers are all well-placed to spot the signs that someone has been trafficked, alert the authorities and provide support. We owe it to the survivors of trafficking to improve how we do this.That is why last week Cosla, the membership body for Scotlandrsquos councils, launched guidance aimed at the local authority workforce, giving them information on how to spot the signs of human trafficking and what to dothey suspect it is taking place. Councils are advised to have proper processes in place to ensure frontline staff receive the training to spot any signs of human trafficking they might witness in the course of their day-to-day duties. Every council is advised to have strategies and effective plans for what to do when they encounter victims and to provide the critical support and refuge that a survivor needs.:Ian McConnell: East Renfrewshire Tory MP ignores Brexit economics to point at SNPWe also need to make sure we share all relevant information with the police, to ensure that they can arrest the perpetrators and disrupt the trafficking networks.The NHS has launched similar guidance for health workers and our colleagues in Police Scotland, the Scottish Government and the third sector are working to improve their response to human trafficking too.There is also a role for members of the public. Anyone who sees anything that appears to be an emergency should immediately dial . If it is not an emergency, but a cause for concern, dial . If unsure, it is always right to call  rather than not report at all. Human trafficking is a hidden crime, which means that the outside signs can be hard to spot. The more information the authorities have, the better the response.It can be hard to spot the victims of trafficking. Victims can be threatened with physical violence to themselves or their families, and they can be psychologically controlled and isolated, making them reluctant to speak out. Sometimes, victims donrsquot always recognise that they are victims, particularlythey see their current situation as an improvement.This can be the case, for example, for an orphaned street child living in extreme poverty, who is offered food and shelter in exchange for cleaning, cooking and looking after children in a family home, and who may see this as better than living on the streets at risk of greater exploitation. We all have a role to play in reporting suspicions of human trafficking, to free people from this exploitation.The terrible case last week in Essex underlines so tragically the importance of working to fight trafficking. We hope the perpetrators of this awful crime are brought to justice swtly. But we must never assume such crimes could not happen here. They do. For the victims in Scotland, we must do all we can to fight back against human trafficking and exploitation.Councillor Alison Evison is the COSLA President and CouncillorKelly Parry is the COSLA spokesperson for Community Wellbeing"},{"url":null,"title":"sturgeon-only-listening-corbyn-not-voters-claim-tories","story":"The party said the SNP and Labour leaders were ldquoalready having private chats with an eye to him granting Indyref infor her propping up a minority Labour government.Acting Scottish Tory leader Jackson Carlaw made the accusations as he campaigned in Aberdeen and unveiled a new poster depicting Ms Sturgeon with her fingers in her ears.:Nicola Sturgeon says Labour will grant Indyref\"She still wont listen, so tell her again,\" it says.Mr Carlaw said the SNP had lost  seats and almost half a million votes at the  general election after trying to make Brexit a ldquospringboard to Indyref.He said: ldquoNicola Sturgeon is not listening ndash she is obsessed with independence and we must send her a message at this general election.ldquoPeople have had enough of the ision and we just want to move on.ldquoHere in the north-east of Scotland, voters overwhelmingly rejected independence in .ldquoYet, here we are in  and the entire SNP campaign is based on a re-run of that decisive vote.

Just over  pairs of bike lights have been purchased using funding from Police Scotland Safer Communities for this purpose.#Visibility is key to keeping cyclists safe on the roads and I would encourage cyclists to ensure they wear bright reflective clothing and illuminate lights on their bikes, both front and rear, in order to make themselves more visible to other road users,# said chief inspector, Matthew Webb.#This is equally applicable during the day, but more important at dusk and when it#s dark, to avoid collisions and warn other road users to their presence.#Some cyclists wear dark clothing and particularly on faster roads they can be almost invisible to drivers until they are close to them.#He added: #I recognise in this rural community that a lot of the measures are equally applicable to the equine community and they are more than welcome to make use of the same free offer.#This initiative has been supported by the Orkney Road Safety Forum who will assist with the distribution of these lights, which in addition to the police office, are available from the OIC hubs and Scottish Fire and Rescue Service Community Safety Advocacy.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

If Edinburgh and Skye do suffer from overtourism, what can we do about it  In a free country, we cannot stop people from coming here, evenwe wanted to.It should also be recognised that folk visit those two places for dferent reasons. Edinburgh is an architectural jewel which is at its most crowded during the annual festival. People come to Skye for the scenery — most notably in recent years to the Trotternish Ridge and the Fairy Pools, two undeniably beautul spots in an island which is full of other undeniably beautul spots.Edinburgh cannot be expected to cancel its festival, any more than we want to drain the Fairy Pools or blow up the Old Man of Storr.And we do not want to stop them coming. They bring money, which provides jobs and kickstarts enterprises and improves the island#s economic wellbeing even outside the realm of the local tourist industry.Professor John Lennonof Glasgow Caledonian University#s Moffat Centre is presently commissioned by another independent body, SkyeConnect, to carry out a major survey of the impact of tourism on Skye.Professor Lennon and his colleagues are not due to deliver their report until next spring. But he will offer a taste of its findings so far to the autumn conference of SkyeConnect next month.We look forward to both the sample and the full report. We can hazard a guess at some of its content.Skye has been #discovered# by the rest of the world, like a Caledonian Machu Picchu.Unlike the Peruvian Inca site, however, Skye is a very big island. Unlike Machu Picchu, it is not yet collapsing under the weight of its visitors# feet.Skye can — and Mark Crothall congratulated the Skyetime campaign for pointing this out — accommodate half a million visitors, and continue to benefit hugely from their spending, particularlycertain adjustments are made to the tourist itinerary.More people should be encouraged to spend a quiet and infinitely rewarding week in Elgol or Waternish, in all four seasons, than take a whistle-stop, bucket list summer tour of the Storr, the Fairy Pools and back to the bridge.And of course, local and national government should do much more to improve the basic infrastructure of the island, from roads and parking areas to public transport and public toilets.Skye has bucked the trend of the rest of the north-western Highlands and Islands by growing its population and its economy in recent years.That has chiefly been because of the tourist industry. After  years of steady and apparently irreversible decline, the growth quite naturally took everybody by surprise. We should now learn to adapt to it, rather than call it #overtourism# and hope that it goes away."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/001WH2510NCA-web.jpg","title":"west highland free press audio files friday 25th","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineEvery week, Skye  Lochalsh Council for Voluntary Organisations http:www.slcvo.org.uk  produces an abridged audio version of the West Highland Free Press.

Instead, it leads to the booze aisle in thelocal supermarket and to a drinking den out on the moor.In this, the maincharacter in Kevin MacNeil’s novel ‘The Stornoway Way’ is depicted as havingmuch in common with his fellow islanders, whether or not they absorb their localminister’s thunderous moralising. Theplay of the same name, which MacNeil also wrote, pulls no punches so far asdevastating social critique is concerned.There’s a lot in a name. RomanStornoway can be read as romance torn away. He is also R Stornoway. He is a religiouscuckoo in the nest and the key in a roman a clef. The character himselfacknowledges all this. As an everyman outsider, Mister S is meant tocommunicate a great deal about Lewis.Calvinism, alcohol and climatecombine in a pernicious cocktail that permeates people and place. Depression, repression and addiction are endemic.So are dreams of escape.If this is the desolate reality in which MacNeil’s characters are immersed, the play of the novel # staged by Dogstar Theatre at Sabhal Mor Ostaig last week # sugars the pill with scabrous wit, hilarious minor characters, and some truly moving songs, among them a traditional Gaelic lament rendered with crystalline clarity by Lewis-born actor Rachel Kennedy. It is a sublime moment where Roman reconnects with the culture he scorns. But the moment passes, and the song of loss and love is soon replaced with cynicism and tomorrow’s hangover.All good writing, whetherfor page or stage, interweaves the personal, the local and the universal. Roman’s war is with himself and with Lewishis dreams are of finding love and self-fulfilment. The universal arrives inthe shape of Eva, a Hungarian student who initially succumbs to Roman’s scatterguncharm, but who later comes to see him as self-obsessed and manipulative. Roman is certainly that. Heis also vulnerable, funny, and capable of great profundity.Self-fulfilment comesthrough music, and when Roman’s long-suffering best friend Eilidh organises asession for him in a recording studio in Edinburgh, the road to salvationopens. But Roman is a master at self-sabotage. Matters don’t quite go to plan.Naomi Stirrat as Roman,Rachel Kennedy as Eilidh and Chloe-Ann Tylor as Eva are all fine actors, and adeptat lively theatricality. As an ensemble,they tick like a Swiss watch, darting here and there without missing a beat. Andthey can’t half belt out a tune. As with all adaptations,there are issues concerning the episodic aspect of narrative fiction and how thisworks on stage, in real-time. In ‘The Stornoway Way’ scene transitions areheralded by brief drum patterns that wouldn’t sound out of place in an Americansitcom. But that is to cavil. MacNeil’s play is at least as good as his novel, and the novel was very good indeed."},{"url":null,"title":"exceptional period residence","story":"#Prospect House# is an exceptional period residence occupying a choice mature setting yet is within a short walk to the town centre and facilities of Ballymoney.

Anyone that met her - she took a piece of their heart straight away and they never forgot her.Ruby had to battle a lot day to day, but she did it with huge strength, she was fully depended on us   for all of her care. This was huge for us as a family.Ruby did not sleep at night. She had a lot of cerebral irritation and suffered from frequent seizures daily We, as her parents, were the only ones able to provide this care.This is where the Hospice played a huge part in our lives, Ruby attended the hospice for respite from the age of six months. The hospice is a home away from home that provides the most amazing care and love to the children and their families with full : medical care  .We, as a family, felt completely comfortable that Ruby was being cared for to the highest standard, in a place filled with love and joy. This gave us time to refuel to keep going that bit longer.The Hospice were also there for us in Ruby’s end of le care, we spent our final two days with her there, in the comfort of a home setting with the support of the nursing staff around us.This gave us precious time that we would never have got anywhere .We made memories that we will cherish forever and we are truly indebted to the Hospice for having such a signicant impact in our final days with Ruby.We decided to host Rubys Birthday Fundraiser last year and it was a huge success, raising an amazing pound,. The whole community and local business were fully behind us and couldn’t have done it without them. The NI Childrens Hospice is the only one of its kind in Northern Ireland providing care to  children with le limiting conditions.The annual running cost of the Hospice is pound.million, that is for four rooms of the  the hospice has - the hope would be to get all  rooms funded and running.The government support is only % of this, thats why the Hospice relies so heavily on fundraising events to keep this facility running for families like ourselves.My goal in le is to keep Ruby’s memory alive and by holding her parties its raising money in Ruby’s name for the Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice.We will be forever indebted to the Hospice for all the support they gave us during Ruby’s le with respite, end of le care and all the memories we created in Horizon House. I continue to tell my story of grief and Ruby’s le on my blog Chasingladybirds it has been a good way help journey through grief and to also reach out to others in the same situation.Everyone that knew Ruby knew that ladybirds was her wee thing.When she was only a few months old a ladybird landed on her toes one summer day and thats where it all started.In my journey of grief I decided that blogging might be a good outlet and a good way to share my story and journey of grief.Chasing ladybirds came from our connection of ladybirds with Ruby, and Chasing was down to we will always chase Ruby’s memory.We will never forget our memories and love for her - we will always chase every moment we had with her.Lisa and her family would love ityou can make it to Rubys Birthday Fundraiser.Admission costs pound for adults and children go free. There will bouncing castles, soft play, face painting, nail painting, little gladiators, cake sale and a raffle with an array of great prizes,as well as Victoria Sponges with filled do-nuts.Raffle tickets cost pound a strip and can be purchased before the partythey can’t attend by contacting Lisa via Instagram: @chasingladybirds or Facebook: Lisa Powell.The fun kicks off at pm until pm and most importantly all money raised goes towards this vital cause - a poignant and fitting way to remember little Rubys legacy.

Today we come together - community, council, funders and key contributors - to celebrate its successful completion. Well done to all involved!”The completion of this second phase of works on council-owned land has created a scenic riverside trail that stretches  metres and connects Bridge Street and Gilford Community Centre to the attractive Woodlands Park, passing the iconic Gilford Mill building along the way.In addition to creating a short section of walkway over the remains of the old millrace and constructing a new footbridge across the millrace, the council undertook associated works to enhance the trail including landscaping, installing street furniture, lighting and interpretative .The second phase has been completed thanks to £, in funds allocated by SOAR’s Local Action Group. This project was part funded under Priority of the Northern Ireland Rural Development Programme - from the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs and the European Union.Chair of SOAR ABC Roisin McAliskey added: “This project has been completed to an exceptionally high standard, and is exemplary ofhow funds from SOAR’s Rural Village Renewal scheme can be used to support the implementation of local village plans.”Open to the public since July, the new trail is already proving to be a popular destination for walkers, runners and cyclists.Welcoming completion of the trail, Jerome Burns, Contracts Manager, Southern Rural Affairs Division at the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs  said: “This trail has been completed as part of a suite of village enhancement measures financed through the Village Renewal strand of the Leader Rural Development Programme. It provides a great opportunity for everyone to enjoy the many benefits of outdoor activity, and it is an excellent example of how DAERA is delivering on its vision of a ‘living, working, active landscape valued by everyone.”Given its proximity to Gilford Community Centre, this marvellous amenity set in an attractive riverside setting greatly complements the centre with its excellent indoor and outdoor facilities including a climbing wall, trim trail, picnic tables, pump track, canoe landings and beginners’ canoe slalom course.Alternative Heat are set to expand the firm Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"The council acknowledges with thanks the co-operation of the owners of Gilford Mill, Karl Asset Management, which enabled this project to proceed along with The MWA Partnership Ltd, Landscape Architects and A.G.

The event will also see launch of a groundbreaking new report that outlines a framework for community development.The paper, entitled ‘We Must Dissent’, is the result of a community survey that assessed the human rights of local residents against the major issues facing the area. Amongst the issues identied were concerns around road safety, housing, health, education, and unemployment.Another key issue was the pressures of commercial land speculation in the area, which has presented an obstacle to the community development of the Lanyon Tunnels.Despite planning permission and £.million being granted for the development, plans have been stalled by owners of an adjacent piece of land – which was subject to plans to build a £million office block.In , residents won a legal victory when the High Court ruled that planning approval for office block was unlawful. However, the potential for future plans to develop the land could impede access to the tunnelsgiven the go-ahead.Speaking ahead of next Wednesday’s event, Fionntán Hargey from the Market Development Association said the tunnels development would provide a “massive boost to people’s self esteem”.“It would physically reconnect them to city centre and it would also reconnect them into the economic, social and cultural le of Belfast. “The tunnels got planning permission in , and there is £. million in funding sitting there ready to go, and there are three groups of residents trained up and they’ve got business places developed. We also have updated drawings that have recently been commissioned. “The issue is that there is a private developer who is refusing to grant access to allow the project to go ahead.”He continued: “Next Wednesday will refresh people on the latest concept drawings and give people wider overview of the Redeveloping the Local Economy programme. Our aspiration is that by January we will be launching a report, and we will have several groups of residents with business ideas that are on course for development.” Next Wednesday’s event will take place at pm in the Market Community Centre where guest speaker, Dr Sean Byers, will discuss the economics of community empowerment. There will also be a full project update on the Lanyon Tunnels."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ballotbox_pr8qo2.png","title":"north set for december","story":"POLITICAL parties in the north have put their general election machines in gear after MPs voted for a December  poll.The legislation is expected to be approved by the end of the week when it goes through the House of Lords. MPs votedfor the election by a mammoth margin of  votes to .Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he is ready to fight a “tough” election while Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the snap poll is a “once-in-a-generation” opportunity to transform the country.DUP Leader Arlene Foster said it is right the people of Northern Ireland have their say through the ballot box.“The DUP will use this opportunity to campaign strongly to send a message that Northern Ireland is better in the Union of the United Kingdom and we cannot be separated economically from Great Britain,” she said.“We have a record of speaking up for Northern Ireland in Westminster and delivering for everyone in Northern Ireland.“At a time of great uncertainty as to who will form the next government how Northern Ireland votes will matter as never before.“Unionists need their strongest team ed to so that Northern Ireland’s interests are protected in the next Parliament.That team is the DUP.“This election will matter and we will be campaigning for every vote as we take our message to the people.”Reacting to news of a pre-Christmas election, Sinn Féin Leader in the North Michelle O’Neill said it is an opportunity to reject the DUP, reject the Tories and reject the destructive role of Westminster on the north. “It is a welcome opportunity for the people of the north to have their say on the looming disaster of Brexit,” she said.#It is a chance to reject the DUP and the Tories, to reject Brexit and the Westminster chaos and its destructive influence on the north of Ireland.#Sinn Féin has strong candidates who work tirelessly on behalf of their constituents, and we stand ready to fight this election. “Sinn Féin has successfully made the case to the Irish government and Europe that the north’s special circumstances needed to be recognised to protect our economy against the Brexit catastrophe, to avoid any hardening of the border and to protect the Good Friday Agreement. “The DUP have ignored the democratic wishes of the people of the north, of business, of farmers, of retailers. The people of the north did not consent to Brexit. “There is no good Brexit for Ireland. “Westminster is in chaos. It has no answers and no solutions.“The Brexit debacle has shown that Westminster cannot, has not and will never act in the interests of the people of the north. “Your interests in this election are best served by voting Sinn Féin for a dferent future by sending a clear message to the British government that we want control of our own future through a referendum on Irish unity.#Alliance Leader Naomi Long said her party is best-placed to unite Remain voices.“This election will be mainly focused around Brexit and Alliance has always been clear there is no such thing as a good or sensible Brexit,” she said.“Therefore it will be an opportunity for people to have their say and elect MPs who want to avoid a hard border, protect the Good Friday Agreement and attend Westminster to represent their interests. “We are uniquely placed to do that, as the Alliance surge seen in May’s local government and European Elections showed the party could reach across all sections of our community and gain support from everywhere.“We have been preparing for an election for some time, as it is clear this Parliament is hopelessly ided and the Government has no legitimacy. Northern Ireland voted to Remain. “If people vote for Alliance candidates, we can increase the representation of progressive, pro-Remain MPs and articulate that voice loudly at Westminster.”"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38648579.ece/3f117/BINARY/Sundae.jpg","title":"mcdonalds in portugal apologises for halloween social media campaign","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

New projects this year included social prescribing mdash helping people who present to their local GP to get out and about in their local area.New investment in multi-disciplinary teams in GP practices in Down was now being rolled out to the rest of Newry and Mourne. He said the Network was central to that roll-out and CDRCNrsquos experience of social prescribing made the organisation a great source of referrals to local community activities.Cllr Casey said CDRCN along with Community Advice and other umbrella support organisations were key to the delivery of Council services. He was grateful to the Network and especially to the hundreds of groups and thousands of volunteers who work away, day and night with no financial reward to make sure this area is a safe, pleasant and prosperous place to live, work and play.Alan Dumigan, CDRCN chairman, thanked the outgoing management committee for their time and expertise in bringing the Network forward.He acknowledged Board member Doris Noe, of Lecale Conservation, who, he said, had contributed her time, energy and expertise over the last number of years to the organisation and he wished her well in her retirement from the board.He thanked the community groups for their ongoing support and the management and staff for their continued commitment.The guest speaker, Dr Chris Leggett, recalled his long association with the community network and the exciting new developments. He acknowledged the importance of projects tackling social isolation and poverty and the need to address mental health and suicide in our local area.Nicholas McCrickard, CDRCN manager, presented the work of the organisation and reported that an increasing range of activities and projects were delivered to a high standard.He thanked the board and staff for a ldquofabulous year and acknowledged that the community and voluntary sector from Bangor to Crossmaglen was a thriving and creative place which was tackling issues relating to health, the economy, the environment and more.ldquoWorking together with the local Councils and Government departments is key to our success, he said. ldquoOur communities have a powerful voice coupled with large numbers of willing volunteers and we have risen to the challenge of tackling mental and physical health problems.The evening concluded with a talk from local photographer Raphael Mason on how photography can impact on peoplersquos physical and mental wellbeing. Attendees were treated to a video collection of captured scenery from around Co Down with collaborations from menrsquos groups..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/30th October 2019 Ballycran.jpg","title":"Ballycran’s dreams completely crushed by Dunloy demons  ","story":"DUNLOY powered to a comprehensive victory over a game Ballycran side at the Athletic Grounds, Armagh, on Sunday to secure their place in the Ulster Club Senior Hurling Championship final against Slaughtneil.The Antrim kingpins, who recently dethroned Cushendall to get their hands on the Volunteer Cup after a -year lapse, had things very much their own way as they step up their quest for an th Ulster title success.Early scores from Keelan Molloy, Nigel Elliott and Conal Cunning gave Dunloy a - to - lead after only six minutes.

We are being terrorised in our homes and our property is being damaged.Mrs Smyth said it was almost impossible to report incidents to the police.ldquoIf we can get through the police often donrsquot respond, she continued. ldquoThese temporary gates have been being put up for almost two years now. Torn down and put up again. Itrsquos the residents who suffer, not the council people for delays in signing off on the workthat needs to be done.The residents are being supported by local Independent councillor Cadogan Enright, who accused the council of being ldquonot exactly on top of their game.He said: ldquoThe need for fences and gates to make the area into a cul-de-sacs was triggered by an emergency situation where pensioners were and still are under siege by a small number of nersquoer-do-wells, culminating with the actual burning down of a pensionerrsquos cottage.ldquoThe council have not been treating this as an emergency. Were it not for the Housing Executive repeatedly replacing the eight temporary steel and wood barriers week after week when they are torn down, the area would be unviable as an area where pensioners can live.He added: ldquoI have proposed a workshop between the social partners led by the PSNI, Housing Executive, council and other partners to agree in detail a step-by-step process for gating orders in writing so that we never again have such a series of dreadful delays.A spokesman for the council said last night: Newry, Mourne and Down District Council can advise that the Northern Ireland Housing Executive has applied to the council for gating orders in the Model Farm area and that the Council is currently following gating order guidance produced by the Department of the Environment.ldquoThis process requires consultation with the Department for Infrastructure and members of the public in the area. A public advertisement of the proposals is then required. It is expected that this process will be complete in December .ldquoThe Policing and Community Safety Partnershiphas increased the number of Community Safety Warden patrols in this area over the last few weeks as a deterrent to reports of anti-social behaviour.ldquoThe PCSP will continue to work in partnership with the PSNI to ensure that warden patrols are appropriately deployed across the Newry, Mourne and Down District Council area where reports of anti-social behaviour have been received..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/30th October 2019 Fond.jpg","title":"Fond farewell to council chief  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council have bade farewell to their retiring chief executive, Mr Liam Hannaway.The celebratory event, which was hosted by council chairman Charlie Casey took place last Tuesday at Killeavy Castle, near Newry.Paying tribute on the evening, Cllr Casey reflected on Mr Hannawayrsquos many years in public service and his dedication to Newry, Mourne and Down Council.He said: ldquoLiam has spent  years in public service.

We will eventually cover all old estates, subject to continuing funds and satisfactory contracts.Movements have already been made with the awarding of a number of pre-paint repair contracts and work on all contracts should begin by March or April next year.More programmes of maintenance work are being prepared and will be starting in the - financial year, subject to the approval of the Executiversquos Board.CASTLEWELLAN mdash Uncertainty has surrounded the recent proposals to establish units for educationally sub-normal pupils at Castlewellan.The South Eastern Education and Library Board give approval in January for two new units to be set up at the local controlled primary school.However, plans were revised when the neighbouring school, St Malachyrsquos Primary, decided it wanted to have special ESN units.Board officers decided thatan ESN unit is established at St Malachyrsquos the demand for ESN facilities at Castlewellan Primary mightand therefore only one unit might be necessary at each school.But confusion arose when the Board placed advertisements in a local newspaper about the plans to establish the units.Castlewellan councillor, Mrs Ethel Smyth, a Board member, was unsure about whether or not the Board had changed its policy and was intended to establish the units at St Malachyrsquos instead of at the controlled school.Mrs Smyth, who has raised the matter on several occasions, told Board members, this week that she was aggrieved about the whole affair and thought that Board officers had acted in a ldquovery surreptitious manner.ldquoThis sort of thing raises suspicions in the community and itrsquos just not good enough,: said Mrs Smyth.However, she was assured by Board chairman, Mr Cecil Kirkwood, that Board officers had not acted in an underhand manner and that there had only been a misunderstanding.KILLYLEAGH mdash A Killyleagh priest had called this week for people to follow the example of friendship shown by more than  Protestants and Roman Catholics who joined together in a special Halloween dinner and concert organised by his church.He is Fr Hugh OrsquoHagan and he was speaking hours after  senior citizens had enjoyed a dinner and concert in St Maryrsquos Hall, organised by the hall management committee.Speaking afterwards Fr OrsquoHagan said that Killyleagh and Shrigley had a unique community, ldquo everywhere has like here, Northern Ireland would be a more peaceful place.Invitations to Thursdayrsquos dinner and concert went out to both sides of the community and Fr OrsquoHagan stressed that he hoped no senior citizen had been forgotten, either Protestant or Roman Catholic.The idea of the dinner mdash which was such a success last year, when he was held for the first time mdash has been widely praised in the town, especially by the senior citizens and Thursday nightrsquos was no exception, with many voting it a big hit.Before the dinner began, Fr OrsquoHagan mdash who has been priest in Killyleagh for over  years and who is the longest serving priest ever in the town mdash welcomed everyone and thanked them for coming.He welcomed especially, the three ministers in the town, the Rev J C Boggs, Rev J D Mark and Rev R E Conn.

preparing to import the generic drug from South America as part of a CF Buyers Club of families.In a desperate attempt to start their son on the drug as quickly as possible, the couple and their family fundraised around pound, to buy Lorcaacuten three months treatment.ldquoWe were so close to getting the generic drug ourselves and that would have been great as Lorcaacuten would have started on it, but we would have still been campaigning and pushing for it, said Jen.ldquoWe have been told that the Department of Health want to copy what NHS England did and get the drug into peoplersquos

The choral society gave me a taste for musical theatre and my mum really pushed me to do it. It turned out that I just loved it, added the former pupil of St Colmcillersquos High School in Crossgar and Down High School, Downpatrick.Mark performed in every musical staged by the society until his final appearance in Sunset Bouled, with music from Andrew Lloyd Webber, at the Grand Opera House in .ldquoThat role was the hardest one I had ever done, as while I have had plenty of leading roles, it was one that had me on stage in a major theatre and for nearly every scene, just as I will have to do the same in Joseph, said Mark.While Declanrsquos illness undoubtedly shook the McMullan family to its core, Mark said that he believes some good has come out of it.ldquoBefore Declan took sick in , my dream was always to go and live and work in London and do musical theatre. Unfortunately when that happened I had to put that dream on hold.ldquoI never thought I would look at it again as I knew I had to help Declan and my family, but unwittingly, the bad thing that happened to Declan has actually helped me pursue that dream even more.ldquoHe is my biggest supporter, hersquos like my manager.

Leading a presentation on Agriculture and Agri-food, Craig Humes highlighted how dairy farmers will be one of the main farming groups to be ldquostruck by Brexit.ldquo. billion litres of milk are collected from across Northern Irish farms each year.  per cent of this milk produced is then exported south to be processed.ldquoThis could make le extremely dficult for farmersexport tarfs are to be introduced, Craig shared, adding that Dr. Mike Johnston, Chief Executive of the Dairy Council Northern Ireland believes that milk prices could drop by  pence per litre should a no-deal Brexit proceed with such excessive tarfs announced.ldquoIn my opinion, to put it quite simply, dairy farmers will not survive in Fermanagh unless there is a deal, commented Craig.In her presentation on Tourism and Hospitality Rebekah Starrett noted how Fermanagh had over , visitors last year who spent an average of pound. million.ldquoThis is a massive amount of money being spent in this local economy. The tourism and hospitality industry here supports , jobs ndash one of the biggest employment sectors in the county.ldquoIf Brexit happens it could mean some businesses may need to let some staff go and leave people without a job, said Rebekah.Stating that in her opinion Brexit offers the tourism and hospitality sector many innovative opportunities to potentially grow and expand, Rebekah shared some examples.ldquoThere has been a rise in lsquostaycationrsquo ndash the number of UK residents that have been staying and holidaying at homehas shown a three per cent rise in  and is continuing to grow something which would be good for Fermanagh Tourism, explained Rebekah, who also highlighted how Fermanagh is renowned for its celebrity chefs, award-winning restaurants and local produce which will continue to attract visitors to the County.Presenting facts on Business and Cross Border Trade, Nicole McFarlane and Oran OrsquoLoughlin shared how Enniskillen has the lsquotop performing ASDA store in the UKrsquo which was the th best store in Walmart Worldwide Group in  and that an average shopping trip spend by Republic of Ireland shoppers to Enniskillen is euro to euro.ldquoCross Border trade stands at pound. billion for  and Northern Ireland makes up between  to  per cent of total exports from Ireland to the UK and accounts for seven to eight per cent of imports, stated Nicole and Oran, adding that the flow of trade between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland will depend on what kind of agreement replaces the current one which is free market trade within the EU. Sharing a positive outlook on how Brexit could impact business trade, the studentsrsquo stated: ldquoBrexit could actually result in more opportunities in more vibrant markets across the world becoming available. Some argue that Brexit could liberate the UK government to sign fresh trade deals with more dynamic markets outside the EU and therefore bolster trade.Whilst presenting his research on how Brexit could impact Student Le, Jordan McClure shared: ldquoStudent le is a vital part of growing up where we learn many things. Brexit has taught me the importance of ensuring that my opinion and voice is heard, especially, when I wasnrsquot the age to vote in the  referendum.ldquoWhilst much of what happens around Brexit is beyond our control one thing for sure is that the potential impact will affect all of our lives.

The party has shrunken considerably in North Belfast over the last decade. Robert Foster, an Antrim and Newtownabbey councillor, was the UUP candidate in the  assembly election, the last time the party contested North Belfast in an election. Last night he told the News Letter he had no ambition to be candidate this time, citing his business and council work.Another potential candidate, Mark Cosgrove, the UUP’s treasurer and the party’s group leader on Antrim and Newtownabbey Council, said that due to business commitments and his council work he did not want to be a full-time politician.Yesterday the Belfastpublished a letter signed by  north Belfast unionists who called on Mr Aiken not to contest the constituency. One of those who signed the letter, Dean McCullough, was described as chair of Rathcoole Neighbourhood Renewal. It did not mention that Mr McCullough is also a DUP councillor, and therefore might be expected to endorse the party policy of allowing Mr Dodds a free run.When asked about that, Mr McCullough told the News Letter that his DUP political role was not mentioned in the letter because he had signed it in his community capacity.The letter was signed by other unionists from ious backgrounds, including PUP leader Billy Hutchinson and Belfast County Grand Master of the Orange Order, Spencer Beattie.NI people offended as McDonalds Portugal apologises over Sundae Bloody Sundae Halloween advertising campaign Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"It was also signed by a sitting UUP councillor, Frazer Agnew, and someone who was a UUP councillor until May,Davy Browne.The letter set out “strong opposition” to the policy espoused by Mr Aiken, arguing that the “only consequence” of challenging Mr Dodds would be to help Sinn Fein.The letter, which was restrained in tone, said: “The North Belfast seat holds a special place in the heart of the unionist community across Northern Ireland. The seat once held by Edward Carson, since its creation, North Belfast has always ed a unionist Member of Parliament.“For decades the unionist community in North Belfast faced the brunt of the sectarian murder campaign of the IRA. It was the collective unwavering resolve and unity of purpose amongst our community that gave us the strength to carry on. It is that sense of unity and standing together that continues to define the unionist community in North Belfast to this day.“Whilst we the undersigned come from dferent political viewpoints, as unionists, we are all united in our desire to ensure North Belfast s a unionist Member of Parliament.”It went on: “Nigel Dodds has been the collective choice of our united unionist community in North Belfast.“The only consequence of running a candidate against Nigel will be to help Sinn Fein. Only Nigel can retain this seat.”When asked for Mr Aiken’s response to the letter, the UUP responded with a brief statement from a party spokesman.The statement did not state unambiguously – as Mr Aiken did earlier this week – that the party will unquestionably be standing in North Belfast.Instead, it simply said: “The letter has been received and we are listening respectfully to all views in the community.”The last time the UUP stood in North Belfast constituency was the  assembly election the party took , votes. In the  general election, even with the UUP standing aside, Sinn Fein was just , votes behind Mr Dodds.l Morning View, page ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"traffic and travel","story":" getRequiredClientIdforjpiconsole.log requiredClientIdcatch]EV.Core.updateUserProfile]EV.Core.updateUserProfile....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive any of the following newsletters from Belfast News Letter, via email Daily news, news features and service updates\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". ss+s+  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+]]]]]]]]]]]]]] initInArticleOnlySiteText, initArticleSiteText, isInArticleOnlyTemplateReady. s isArticleTemplateReady. s addCustomTextToSiteTemplate addSiteName.html  -- -- Traffic and Travel   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business Subscribe#jp #login-widget #login-flip.flip RegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health Opinion People Read This News Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health Opinion People Read This Sport Football Rugby Union Motorcycling More Sport Sport Opinion Whats On Arts  Entertainment Things To Do Nightle Lestyle Retro Cars Homes Must Read           Traffic and Travel      Four vehicle road traffic collision on N.I. road - emergency services at sceneThe PSNI is at the scene of a four vehicle road traffic collision.

There was no power or water so we had to boil water at home for tea and coffee.ldquoThe new one has a sink, microwave and wersquore getting a fridge.

A former head of two other schools in Gwent, he is clearly proud of his school and all they have accomplished.ldquoItrsquos a wonderful school and everyone here has worked so hard to make it that way, he said. ldquoBut it does face challenges.Like other head teachers in Penarth, Mr Rees had signed the open letter to the Welsh Government calling for fairer funding for Vale schools earlier this year. He had discussed coming in to the school on weekends to clean the toilets himself to help balance budgets. But he is firmly optimistic.ldquoBetween kind donations and fundraising efforts from our PTA, renting out the school hall, and younger members of staff taking on some extra burdens we are just about able to balance our budgets, he said. ldquoTo be honest, next year might start looking grim, but wersquore keeping our heads high.ldquoWith that said, wersquove been working hard on incorporating new initiatives and the new curriculum, we have a great crop of pupils and staff morale is high. We are very positive here.ldquoItrsquos also our th anniversary this year, so we have loads of ex-staff and pupils coming through the doors to say hello, a celebratory PTA barbecue and more planned.Taking a tour around the school, this positivity is reflected in students and staff alike. Children seem genuinely excited to learn, smiling, waving and saying hello to Mr Rees.Evenlode Primary School itself has an interesting history.It was opened in  as the first open plan primary school in South East Wales.The population of the school has risen dramatically over the last  years, from  on roll in  to the present .The building itself, a maze of classrooms and corridors plastered in colours, has also changed to accommodate more pupils.Much of the semi-open plan design has disappeared, making way for more conventional classrooms.The school benefits from having a superb site with two playgrounds as well as a large playing field, a designated play area for Reception children, a wildle area, open access to the local tennis club facilities, a newly constructed lsquooutside classroomrsquo and adventure trail.One of the first stops was a hall used by its lsquoSaplingsrsquo Out of School Care, the pre and after-school club for children.Saplings provides childcare for around  children from all year groups, providing breakfast in the morning and looking after children from .am to pm when needed.There, the children can access a wide range of activities, switched up on a regular basis.These have included cooking, gardening, art, crafts, sporting activities, outdoor play and plenty more.A couple of pupils, part of the Saplings, are called through. They happily talk about their favourite part of the clubs. One says arts and crafts another, going outside and playing sport four more say the food.Saplings isnrsquot the only place the students can indulge in a little food.Pupils have set up a fruit tuck shop in the school yard, a group endeavour that students control all aspects of - from placing orders for snacks, selecting the products, handling finances and, of course, selling to their friends.A small group of budding merchants were excited to show me their wares, selling oranges and bananas at break time.There was plenty more to do outside, as well.Mr Rees himself taught fire-making lessons in their fire pit, while the school also made use of rope courses, and a newly refurbished gazebo.Bike racks could be found at the front and back of the site, with students encouraged to cycle to school.Sport is very high on the schoolrsquos agenda.ldquoWe have kids from the school representing us in cricket, rugby and tennis at a county level, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore also fielding regular football, rugby and netball teams, and we are pushing plenty of other outdoor activities - like our new ropes and outdoor assault course.ldquoWersquore lucky to have parents in this area who are incredibly supportive of sports, and we have some shining examples of sporting prowess in our children.ldquoWe think itrsquos a very important part of being a rounded and healthy inidual.The school doesnrsquot just focus on sport - they aim to nurture minds and souls too.ldquoExpressive arts is a major area of focus at the moment, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore lucky enough to have a drama specialist supporting us, helping coach the children through both acting and production.ldquoWe are even working with the Welsh Government on a production of H.G. Wellrsquos The Time Machine, to be held in our school hall.The hall had been built with money raised from selling off surplus land, with a further loan from the Vale council.It is tidy, modern, and neatly decorated, with a sophisticated looking lighting system - built with help from parents.ldquoWersquore very proud of the relationship we have with parents here, said Mr Rees. ldquoThey have been enormously helpful with our budgetary concerns.Evenlode is a school with a cheerful outlook, a happy student body and a strong working relationship between staff, students and parent alike.It deserves to go far. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the past he chaired the all-party Parliamentary group on nuisance calls and secured changes to the law to restrict cold telephone calling.ldquoThere have been a number of complaints about the increase in nuisance callers and the rise of the doorstep economy in the Vale of Glamorgan. Ahead of the clocks going back, Alun wants to provide constituents with a proven means of reducing the number of doorstep callers.Welsh Labour parliamentary candidate for the Vale, Belinda Loveluck-Edwards said: ldquoIt appears that Alun Cairns is using public money to try and block his political opponents from speaking to voters. This must be investigated.ldquoThis is a deliberate attempt to present a  equivalence between genuine political canvassing and those who would wish to scam vulnerable people.ldquoMany people will be deeply unsettled by this behaviour from Cairns at the same time as the Tories are attempting to suppress votes by making it a requirement to show ID at polling stations- a move that will disproportionately affect working class, ethnic minority and young voters.ldquoThis is not how politics should be done. In contrast, Welsh Labour is opening up politics by extending votes to  and  year olds in future Assembly elections.

We need a UK Labour Government that will stand up for the many.The Tories have been cutting budgets for nearly  years now.Since  they have scrapped over , frontline police officers.In the last year alone more than , children were pushed into absolute poverty.Boris Johnson has sought to ide our country.Labour would immediately raise the minimum wage to pound an hour for all ages, increase funding to Welsh Government for the NHS, and kickstart a green revolution.On Saturday it is expected that MPs willto Westminster to sit for a highly unusual session in Parliament, as we reach the critical stage of the Brexit process.Weekend sittings are very rare, and the House has only sat on four Saturdays since  ndash on September ,  at the outbreak of World War II on July , as a final summer sitting on November ,  to debate the Suez Crises and on April ,  over the Falkland Islands invasion.A Saturday sitting, two days after the EU summit, is likely to be a decisive moment in determining the future of our country.Saturday will also see a lsquoTogether for the Final Sayrsquo march to Parliament Square.When a similar march took place earlier this year an estimated million people of all ages, from every corner of the UK and from all walks of le, took part ndash including many from Penarth and Cardf who travelled to London to make their voices heard.Their message was absolutely clear then ndash and mine remains the same now - that the people must be given a final say on this Brexit disaster. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

His father was West African and his mother was Irish.Billy was overlooked by rugby union. However he is recognised as one of the greatest ever British rugby league players.Elizabeth lsquoBettyrsquo Campbell, also born in  in Butetown, was the first black head teacher in Wales.Following a public vote on hidden heroines Cardf Council confirmed earlier this year that a statue of Betty will be built in Cardf - the first woman to feature in our capital city.On the weekend I will be on a question and answer  about institutionalised racism in Wales, across sport, the media, politics, and the world of work.I look forward to sitting on the  with Cllr Saeed Ebrahim, lawyer Hilary Brown, and Chisomo Phiri from EYST.As more and more Black History Month events take place across Wales, I cannot help but feel a sense of pride in how far we have come as a nation.I hope that these events continue to inspire the next generation of young black leaders as we still have so much more to change.To all my constituents, to everyone across Wales, I hope you all join in with the celebrations and festivities of this historic month, attend the events, learn about those that have trailblazed for us and make this a Black History Month to remember. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It would require the removal of seven of the  ancient trees in the Conservation Area.Many of the trees had been assessed in September  as deserving of a Tree Protection Order, which would prevent them from being cut down, though the Vale council has said they are in the process of securing the protection orders.Residents say one ndash Ash Tree , crucial to development ndash has already been removed. John Lean, a resident of Kymin Terrace, said: ldquoAround a week ago, the first ash tree was sawn down. It was painted as a routine tidying up of their grounds, that it was sick, and was carried out not by the architects who made the main application, but by the warden. We do not believe there was anything wrong with that tree.ldquoAn application was made under Section  of the Planning Acts for the removal of Ash Tree , another tree not in the wood but next to the house, and the removal of a fallen tree. No notice was given to local residents the Vale council did not inspect the site before permission was given, and the first we knew of it was when we heard the chainsaws.Ash Tree  would have to be removed for any development to take place, to allow construction traffic to pass.David Burnett, a resident, said: ldquoThis creates a dangerous precedent for further development here.ldquoWhen the construction of Homeside House was permitted on appeal in , the inspector at the time made it clear that it should not impinge on the woodland. The woodland was described as lsquoinviolatersquo ndash itrsquos at least  years old. What was true then is true now. Other residents had further complaints about the proposed development, and the methodology used to carry out inspections.The large footprint of the dwelling occupies over half the site. The access road would also have to be able to take construction traffic, which residents fear would further damage the site and could limit parking.One resident described a bat survey as lsquocompletely inadequatersquo, as the resident said the survey carried out on behalf of the applicant noted observation was made on two occasions only.William and Karen Stonehouse said: ldquoThe development would involve the destruction of a valuable natural habitat without any benefit to the community whatsoever.ldquoPenarth is not short of expensive properties. It is affordable housing that is desperately needed to prevent the continuing drain of its young people who can no longer afford to buy any property here.ldquoThis proposal does nothing to address that.Joanna Masters said: ldquoI am very concerned about the proposed plan to fell the wood.ldquoI thought the world was becoming more environmentally aware, particularly regarding the value of trees, but it seems the Vale council is, in its own way, as irresponsible as Brazilrsquos Bolsonaro.A spokesman for the Vale council said: ldquoThis planning application has yet to be determined and will be considered in exactly the same way as any other, with the views of all interested parties taken into account.ldquoThat will involve reviewing all letters of representation and consultation responses on the matter. IldquoIt has been resubmitted after a previous one for a similar development was withdrawn as it failed to provide full details of the impact on nearby trees.ldquoWe are in the process of arranging Tree Preservation Orders for trees there that meet the criteria for that protection.ldquoThe council did approve an application to fell an ash tree from Homeside House as, after inspection by an officer, it was deemed to have a fungal bracket, which can structurally weaken trees to the point of breakage.

Their sole motive has been about blocking Brexit.I have long thought the only way out of this is a general election.The British people need to be given the opportunity to have a clear out of those politicians who said one thing to get elected and have done another in office.All Labour and Conservative MPs were elected on manestos explicitly promising to respect and honour the referendum result.The people of Penarth deserve better than this.Earlier this month, I was present on the steps of the Senedd as the petition to save the Sam Davies ward at Barry Hospital was presented to the Assembly.I joined other local representatives and campaigners from Unison to receive the petition, and send a clear message on the health boardrsquos proposals.Under the plans, the -bed older persons rehabilitation ward will close, with services transferring either to the community or Llandough Hospital.Local opinion in Barry is quite clear that the ward should stay, while in Llandough, further expansion of the hospital will cause further pressures on the village.You wonrsquot often catch me standing alongside Unison, but on this we completely agree.These plans need to be dropped.The Royal British Legion have officially launched the  Poppy Appeal, and as ever, I am delighted to pledge my support.It is crucial we commemorate those who made the ultimate sacrice to defend our freedoms, including those from Penarth.Wearing a poppy is an understated yet clear way of demonstrating that, and it also raises vital funds to support current and former servicemen and women and their families.It is often misunderstood as condoning or celebrating war, and that could not be further from the truth. It is respecting those who have fallen.Irsquod like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Royal British Legion for their work. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

She said she would interpret a strong SNP result at the election as an endorsement for another referendum, and urged ldquosavvy voters to back her party ldquoto make sure Scotlandrsquos voice is heard ndash eventhey are in favour of the union.ldquoIf people in Scotland demonstrate the desire ndash as I believe they will in this election ndash for an independence referendum, then I donrsquot believe Westminster opposition to the principle or to the timetable to that will prove to be sustainable, she said.ldquoEverybody knows therersquos going to be an independence referendum. The opposition parties might not have got round to conceding that point in public, but they know it and everybody knows it.While Ms Sturgeon has held talks with Mr Corbyn recently, she revealed they did not discuss the issue of independence.ldquoThe discussions Irsquove had with Jeremy Corbyn over recent months have been understandably about Brexit and the tactics in the House of Commons, she said.ldquoI met with him last week ndash that was the most recent occasion ndash and that was about Brexit and the prospects, as they were then, of an election.ldquoI donrsquot think Jeremy Corbyn is under any illusions, though, about my position around independence and a referendum. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Nicola Sturgeon said she is sure Jeremy Corbyn will approve another vote on independence  --Claiming that there is a ldquohuge appetite for both a second Brexit and Scottish referendum in , Ms Sturgeon said she would send a letter ldquobefore Christmas to whoever is in  Downing Street requesting powers under Section  of the Scotland Act  to grant the Scottish Parliament powers to hold another vote.Ms Sturgeon also warned of a future where ldquoyoursquoll have Nigel Farage and Donald Trump pulling Boris Johnsonrsquos strings, following the US presidentrsquos comments that Mr Johnson and the Brexit Party leader working together would be ldquounstoppable.She added: ldquoA Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson coalition would be scary, I know Halloween was yesterday, but itrsquos the kind of Halloween monster that no one in Scotland wants to see.ldquoBut whether therersquos a formal deal between Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage or not, everybody knows that the Tory Party is currently morphing into the Brexit Party and thatrsquos the future unless Scotland positively and actively chooses an alternative, votes to escape the Brexit horror show and instead puts our future into our own hands.Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie accused Labour of being willing to grant another referendum, while he said the Conservatives are ldquoproposing a border down the middle of the Irish Sea.He said: ldquoScotland doesnrsquot need another independence referendum. -- --ldquoScottish Liberal Democrats are now the only ones who can be trusted to stand up for the union. If you want a party who will stand up for Scotland in the UK, you need to vote for the Liberal Democrats.Scottish Conservative acting leaderJackson Carlaw said: ldquoNicola Sturgeon is not listening ndash she is obsessed with independence and we must send her a message at this general election.ldquoPeople have had enough of the ision and we just want to move on.ldquoNicola Sturgeon and I can finally agree on one thing. Therersquos little doubt now that as prime minister, Jeremy Corbyn would cave in to the SNP on another referendum immediately.ldquoGiven that, itrsquos little wonder Nicola Sturgeon is already having private chats with him.ldquoShe is rolling out the red carpet for him because she knows hersquoll give her what she craves ndash another independence referendum..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Nicola Sturgeon confident Jeremy Corbyn would allow indyref article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--Promoted Stories       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

There is fierce competition to host the All Ireland Fleadh each year as it attracts thousands of visitors and musiciaans from across the world. Councillor Mark BaxterAt Monday night’s meeting Sinn Fein welcomed the success of their motion, tabled by the party’s group leader Darren McNally, which asked council to investigate the feasibility and economic benefits of hosting the Fleadh Cheoil Na hEireann in Armagh.Cllr McNally said it would be ‘a massive economic boost for the entire borough’ with a potential £m for the economy.“I believe Armagh would be a very fitting venue given the rich ancient heritage and culture the city possesses’”#However DUP Cllr Mark Baxter said: ““We are hugely disappointed that we were the only party to vote against this potential colossal spend by council in these very tough economic times. The other parties were quite happy to task officers to investigate bringing the Fleadh Cheoil to Armagh despite the huge cost involved.” “Ironically it was only three weeks ago that Sinn Fein refused to back another much smaller proposal for a community event citing a lack of council resources. I would question in the strongest possible terms the economic benefits and the motives for bringing such an event and why the UUP and Sinn Fein are so keen to bring the event to Armagh which has in the past had some very controversial artists. Indeed we all can point to similar festivals recently held in Belfast where its very clear that ‘unionists’ were not welcome with Pro-IRA chanting and bands imploring the British to “go back home. “I would call on councillors to reflect on this wanton disregard for the public purse and remind them of their responsibilities in delivering first class services for best value. The DUP make no apology for being the champions of low rates in council.”Sinn Fein Cllr Liam Mackle dismissed claims by the DUP‘s Mark Baxter that the motion committed council to a massive spend as untrue.He said: “The passing of this motion gives council officers the freedom to engage with numerous stakeholders holders including Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann who organise the Fleadh Cheoil to get a better understanding of what’s expected of any host venue, Council officers will bring back a report to committee following engagements with local businesses, hospitality sector, community groups and traditional musicians, where Councillors can have an informed debate on its feasibility.“We have seen the DUP on ABC council spend hundreds of thousands of pounds on a whim - on events with no economic benefit to our borough. Their behaviour is somewhat childish, compared to the mature approach of this motion.”Musician Willie calls for better rehabilitation for stroke survivors Coremetrics  Coremetrics

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals.

The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall. The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.  Danske Bank’s Conor Lambe said there were still a number of possibilities for what might happen over the next  days, with the UK due to leave the EU on October . Possibilities included a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of Article  period or a general election. But predictions were \"incredibly dficult\", he said. \"Businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month,\" he said. The .% is down from the bank’s previous forecasts, delivered in June, that growth would hit % in  and .% in . In its latest Northern Ireland Quarterly Sectoral Forecasts report, Danske Bank said that the Northern Ireland economy likely expanded in the second quarter of the year, but the rate of growth over the first half of the year remained modest. “We have revised our forecast for economic growth in Northern Ireland downwards for both  and ,” he said. “This largely reflects the modest data for the first half of the year, increased Brexit-related uncertainty and the weaker global economic environment. “Assuming that a no-deal Brexit is avoided, we expect the Northern Ireland economy to grow by .% in  and .% in , below the .% we expect UK GDP to grow by in both years. “A combination of strong wage growth and more stable inflation is likely to lead to solid growth in consumer spending, but the lack of clarity around the UK’s future relationship with the EU is expected to continue holding back business investment.” It says the information and communication, and professional, scientic  technical services sectors are expected to be the fastest growing parts of the economy over the next two years.

Ulster Business speaks to Northern Ireland managing director Ian Sheppard, and learns more about how colleagues are being empowered to play an active role in the local communities where they live and work Bank of Ireland UK sees developing its colleagues and helping customers and communities to thrive as part of its DNA, according to Ian Sheppard, managing director in Northern Ireland.From key charity partnerships, to fundraising, volunteering, sponsorship and more, Ian says the desire for Bank of Ireland UK is to make a positive impact by empowering colleagues to make a dference.“When I speak to my colleagues, I hear how really active and involved they are in their own community,” Ian says. “There are so many examples and I never cease to be amazed by their passion and commitment.An important partnership for the bank is with Alzheimer’s Society, its flagship charity for the last two years. In that time around £, has been raised in Northern Ireland, but as Ian explains it’s about more than fundraising.“We realised that not only can we help them financially, but there are resources we can share and opportunities we can offer which can help to signicantly raise the charity’s profile and raise much needed funds.”One example in which the bank has supported Alzheimer’s Society in this way is through its own long-running partnership with Ulster Rugby.“We donated our advertising and promotion activity for a televised game at the Kingspan Stadium making the charity ‘Sponsor for a Day’. This included using their logo on the back of the Ulster Rugby jerseys, taking over the pitch side boards and inviting a group of people living with dementia, their family and carers to the game – helping to get their brand message out to not only a stadium with capacity of , people but to a much wider TV audience.”Alzheimer’s Society sees some fantastic people giving their time to help others. That’s no clearer than its Side by Side programme, which Bank of Ireland UK helps to fund.The photograph on the front of this edition of the magazine taken at the Grand Opera House in Belfast features Mary Dalzell a Side by Side volunteer, alongside Hazel Whiteside, who has been living with dementia for two years.They share a love of music, theatre and cinema and the Side by Side programme, which re-connects people with dementia to their communities by doing the things they love, has not only put a smile on both their faces but has had a positive impact on their lives.There are so many people impacted by dementia and Alzheimers in our local communities, and its touching so many people’s lives, taking this as our motivation, the bank now has almost , staff trained as Dementia Friends.The bank’s ‘Give Together’ programme means staff can take one day a year to spend the time working with a charity or community organisation of their choice. “This day can involve anything from gardening work to painting a youth centre,” Ian says“Beyond Alzheimer’s Society, colleagues are helping many other organisations such as Macmillan Cancer Support, Cancer Research UK through its Relay for Le Legenderry, the Wooden Spoon children’s rugby charity, and Space NI, which offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community.” You canabout some of the good work colleagues have done further on in this feature.“We are also committed to reflecting the community by developing a erse and modern workforce – which is part-and-parcel of a progressive company,” Ian says. “It’s something that current and future employees expect in their employer. For us its part of our DNA, something that’s always been there but we are now putting a clear and visible structure around it,” Ian says.This has included being a founding member of FuSIoN – the Financial Services Inclusion Network which drives to support and promote LGBT+ professionals across the sector, becoming JAM Card members – allowing staff to knowcustomers with a communication barrier need ‘just a minute’, as well as recently being awarded the Diversity Charter Mark.“Our community involvement is something we are very clear about - something I’m passionate about and it’s an easy ask to get staff engaged. It’s very natural, and it has always been developed from the ground up,” Ian says.He believes this contributes to the huge numbers of staff doing their bit – enabling their own local communities to thrive.  ALISON MITCHELLA customer service manager for Bank of Ireland UK in Londonderry, Alison has worked for the bank for  years, but her motivation for fundraising and support for Alzheimer’s Society began in , following her mother-in-law’s diagnosis with dementia. Alison trained at her local hospital to become a dementia volunteer and learned so much she asked Alzheimer’s Society to run similar sessions in her own branch to enable staff to better assist customers with dementia.Sadly, Alison’s mother-in-law passed away in May of this year but to mark her passing and to raise vital funds in her memory, Alison took part in Alzheimer’s Society Cupcake Day. Initial plans to simply sell cupcakes within her own branch changed rapidly as colleagues from nearby branches heard of the event and wanted to support both Alison and the charity.  Faced with orders for more than  cupcakes, Alison requested a Give Together day, which is time given by the bank to both iniduals and teams to give back to their communities. Alison says: “I was in the kitchen from am to pm baking and icing but it was worth it. The event raised £, which Bank of Ireland UK matched doubling the amount raised to £,. “I could not have achieved that without the support of family, colleagues and the wider business. I was proud to raise the funds in my mother-in-law’s memory and I am proud to work for an organisation that not only values our role in the wider community but supports it too.” CHRISTINE GRAHAMChristine Graham has helped to raise funds for Cancer Research UK through the Relay for Le “Legenderry” event held in St. Columb’s Park, Londonderry.The Derry-based senior business manager for Bank of Ireland UK has personally been touched by cancer as she lost two close family members to the disease. Her young great niece was also diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in  and is now doing well, but seeing the impact a cancer diagnosis has on a family inspired Christine to get involved with the Relay for Le event.“Our event truly is ‘legenderry’,” she says. It is a -hour relay race that brings the whole community together to celebrate the lives of cancer survivors, to remember those lost to the disease, to fight back by increasing our knowledge of cancer and by raising money to fund le-saving cancer research.”In just three years the event has raised over £, for Cancer Research UK with Christine helping to raise £, in  – not only the most successful Relay for Le event in the UK this year but all funds raised in Northern Ireland stays here.  Christine values the support she has had from the bank who promote the event to the wider community and from her colleagues who enter teams.“Relay for Le is for all ages and stages, all shapes and sizes,” she says. It’s cross community and intergenerational and the atmosphere every year is electric.”Plans are already underway for Relay for Le  which promises to be another massive event. PAUL MAGEEPaul Magee, associate director of the corporate banking team, became involved with the Ulster Region Committee for Wooden Spoon, the Children’s Charity of Rugby, five years ago after he successfully completed the charity’s Four Peaks Challenge, reaching the summits of the UK and Ireland’s highest peaks. He is now an active committee member for Wooden Spoon, helping to raise funds to provide le-enhancing experiences for disadvantaged and disabled children. “All funds raised in Ulster stay in the region and benefit the children here,” Paul says. “For instance, we provided £, to the Mae Murray Foundation to buy specialist equipment for the first fully accessible beach in Ulster at Benone Strand. When we created the access to the beach, one parent was very emotional as he watched his teenage daughter in the sea for the first time. It’s those occasions where we’re responding to a need within the community that makes the effort worthwhile.”Wooden Spoon has funded numerous charity projects, most recently £, for a new multi-sensory room at Parkview Special School in Lisburn and purchasing a horse for Riding for the Disabled Association in Coleraine, a charity that enhances children’s lives every day.  With his passion for and involvement in Wooden Spoon, Paul is grateful for the support Bank of Ireland has given him in his role with the organisation, specically the corporate banking team who value his dedication to making a dference. He says: “The bank has been fantastic – I appreciate the flexibility the team offers in the lead up to events and my colleagues often attend Wooden Spoon fundraisers. I’ve also benefited from the bank’s Give Together initiative, which offers days of paid leave that employees can use for volunteering. The bank’s support has helped facilitate my commitment to Wooden Spoon, where I can really see and be a part of the impact the charity has on the local community.” SALLY IRVINEOver the last  years Sally Irvine’s coffee mornings have become a highlight in the office calendar, in turn raising more than £, for MacMillan Cancer Support and funding  days of specialist nursing care for cancer patients across Northern Ireland.Sally, a business lending and credit governance manager at Bank of Ireland UK, arranged her first Macmillan Coffee Morning in  following a colleague’s cancer diagnosis. She found herself wanting to do something to help people living with cancer and so took the plunge and decided to be a host as part of Macmillan’s biggest coffee morning fundraising event. From the outset, Sally had tremendous support from her team members and the wider business, and this has contributed to the ongoing success of the event.The bank plays a huge part in ensuring Sally can deliver the event each year by giving her support through their Give Together scheme.Sally says: “The coffee morning has become a very special occasion and a great day of fun where people from across the bank come together to have a wee cuppa and a cake and take time to catch up while raising money for a really important cause. One in two of us will face cancer at some time in our lives and I am passionate about continuing to fundraise to provide the specialist nursing care that’s so vital for those living with cancer.”Plans are already underway for this year’s Macmillan Coffee Morning and Sally is hopeful the annual fundraiser will continue to hold a special place in the office calendar. PAUL SLEVINBranch manager at Bank of Ireland UK in Newry, Paul Slevin is someone who embodies the bank’s ethos of community involvement through his role with the charity Space NI.  Space NI offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community. Through its service Home to Hospital, the organisation has helped  elderly people travel to crucial hospital appointments, while its Family Support Hub offers vital assistance to families in distress. Paul joined the charity in  and has just completed five years as chairman of the Board of Directors. He is proud that his background in finance has enabled him to support the charity through its repositioning process to ensure that its activities best serve the community.  Since Paul’s involvement with the charity began, Space NI has won the ‘One to Watch’ award at NI Social Enterprise Awards and the ‘Community Wellbeing Initiative’ at the All Ireland Pride of Place Awards. The organisation has also grown and opened a third premises in Newry and launched a range of volunteer made soy wax candles to raise crucial funds. “Bank of Ireland UK encourage all staff to give back,” Paul says. “Every manager I’ve had was very active in their community, so they were both great role models and great motivators. I think it’s really important to give our time, our expertise, and to do whatever we can to help and support the communities we live and work in.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/12312323.jpg","title":"novosco sold to global services giant for m","story":"Posted on Monday  October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland IT services firm Novosco has been bought by a German-based global industry giant for around £m, it has emerged.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"We’ve got a great new deal that takes back control — now Parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday so we can move on to other priorities like the cost of living, the NHS, violent crime and our environment.\" Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, said: “This agreement is a fair compromise between the EU and the UK. It is testament to the commitment and willingness of both sides to do what is best for EU and UK citizens. We now have a newly agreed Protocol that protects peace and stability on the island of Ireland and fully protects our Single Market. I hope that we can now bring this over the line and provide the certainty our citizens and businesses so deserve.” Michel Barnier, the European Commissions chief negotiator, said: “We had dficult discussions over the past days. We have managed to find solutions that fully respect the integrity of the Single Market. We created a new and legally operative solution to avoid a hard border, and protect peace and stability on the island of Ireland. It is a solution that works for the EU, for the UK and for people and businesses in Northern Ireland.” The DUP has said it could not support the deal brokered by Mr Johnson. So, what deal was agreed  A statement from the European Commission says: “In terms of regulations, Northern Ireland will remain aligned to a limited set of rules related to the EUs Single Market in order to avoid a hard border: legislation on goods, sanitary rules for veterinary controls , rules on agricultural production marketing, VAT and excise in respect of goods, and state aid rules. “In terms of customs, the EU-UK Single Customs Territory, as agreed in November , has been removed from the Protocol on Ireland   Northern Ireland, at the request of the current UK government. EU and UK negotiators have now found a new way to achieve the goal of avoiding a customs border on the island of Ireland, while at the same time ensuring Northern Ireland remains part of the UKs customs territory. This agreement fully protects the integrity of the EUs Single Market and Customs Union, and avoids any regulatory and customs checks at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. “Finally, the EU and the UK have agreed to create a new mechanism on ‘consent, which will give the Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly a decisive voice on the long-term application of relevant EU law in Northern Ireland. The Commission has been in close contact with the Irish government on this point.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/redbus.jpg","title":"wrightbus deal struck to buy ballymena bus maker","story":"Posted on Tuesday  October  by John Mulgrew A deal has been struck to buy the business and assets of Ballymena bus maker Wrightbus after it entered administration with the loss of , jobs.

We hear about the firm’s plans for growth hereBelfast City is changing and its transportation network and parking strategy have a key role to play in supporting its growth. Innovative use of technology to make parking ‘smarter’ and promoting better use of city centre space will contribute to creating the right environment for business investment and the lestyle of residents, commuters and visitors. The need for effective parking planning reaches beyond Belfast city though as parking issues are common in towns across the country. Parking planning is not just about the provision and management of spaces – the majority of parking acts require some sort of enforcement system to ensure effectiveness. As an experienced parking operator, APCOA can work with the public and private sectors to contribute knowledge and expertise to the planning and implementation of effective parking strategies. An on-going investment in developing parking technology also offers new ways of improving services to clients and the public.In August, APCOA acquired the business of Nationwide Controlled Parking Systemsin Ireland, including subsidiaries Parking Enforcement Solutionsand Mobile Research Solutions.The combined operation resulting from the acquisition sees APCOA’s business in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland double in size to cover more than , site locations and it will enable them to service all counties in both countries.APCOA’s existing business in Northern Ireland operated a number of sites including two city centre multi storey car parks in Belfast city centre. The NCPS subsidiary PEA brings a further c. locations, primarily in the greater Belfast area with key sites such as the Titanic Quarter, numerous NHS hospitals and trusts and the Odyssey. APCOA sees this investment as strengthening their position in Northern Ireland and providing a  for increased growth.Combining the existing APCOA expertise and customer base across both countries, this acquisition now makes APCOA a leading mobile parking operator in cashless parking providing convenient, cashless and cost-effective payment options to nearly , parking customers.Both APCOA and NCPS see this as a real opportunity to broaden the strength of services to clients and to improve capabilities by bringing together the best knowledge, systems and operational practice. Kim Challis, regional managing director for APCOA UK  Ireland, said: “The businesses complement each other well across dferent geographies and business sectors and both have strong management and operational teams.  “There are opportunities to share innovation and technology solutions from both companies across the whole business, and also to benefit from the on-going investment and business experience that comes from APCOA UK  Ireland being part of a larger European group. We’re really excited about the opportunities ahead.”Neil Cunningham, managing director of APCOA in Ireland, explains why he sees the acquisition as a positive move for the business in Northern Ireland.“This investment strengthens APCOA’s ability to offer countrywide services and gives us a stronger base for future growth. Colleagues in both companies have a keen focus on customer service and we’ve brought together two experienced management teams.“I’m also delighted that Jason Ballard, founder and chief executive of NCPS and PEA, will continue to work with us for the next six months to support the smooth integration of the business. Combine those factors with the wide range of services and innovative technology we can offer, the possibilities for further growth in Northern Ireland look very strong indeed.”  Philippe Op de Beeck, chief executive of APCOA Parking Group, says the company “profited from healthy organic growth last year”. “In addition, we are currently strengthening our focus on strategic acquisitions.“The group recently acquired Onepark A S in Denmark, after having bought another smaller Swiss company early last year. With every acquisition, we have pursued a clear strategy: not to become a property owner. Thanks to its consistent ‘asset light’ business model, APCOA has established itself as a reliable partner, maximising the value of both private and public property owners’ assets. “At the same time, APCOA offers consumers a range of products and services that are increasingly digital and that span the entire market.” These acquisitions have enabled APCOA to expand its presence in each market and position itself for further profitable growth.
