Her other companion is Anglo-Asian police officer Yasmin Khan (Mandip Gill).In last Sunday’s episode, the Doctor and her companions travelled back in time to the moment black bus passenger Rosa Parks ignited the US civil rights movement.

There’s also an underlying feeling the focus has been forcing inclusiveness by having such obviously erse characters.’Another said: ‘Please keep the PC stuff for documentaries and serious drama and let the Doctor help us escape to a fantasy world.’Similar criticism is likely to follow an upcoming episode called Demons Of The Punjab, set during the Partition of India in 1947.But Frazer Hines, who played the Doctor’s companion Jamie McCrimmon between 1966 and 1969, said: ‘I was a bit worried about the Rosa Parks episode because race is obviously a sensitive issue, but I thought it was very well done.’  First, we had the Rosa Parks race relations plot... Last week’s storyline – in which the Doctor and her companions come to the rescue of heroic civil rights campaigner Rosa Parks in Alabama in 1955 – may have been ideal for Black History Month but its heavy-handed message led one fan to dub it the ‘racism-is-bad episode’.           The Doctor and her companions come to the rescue of heroic civil rights campaigner Rosa Parks in Alabama in 1955Next, we\u0027ll be told we did bad things in IndiaThe political education in the Rosa Parks episode will continue in the upcoming Demons Of The Punjab – set during the Partition of India in 1947 and guest-starring Shane Zaza (Happy Valley). It’s likely to show the evil consequences of the British Empire and colonialism, as the Doctor’s companion Yasmin goes back in time to search for her grandmother.            The political education in the Rosa Parks episode will continue in the upcoming Demons Of The Punjab, set in India in 1947The Doctor is too busy preaching to fight any aliens...In the opening episode, the Doctor pleads with psychotic alien Tzim-Sha – his face encrusted with the teeth of his victims – to look deep inside himself and leave his murderous ways behind. Unsurprisingly, the preachy approach doesn’t work and the Time Lord is forced to resort to more drastic action.

I think he was tempted into it.\u0027In 2014 a struggling student died from an overdose after taking out a payday loan which spiralled from £100 to £800 in just three months.Courtney Mitchell Lewis, 21, took an overdose of slimming pills after his short-term loan spiralled to eight times the amount he had borrowed. He had previously posted \u0027I don\u0027t want to die\u0027 on Facebook.An inquest at Swansea Civic Centre heard how the physics undergraduate - known as Mitch to his friends - had taken out the loan while struggling for cash during his studies.The student, of Aberdare, South Wales, was working as a barman while studying at Swansea University but decided to use the payday loan company to borrow £100.Colin Phillips, acting senior Swansea coroner, said: \u0027Mitch was a loving and caring inidual who was facing a number of personal problems.\u0027He had debts after taking out a £100 loan which had increased to £800 within just three months.\u0027And in 2016, disabled teenager Kane Sparham-Price killed himself on the same day Wonga left him penniless after emptying his bank account.The 18-year-old, from Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester, hanged himself after the now defunct loans company took payment for his debts under the terms he had agreed to.For confidential support phone Samaritans on 116 123 or visit their website.

The choir sang at the Invictus closing ceremony          As always when these Games close, I would like to start by saying thank you.To PK and Lieutenant General Peter Lay and the whole Sydney 2018 team - the vision and hard work has paid off and you have put on a truly magnificent Invictus Games.Thank you for being our partners over the last couple of years, and our team at the Invictus Games Foundation, especially Dominic Reid and Rose Hall, for their tireless efforts and hard work.To the people of Australia who filled the stands and cheered on the sidelines - thank you so much. Your energy powered our competitors all week and you made these Games your own by creating a typically Aussie atmosphere.To the friends and families who got our competitors to the start line and applauded them all the way to the finish line, thank you. You are all part of one big Invictus family and none of us would be here without you.And to the competitors goes the biggest thanks of all. You have once again left us humbled and inspired by your example, by your determination, by your service and by your sense of humour.Last Saturday, I spoke about how you were part of the Invictus generation. Your choice to serve your nations places you alongside those storied generations that have come before you, that fought two world wars and then secured a world order built on freedom, democracy, and tolerance.And of course this choice to serve - this choice to put yourselves at risk for the benefit of others - is at the very heart of what I founded these Invictus Games to celebrate. I wanted your service to be recognised.But what we saw again this week is that Invictus is so much more. Your example goes beyond the military community. It is about more than just your inspiring stories of recovery from injury and illness.It is about your example of determination, of optimism, of strength, honour and friendship, or as the Aussies call it \u0027mateship\u0027, as a core value that has the power to inspire the world.When we saw Paul Guest and Edwin Vermetten support each other through Paul\u0027s struggle with Post Traumatic Stress on the tennis court in front of a large audience, we saw what mateship really looks like.When Jakub Tynka fought through excruciating leg pain for the final 20 minutes of his cycling event, and let the cheering crowd and his fellow competitors Benjamin and Cedric push him over the finish line, we saw the definition of strength.When you saw Hannah Stolberg crossing the finish line on a bike which belonged to a late fellow serviceman whose values she strives to emulate, you witnessed the real meaning of honour.

Meghan referenced his courage in her speechIn travelling to these military bases, I was given a very special glimpse into the lives of those who serve our countries. I was able to see the unshakeable bond between servicemen and women on the ground together, but at the same time to feel the palpable longing for family and friends while deployed. Once home, the need for that anchor of support from loved ones, especially given how much it accelerates recovery and rehailitation is immeasurable. I\u0027ve been reminded of those memories here.During this year\u0027s Games in Sydney, I have witnessed the most amazing support networks that surround competitors, and I\u0027ve had the privilege of meeting several of these family and friends. The Novack family from Chicago is a prime example of this very thing. When their son, Ryan, suffered a severe injury leaving him paralysed from the waist down, doctors said he would never be able to walk again, but after speaking to his mum, Kerry, it was clear that it was through Ryan\u0027s strength of spirit and with the unwaivering support of his parents that he was able to prove all of those doctors wrong.Not only has Ryan competed in sailing, swimming and athletics this week, but when Harry and I saw him at the finish line of the sailing competition, he literally jumped into our boat, with dexterity and ease by the way, to give both of us a hug.Seeing Ryan\u0027s mum on the water that day, waving a flag to cheer him on was a moment I will never forget. The support system on the ground here in Invictus is something unlike any other because it\u0027s not just cheering on your own, but realising that by the end of this week, your own becomes everyone in the Invictus Family.It was, after all, only within 24 hours of meeting other families at the Games that another competitor\u0027s little girl was calling Kerry Aunty Kerry. This is what the Invictus Family is all about.On that note, I would like to invite everyone to please join me in a huge round of applause to thank all of the friends and family who have helped make these Games possible. Meghan turned heads in tuxedo-inspired Antonio Berardi halterneck in a green hue with a buttoned wrap detail around the waist that perfectly skimmed her growing baby bump.She accessorised with a crescent-shaped clutch bag and added a dazzling touch to the ensemble with statement earrings beneath her delicate chignon while Harry looked dapper in a light grey suit and white shirt.The couple earlier returned to Sydney just in time to watch the final day of the Games before heading to New Zealand for the last leg of their Commonwealth tour. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex  arrived at the wheelchair basketball final just after the match started at 2.10pm, receiving a standing ovation from the crowd. After the final whistle, pregnant Meghan went on court to give the Netherlands and USA players their medals and one cheeky Dutch player kissed her on the cheek.The bold move was technically a breach of protocol because the correct way for men to greet a member of the royal family is with a neck bow (from the head only) - but informal Meghan touched the player on the shoulder and smiled as he kissed her. The Duchess was glowing in a $550 maroon crepe knit wrap top by Australian designer Scanlan Theodore. She wore a Remembrance Day poppy on her left side and paired the top with black tapered trousers and high heels.           A cheeky Dutch player gave Meghan a kiss on the cheek after the final whistle. According to Royal.uk the correct way for men to greet a member of the royal family is with \u0027a neck bow (from the head only).

It has nine bedrooms and a swimming pool and looks onto Willow Canyon and the grounds of the stunning Santa Catalina nature reserve. In an interview in 2010, Sir Philip said of his stay at Canyon Ranch: \u0027To have time, space. It was spectacular. There were blue skies, you\u0027re walking and see mountains.\u0027I had time to think in an open space and was in a completely different zone.

He\u0027d put his hand up the back of her skirt – apparently getting a kick from both her boyfriend\u0027s ignorance and her powerlessness to stop him.\u0027Why did no one challenge him sooner,\u0027 the buyer asked me. \u0027Who\u0027s to say a hand cupping a buttock is worse than being shouted at while you\u0027re on the phone to a supplier in the Far East – yelling that you must make them drop their prices.\u0027It got to the point I felt sick every Sunday night at the prospect of going to work.

I met him in his boardroom at Arcadia HQ on Berners Street with its view of the London Eye before his chauffeur and bodyguard, Kevin, drove us to the Royal Academy, where his brands – Topshop, Evans, Miss Selfridge, Dorothy Perkins, Burton – were showing their wares to the press. In the limo, he chain-smoked Philip Morris – \u0027I have to have one pleasure in life\u0027 – and slagged off every designer store we passed. \u0027Stella McCartney? Never made two bob.\u0027 When I asked about his employees, his reputation as a rottweiler, he told me: \u0027I give a straight yes or no. They are empowered.\u0027He introduced me to his wife, Tina (who owns 92 per cent of Arcadia shares) and 14-year-old daughter, Chloe. When I later wrote that Chloe was wearing mukluk boots, which are made of fur, something banned in his stores, he complained to my editor, a soignee woman who that morning had no need of a blow dry.But he could be loyal.

Sir Philip Green is pictured working up a...Lord Hain refuses to apologise for outing Sir Philip Green...Share this articleAt the launch of Moss\u0027s first collection for Topshop, in May 2007, I wrote in the Daily Mail, where I\u0027d become fashion editor, that he worked his way along the queue of young girls snaking along New Oxford Street to check they each knew their PIN – so they could buy his products. He called me, swearing, and told me I was \u0027anti-Semitic\u0027. \u0027No,\u0027 I said. \u0027These girls don\u0027t have much money. You were grooming them.\u0027 As, over the years, I refused to fawn over him, his mood swung between extremes. After I wrote a rave review of one collection, he sent me a gorgeous olive greatcoat, still warm from the model who\u0027d worn it. Later, after a bad review, his right-hand woman called me. \u0027He wants his coat back.\u0027The last time I spoke to Green was at an Evans show in the autumn of 2014. He\u0027d sat me front row of this plus-size show (now that\u0027s a laugh in Oliver Shah\u0027s biography, he is reported to have told a female buyer: \u0027You\u0027re absolutely f****** useless. I should throw you out the window but you\u0027re so fat you\u0027d probably bounce back in again\u0027), as I\u0027d been at the vanguard of a campaign to give big women the fashion they deserve. Afterwards he asked if we could pose together for the paparazzi. I said no. Unlike every female glossy editor in the land, I felt to do so would betray my readers. I couldn\u0027t bring myself to stand next to him, gurning.          I can\u0027t help but remember the image, at his show inside the old Eurostar terminal in Waterloo, of American Vogue editor Anna Wintour, looking like the cat who got the zero fat cream because Green had arranged for her own personal escalator on which to glide in, and glide out (when approached for this story, her silence was deafening). Above, at Tate Britain in 2016Everyone in fashion knew he was a tyrant, but it\u0027s unreasonable to expect teenage models and junior employees to stand up to him you might wonder why anyone would sign a gagging order, but this was a seriously powerful man.So it was the responsibility of the senior company executives, editors, publishing directors and model agents to be on the side of the women who toil in low-paid jobs in stores and factories and lap up glossy fashion magazines.I can\u0027t help but remember the image, at his show inside the old Eurostar terminal in Waterloo, of American Vogue editor Anna Wintour, looking like the cat who got the zero fat cream because Green had arranged for her own personal escalator on which to glide in, and glide out (when approached for this story, her silence was deafening).I can\u0027t help but think back to the meetings of magazine editors and London Fashion Week bigwigs in the boardroom of Vogue House, where not one woman had the courage to say, \u0027What can we do about Philip Green?\u0027Or, later, as the BHS scandal erupted and the pension hole gaped, why even then did not one of them take him to task over the number of employees his greed was condemning to penury?My guess? They were too busy counting his advertising spend, and nursing their 40 per cent Topshop discount card.Even today, when I ask Caroline Rush CBE, chief executive of the British Fashion Council, who will have had more dealings with Green than most, if she ever took him to task, I\u0027m told her PA is away on honeymoon. I email the British Fashion Council press office and ask them to call her on her mobile. How bad is this for British fashion? Will he show next season? She doesn\u0027t ring back. It is her job to reply. This is what she is paid to do.Or Baroness Karren Brady CBE (don\u0027t you love all these titles?), who has been vocal about fighting sexism in business, and has been chair of Arcadia\u0027s parent company, Taveta, for eight years.I ask if she knew of allegations that Green gave female staff \u0027lingering hugs\u0027 and asked if they wanted their \u0027bottoms slapped\u0027 or, indeed, had paid substantial sums to settle complaints. Only her PA gets back to me: \u0027Karren is away until next week.\u0027 But this is important! She\u0027s got a phone, hasn\u0027t she? I visit her glorious villa next to Harrods no one answers the door.How about Naomi Campbell, who publicly attacked former Vogue editor Alexandra Shulman – now a Mail on Sunday columnist – for having too many white staff? Did Naomi ever find Green racist? No reply.How about Kate Moss? Would she like to offer her support to him, given he\u0027d been so loyal to her in the past? She was \u0027about to get on a plane\u0027, apparently.Or Edward Enninful OBE, new super-erse editor of UK Vogue? No reply.Come on, then, Natalie Massenet, Net-a-Porter founder and one-time chair of the British Fashion Council? She can\u0027t be scared of anyone. She\u0027s a bleeding Dame! I get an email. \u0027Natalie is going to reach out to you.\u0027 I\u0027m still waiting.Isn\u0027t it telling that the only powerful person in British fashion I can find who is willing to speak out about Green is a man – although he doesn\u0027t want me to use his name.No longer employed by Topshop, he tells me: \u0027He\u0027s outrageous. This is all typical of him. Doing it in the first place is unacceptable, covering it up is ridiculous.\u0027Is he a sexual predator, a racist? \u0027The real issue is this: he will never be aware that he has done anything wrong. He just doesn\u0027t get it, he will never change.\u0027Is that why he left Green\u0027s company? \u0027I left because I didn\u0027t like the way he treated people. My mum told me that we are all equal, and that we should treat everyone with respect. He didn\u0027t treat anyone with respect.\u0027 "},{"url":null,"title":"Publicity hungry Prince Harry gazumped father Charles present Radio 4s Today show","story":"    The Prince of Wales said it was ‘amazing’ that Harry, above, had listened to him at all. Harry then invited his father to be one of his interviewees, along with former U.S. President Barack ObamaNow, though, his father magnanimously withdrew to avoid any conflict.Perhaps as a compromise, Harry then invited his father to be one of his interviewees, along with former U.S. President Barack Obama.The Prince took full advantage of the media platform given to his ‘darling boy’ (as he referred to Harry on air) with aplomb.Is it the end for William and Harry\u0027s \u0027double act\u0027?

Such a consequence included use against others in nuclear weapons.’Mr Attwater agreed to sign a basis of plea prior to his formal guilty plea, in which he said: ‘I did not know or believe that goods or aircraft components would be shipped to Iran.‘I did not think there was even the remotest opportunity of these good ending up in a nuclear weapons program.’George, of Bristol, denied two counts of being knowingly concerned in the supply or delivery of controlled goods to an embargoed destination but was found guilty by a jury. Mr Attwater, of Telford, Shropshire, admitted being knowingly concerned in the exportation of goods with intent to evade prohibition or restriction.

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week:Halloween approaches and tiojo has been doing some appropriate reading:I’ve just put down Andrew Michael Hurley’s second novel based in the countryside of the Bowland Fells and the Fylde, Devil’s Day. It follows on well from his first, The Loney. The countryside, which I know well enough, inspires him. But he sees things in it not many of us would. What to us are rolling moors, green valleys, sparkling streams, picturesque farmsteads, signify something else to Mr Hurley. He sees another world. Spiritual, demonic, folkloric, who knows. An unsettling mixture of real and imagined geography gives us the horror version of Le Grande Meaulnes. His novels are psychogeography in action. The moors will look different next time I walk across them.On the same theme, Veufveuve has enjoyed Mary Shelley’s Transformation:A slim collection of short stories (comprising the title story, The Mortal Immortal, and The Evil Eye). All three stories are in some way supernatural or uncanny and the writing, though obviously touched by the gothic and thus sometimes a little overblown, is often very good – she knew what she was doing. All three stories, like Frankenstein, explore what it means to be human and how we might live. For me, by the far the most effective was The Mortal Immortal (I probably don’t need to explain the subject matter), bringing home its great existential crisis very powerfully.A different kind of monster has entertained Kevin Dawson in Craig Brown’s Ma’am Darling: 99 Glimpses of Princess Margaret:That rare thing, a genuinely unputdownablelaugh out loud book. Difficult to tell who was the less appealing, Princess Margaret herself or the people who (as Brown notes) happily accepted invites to events at which she would be present, knowing how awful it (and she) would be. They attended seemingly only so they could then skip off home to describe how awful the event was. Increased my respect for George Harrison, though (who, on being told he couldn’t eat before she left a “do” simply went up to her and asked her to leave).This Thing of Darkness by Harry Thompson has impressed 17Luftballons:It’s about the captain of the Beagle and Darwin. Echoes of Patrick O’Brian’s naval novels but it’s the detail and description that really bring it to life, so vivid and well-described I almost feel like I’m watching a film, or that I’ve visited all these places I’ve never seen. The characters are fascinatingly nuanced and human. And their debates over theology versus their scientific discoveries are really bringing home to me the significance and impact of evolutionary theory at the time. Nice and long, too - I don’t want it to end any time soon!A forensic and very readable analysis of The Iliad and the different strands that informed its creation. Utterly fascinating and totally recommended for armchair Homer fans and general readers alike.Here’s a teaser from casaleiro:About 10 days ago the  carried an interview with a Spanish writer who recommended A High Wind in Jamaica by Richard Hughes. Never heard of it! So down the town I went and found a copy in a charity shop. It was a fabulous discovery, and I am currently following it by re-reading William Golding’s Lord of the Flies. What the two have in common is their view of childhood as a wild and potentially violent state of being. I guess most readers are familiar with Golding. Concerning the older novel by Hughes (1929), I will say nothing, I simply urge people to read it, preferably without knowing anything about it beforehand.I’m intrigued. Talking of suspense, franhunny has been reading Agatha Christie’s Mrs McGinty’s Dead:While I usually loathe Poirot because of his smugness, it was not as bad as in other Poirot novels so I could live with it as a quirk.Which made the book quite enjoyable. Oh, I knew the murderer after the second murder, but I did not know why yet and how the two murders were connected.A classic whodunnit, with the classic “all suspects into the same room” finale where Mr Poirot explains his thoughts.A few hours well spent.(I’m glad it felt like a good investment of time, because we’re going to be looking at Agatha Christie on the reading group next month.)Finally, Tropic of Capricorn by Henry Miller has done the trick for judgeDAmNationIII:I’m about halfway through rereading and my God is it the tonic I need at the moment. I remember being relatively unimpressed with it the first time around (at least compared to the Rosy Crucifixion trilogy and Black Spring, which I read first), and although there are parts that go on a bit, the rest of it just feels like it’s screaming directly into my soul.That sounds pretty good to me.If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

He added: “That process is not in our hands.” Grayling said there was “no way that flights will stop” between the UK and the EU, but there appeared to be a marked change in tone from previous speeches in which he had described planes being grounded after Brexit as inconceivable.The legal basis for continuing flights between the UK and the EU is unclear without a new deal. Grayling said the UK could fall back on bilateral agreements with inidual EU member states but was hoping for a “barebones” aviation agreement with the whole bloc, saying he had not met “one single person” in the commission or a member state who believed there would be an interruption to aviation. “I’ve offered the commission to prepare a barebones deal if there is no broader agreement,” he said. “They are not yet ready to begin but the commission has said very clearly it expects there to be an agreement.”Asked if he would take responsibility for any disruption to aviation, having earlier dismissed industry warnings, the transport secretary said: “It’s not me that is not opening talks.”Grayling said the Ryanair chief executive, Michael O’Leary, who has repeatedly claimed flights could be grounded, was “selling tickets for next summer and expanding the number of routes between the UK and the European Union”.But airport bosses said they were preparing for the worst, including queues of lorries potentially jamming Britain’s main road artery, the M1, because of new customs requirements.Karen Smart, the managing director of East Midlands airport, which handles large amounts of freight, said Brexit could cause tailbacks on the motorway if longer checks on goods lorries were needed.She said the airport hoped pre-Brexit fears would be “like the Millennium bug” and prove unfounded but that it was working closely with local authorities to make contingency plans.Referring to Operation Stack, the government plan for holding thousands of lorries on motorways leading to Channel ports, Smart said: “My biggest risk is an Operation Stack on the M1 because vehicles can’t get to the airport because the processes have been slowed down. We have thousands of vehicles that are processed through the airport.”Derek Provan, the chief executive of AGS Airports, which owns Aberdeen, Glasgow and Southampton airports, said it needed certainty that there would be no disruption, adding: “Unlikely is not much good.” He said the airports were spending a lot of time and money on post-Brexit contingency planning.Ed Anderson, the chairman of the Airport Operators Association, said a framework agreement was needed swiftly to give passengers the confidence to book flights for next summer. “We are concerned at the lack of progress in this aspect of the Brexit negotiations,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79d51a5ff45a3a69ef1c29cfea7f1b15ebf07732/107_22_1723_1034/master/1723.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d6c425fc8cb921da0ec372ff9d934520","title":"families moved home job security zero hours contracts social isolation","story":"As if job insecurity and pitiful wages weren’t enough, social isolation is now being inflicted on huge numbers of peopleIn the first six months of this year, more than 1,200 homeless families were moved out of London to as far away as Newcastle, Glasgow and Cardiff. Headline figures fail to accurately reflect the entire weight of human misery contained in their stories: the forced eviction to a place where the family has no links and knows no one the stress involved in uprooting your entire life, disrupting your child’s education, and dealing with all the administrative issues involved. The housing crisis has worsened under austerity, with local councils outside the capital often not informed of an influx of people.Further, tearing families away from their friends and relatives is a surefire way to exacerbate the problem of loneliness, which is already a looming crisis across society. Making new friends is difficult in any new area, more so when you have caring responsibilities, and nigh on impossible when you are living on subsistence benefits and poverty wages. The social isolation of poverty reinforces the psychological toll on those ensnared: anyone claiming any form of benefit is labelled a scrounger and told by the government to work harder. Self-isolation and shame are endemic factors, further silencing the collective misery inflicted on millions.With empathy seemingly in short supply, a common response to households being turfed out of the capital is, “Well, if I can barely afford to live there, why should anyone else?” Yet the fact that our tax credit system is a windfall for huge multinationals that refuse to pay a living wage is rarely questioned. And so an illogical idea – that the poor must be starved into action and threatened with poverty to spur them into work, while the wealthy are only incentivised by more wealth than they could possibly need – shows little sign of fading.But before rent rises and cuts to local councils pushed them out of their homes, many of these families could afford to make a living. And for those in work, a job used to offer stability and at least a basic standard of living. Now there’s a boom in insecure and zero-hours contracts. And added to that, new houses that they might have been able to afford aren’t being built, and the botched rollout of universal credit has left more people facing eviction and increasingly dependent on food banks.Those who lack empathy don’t seem to realise that illness, relationship breakdown or the whims of a landlord can plunge anyone into financial crisis. Especially when household debt is the worst on record. Without a major redistribution of wealth, financial security for millions of people will grow increasingly more precarious.None of us are as insulated from poverty as we think. The only solution is to express solidarity with the poorest, practise basic humanity, and fight against an economic system that lets the hyper-rich force the government to subsidise their businesses’ poverty wages."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed88003a457304b139cea2c43da5c1666836a2b2/0_98_3323_1994/master/3323.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4fdd0daf6e963f64e6b044cf2ceea25a","title":"philip hammond pre brexit budget 2018","story":"Our writers react to the chancellor’s final budget before the UK leaves the EUSo the lady is for turning, then. The chancellor did his best to pretend that easing off on austerity wasn’t a political decision born of panic about losing the next election, but merely the result of the nation’s “hard work” (and considerable suffering in some cases) “finally paying off”. Definitely not panicking! Everything’s going to plan! Nothing to see here!But the reality is that this was the budget of a Conservative party in ideological retreat. After some flannel about fixing potholes, village halls and a mildly surreal offer of £400m for the “little extras” schools need (at a time when some schools are debating closing early on Fridays to save money) Philip Hammond got down to swallowing his party’s pride.Critics will say that the £1bn he promised to stop people losing out when they move to universal credit, plus another £1.7bn to boost work allowances, isn’t enough. They’ll say the same of the extra £20bn already announced for the NHS. But both represent grudging admissions that critics were right about cuts going too deep. Chunky business rate reductions for smaller high street businesses, alongside a digital tax on tech giants doing business in Britain, felt meanwhile like a belated admission (after Labour’s Rebecca Long-Bailey published her own proposals for retail) that if traditional bricks-and-mortar shopping can’t be saved then government can at least ease the pain of transition.For middle-class professionals wondering what’s in it for them, tax thresholds will rise a year earlier than expected (a tax cut disproportionately benefiting the highest-paid) and to the disappointment of anti-plastics campaigners Hammond ruled out a “latte levy” on disposable takeaway cups. But for once, this budget didn’t feel as if it was about them. It may not have felt like the end of austerity. But it did feel, perhaps, like the end of an era.On the way to today’s budget, a Tory MP stopped me to complain that Theresa May had made a catastrophic error by announcing at Conservative party conference that austerity was ending. With little agreement on what that meant, they predicted that no amount of spending would be enough to stop Labour from declaring that austerity wasn’t really over.Today Hammond did his best to address such fears by putting some clear blue water between the anti-austerity Tories and anti-austerity Labour. The chancellor proudly declared that “austerity is finally coming to an end” before adding the important caveat that “discipline will remain”. He suggested the government defined ending austerity as an above-inflation increase in departmental spending before explaining that a Tory end to austerity meant, unlike Jeremy Corbyn’s version, no tax rises: “My idea of ending austerity does not involve raising people’s taxes.”Yet it can’t be denied that big chunks of today’s budget were Labour-lite. Fiscal Phil announced an end to the government signing off on much-loathed private finance initiative contracts – something Corbyn has already promised. On tech giants avoiding tax, Hammond pledged a crackdown with a UK “digital services tax” aimed only at multimillion companies rather than startups. On universal credit, the government attempted to neutralise the issue with an extra £1bn to ease issues with its rollout.It was a comprehensive spending spree by Tory standards, but Labour will still be able to point to where it fell short on spending. Opposition MPs have been quick to go on the attack over the fact more money went to sorting potholes than fixing schools.Although Hammond’s comments on fiscal discipline did succeed in putting a iding line between Labour and the Conservatives when it comes to loosening the purse strings, there’s no denying that the party is now fighting on Corbyn’s turf.• Katy Balls is the Spectator’s political correspondentEight years of the Tories has brought us potholes the size of Brexit chaos historically high household debt, more people in precarious work, the slowest recovery on record and a deepening north-south ide. Yet if you listen to the chancellor you’d think they’ve done a great job of running the country. The Tories have lowered the bar on what we expect from government so much that we get excited about money for public toilets. They have dangerously lowered our expectations, and at a time when we need to demand so much more.Don’t be fooled by these spending pledges. Where new money has been promised, it will only go part way to curing the problems the Tories have created. Let’s take the NHS – the chancellor reiterated an increase of £20.5bn for our treasured public health system. However, the real-term squeeze since 2010 means that hospitals have debts of £12bn. Hammond should remember the old adage that prevention is better than cure – fixing things is always more expensive.He did steal Labour’s manifesto pledge to end PFIs – no bad thing, but of course he failed to admit that under Tories the state has outsourced our services, including our schools, to companies and institutions who prioritise profit and CEO pay over delivering for the taxpayer. Perhaps the biggest takeaway was the lack of ambition. The recent IPCC report on global warming found that only “rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society”, would work to protect the planet. In more ways than one, Hammond has badly let down current and future generations by his meagre budget today.• Faiza Shaheen is the director of the Centre for Labour and Social Studies and Labour PPC for Chingford \u0026amp Woodford GreenThe only explanation is that the chancellor lost a whole section of his speech. This was the most nature-depleted budget in decades. His biggest announcement on the environment was abandoning the latte levy, and with it the pretence of caring about our natural world.Two weeks ago, the world’s top scientists warned we have just 12 years to prevent climate catastrophe – so today we urgently needed an emergency budget with major investment in green energy and jobs to protect the planet. That means not a single pound spent on climate-wrecking infrastructure, revolutionary funding for solar and wind power, and a major programme of insulation to make every home warm.So it’s unforgivable that Hammond failed to even mention climate change. He spent 500 times more on roads than on planting trees, lavishing almost £40bn on locking us into our cars as public transport deteriorates.So many of us have little choice but to drive everywhere – making us less healthy, worsening deadly air pollution and contributing to climate breakdown. The chancellor should have cut bus and train fares, invested in more frequent and reliable services, made walking and cycling safe and simple, and made electric vehicles an affordable option for those who do need a car or van.It’s not clear what planet Hammond is living on – because he’s certainly doing nothing to protect those of us living on this one. His deluded budget was built on a fantasy future where the technical revolution will solve all of society’s problems. Our children will never forgive him.• Caroline Lucas is co-leader of the Green party of England and Wales, and the MP for Brighton PavilionBut at least it means that the extra £20bn a year pledged for the NHS by 2023 becomes more easily achievable. There were some welcome allocations to universal credit and spending pledges on housing, roads, defence and the Home Office. Also some welcome help on business rates and a faster raising of personal allowances and higher tax thresholds .Overall, though, Hammond has just papered over the cracks. He is constrained by Brexit uncertainty, hoping that if a withdrawal agreement is reached, growth may be higher.However, the danger of political turmoil is still very much there and a no-deal scenario, for which he has allocated nearly £3bn of the nation’s money, may well require an emergency budget in the spring, as the chancellor himself hinted. A promised return to growth in departmental spending in the next spending review may come a bit late. While the future trading relationship with the EU remains unclear, growth is also threatened by renewed weakness in the world economy.• Vicky Pryce is chief economic adviser at the Centre for Economics and Business Research and a former joint head of the Government Economic Service"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8199a65c2ceada98864eaa2498711c4c0835c1d4/0_118_3047_1828/master/3047.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ae7f5229fd1e943f19b0d317ba26ab2","title":"tory budget 2018 nation in decline brexit","story":"Here was a pothole budget, a light spray of makeshift asphalt over the riskiest craters in the public sector. The end of austerity? No, just minor repairs to a little of the damage they have done things sounding good but signifying little.This was a traditional Tory budget, with benefits still frozen for the poorest while three-quarters of the winnings from raising personal tax allowances flow to the top half of earners. As John Major warned, universal credit would have collapsed, and taken the government with it, without a bung. Enough? Its structural defects may sink it yet. Welcome gestures, like taxing the Amazons and Googles, turn out to be a slap on the wrist. A one-off £10,000 gift per primary school is almost insulting, as was the small sop for social care, while police and local councils are left high and dry.This chancellor never disappoints because our expectations are so low, but he seems to relish universal disdain, like the Jolly Miller in the song: “I care for nobody, no, not I and nobody cares for me.”. In reality he had just two key messages. Most important is the threat directed at the Brextremists behind him: if you vote down the prime minister’s deal and cause a no-deal crash out, I will be forced to deliver a punishment budget like no other. When Jacob Rees-Mogg and his cabal rage at Philip Hammond’s Treasury as “the bastion of remoanerism” when they demand Brexit bonanzas, Hammond insists that even a good deal with the EU still only “minimises any negative effect”. Anti-Brexiters will praise him for admitting as much – no possible deal can ever match the status quo of our EU membership: outside Europe lies only national decline, abrupt or gradual, depending on how we leave.His other message was coded. Austerity is only “coming to an end”, whatever the fantasy Theresa May danced her way into at the Conservative party conference, austerity is not over. Howls greeted his absurd claim that it was never “driven by ideology”: the intent was always downward, to a low-tax, small state, austere to the tips of Hammond’s bony fingers.The Resolution Foundation says the most minimalist interpretation of “ending austerity” would take £31bn just to stop cutting more, without restoring anything. I doubt that definition will cut the mustard with a public that sees the effect of cuts everywhere. All those “strivers, grafters and carers” Hammond praised in his speech can see it all around them – in closed libraries, Sure Starts and day centres, in operations delayed, GP appointments as rare as gold dust, everywhere creeping public squalor.Even in the most affluent places, the well-off step over rough sleepers outside Waitrose stores that offer collecting bins for local food banks. Job creation is indeed a British success story, but this is still the worst decade of wage stagnation since the Napoleonic era, with pay still below pre-crash levels. Growth in lower-skilled jobs – warehousing, online retail pickers, catering and logistics – hardly suggests his promised bright future of a “high-wage, high-skill economy”.Good things were listed. Mental health still gets only half that “parity of esteem” eternally promised, but it will help children in crisis left waiting for treatment for up to 18 months. That money is skimmed off the £20bn promised for the NHS, which must stagger through another stark winter.But overall, this was a budget to bodge things with sticking plaster, put fires out with a watering can, and making do while failing to mend. None of it is likely to stop our relative descent in one measure after another – GDP growth, education, health outcomes – as the UK slides embarrassingly in most international rankings. This is what decline feels like.Any chancellor would be wary of the unknowable blowback from Brexit. This was never going to be a budget to stand back and look at the broad sweep of how, why and who we tax, and what we spend it on. In the long and disreputable history of budgets, there never is a right time for radical reform, never the moment to fix the excrescences of a perverse, distorted, unjust system. Paul Johnson, the director of that great budget arbiter the Institute for Fiscal Studies, was blunt when talking to me on the eve of the budget: “How is it that most of Europe raises so much more tax than we do?” he asked, rhetorically. He has always bemoaned Britain’s demand for Swedish services delivered on American low tax rates – and the abject failure of all parties to confront the voters honestly.Take this glaring example: not one chancellor or economist defends the disgraceful failure in England since 1991 to reform council tax, as the richest pay a tiny fraction of their property’s worth compared with the poorest. Let that stand for myriad deformities that survive only because no party has the political guts to engage in an honest conversation with voters.The tax plans in last year’s Labour manifesto were miserably unradical. Raising the general income tax rate by 1p yields £5.5bn, twice as much as Labour’s extra on earners over £80,000. Good to tax the best-off more – but restoring that 2p Brown cutjust to make a budget-day splash would bring in £11bn. Labour should be encouraged that Johnson tells me there’s no reason why Britain should not borrow “a lot more, in the short to medium term”.Meanwhile, lest we forget, while we count pennies and dispute winners and losers, the overheating planet is reaching a fatal tipping point, but nothing in this budget – certainly not the ninth year of a fuel duty freeze – can save our children and grandchildren."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b59e9660a14f56e182e4012605fad0c4b31933e/0_0_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c00c6f04856665ded758ae710f528f70","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of towering","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘towering’The closing date is Wednesday 31 October at 10am.

That fund, the Woodland Carbon Guarantee scheme, should pay for 10m trees.The other £10m will be targeted at planting in cities and towns and should fund at least 100,000 more trees.The Woodland Trust, a conservation charity, said the money was a step in the right direction in terms of tackling climate change and wildlife losses, but not enough in total. “The problem is greater than just having the funds to deliver increased tree-planting,” said Abi Bunker, the group’s director of conservation.The government said it would also back a study into the possibility of creating a new “Great Thames Park” in the Thames estuary, which experts have said could be ready by 2020. Ministers have pledged to plant 11m trees between 2017 and 2022, approximately the same number that were planted under the five years of the coalition.England’s tree-planting record is poor compared with other European countries. About 1.6m trees were planted in England with government support in the 2017-18 financial year, covering 895 hectares. By comparison, Scotland planted 7,100 hectares in the same period.Conservationists have pointed out that because England’s 120m ash trees are threatened by ash dieback, a deadly fungus that arrived in 2012, the country is on track to suffer a net loss of trees over the next five years. The mix of species to be planted under the government’s new funding announcement will be decided at a later date."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed48c486424ecb97667914fb4ecc65ac902c0d3a/0_345_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=993686dba05844da3eccc0670167b517","title":"air pollution worlds children breathing toxic air who study finds","story":"Report says air pollution is having a devastating impact on children worldwide, storing up a public health time bombPoisonous air is having a devastating impact on billions of children around the world, damaging their intelligence and leading to hundreds of thousands of deaths, according to a report from the World Health Organization.The WHO said medical experts in almost every field of children’s health are uncovering new evidence of the scale of the crisis in both rich and poor countries – from low birth weight to poor neurodevelopment, asthma to heart disease.Dr Tedros Adhanom, WHO director general, said: “Polluted air is poisoning millions of children and ruining their lives. This is inexcusable – every child should be able to breathe clean air so they can grow and fulfil their potential.”The findings coincide with the start of the first global conference on air pollution and health in Geneva, including a high-level action day at which nations and cities are expected to make new commitments to cut air pollution.The WHO study found that children are particularly vulnerable to air pollution because pollutants are often more concentrated nearer to ground level. It added that their developing organs and nervous system are also more susceptible to long-term damage than those of adults.“Air pollution is stunting our children’s brains, affecting their health in more ways than we suspected,” said Dr Maria Neira, WHO director of public health and the environment.Pregnant women are particularly vulnerable, with dirty air linked to premature and underweight children. Air pollution also increases the risk of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease later in life.Tedros, writing in the  on Saturday, described air pollution as the “new tobacco”, saying the simple act of breathing is killing 7 million people a year and harming billions more.In the UK, most urban areas have illegal levels of air pollution and ministers have lost three times in the high court after challenges over the inadequacy of their action. The latest government action plan, called “pitiful” by environmental lawyers, revealed air pollution was actually much worse than previously feared.Globally, with smoking on the decline, air pollution now causes more deaths annually than tobacco. However, researchers think the harm known to be caused by air pollution, such as heart attacks and lung disease, is only “the tip of the iceberg”.Today’s report found that both indoor and outdoor air pollution was causing significant health problems. It said burning fuel such as wood or paraffin for heating, cooking and light in poorer countries was having a drastic impact on children’s health and called on governments to promote the clean alternatives as a matter of urgency.Mark Watts, executive director of the C40 Cities group, which represents cities around the world working to tackle the climate crisis and air pollution, said the report was an urgent call to action.“The moral and practical case for urgent, bold and far-reaching action to reduce emissions, including calling an end to the fossil fuel era, is now utterly irrefutable,” he said.“Citizens are demanding action to protect their children, mayors of the world’s big cities are regulating to take dirty vehicles off the streets and slash emissions from buildings and waste. Now is the moment for governments, car manufacturers and other big polluters to step up.”Neira said the air pollution crisis and the climate emergency could only be tackled together.“The solutions are a basic public health agenda that will have plenty of benefits for public health and the environment,” she said. “No matter what else, we know that we need to decarbonise our society sooner rather than later and the benefits of that for our health and our economy are indisputable.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/662ce2118e6e3e07d4eb5156b6d4099a8ad5e11a/0_106_1425_854/master/1425.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3773d0e4b9a248f65840049ba5c0aed3","title":"unfashionably fashionable the best of rankin in pictures","story":"A new book charts 30 years of the fashion photographer’s work.

Walk through a market and you might spot a box of salt-encrusted fillets and catch a pungent whiff. It is baccalà, or salt cod.The Vikings may have been the first to cure cod by drying, and the Egyptians and Romans salted fish. It was the Basques, though, around the year 1000, with the means to fish extensively and gain access to salt, who discovered that cod salted before drying lasted longer and rarely spoiled. It was their bacaleo, which became bacalhau in Portuguese and baccalà in Italian, that expanded the cod market into an international trade.Catholicism then gave the Basques their great opportunity. In his fascinating book Cod, Mark Kurlansky explains how the medieval church imposed fast days on which sex and the eating of flesh were forbidden, but that the eating of cold food was permitted. Cod is from water, therefore cold, so the Basques, wily traders that they were, stepped in. Lean days all over Europe became synonymous with salt cod, and from the middle ages until quite recently, salt cod became “an almost mythological crusader for Christian observance”.Times may have changed and fridges grown to the size of small cars, but in Rome, the tradition of eating fish on Fridays, whether to observe a lean day, or simply because of habit, persists, grows even, as new Italians from other continents settle. And the fish is often still baccalà, either battered and fried, baked with fruit or onions, braised with tomatoes and vinegar, or simmered into a rich soup with its lean-day companion, chickpeas.My favourite of the salt cod and chickpea soups is maybe the most straightforward: just chickpeas, water, olive oil, onion, garlic and salt cod. It is not the quickest, although I am sure you could make adjustments. For it, 300g of chickpeas are soaked for 24 hours, covered with new water and simmered until tender. In another pan, a diced onion and chopped clove of garlic are fried gently in olive oil until soft and fragrant, then the chickpea and cooking liquid is added, along with 400g of soaked salt cod, and then everything is simmered for 15 minutes.I have written about baccalà before, how it needs to be washed of the surplus salt, then soaked, with several changes of water, for anything from 12 to 48 hours depending on size and saltiness of the fish. With added risk. As Gillian Riley notes: “Too much soaking can make the flesh soggy and tasteless.” Wet carpet comes to mind. Too little soaking “leaves it desperately salty and stringy”. In short, it is a palaver, the opposite of fast food. What’s more, there is always a chance that under the salt, the cod has turned. Try as you might, you can’t ignore the odd smell as you slice and simmer.So to recap, the soup could take you two days and there is a slim chance the piece of cod you have purchased, bathed and soaked like a newborn could have turned and produce a pong almost as persistent as the one made by the potato that rolled under the sink. Cooking and eating, though, is full of stinks, rot and risks – there should be more of them in food writing. But there is also a much greater chance that you will turn out to be an expert soaker and that, as it simmers, the salt cod – which tastes to me like fresh cod with well-seasoned muscles and wit – falls into fat flakes in the soft, accommodating soup.Croutons and a pinch of red chilli flakes sprinkled on top make it even better.300g dried chickpeas, soaked in water for at least 24 hours1 onion, peeled and finely diced1 clove garlic, peeled and finely choppedSalt6 tbsp olive oil400g salt cod, soaked for 24 hours, changing water four times, or as directedBread, cubed and fried in olive oilChilli flakesDrain the soaked chickpeas, put in a pan, cover with 2 litres of fresh water, bring to the boil, then reduce to a simmer for 1–2 hours, until the chickpeas are tender.In another, heavy-based pan, gently fry the onion and garlic with a small pinch of salt in olive oil until soft and fragrant – about 10 minutes. Add the chickpeas and 1 litre of their cooking water and bring to a lively simmer.Chop the salt cod into chunks and add to the simmering pan. Half cover with the lid and simmer for 15 minutes, until the cod is opaque and broken into large flakes. Taste and add salt as necessary. If you wish, remove some of the soup, puree it, then return to pan, for a creamier texture.Make croutons by frying cubes of bread in olive oil, with a pinch of salt, until crisp and golden.

The club claimed the transfer had been instigated “at the will and the request of the player”. Ronaldo, in an interview with France Football, suggested Pérez’s attitude towards him had changed.“I felt it inside the club, especially from the president, that they no longer considered me the same way that they did in the start,” he said. “In the first four or five years there I had the feeling of being ‘Cristiano Ronaldo’. Less afterwards. The president looked at me through eyes that didn’t want to say the same thing, as if I was no longer indispensable to them, if you know what I mean.“The truth is that the president wanted me but, at the same time, he made it known to me that my departure would not constitute a problem.Asked whether the decision of the manager, Zinedine Zidane, to leave after overseeing a third successive European Cup win had influenced his move, Ronaldo said: “My decision to leave was not based on his departure. That being the case, it’s one of those little things that made me feel a bit better in terms of what I thought of the situation at the club.”The 33-year-old, who scored 44 goals for Real last season and has seven for Juventus, is aiming to win the Ballon d’Or for a third year in a row. “I think I deserve it this year … Yes, I dream of winning the Ballon d’Or for the sixth time and passing, in this case, Lionel Messi.”Ronaldo is the subject of a criminal investigation by Las Vegas police and a separate civil action after an allegation of rape made against him by Kathryn Mayorga. He strenuously denies the allegation, which Mayorga, now 34, claims took place in the summer of 2009.She alleges the footballer assaulted her in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009, then used “fixers” to stop her pursuing criminal charges – including paying her $375,000 “hush money”. Police confirmed the original case was closed in 2009 due to Mayorga not disclosing details but it was reopened in September after she went public, inspired, she said, by the #MeToo movement.“Of course, this story is interfering in my life,” Ronaldo said. “I have a partner, four children, an ageing mother, sisters, a brother, a family with whom I am very close. Not to mention my reputation, which is that of someone exemplary ... Imagine what it means when someone accuses you of rape, whether you have all that or not. I know who I am and what I did. Truth will out one day. And the people who criticise me or seek to expose my life today, who make it into a circus, these people will see.”He added: “I explained to my partner. My son, Cristiano Jr, is too young to understand. It’s worst for my mother and my sisters. They are stunned, and at the same time very angry. This is the first time I have seen them in this state.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d769d8efe6e5a8bf36d3bf73c08badf587d49ca/0_89_1517_910/master/1517.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c1fb1a89e706c755e104e892fc807cb7","title":"manchester united back jose mourinho january transfer window 100m","story":"José Mourinho will be backed in January to strengthen Manchester United if the right deal is possible in what can be a difficult transfer window for finding value.The manager wants a central defender and goalscoring forward after trying unsuccessfully to sign one of each in the summer.More than £100m is potentially available.

The midfielder Casemiro called the team a “disaster” and described the defeat as the “image of our season”.

There was no press conference or appearance from the president to explain the decision.“The board understands that there is a great difference between the quality of the Real Madrid squad, that has eight players nominated for the Ballon d’Or, unprecedented in the history of the club, and the results achieved until now,” read a club statement. “We are grateful to Lopetegui and his staff and wish them the best in their professional career.”Santiago Solari, who manages Madrid’s B team Castilla, will take over on an interim basis, starting with Wednesday’s trip to face Melilla in the Copa del Rey.Madrid had briefed that they would bring the former Chelsea manager Antonio Conte, who they contacted over three weeks ago, but talks stalled on Monday. Although there is no definitive decision, there was little optimism that a deal would be done with the Italian. The reason for that is not yet clear, but Madrid captain Sergio Ramos had made it clear that he did not welcome the prospect. Asked about the prospect of a manager like Conte with “mano dura” – an iron fist – arriving at the Bernabéu, Ramos replied: “Respect is earned, not imposed.”Although he did not name them, Ramos clearly referred to Vicente Del Bosque, Carlo Ancelotti and Zinedine Zidane, none of whom are authoritarian and who had a close relationship with the squad, when he added: “We have had success with coaches that I don’t need to name but you all know. Sometimes knowing how to manage a dressing room is more important than technical ability.”Madrid’s president Florentino Pérez believes that he needs a manager to lead a dressing room that has become too comfortable, but the prospect of conflict from the start is not one that Conte can have relished.One of the criticisms Pérez levelled at Lopetegui was that he was too indulgent of the squad and he rapidly lost faith in the coach – at least in part because he did not have much faith to start with. After Zidane announced his surprise resignation, Madrid sought to bring in a series of managers to take over, including Mauricio Pochettino and Max Allegri, before eventually turning to Lopetegui in the face of extremely limited options. Few wanted to follow Zidane, winner of three Champions Leagues in a row. Some saw flaws in the squad, too – Zidane himself had warned of the need to make changes after a season in which, while they won the European Cup, Madrid finished third, 17 points behind Barcelona.For Lopetegui, the opportunity was one that he could not pass up – he didn’t think it would mean the chance to coach Spain at the World Cup would be denied him. He did not request that Madrid wait or that conversations be held with the Federation, whose president was furious when he was presented with a fait accompli.Lopetegui was unveiled at the Bernabéu the day after he had been sent home from Russia. “Yesterday the saddest day of my life today is the happiest,” he said. It would always be difficult to disassociate the two days: being Madrid manager was always likely to be tinged with some regret, even if he was successful but he hasn’t been. Although Madrid started the league season brightly and were impressive in their Champions League debut against Roma, results soon deserted them. Lopetegui lamented injuries and bad luck, but that excuse did not convince.He was careful not to publicly challenge decisions made at boardroom level but with Neymar the only player Madrid were prepared to spend big on and the market shifting, the squad has got weaker over the last three years. That morning, El Mundo published an interview with Lopetegui’s elderly father in which he complained “they have taken fifty goals off” his son, with the departure of Cristiano Ronaldo.Pérez was also unhappy that there was no place for 18-year-old Brazilian signing Vinicius, who Lopetegui left in the B team. The club’s legal staff managed to get a ban overturned following a red card playing for Castilla last weekend, freeing Vinicius to play the clásico on Sunday. He travelled with the team, missing the Castilla game, but Lopetegui left him out of the matchday squad.The manager’s position had already become all-but untenable. The clásico might have been an opportunity to avoid the inevitable, and some players expressed their support, but Madrid were defeated 5-1 and slipped seven points behind their rivals. “I know how football is,” he said afterwards."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cff66d8e59d766022024304ae55175aa6d532ea1/0_346_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e41f3c0fa00c48e298456349f74f4bee","title":"vichai srivaddhanaprabha tributes el clasico and more football weekly podcast","story":"Max Rushden is joined by Barry Glendenning, Jonathan Wilson and Lars Sivertsen as they discuss the tragic incidents in Leicester, the weekend’s Premier League action and Real Madrid’s collapse in El ClásicoJoin the conversation on Facebook, Twitter and email.

This time Spurs go long from the back and Laporte gets the flight of it wrong, only succeeding in flicking it to Lamela. He promptly plays Kane in and you’d back him to finish the job ... but his first touch is heavy and allows Ederson to race out and smother bravely at his feet! That wasn’t Kane at his sharpest, although he dealt Ederson enough of a blow to necessitate a short spell of treatment.33 min: Spurs thread together their most pleasing back-to-front move yet but Fernandinho pickpockets the dawdling Lamela. That’s as good as it gets for them at the moment.31 min: That previous chance came after lovely footwork from David Silva, who has been outstanding so far. Spurs need similar guile and will surely need to call upon Eriksen if the current pattern persists.29 min: Mahrez hits the post! It’s a vital left hand from Lloris, in fact, pawing an angled effort onto the upright after City had again probed Spurs into near submission. The corner comes to nothing and the home team survive for now!27 min: Another cunning City foul as Aguero fells Trippier. They do love those. It’s not all buttercups and daisies.26 min: My eyes have just about adjusted to this now.23 min: Oh, that’s wasteful from Sissoko. Mendy makes a poor mistake, letting a Trippier ball roll under his foot, and the Frenchman is away down the right! He has aeons of time and acres of space, and could even drive one at goal from an angle. Instead he looks for the onrushing Lamela but Fernandinho, in a superb recovery, dashes back to nudge the ball away.22 min: City are making it almost impossible to Spurs to play through midfield here, pressing their defence incredibly high. They look firmly in control at the moment, although Fernandino bails them out now with a very Guardiola-team-esque tactical foul after Lamela breaks into their half.20 min: “Terrible start for Spurs, but plenty of time for them to get back in it. We’re still in the first quarter, after all,” chortles Greg Phillips.18 min: Kane miscues a relatively straightforward switch for Trippier. That spirited flurry from Spurs after the goal has dulled rather.17 min: City ping the ball all around Spurs’ area before Bernardo Silva sees an angled drive deflect wide. Their attacking players seem in the mood. Martin Tyler has just made the “end zone” joke – which precedes Walker failing miserably to find it after the corner is played short to him.14 min: It’s been a good, brisk start here. Aguero wants a free-kick after Sanchez barges him in the back on the right flank, and replays show he had a fair point.12 min: Sterling has plenty of space to get onto a cushioned David Silva lay-off but Alderweireld gets across to make a crucial block. The corner is cleared.I’ll allow this one too.10 min: Trippier gets to the City 10-yard line (OK, I won’t make any more of those) and earns a corner, which he takes himself. Alderweireld wins the header from it but Ederson saves well. Spurs have responded to that early setback though.9 min: But Spurs almost level! Lamela finds Kane, who takes advantage of a rooted Stones and a poorly-positioned Ederson and tries his luck from 25 yards. The goalkeeper is mightily relieved as it swerves and dips over by the narrowest of margins.7 min: Sterling tries to double the lead but shoots wide. Brilliant start for City, this, and Wembley already seems very muted.The perfect start for City! Sterling, who had already enjoyed a little encouragement, capitalises as Trippier misjudges a long ball, then beats the full-back as he tries to recover. He gets to the byline and cuts back for Mahrez, on the run, to finish smartly from eight yards!5 min: City are navigating the magic-eye pattern marginally the better so far, although Sissoko just broke away briefly on the right without being able to get enough on a diagonal ball to the other side.3 min: A few bobbles so far but I’m not sure the pitch is all that bad. It just looks terrible. On a night when most of the top tier is also empty, reflecting a surprising lack of appetite for this fixture, there are probably various things you could say about the state of modern football.1 min: I’ll say it now – however the ball rolls, all these NFL lines, words and colours on the pitch are going to make this a confusing watch. It’s a joke, really.On a pitch marked with 50-40-30-20 lines as per NFL, Spurs get us started from the very middle of the American sport’s badge. Might help with offside decisions!Before we start, everyone is to observe a minute’s silence for the tragic events in Leicester on Saturday.Out come the players to a ... not exactly full Wembley.No stone is to be left unturned in modern football preparations.Can’t let tonight pass without a mention of Glenn Hoddle, by the way. Brilliant news that he is responding well after his heart attack at the weekend – a sentiment that will be echoed around the Tottenham fanbase with particular feeling.“The Premier League is 38 games, Tottenham is always tough with the same manager and exceptional players. We know how complicated it will be but OK, we’ll try to maintain our level and we will see the performance of both sides will dictate the result. The pitch is what it is, no complaint.”“I am worried for both sides because the pitch is not in the best condition. The most important thing is that the players finish the game in a very good level.From Marie Meyer: “I recall a Liverpool having a Champions League match somewhere in Eastern Europe years ago. Jerzy Dudek was getting ready to take a goal kick. You know how goalkeepers sort of mindlessly bounce the ball while they wait for the outfield players to sort themselves out? Dudek did that. Imagine his surprise when it didn’t bounce back - he had plopped it down into a puddle of mud, and there it stayed. An attacker was on him like a flash, so he had to fling himself into the mud as well in order to cover up the ball.”“Tommy Docherty’s deliberately waterlogged wings against Barcelona in the 1960s springs to mind,” writes Carl Jepson.Good one. Keep them coming!Decent snapshot of the job Pochettino has done at Spurs ...Matt Burtz gives us the lowdown on some stateside skulduggery:“Here in the US of A, groundskeepers of baseball stadiums have commonly adulterated the playing field to provide an advantage one way or the other. Other team has speedy runners? Water the dirt between the bases heavily so the paths are muddy. Your team likes to bunt? Water the dirt directly in front of home plate so the ball dies before reaching an infielder. Your team likes to chop the ball in front of the plate so it bounces high and the runner can beat the throw? *Don’t* water the dirt in front of home plate and let it bake in the hot sun so it resembles concrete!“I think Spurs should embrace the opportunity to muck up the game. Three points is three points, after all losing on a well-kept pitch to a good team is a moral victory at best.”Of course football hasn’t been totally immune to such methods. John Beck used to legendarily like long grass down by the corner flags so that his wingers could chase the ball as it held up. Any other examples you can think of?Found some footage from the pre-match warmup!“This palaver over the pitch perplexed me,” puzzles David Hopkins. “When I was a kid I would go to the Baseball Ground which by late October was a brown diamond with a few tufts of grass in each corner. My dad claimed that canny Rams players of the past would lure unsuspecting opponents into the deepest mud knowing they’d get stuck.”This is much more like it from Danny Michaux:“As a Spurs supporter, beating City on this lame excuse of a pitch would be hilarious. Imagine Vincent Kompany slowly trudging off at the final whistle and getting caught in a boggy section, Pep’s fury in the post-match interview, the endless impotent bashing of keyboards on social media sites and comment sections across the nation and beyond calling for Spurs to be stripped of their points and fined. Doesn’t it fill your heart with hope that there is some magic left in the game?“We’re going to get pumped though.”It’d rival Darren Bent and the beach ball.On to some football and here’s Ed Aarons on Maurico Pochettino’s sense of discontentment.Been a funny start to the season for them, hasn’t it? As mentioned in the piece, their league form is fine – but only a few weeks ago we were worrying about them losing games hand over fist and being in a mini crisis. The Champions League campaign has certainly been unsatisfactory so far, and Pochettino’s biggest annoyance is clearly that the stadium business hasn’t been put to bed – thus continuing to weigh Spurs down. They’re churning results out without quite looking at their best at the moment. Can tonight bring the kind of season-defining performance that might cheer their manager up?“As a Spurs supporter, I don’t ever wish to lose points but beating City on this lame excuse of a pitch would make me embarrassed, not elated with joy. A draw would be best,” writes Kaushik Prasad.Whooooaaaa! Does everything in this ultra-serious Premier League of ours really have to be gleamingly splendrous all the time? I do take the indirect point that Spurs’ stadium situation has goneis going very badly and that this is an unfortunate consequence of that.I’ll talk about some actual football in a bit but look what we did for you back in 2016! A Joy of Six: Sporting Pitch Fiascos! Will tonight make seven?Interesting snippet from the wires, reporting that the match officials have been doing their due diligence on the surface:Parts of the pitch are lush and green, but there are large areas of worn brown turf, especially on each touchline, while the NFL logo is still visible in the centre circle. Referee Kevin Friend and his fellow match officials walked around the pitch at around 6pm with a ball testing to see how it rolls.“Wembley has come a long way from 1970 when domesticated equines tore up the pitch before the FA Cup final with the Horse of the Year Show,” notes Justin Kavanagh. “These days its Jaguars from Jacksonville and Philadelphian Eagles ruining the footie! Mind you, the Jaguars seemed to be only interested in prowling London’s nightclubs (running up a bar bill of $64,000, according to a Philly news report) and the droppings of eagles don’t seem too big a problem at Selhurst Park.”That’s interesting – Christian Eriksen and Kevin De Bruyne are both on the bench. Both have had their injury troubles. Is that a reaction from both managers to the pitch issue? Either way, it’s potentially a shame for the spectacle.“Faded American football stripes on a torn-up Wembley turf for a Premier League match?” observes Peter Oh. “Oh the irony! Or should I say, the gridirony?”The pitch doesn’t look great, does it, and the NFL logo in the middle tells a few stories. I have a question though. It’s not exactly going to be a quagmire, and 20 years ago nobody would have batted an eyelid – why aren’t things simply allowed to be a bit rubbish anymore?A Premier League weekend that has, for obvious reasons, been very difficult comes to an end tonight with a fixture that promises plenty of flourishes on the pitch.In fact it’s funny I mentioned the pitch, isn’t it, because that’s stolen many of the headlines before Tottenham’s keenly awaited match against Manchester City. Wembley’s surface has come off decidedly second-best to yesterdays NFL game and hands are being wrung about just how technical Mauricio Pochettino and Pep Guardiola’s men will be able to get tonight. Are you wringing yours? Does this sort of thing actually worry you? Either way it’s added another storyline to a match that doesn’t really need much setting up: if Tottenham, who often do pretty well against Man City, can do something here then you sense we really do have a title race this year. If City cut loose, as they did here in April, you wonder whether they’re purring towards top gear and ready to pull away again. They’ll go top on goal difference if they win should Spurs take the points, though, City will drop to fourth and the hosts will go third.Plenty to get our teeth into then. Send me your tweets and emails – should be able to get through a fair few before kick-off, which is at 8pm UK time. Not midnight, even if it feels like that since the clocks went back.

These five routes are perfect for those looking to take on longer rides at a gentler paceMore and more people are rediscovering cycling as a gentle way to exercise and explore new places on their own steam. Cycling lets us experience our surroundings in new ways – from the sights and smells we might miss in the car, to the simple pleasure of feeling the wind in our hair. It’s also something just about anyone can enjoy: cycling is non-weight bearing, and for many people it’s easier than walking. There are also bikes to suit most needs.

No wonder the fitness world loves itIf you have an injury or health condition, consult your doctor before doing these exercisesIt doesn’t take much time to improve your health. HIIT has become a staple in the fitness world and for good reason: it’s the time-efficient, super-effective way to get fitter that’s backed by science.But it doesn’t always have to mean donning your lycra – in fact, research shows that as little as a minute of HIIT can benefit the body. The workouts below take two minutes each, one for each hour of your working day. They target every muscle group in the body, require no equipment and can be done in very little space.The benefits? You’ll boost your circulation and energy levels every hour, so no more wanting to sleep face down on your keyboard it will increase your cardio fitness, muscle strength and core stability, and you’ll continue to burn calories even after you’re back at your desk!Before doing each workout, warm up by gently jogging on the spot for 30 seconds and then standing and raising one knee at a time in front of you – 10 on each leg. Work as hard as you can for the 20-second bursts of exercise. At the end of the workout, pace around for 30 seconds to cool down and stretch out any muscles that feel tight.Each workout follows the same pattern: do the first three exercises for 20 seconds each, with 10 seconds of rest in between each one. Do the fourth exercise for 30 seconds:Plank Lie on your front, hands beneath your shoulders, elbows pointing back. Tuck your toes under and push yourself up until your arms are straight, pulling your navel up towards your spine so you feel the core stability muscles around your middle engage. Keep looking at the floor and make sure your bottom is neither sagging towards the floor nor pushing up towards the ceiling.Press-ups From a plank position, bend your elbows to lower yourself towards the floor. Letting your elbows flare out to the side works the chest harder keeping them nearer your sides focuses more on the triceps. A full-press up is touching your nose almost to the ground, but you may not get that far to start with. The most important thing is to keep a straight line from your knees, to hips, to head. Balance on your knees rather than your feet to make it easier if needed.Jumping jacksStand with feet together and hands by your sides. Simultaneously, jump your feet out sideways and swing your arms out to the side and up until your fingertips meet above your head. Jump back to starting position.Bottom kicksJog on the spot, flicking your heels up to kick your bottom.High kneesJog on the spot while bringing your knees up high in front of you. Use your arms to really drive the movement and go as fast as you can. If this is too vigorous for you, do the same action but as though you’re walking rather than running.Mountain climbersFrom a plank position, lift your right foot off the floor and drive the knee towards your chest. Place the foot back and repeat with your left knee. Don’t stick your bottom high in the air and keep a rapid flow.Shadow boxStand with feet hip-width apart and bring fists up into a boxing position. Punch upwards with the right hand then the left, then punch across your body with your right hand then left, allowing your body to rotate towards the direction of the punch and heel to come off the floor.Bear crawlKneel on all fours, hands directly under your shoulders, knees under your hips. Tuck your toes under and lift your knees to hover a few inches above the ground. Now crawl forwards – right arm at same time as left leg and vice versa – for six paces, then crawl backwards for six. Keep your abdominals engaged and back as flat as possible (imagine you’re balancing something on it).Reverse lungesStand with feet hip-width apart. Step back with your left foot, lowering the front knee to a right angle or deeper. Focus on using the glute in your right buttock to power back up to standing. Repeat with the right leg.Sumo squatsStand with feet wide apart, toes turned slightly out (about 45-degree angle), hands clasped in front of your chest. Keeping your back straight, bend your knees in the direction of your toes (but don’t go beyond them) to lower yourself until your knees are as near to 90 degrees as possible. Keep your weight in your heels. Come back to standing.Squats or jump squatsStand with feet just wider than hip-width apart. Cross your arms and place your hands on opposite shoulders. Keeping your torso upright and chest facing forward, bend your knees and stick your bottom out, spread your weight through your heels and ensure that your knees don’t stick out beyond the end of your toes. For a full squat, you’re aiming to lower your bottom to knee height while keeping your chest facing forward, but go as far as is comfortable. Return to standing. To make squats harder, add in a little jump at the top of the move.Bicycle crunchesLie on your back with feet flat on the floor, hands touching your ears, elbows out to the side. Simultaneously, lift your feet and head off the floor and begin to slowly move your legs in a pedalling motion. As your right knee comes towards you, bring your left elbow towards it and vice versa with the left knee and right elbow. Keep your torso still by engaging your core stability muscles."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46bde53bfab45f752f0423461a10de1c7b166975/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=93f40f06a7976a63d80404621f00899d","title":"nine simple ways to revamp your workspace for a healthier environment","story":"Improving your posture at work, adding some greenery to your desk and moving to a window seat are just some of the quick fixes that can transform your productivityThere’s a lot more to happiness in the workplace than a comfortable salary. In fact, working more than 40 hours a week may well be doing you a considerable disservice and directly affecting your health and performance at work. Thankfully, taking a few minutes of your day and deploying intelligent fixes can turn your office from a dreary workspace to an area that transforms your productivity and mindset. Here are nine ways you can make your office work for you.Take a standThere’s a reason standing desks – no longer the reserve of agile Silicon Roundabout startups – are quickly making their way into the offices of multinationals. Encouraging employees to be considerably more aware of their posture at work, adjustable desks and workstations such as Varidesk and the Yo-Yo desk are quickly becoming adopted by offices across the UK. What’s more, sitting for more than six hours a day leaves you at greater risk of anxiety and depression, according to the Association for Psychological Science – meaning that an eight-hour day spent on your rear quickly becomes an unhealthy habit.Spring cleaningOld meeting notes, dirty mugs, empty sandwich boxes and a dirty keyboard all add up to an unhappy desk. According to a study by Princeton Neuroscience Institute, “multiple visual stimuli” – also known as unwelcome desk clutter – compete for attention in your brain, meaning you can remove distraction with a desk free of unnecessary mess. Similarly, you’ll want to give your keyboard a wipe-down every week or so, as the average keyboard has 20,000 times more bacteria than a toilet seat.Stretch it outStressful experiences – at work and at home – have the potential to age the human brain by four years, according to a 2017 study presented at the Alzheimer’s Association’s conference. Thankfully, you can de-stress and fight poor posture at your desk by working through this stretching routine. To open up your back, bring your hands behind you and press your palms together. Bring your elbows back and downwards, slowly tucking your chin – hold the stretch for 30 seconds and repeat three times. Consider this your first step to become a more supple – and pain-free – human.Make a moveFor now, there are no stringent laws on taking screen breaks, but the Health and Safety Executive recommends a five- to 10-minute break every hour. Standing up and walking around will help stretch your body, adjust your posture and increase productivity and attention, as well as the quality of your work.Give yourself a handSpending 35-plus hours at a desk each week is hardly appealing, the very real prospect of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) – a condition in which a nerve in your wrist is under pressure, causing numb hands, weakness and tingling – is far worse. Common in men and women over 40 years old, CTS stems from repetitive actions such as using a mouse and keyboard. Handily, ergonomic office equipment – Microsoft Surface and Mac-friendly Kinesis Freestyle are two of the UK’s most popular options – can help stave CTS off. The oddly shaped equipment improves forearm posture, adds comfort and supports your hands. You’ll agree that it’ll be worth a few odd looks.Thirsty workWorkplace absence in the UK is costing £18bn annually, according to analysis from Centre of Economic and Business Research. That’s a total of 168m working days lost annually. While there’s no sole reason for this, it’s important to adopt everyday habits to keep you as healthy as possible in the workplace. Dehydration, for example, even at a mild level, directly affects both physical and mental performance, meaning that you’ll find it hard to concentrate during work hours and struggle with that post-work run. Women should aim for two litres a day, and men for three litres.Light workIf constantly feeling tired is making office life a miserable reality, it could be because of the light levels in your office. A 2013 study from the Netherlands found that when office workers were exposed to more daylight during the working week, they were less sleepy and considerably more energetic. Similarly, researchers from Turkey found that study participants who had three hours or more of daylight a day felt considerably happier and more satisfied – muting the chance of office burnout. Push for that window desk and reap the rewards immediately.Pain in the neckYour career, rather unfortunately, is wreaking havoc on your neck. A combination of poor posture and stress, which affects your sleep, is likely to be causing unnecessary neck pain. Rarely a sign of something more serious, neck pain can be treated with over-the-counter painkillers such as Voltarol, which can be taken orally or applied directly to the affected area."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb2b30fa74b9aa833fc86cef2012cb9ec35f1c6d/0_24_4683_2810/master/4683.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09525c4b1174948beb907c5a7e6f894a","title":"kanye west designs clothing candace owens blexit","story":"The designs appear on merchandise for conservative commentator Candace Owens’s ‘Blexit’ campaignKanye West has reportedly designed a line of apparel for a conservative campaign encouraging black Americans to quit the Democratic party. Spearheaded by the YouTube star and TV pundit Candace Owens, Blexit is described as “a frequency for those who have released themselves from the political orthodoxy”.Owens told Page Six: “Blexit is a renaissance and I am blessed to say that this logo, these colours, were created by my dear friend and fellow superhero Kanye West.” West created two designs for the Blexit merchandise range: one spells out Blexit in lettering designed to resemble human forms, the other states, “We free”.Owens said West “has taken one of the boldest steps in America to open a conversation we have needed to have”. West has been a vocal supporter of Donald Trump since the 2016 election campaign. He recently visited Trump inside the Oval Office, ostensibly to discuss prison reform – an issue his wife, Kim Kardashian West, has previously discussed at the White House.Surrounded by reporters and cameras, West launched into an impassioned stream of consciousness touching on race relations, tax breaks, criminal justice and mental health. He described the red “Make America Great Again” baseball cap on his head as “a superhero cape”.West’s Blexit designs were unveiled at the Young Black Leadership Summit held this weekend by Turning Point USA, the conservative advocacy group of which Owens is director of communications. West was not present at the event.West recently donated $73,540 to Chicago mayoral candidate Amara Enyia as she launched a campaign to take over from the incumbent, Rahm Emanuel.

Talent is spread evenly and the challenge with Britain is that opportunity isn’t and that’s what we have got to fix.”Her comments will fuel ongoing speculation about the prime minister’s future, as the number of MPs backing a leadership contest is believed to be close to the threshold of 48 necessary to trigger a vote. Many of those MPs are known to be hard Brexiters disgruntled with what they see as May’s concessions to the EU.If she ran as leader, Greening would hope to draw support from the other wing of the party and the majority of Tory MPs who backed remain in the referendum.Greening resigned from the government after being offered the post of work and pensions secretary in May’s January reshuffle.Since leaving the cabinet she has been outspoken about the need for the Tories to broaden their appeal to younger, more socially liberal voters. In June, she ruled herself out of the running to be the Conservatives’ candidate for mayor of London.She told ITV: “We need a guarantee on opportunity for people in country in the same way that we tried to give them guarantees on health … I didn’t have a life mission to come into politics. I just want to see change on the ground, it is as simple as that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef4287269cf0256c42e655418cb0662f474794eb/31_0_1630_978/master/1630.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=29b5595094986fc3dce4e26974777611","title":"pencils and potholes as hammond peters out with barely a whimper","story":"Chancellor’s budget leaves him ready to exit as he arrived – unloved by everyone but himselfCredit where credit is due. At least Boris Johnson made the effort to write two entirely contradictory speeches, even if he didn’t particularly agree with either. Philip Hammond couldn’t even manage that as he delivered what is likely to be his last budget. He has the unique distinction of being the chancellor that neither his own party nor the opposition really wants. And true to form, Hammond couldn’t but help bowing out with the merest whimper. The dog that didn’t bark in the night.In her leader’s speech at the Tory party conference in Birmingham, Theresa May had confidently declared that the years of austerity were well and truly over. We had never had it so good. Hammond visibly blanched and was quick to distance himself from his prime minister’s hostage to fortune by opening his statement with a mumbled statement that austerity was merely coming to an end. Though he couldn’t say exactly when. All he could do was acknowledge things were still fairly rubbish but he would do his best to make things appear slightly less bad than they already were by spending money he couldn’t say for certain that he definitely had.Then Hammond got to the tricky, Brexity bit that he tried to gloss over as quickly as possible. If we happened to get lucky and the prime minister could get her bad deal past the EU and parliament, then things were going to be so great he was going to put aside another £4bn to prepare for the damage Brexit would do to the economy. And if the UK crashed out with no deal, then all bets were off. Things would be so catastrophic that an emergency budget would be needed a budget that he hadn’t yet got round to writing as the mere thought of it gave him nightmares. The no-deal contingency planning was to have no contingency plans.With Brexit dismissed in a few sotto voce sentences, Hammond could press on with his fantasy budget which he wasn’t yet sure he was in any position to deliver. “Fiscal Phil says Fiscal Rules OK,” he said, in the first of several attempted gags that fell stone dead. So often cast as the Undertaker, Hammond was now reinvented as the Clown. The chancellor’s self-regard is astonishing. It’s bad enough that he imagines himself to be an economic wunderkind, but he’s borderline delusional in believing himself to be a raconteur with comic timing. His only public speaking gift is to make 75 minutes feel like 150.Continuing to fall to the occasion by announcing a small spending commitment purely to allow himself the pleasure of making a few schoolboy toilet jokes – taking the piss was a running theme throughout this budget – Hammond went on to reveal many of the announcements that had either already been announced by May some months previously or had been leaked to the media last weekend. So we got the money for the NHS, a few pencils for schools, the odd pothole mended, and a partial reversal of the cuts to Universal Credit that George Osborne had brought in three years earlier.As the chancellor neared the hour mark, heads began to go down even among those Tory MPs who had been force-fed amphetamines by the whips to act as cheerleaders for a budget in which no one was much interested. After all, if Hammond didn’t really believe in it, why should anyone else? At one point the chancellor paused for some knowing guffaws after what he had imagined to be exceptionally bons mots. None came – least of all from the prime minister, who hates her chancellor almost as much as she hates herself and sat stony-faced throughout – and he appeared genuinely surprised and upset.As his batteries began to give out, Hammond faded to silent with a half-hearted appeal for everyone to believe in his magic numbers, even though he didn’t believe in them himself. The Tory benches gave him the briefest of cheers before heading for the exits. Up in the public galleries, a group of WASPI women (Women Against State Pension Inequality) protested against the attack on their pensions. Labour MPs rose to give them a prolonged round of applause the reception Hammond had so much craved but would never get. He would go as he had come – unloved by everyone but himself."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6379cb0c0d8fdbf5b46af15b0c5db7d536c6a176/0_14_2414_1448/master/2414.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23e013d5ed81d49562df1f25939f16e3","title":"twitter users mint new jokes over brexit 50p coin","story":"Mooted plans for special coin to mark UK leaving EU spark derision on social mediaChancellors are renowned for trying to spring a surprise during their budget speeches, and Philip Hammond is expected to announce that the UK will mint a special celebratory coin to mark the UK’s departure from the European Union.The Brexit 50p is expected to be issued on 29 March next year, the day the country is due to leave the bloc after 45 years of membership. According to reports, the coin will bear the phrase “Friendship With All Nations”.The report was greeted with derision on social media from Hammond’s opponents. In a reference to the continued devaluation of sterling, Wes Streeting, the Labour MP for Ilford North, posted a picture of a pound coin. It wasn’t long before the jokes started on social media, as others soon found images they thought might be a more appropriate metaphor for Brexit to display on a coin:And others thought, given the progress with negotiations, the wording might need changing.The phrase expected to be on the coin is rather pointed but isn’t especially British. It is a truncated version of a quote from the former US president Thomas Jefferson, who said: “Peace, commerce and honest friendship with all nations entangling alliances with none.”Some suggested that perhaps the new coinage could be made more memorable by adopting a unique and appropriate shape.As more and more people re-imagined the Brexit 50p, a favourite phrase from the sitcom Dad’s Army sprang to the mind of one social media user.And another suggested this alternative, with an eloquently written description: “One side features the Queen with her head in her hand, quietly sobbing, while the other has a comprehensive list of the benefits the people of the UK will receive on leaving the EU.”That side of the coin is left blank.The UK is definitely striking it out alone with the plan, as the move to celebrate Brexit with a coin will not be echoed across the channel. The EU has already said it has no plans to mint a special euro coin to mark Brexit. “We have no current plans to do anything of the sort,” said a European commission spokesperson.In 1998 the Treasury issued a special 50p coin to celebrate the UK’s presidency of the EU and 25 years of membership of the EU. The UK also issued a commemorative 50p in 1973 to mark joining the EEC.The move to celebrate Brexit in this way may be ultimately self-defeating.

England were able to set to work at the Nondescripts ground in the heart of Colombo with their red balls. On Tuesday they begin the first of two two-day practice matches. These are not first-class games and they may prove to be an ugly spectacle as all the batsmen bat and all the bowlers bowl.These matches will hardly be a contest from England’s perspective they are more likely to be a series of little battles between players eager to nail down a place for the first Test in Galle on 6 November.Root could do no more than offer steers: there was no guarantee Jonny Bairstow will be fit for the first Test, in which case Jos Buttler behind the stumps was “the likely scenario”, though the presence of Ben Foakes “gives us another way to balance the side up”. It remains Root’s preference to bat at four.The simple truth is Root and Trevor Bayliss are not absolutely certain who their best team are. Hence there was much talk of the virtue of having so many options and the importance of the next four days of practice, which are likely to be painful to watch and, for several borderliners in the squad, stressful to play in.There are tricky decisions to be made everywhere and perhaps the trickiest relates to Stuart Broad. To his credit Broad is a great survivor. Recently there has been discussion within the England hierarchy of Broad being one of the bowlers to be rotated or rested for the greater good. One media outlet assured us he would be dropped for this tour but he is here and eager to play. However the possibility of England wanting to play three spinners in Galle, where the ball is expected to turn in Rangana Herath’s last Test, enhances the chances Broad really will be rotated this time.Root’s response to the Broad question was Delphic it could be interpreted in various ways. “I wouldn’t say it’s a changing of the guard and I wouldn’t say he’s in a weaker position than he has been previously,” he said.“We still haven’t finalised the team. He could still definitely play a massive part within the three-match series and definitely the first game is an option. But we have struggled away from home a number of times now, so we are trying to find a different formula with him or without him.“I don’t think it weakens him as a player or where his game is going. I think he’s actually improving all the time and using his experience wisely. His action is as strong as it has ever been but whether we have to find a different formula we’ll just have to wait and see. We have to make a real, clear call on what’s going to be the best side on a given surface.”Sir Humphrey would have been proud of Root’s perambulation. A guess is that Broad is likely to be left out, which probably means he will produce a four for 10 spell over the next few days.The other debate centres on the identity of the opening batsmen. Keaton Jennings is the only one in the squad who has opened regularly for England recently, yet there remains a good argument he should give way to Rory Burns and Joe Denly with the possibility of Moeen Ali continuing at No 3. In this instance runs over the next few days for any of the three new(ish) boys will be significant.So Root has plenty to ponder though his concerns are pinpricks compared with the recent experiences of the former Sri Lanka captain Arjuna Ranatunga, who “feared for his life” at the weekend.Until last Friday Ranatunga was a government minister then one person was killed by his security detail amid unrest outside his former office as Ranatunga collected some of his personal effects. He has since been arrested. The political situation is volatile with the prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, sacked by the president and replaced by a former president Mahinda Rajapaksa.The England and Wales Cricket Board is continuing with its preparations for the series as planned but said: “We are aware of the developments and are in constant contact with the British High Commission. We are exercising vigilance and avoiding all demonstrations or large political gatherings.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3131865196a6df7de499d1521a5231147f51fffe/1902_232_1751_1050/master/1751.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=97b2c04a32a728a68655eb4f3128bdb8","title":"gafur rakhimov boxing aiba olympic","story":"The Uzbek businessman is expected to be named Aiba’s new president and wants to clear his name before securing the sport’s Olympic futureHe is blacklisted by the US treasury, which has accused him of being one of Uzbekistan’s “leading criminals” with “links to the heroin trade”. Yet Gafur Rakhimov, the man expected to be elected as the president of amateur boxing’s governing body on Saturday, says he will clear his name – and then lift his sport off the ropes.In a wide-ranging interview with the , Rakhimov also claims that Aiba had been “days away from bankruptcy” earlier this year and accepted that relations with the International Olympic Committee – which has warned that a full boxing programme at Tokyo 2020 is in “jeopardy” under Aiba – were in a bad way.Rakhimov, who became the interim president in January after Aiba’s former president Wu Ching‑kuo was suspended over governance and finance issues before stepping down despite denying all allegations, said he could be trusted despite the US treasury linking him to the international criminal network “Thieves In Law”.In a vigorous defence of his reputation, Rakhimov says: “I have never been personally involved in any transnational criminal organisations or any other criminal activities,” before providing documents he said showed he had been taken off Interpol’s list in July.“These lies were fabricated by the former regime in Uzbekistan because they wanted my businesses to support them financially,” he says. “But I refused. The pressure continued relentlessly until my family and I were forced to leave the country in 2010 to protect ourselves.“They then launched a misinformation campaign against me, in which they used the levers of state to harass me, and reported false allegations about me to the US authorities to destroy me.”Rakhimov said many of his enemies are now in prison before revealing his lawyers had petitioned the US treasury to get his name taken off the blacklist. “The new Uzbek government has provided official letters noting that these allegations are ‘unfounded’ and ‘untruthful’,” he says.This month the IOC took a dim view of Rakhimov running for president and also warned that if Aiba’s governance issues were not addressed at its congress this week “the existence of boxing on the Olympic programme and even the recognition of Aiba is under threat”.Rakhimov believes he can win the IOC around with a range of reforms – but would be prepared to stand aside to ensure boxing was fully represented at the next Olympics.“The IOC has six concerns about Aiba, including financial management, judging, refereeing and doping,” he says. “But we have been working day and night over the past nine months to not only save Aiba from bankruptcy, but also to improve our governance systems in a wide range of areas. I believe I can bring in reforms and steady the ship. But I will never stand in the way of an Olympic future for boxing.”Last year the  revealed Aiba was at risk of going under after the Azerbaijani company Benkons demanded it immediately repaid a $10m loan from 2011. To make matters worse, the Chinese group First Contract International Trade also wanted it to pay back a $18m investment into Aiba’s marketing arm, BMA. However, Rakhimov now says the situation was even more precarious than reported.“Aiba faced an extremely difficult situation at the beginning of this year,” he says. “In my entire business career, I have never seen anything close to this.“Aiba was days away from bankruptcy but using some of my links and acquaintances I have already helped restructure tens of millions of debt that Aiba owed its creditors.“In the future, all key decisions will have to be taken by the president and the executive committee working together. That has restored trust and governance in our operations. As for financial transparency we are working hard to reduce Aiba’s liabilities, which had ballooned under the former leadership.”The IOC froze all payments to the association last December and a spokesman said Aiba still needed massive reform, despite Rakhimov’s overtures. “We haven’t changed our position,” he said. “Aiba is in grave danger. We will make sure boxing takes place in some form at the 2020 Olympics but it might not be under the auspices of Aiba.”Rakhimov is the only candidate able to stand in the presidential election, although he may yet face a challenge from the president of the Asian boxing federation, Serik Konakbayev.Konakbayev, who is supported by England Boxing, has appealed to the court of arbitration for sport after originally being declared ineligible to stand after failing to attract sufficient support from governing bodies before the deadline. Cas is expected to make its ruling public on Tuesday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16fa263bce2b2fc6ceef0a606efb5b5ddcb940c1/0_173_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40f633d19199241b055ea4ee69cba470","title":"apple announce new ipad pro without home button usb c new macbook air","story":"Redesigned tablet with USB-C and potentially a new MacBook Air expected to be launched at New York event on TuesdayApple is expected to unveil a redesigned iPad Pro with Face ID and no home button, alongside new Mac computers, at an event in New York on Tuesday afternoon.The long-rumoured iPad Pro redesign will be the first significant change to Apple’s iOS-based tablet since the release of the 12.9in iPad Pro in 2015.According to an icon found within the latest version of Apple’s iOS software, the new iPad will have an all-screen design with slimmer bezels around all sides. It will still have a power button and volume buttons, but will lack a home button, instead relying on facial recognition for unlocking the device. It will not have a notch into the screen like Apple’s new iPhones, however.The new tablet is also expected to embrace the USB-C connector, replacing the long-standing Lightning connector that has been used in the iPhone and iPad since 2012.All of Apple’s Mac computers released since April 2015 have shipped with at least one USB-C port, with the MacBook and MacBook Pro shunning all other ports for the multipurpose connector.The new iPad is also expected have a new version of Apple’s A12 Bionic processor, as found in the 2018 iPhones, and may have a new graphics chip.Apple will hope the that refreshed iPad Pro with greater PC-like capabilities, including the versatility of the USB-C connector, will boost sales of the tablet against growing competition from Windows 10 2-in-1 hybrids such as Microsoft’s Surface Pro and Lenovo’s ThinkPad X1 tablet that aim to perform both tablet and laptop duties.Apple is also expected to update its Mac computer line with new processors and some updated designs. Despite its popularity, the MacBook Air was last updated in early 2015 with fifth-generation Intel Core chips with 8GB of RAM made standard in 2017, and is still on sale with those old components.Ever since the introduction of the new 12in MacBook in 2015, Apple has been expected to either drop the MacBook Air from sale or update it.Rumours predict that the MacBook Air will see a redesign with an improved screen and newer seventh or eighth-generation Intel Core chips bringing it into line with Apple’s other computers.Apple’s smallest desktop computer, the Mac Mini, has not seen an update since 2014 and is still sold with fourth-generation Intel Core chips. The Mac Mini is expected to either be dropped from sale or updated with new chips similar to the MacBook Air.The iMac, MacBook and MacBook Pro without Touch Bar are currently sold with seventh-generation Intel Core chips, and are anticipated to see updates to the newer eighth-generation components at some point in the near future."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37b2ea6403db9770e789c2d0ba6d13d0afa11e85/509_0_3971_2383/master/3971.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e0ec7347cd4465f30b5aaba53b69ad8","title":"the cook islands everyones happy if youre not happy youre in the wrong place","story":"Times are changing in this formerly overlooked paradise as tourists discover the food, snorkelling and distinct culture We’re just over the last crest of Maunga Pu when we see it.Here, at Aitutaki’s highest point, the true glory of the island’s sprawling lagoon reveals itself. Its outer edge encircles the tiny island, splitting crystal clear waters from the heaving dark blue of the Pacific beyond.It lends the atoll – the second most populous of the 15 Cook Islands – an air of stillness.“Pretty amazing view, hey?,” I say to a rare group of American tourists we find at the top of the hillside. “Yeah, incredible,” one responds, smiling.Time on Aitutaki still moves with the kind of slow, lazy gait long lost to the more tourist-dense island paradises, like Bali or Phuket. Only 2,000-odd people live on Aitutaki, and the community has been careful to keep its long, arcing beaches peaceful, free from pollution or the western hordes.It has a modest tourist trade but is far from overrun. The resorts that are here, like the boutique Etu Moana villas, have been careful to maintain the island’s relaxed air. The elegant rooms sit just off the water, their thatched roofs hidden among the palm trees. In the evenings, my partner and I sit on the veranda, cocktails in hand, watching the sun lower itself toward the horizon.Our mornings are spent uninterrupted, usually exploring the teeming reef, chasing tropical fish til exhaustion. The waters, still as glass, light up with the reds of the angelfish and the yellows of the butterfly fish as they flee into forests of coral.Out beyond the reef, between July and October, whales can be seen making their great migration south, heading to the warm Pacific waters to breed and give birth.Shops in the main town of Arutanga are counted on the digits of one hand, and cars are outnumbered by the population of cats roaming the island.Eteta Fepuleai and her family have run a small takeaway restaurant, Puffy’s Beach Bar and Grill, on Aitutaki for almost 18 years. Puffy’s is the best kind of takeaway joint. Unpretentious, cheap and simple, it doesn’t stray from what it does best: fresh seafood, salads, burgers and cold beer.But when Fepuleai began, it was one of the only takeaways here. Over the years competitors have sprung up as more tourists sought out Aitutaki’s paradise. “It’s changed a lot,” she says. “A lot of businesses compared to us, a lot of takeaways have come up. I don’t really worry, because everyone knows us. They know the way we cook.”Fepuleai spent much of her life in nearby New Zealand, before returning to her place of birth. It’s not an uncommon story.Curiously, there are more Cook Islanders in New Zealand than in the Cook Islands. But more and more are returning home. Most come back to Rarotonga.Like Tupou Metutaopu, a New Zealander whose parents were born in the Cook Islands. He came back to Rarotonga five years ago to reconnect with his roots. Metutaopu now helps crew for Koka Lagoon Cruise, a company that runs glass-bottomed boats in the waters off Rarotonga.“Locals who used to live here are coming back,” Metutaopu says. “I’m from New Zealand, born and bred in Wellington. My mum and dad are from here.”Metutaopu is speaking to me while standing in the shallows of Muri beach as he unloads the boat after finishing a long morning on the water. We’d just spent half the day on the lagoon cruise, which weaves its way through the reef before making landfall on one of the islands scattered off Rarotonga’s eastern coast for lunch.Within minutes of casting off, hand drums and wood-carved ukuleles materialise in the hands of the crew. The music is an eclectic mix of traditional Polynesian songs and western pop hits, all set to the rapid, bright strum of the ukulele. We’re on the first of two daily cruises run by Koka. Much of the cruise is spent in water, exploring the reef, and watching as the crew try to lure Roger, an impossibly large eel, from his hiding place in the coral. When we stop at an uninhabited island for lunch – a fresh seafood barbecue – one of the crew expertly climbs to the upper reaches of a palm tree, without a hint of fear, to retrieve fresh coconuts. They make a show of teaching tourists how to open the harvest and use the milk or oil inside. We’re taught how to weave coconut leaves into a basket, and how to tie a sarong in the traditional style.The smiles have not left the crew’s faces all day.“Everyone’s happy,” Metutaopu says. “If you’re not happy, you’re in the wrong place. Don’t bother coming.” It’s hard, of course, for any tourist to truly understand what Metutaopu means when he talks about the Cook Islands’ culture. It’s the product of a people who lived uninterrupted on these islands for 1,000 years, from 500AD, when the first Polynesians arrived, until the Spanish sailor Alvaro de Mendaña sighted Pukapuka in 1595. Captain Cook, for whom the islands are named, was not far behind the Spanish. Nor were the missionaries, who brought disease, but also a Christian tradition that is now deep-rooted and a profound influence on daily life in the Cook Islands.On Rarotonga, an island of 14,000 people, the white coral and limestone churches are ubiquitous. They seem almost to outnumber the bars and cafes along the single 32km road that circles the island. But Christianity has not pushed out the traditions of the Cook Islanders.We’re on the island for Te Maeva Nui, a week-long festival of dance, song, and culture, designed to celebrate the Cook Islands’ birth as an independent nation. Huge numbers have come from all over the far-flung islands to take part.Tickets are at a premium, and the local news carries stories of parking woes and “heavy congestion” – most unusual for the Cook Islands – when the singing and dancing finally finishes at Rarotonga’s main auditorium. The situation is so dire that the police are even warning of a crackdown on illegal parkers.It’s the event that, quite literally, brings the small nation to a standstill.When I first take my seat in the auditorium, I’m unsure of what to expect. There’s a restless energy in the overwhelmingly local crowd.Drums begin to beat in the darkness.A spotlight casts down on a lone woman, her face partially covered by a floral headdress. Her voice rings out, soaring out across the auditorium and stilling those still nattering in the stands.The stage lights up. Dancers dressed in green, red, and yellow begin slapping the floor in unison. They quickly jump up and begin moving as one. Pendulum hips swing. The men pound their hands on thighs. The drums roll again.It’s a dizzying display of sound and colour. And it continues on throughout the night, each act as impressive as the last.There is a striking iniduality between the cultures of the 15 islands, born of the great distance between each and their varying histories of migration.Some have come a long way to be in Rarotonga for Te Maeva Nui.There’s a team from Pukapuka, known as “the island of beautiful girls”, the northernmost atoll and the most remote part of the Cook Islands. It’s closer to Samoa (750km away) than Rarotonga (1,140km away), and its culture is linked more closely with its Pacific neighbour.The island is stunning and all but untouched, largely because getting there is nigh-on impossible for tourists.An occasional charter plane lands on the a tiny airfield on one of Pukapuka’s three islets, but it runs sporadically – usually once every six weeks – and is often full of government officials. Some tourists have been known to board the cargo ships that try to get supplies to Pukapuka four times a year.But there is no set schedule for the ships. They go to Pukapuka when weather and opportunity permit. Tourists can either get off and explore Pukapuka while the boat unloads, or stay on, not knowing when the next boat will come to take them back.It has helped Pukapuka remain immune from the trend that is transforming Rarotonga. There are rumblings from some within the island’s opposition party that the infrastructure will not be able to cope.Yet the average visitor will hardly notice. For most who have travelled abroad, these islands will, for now at least, remain a thankfully untouched paradise.•\u0026nbsp  Australia was a guest of Cook Islands Tourism, Jetstar and Air Rarotonga"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0aa0ef3bcab9ea706da7d33f5d619790ac69cd69/0_240_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ecdc626d23c9bc9456f5cc91c229270f","title":"hasan minhaj netflix show late night comedy","story":"The ex-Daily Show comedian has launched Patriot Act on the streaming platform, calling it a weekly ‘woke TED talk’, promising to deliver more than the average If deployed properly, self-deprecation can be the most valuable weapon in a comedian’s arsenal. Make a pointed critique of yourself before someone else can, play it off as a joke, and just like that, the potential diss has been neutralized. That’s surely what Hasan Minhaj is going for when he refers to his news-comedy program Patriot Act as a “woke TED Talk” midway through the second episode, and yet the offhand remark does naught to change the fact that that’s precisely what this is. The phrase articulates a perceived objection to the show, but only succeeds in crystallizing rather than dispelling it. He floats a succinct, cutting appraisal not so easily laughed off, the kind of compact dismissal that might as well come from articles not yet written – if Minhaj has room in his schedule to complete the remainder of this review, the door’s open.“Woke TED Talk” pretty much sums up a show knowingly resistant to the tone and structure of the late-night culture that first spawned Minhaj. His mere presence invites comparison to his former home The Daily Show, and his once-a-week slot on Netflix puts him in line with Michelle Wolf’s recently cancelled The Break. In purpose, he’s closest to John Oliver and Last Week Tonight’s deep-e ethic, but Patriot Act raises that show’s “organized ranting” format to the nth degree.Each of the first two episodes screened for critics concentrates on one topic only – the first, affirmative action, the second, Saudi Arabia’s crown prince Mohammed bin Salman – and eschews many of the trappings that have come to define the late-night genre. There’s no desk in sight Minhaj gets a workout as he monologues with ample physicality and wild gesticulation across a screen-covered stage that he ribs as “like if Michael Bay directed a PowerPoint”. (Another self-dig that doesn’t quite negate the criticism at its heart.)He has no guests, and conducts no interviews. On the sliding scale between information and comedy, he falls closer to the former pole, matching Oliver and his team’s rigor as researchers without making an effort to mount some grand-finale prank or stunt. Minhaj dots his routines with one-liners playing to the upper-middle-brow crowd, slipping once again into self-awareness with an off-the-cuff comment about “hitting all the pockets” with an “arthouse joke” about Call Me By Your Name and an “AP Gov joke” name-checking Hoovervilles. While his colleagues grapple for page views, Minhaj employs a refreshingly un-viral technique.What Minhaj has that his de facto competitors so glaringly lack is his perspective, a voice that can stand out from the chorus of white men with identical haircuts. His heritage as a Muslim of Indian descent figures prominently into the fabric of both episodes, informing his commentary with insights that someone of a different background could not provide. He’s an object lesson in not just the moral but the practical benefits of a erse late-night climate, showing how a plurality of vantage points cultivates a more well-rounded viewership. Whether in an extended bit about the customary Islamic bidet known as a “lota” or in an impassioned soliloquy about the conflict of worship demanding travel to Mecca despite objections to Saudi policy, Minhaj’s unique experience bolsters material that can sometimes verge on the overdone side.Michelle Wolf’s finest hour on The Break came in the form of a meticulous, step-by-step dissection of the remarkably consistent formula that hosts use to keep an audience in their pocket. So much of Minhaj’s manner and content follows this model of pre-packaging, his edgelessness maximized to reassure, comfort, and congratulate the well-educated liberal audience invariably courted by shows of this nature. The crowd dutifully brays at every crack against Trump, secure that they won’t be challenged or implicated as part of the distinctly Republican problem. Like Hannah Gadsby’s Nanette, the original woke TED Talk, Patriot Act’s end goal seems at times to be a feelgood emotional catharsis rather than its ostensible utility as edu-tainment.As a man of color in a largely homogeneous field, he’s well-equipped to avoid this sort of tepid-pudding affirmation and pose difficult, discomfiting questions to the gargantuan viewership that Netflix offers. It is this critic’s sincere hope that Minhaj and his new enterprise will be afforded more time to come into their own and evolve past their flaws than their corporate superiors gave Wolf. Allotting 30 minutes to one topic should engender more trenchant reportage than most can manage, if Minhaj follows the more academic-minded direction suggested by the fitfully funny first two episodes. TV needs him, a notion that the first episode’s topic of affirmative actions meta-textually winks at. The least the man deserves is a chance to prove why."},{"url":null,"title":"john oliver fox news last week tonight","story":"The Last Week Tonight host criticised the network for promoting unconfirmed conspiracy theories over the spate of pipe bombsJohn Oliver has criticised Fox News over the network’s decision to push unconfirmed conspiracy theories in their coverage of the Florida mail bomb suspect.On his HBO show Last Week Tonight, Oliver started with a summary of a “particularly grim” week in the US, including a spate of mail bombs sent to high-profile critics of the president.“It has been a time of sober reflection or if you’re Fox News discussing those package bombs, a time for wild speculation,” he said. “Because before the suspect was even arrested, they were giving airtime to a truly ludicrous theory.”Before the suspect had been identified, the network was giving airtime to pundits and “experts” who claimed that the situation sounded like a false-flag operation, a hoax launched by Democrats.Geraldo Rivera was one of those pushing this theory, prefacing it by saying he didn’t want to sound like a “far-right lunatic” – something that amused Oliver.“Sounding like a far-right lunatic is not really a risk for the Fox News brand, is it?” Oliver said. “It’s more of a guarantee.”After the identity of the bomber was revealed, along with his obsession with the president and hatred of his enemies, Rivera tweeted that he had “outsmarted” himself with his earlier guess.“Outsmarted myself is a brilliant way of saying you did something stupid,” Oliver said. “Wow, I really outsmarted myself this morning when I accidentally ate kitty litter instead of grape nuts.”Oliver then spoke about Saudi Arabia, “the country with bans on pork, alcohol and porn – or, as it’s known in America, a Florida breakfast”.The death of Jamal Khashoggi has continued to raise questions, and Saudi officials have released a string of increasingly unlikely explanations. Last week saw a statement that claimed Khashoggi had died after a disagreement. “Apparently it started when they had a disagreement over whether or not Khashoggi should be murdered in cold blood,” Oliver said.He said that the “horrific situation has put Trump in a very difficult position” before calling Trump’s recent statement “very, very weird”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b773cd83540a325b05e2522361377a6ab8a21d11/0_48_3754_2253/master/3754.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e0c3c8d2d3e35d8a7c4432800064d57","title":"cnn suspicious package intercepted atlanta","story":"President Jeff Zucker says package was intercepted at post office in Atlanta but ‘there is no imminent danger to the CNN Center’Another suspicious package bound for CNN was discovered on Monday morning, the network said.The package was intercepted at a post office in Atlanta, where the network is headquartered, according to a statement from CNN’s president, Jeff Zucker.“There is no imminent danger to the CNN Center,” Zucker said.Two of the pipe bombs sent last week to prominent political figures were addressed to CNN.

Everyone here knows the office. It has stood for decades and is owned by the reservation tribal government. But one thing about it has remained a mystery: its address.Until recently that would hardly have mattered. Many properties, from government buildings to small homes, have no formal street address. Members of the Lakota Sioux tribe who live on Standing Rock, like the Native Americans on four other reservations in North Dakota, just know where people live. Most residents use PO Boxes to collect their mail. For years, thousands have used their PO Boxes when registering formal identification documents.Now, with less than two weeks left before the crucial midterm elections, that poses a problem some fear could change the outcome in a pivotal race.Following a supreme court decision earlier in the month, North Dakota’s voter ID laws will go into effect in November. That means voters will be forced to show ID documents that include a full address before they can cast a ballot. The Republican-backed law has been branded a deliberate attempt to suppress the Native American vote.“They proposed this legislation and never invited us to be at the table,” said Danielle Ta’Sheena Finn, Standing Rock’s external affairs director. “We were not invited to propose comments or questions or concerns. It was done almost under the rug, which tells you the intent.”Inside the unnamed yellow building, the small army of volunteers, brought together by a coalition of Native civil rights groups, are determined to fight back. They plan to knock on every single door in the northern side of this vast reservation, which straddles North and South Dakota, and bus people to the single government building issuing new tribal ID cards until all Standing Rock’s population has the documentation required.It is a mammoth task, in an open place where 3,000 eligible voters live in communities dotted around 1,128 square miles of land.Alva Cottonwood-Gabe sat in the office, her old tribal ID card in her hand. It expired years ago but the 57-year-old, who lives on $393 a month in food stamps and other government subsistence, simply could not afford to pay $5 to replace it.“I’ve got four grandchildren to support and I need it to pay for other things in the home,” she said.Following the supreme court decision, tribal governments in all of North Dakota’s reservations moved to waive the fee for new documents – soaking up the costs themselves. Cottonwood-Gabe was among the first to be bussed in to collect her new ID, which she brandished above her head, a small marker of victory. It was identical to her previous ID card, bar a single line that noted her address was 568 Sioux Avenue.The laborious process, which involved three forms and a queue at the federal office, was a reminder to her of what she believed was the new law’s true intent.“They are trying to suppress our vote because they don’t want to hear what we have to say,” she said. “But voting is so important, not just for me but for my children, my grandchildren, my great-grandchildren.”A mother of 13 and grandmother of 20, Cottonwood-Gabe is a veteran of the pipeline protests that commanded international attention in 2016. She was Maced three times in clashes with police and left partially deaf in one ear, after authorities used sound cannons.She has lived in Standing Rock her whole life and voted in every election since 1984. Environmental protection, she said, was the issue that concerned her the most at this year’s election.The battle for the US Senate seat in North Dakota is among the most crucial races in the midterms. Democratic incumbent Heidi Heitkamp faces Republican congressman Kevin Cramer in an election that could be decided by just a few thousand votes. If Democrats cannot hold the seat, it will be almost impossible for them to take the Senate. Heitkamp, who voted against Donald Trump’s controversial supreme court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, currently trails in the polls.Almost immediately after Heitkamp was elected, Republicans in the state legislature passed the voter ID law. Following court rulings that initially blocked it, 2018 will be the first election the law is in full effect.Cramer, an arch-conservative, has like other Republicans in the state argued the law is vital to protect against voter fraud. At a debate last week he suggested there was no discriminatory effect and accused the law’s critics of playing “identity politics”.North Dakota, the only state in the union that does not require iniduals to register before they vote, has prosecuted just one case of voter fraud in decades. According to the Standing Rock tribal council, there has never been a cases of voter fraud in Sioux county, the jurisdiction that covers all of Standing Rock’s territory in the state.For some the new laws were a further reminder of the state’s racist past, in which it legally disenfranchised most Native voters. At the turn of the 20th century North Dakota’s constitution gave the right to vote only to “civilised persons of Indian descent” who had ended their ties to tribal government. Like the Jim Crow laws of the south, the discrimination was formally ended with the passing of the 1965 Voting Rights Act – a defining achievement of the civil rights movement.But since a 2013 supreme court decision weakened key provisions of that law, the voting rights of minority groups like Native Americans have come under frequent attack.Standing at the top of a hill that overlooked Fort Yates, as autumn leaves swirled in the wind, Chase Iron Eyes looked out over his childhood home.“This history that we have here is not set up to honour us as human beings or honour our right to participate in democracy,” he said.“The government didn’t need a physical address to come and steal our children for boarding school. The government didn’t need a physical address when it was time for us to be conscripted into their militaries. But now they need a physical address so that we can exercise one of the most basic principles and tenets of a representative democracy.”“Every election is such a beast. There’s got to be an organized, consistent effort to get our people – disempowered, disenfranchised oppressed people – to give a shit about their destiny. That’s a hard thing to do.”Over the two days of door knocking observed by the , dozens of Standing Rock residents said they had already been out to collect new ID documents. But canvassers were concerned by a few incidents that illustrated the strict requirements now in place.Residents were being told to fill in their forms in blue ink: clerks at the county offices had rejected applications written in black and green. One Standing Rock resident, Dale Ramsey, had his application for a new ID rejected as he had previously listed an address outside the reservation on a separate document. (He had been homeless at the time and so registered at a shelter outside Standing Rock.) As it stood, he would not be able to vote.The tribe were also concerned that two of the five polling stations inside the reservation would only be open from midday on election day – the other three will be open from 9am.Volunteers were encouraging voters to cast their ballot early, at the county courthouse, by applying in person for an absentee ballot and handing it straight back with the vote cast. But the tiny offices there were burdened with other municipal duties too.Out in the remote settlement town of Selfridge, 34-year-old Honorata Defender and three other volunteers were knocking on doors. On one dusty street, 81-year-old James Cowry opened the door, surprised to be receiving visitors.He had lived in his home for three decades and had never known its formal address. The volunteers told him to call the local 911 coordinator, who would give him the information. But he had still not decided whether to vote.“I don’t feel for the candidates either way,” he said.Defender vowed to come back and drive him 30 miles down the road to pick up his ID card later in the week.“Every vote should count,” she said. “I’ll do all that I can to help you.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f021d5d158195249562ab3c772c6589da6d2c44e/0_316_3813_2287/master/3813.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eecc7105eae582260c524015220b42b6","title":"armistice day 100 years on share your letters stories and photographs","story":"Whether your family members or friends were in active service, or in some supporting role at home or abroad, we’d like to hear their storiesSunday 11 November this year will mark 100 years since the armistice treaty was signed between first world war allies and Germany, bringing to an end four years of war in western Europe.On that day people in Britain celebrated by pouring out onto the streets and gathering in large places.

The departure of the EU’s de facto leader before Germany’s next federal elections – due in 2021 – comes as the continent’s political stability and consensus are arguably at greater risk than at any time since the end of the second world war.After months of fraught negotiations, Merkel’s damaged conservatives renewed a weakened and unpopular coalition with their traditional centre-left rivals, the Social Democratic party (SPD). In an ever more fragmented European political landscape, both are now paying the price as voters turn their backs on the traditional parties of government.Held together more by a fear of the alternative – and, in particular, the further rise of the far-right AfD – than by any driving policy ambitions, the governing alliance in Berlin lacks clear, bold ideas and the courage to implement them, creating an increasingly untenable leadership vacuum that voters have punished.Merkel’s move was not, then, entirely unexpected. She has decided that governing one hard-fought compromise at a time, clinging on after elections that were defeats but not quite disasters, is doing more harm than good – and it would be better to remove herself from the electoral equation.But the loss of a chancellor whose cautious blend of principle and pragmatism guided her country and the EU through the 2008 financial crash and ensuing eurozone crisis, the Arab spring, Russia’s aggression in Ukraine and Europe’s migration crisis will still leave a chasm to be filled.While applauded for its humanity, many see her bold decision in 2015 to open Germany’s borders to about a million refugees, mostly Muslims fleeing wars and poverty in the Middle East and beyond, as having speeded her departure, diminishing her authority, iding her party, her country and its European partners, and boosting support for anti-immigrant parties.At home, all eyes will will be focused on whether Merkel can manage to stage a smooth exit. In theory, her announcement that she will not be standing again for the party’s leadership at its conference in December should – while she remains chancellor – allow a new CDU chair to build a strong electoral profile before 2021.But events may well intervene. Merkel is under heavy pressure from her ailing SPD partners to deliver more policy results. The centre-left party, whose vote share has plummeted to an all-time low, could yet pull out of the coalition government during a midterm review next year.That would trigger federal elections and an earlier-than-planned departure for Germany’s first female chancellor. Two of her CDU predecessors as head of government, Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, both failed signally to ensure an untroubled succession.Even if Merkel avoids a messy end to her political career, the CDU’s attention will necessarily be on putting its own house in order and finding a successor able and willing to step into Merkel’s shoes. The government, likewise, will be seeking domestic progress faced with the advances not just of the AfD, but the pro-EU, refugee-welcoming Greens.The chancellor’s weakness at home could well limit her capacity to lead – or at least, provide stability – in the EU at a time when the bloc is dealing with Brexit, a budget crisis in Italy and the prospect of populist parties making big gains in the European parliament elections next May.This is bad news mainly for the French president, Emmanuel Macron, whose big visions of eurozone reform now look further from being realised than ever. It will not, however, herald any major changes in Germany’s policy towards the bloc – or to Brexit.Senior UK officials and politicians had long predicted Merkel would step in close to the end of Brexit talks to secure a deal that Theresa May could sell to parliament. That was never very likely – but even if it had been, with her leadership now time-limited, Merkel’s leverage to fix results has been hugely weakened.More significantly, EU diplomats note that neither Merkel nor Macron can afford to offer the UK any succour in the negotiations.With European elections due next May, the onus for the powerful Franco-German alliance will be on maintaining a tough, principled approach that illustrates clearly the benefits of EU membership and the grave risks to an economy of leaving."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4a578bc4f4e3607b0ecff7c29e8db384e5192fb/0_158_2732_1639/master/2732.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=89172d3e972447b2aed53a6cf23ed7df","title":"angela merkel wont seek re election as cdu party leader","story":"Chancellor also tells Christian Democrats she will not seek re-election as party chairwoman in DecemberAfter dominating European politics for well over a decade, Angela Merkel has said her fourth term as Germany’s chancellor will be her last.Speaking after disastrous regional elections in Hesse and Bavaria for her Christian Democrats and its Bavaria-only sister party, Merkel on Monday said she saw the results as a “clear signal that things can’t go on as they are”.She said she would not be standing as party leader at the CDU conference in December nor seek another term as chancellor at Germany’s next federal elections, due in 2021, adding that she would withdraw completely from politics after that date.She also stated she would also not run for chancellor if snap elections were called before 2021.Often hailed as the world’s most powerful woman and the de facto leader of Europe, Merkel long enjoyed German voters’ support as a guarantor of the country’s stability and prosperity.But her authority has been severely weakened since her decision to keep Germany’s borders open at the height of Europe’s migrant crisis in 2015. The subsequent arrival of more than one million asylum seekers left the country deeply polarised and fuelled the rise of the far-right.Merkel said she hoped her planned departure would end bitter fighting in her weak and fractious right-left coalition and allow it to focus on governing, declaring that “the picture the government is sending out is unacceptable”.Voter dissatisfaction with the federal government had had a regrettable negative influence on the results in Hesse, she said.Seeking to draw a line under a series of political crises that have rocked her fragile coalition, she added that her 13 years as chancellor had been a “daily challenge and an honour”, but that she recognised it was time to “start a new chapter”.It had been widely assumed after her party’s disappointing showing in last year’s federal elections that this, Merkel’s fourth term as chancellor, would be her last, but she had not previously commented on her future.She said on Monday she has made the decision before the summer parliamentary recess and had planned to announce it next week.Her decision not to seek re-election as chair of her centre-right party kickstarts what looks set to be a close-fought race to replace her as its candidate for chancellor in 2021. Merkel, 64, has been CDU chair since 2000 and chancellor since 2005.Her presumed favoured successor is the party’s secretary general, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, who announced her candidacy on Monday, but Merkel declined to back her, saying she did not want to influence the election.Friedrich Merz, a former parliamentary leader of the CDUCSU alliance, has also joined the race to succeed his old party rival. Other favourites are the health minister Jens Spahn and the state premier of North Rhine-Westphalia, Armin Laschet.The CDU general secretary is a staunch centrist, Merkel loyalist and the favourite to succeed her. The 56-year-old former premier of Saarland, who also goes by her initials AKK, is also thought to be Merkel’s preference\u0026nbsp to continue her work of modernising the party. Kramp-Karrenbauer is considered a pragmatist and was a quiet supporter of Merkel’s migration policy, but has expressed reservations about marriage and adoption rights for same sex couples.\u0026nbsp Her intention to stand as CDU leader was reportedly met with applause from party colleagues.At 38, the German health minister is the youngest contender to succeed Merkel. Openly gay, he is firmly to the right of Merkel and has described himself as a “burqaphobe.” He has also warned against “putting the boot into Britain” over Brexit. Perhaps the harshest critic of Merkel’s migration policy within the CDU, Spahn has made a name for himself with his combative style but, it seems, it might not have made him many friends. In contrast to Kramp-Karrenbauer, his intention to stand was reportedly met with deathly silence from party colleagues.Merkel\u0027s old party rival was the first to announce he would stand to replace her. Back in Back in 2002, the dual party leaders (Merz was head of the CDUCSU parliamentary bloc) had clashed over the latter\u0027s\u0026nbsp suggested slimming down of the tax system and his calls for a “German dominant culture.” Merkel pushed him out of office and out of politics altogether until recent rumours of a comeback for the\u0026nbsp 62-year-old.The 57-year-old state premier of North Rhine-Westphalia and devout Catholic sits to the right of Merkel on migration, religion and family issues. In the past he has waded into debates about the role of Islam in Germany and has been a staunch opponent of same sex marriage as well as Germany’s military foreign interventions. He is thought to be close to the liberal FDP on energy policy.Traditionally, the person who holds the position of party chair of the government’s largest party also occupies the role of chancellor, but this is not a binding rule. Merkel has previously said the two jobs belong together.Merkel’s predecessor, the Social Democrat Gerhard Schröder, made the same move in 2004, giving up the position of party chair but remaining chancellor until November 2005. At the time, Merkel, who was then leader of the opposition, spoke of a “loss of authority all along the line”, and “the beginning of the end” of Schröder.Christian Lindner, the leader of the liberal FDP party, was the first to demand Merkel’s resignation as chancellor on the back of her decision, calling for her ruling conservative bloc to “be prepared for a real new beginning in Germany”.Merkel’s CDU allies, however, seem ready to accept her decision to stay on as chancellor for now. The former president of the German parliament Norbert Lammert told Die Welt it was acceptable as part of a “transition phase”, while the head of the CDU in the German state of Thuringia, Mike Mohring, spoke of a “turning point”. Others greeted the chance for renewal in the party.David McAllister, a senior CDU MEP and close Merkel ally, said the chancellor’s announcement had come as a surprise to everyone. “What she did today is give our party a chance for a fresh start,” he told the . He said he would welcome the continuation of the grand coalition, but urged all parties to put aside their differences.“It is important that we now learn from the mistakes of the last months, all three coalition partners should stop fighting in public and concentrate on the issues. That is what Germans expect from their governments.”After news of Merkel’s decision not to stand for re-election as leader of the CDU, however, Nahles ruled out a change in leadership in her party. “A personnel configuration is not being discussed in the SPD,” she told journalists on Monday morning.Sunday’s electoral trouncing for the ruling coalition came shortly after an equally disastrous result in Bavaria, widely seen as a protest against the failings of the Berlin government. Both results reflected the increasing fragmentation of Europe’s political landscape and the shrinking of the mainstream across the continent.The euro fell briefly following Merkel’s announcement, reflecting anxiety at the planned departure from Europe’s top table of the cautious and experienced German chancellor.Additional reporting by Jennifer Rankin in Brussels"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f71366dc093803243b0bc5e980e7ecf85f403583/0_92_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0c72240dd48b27cdd21e525c89e69c5a","title":"canada greyhound bus ending urban rural","story":"Longstanding bus routes will see their last journeys this month, mirroring the region’s struggles: ‘Those who remain are unable to leave’by Will Doig in Swan RiverIt’s 10 to midnight when the Winnipeg-bound Greyhound bus swings off of the empty highway and into a dirt lot illuminated by a single street lamp.Its headlights sweep across the only passenger waiting in this remote lumber town: Mary Reimer, 80, is bundled in a purple parka against the cold.“Since my husband passed away four years ago, this is how I get to my sister,” she says, before climbing aboard.It’s the last time she’ll make the journey this way.Amid cratering passenger figures, Greyhound will discontinue all service in Canada’s western provinces on 31 October. The cuts will eliminate routes that have existed for nearly a century and sever the only transit link for dozens of towns where the British-owned company has endured even as other businesses have trickled away.Some analysts see it as yet another indicator that rural Canada is not only struggling, but slowly decoupling from the country’s thriving urban cores.Don Warkentin has witnessed these changes. After 34 years driving Greyhound buses between Winnipeg and the mining city of Flin Flon 11 hours north, he’ll retire next week along with his route.One of 415 employees phased out by the cuts, he remembers when Greyhound made three runs a day on this stretch, with 24-hour depots at each stop. Now there’s one bus nightly, and most stops are bare-bones roadside pull-offs like this one. “Not as many people are riding these days,” he says, pushing Reimer’s luggage into the undercarriage. “It’s an Uber culture now.”For those that can’t afford an Uber or the high cost of gas, Greyhound’s decision to write off much of the Canadian frontier is more than an inconvenience.“Greyhound is a private company, but they were almost public transportation in terms of the service they provided,” says Cathy Sproule, a member of the New Democratic party congress in Saskatchewan.The decline of Greyhound’s Canadian service reflects the story of rural Canada itself.“We see a confluence of events happening,” says Laura Neidhart, spokeswoman for the advocacy group Canada Without Poverty. “More and more people are leaving rural Canada, and the people who remain are often the ones who are unable to leave.” Since 1950, the rural share of the country’s population has fallen by half.This is evident in Mafeking, a wisp of a town north of Swan River that’s speckled with boarded-up shops. At the Tempo gas station, the clerk Karina Kryzanowski says she hasn’t ridden the bus since the 1980s, in part because it passes through town in the middle of the night, and passengers have to stand on the road to flag it down – a daunting prospect on a desolate highway in the boreal forest.Today, over one-third of Canadians live in Toronto, Vancouver, or Montreal, a dramatic shift from when Greyhound Canada launched in British Columbia in 1929.Back then, mining and farming towns dotted the country’s vast interior.Too isolated for the private sector to bother with, many of their services – insurance coverage and even liquor stores – were furnished by the government. These “crown corporations” also provided transportation, including taxpayer-funded bus lines.Some of these lines still operate today. Ontario Northland, for instance, is a bus line financed by the province that links Toronto with tiny outposts 10 hours north-west. A product of Canada’s 20th-century democratic-socialist heyday, the state-run bus lines were founded on the presumption that integrating rural and urban regions benefits both.That presumption is now being challenged. The starkest example is the Saskatchewan Transportation Company (STC), a 72-year-old state-run bus line that was shuttered last year by the province’s ruling Conservatives.“It was a total shock,” says Cindy Hanson, an organizer with Stop the Cuts, an advocacy group for public services in the province. “They did it so quickly there was no time to protest.”Growing up on a farm in Saskatchewan, Hanson remembers her dad receiving machine parts on the STC buses. “They came through twice a day, so it was faster and cheaper than any other shipping method,” she says. When the STC shut down last year, 253 communities were directly affected, according to Hanson.Afterward, 10 private bus companies stepped in to replace the lost STC routes. Within a year, all but two had walked away, unable to turn a meaningful profit.“The idea behind the crown corporations is that they’re expected to operate in some areas at a loss,” says Hanson.Canada now finds itself in a tight spot. “There’s a real urban-rural dilemma,” says Barry Prentice, a professor of supply chain management at the University of Manitoba. As remote towns depopulate, services are scaled back, compelling even more residents to leave. “For those who don’t have friends or family to help them, the only solution is to move to the city,” he says.At the same time, Canada’s resource-based economy makes this a perilous cycle. “Forestry, mining, oil and gas – you can’t do these things from downtown Toronto,” says Prentice.But you can do them with far fewer people – insulating city dwellers from realizing the effects of rural decline, says Bill Reimer, professor emeritus at Concordia University.This gulf perpetuates itself, both culturally and politically. “Until maybe 20 or 30 years ago, most people in urban areas had rural roots, and that included policymakers,” says Reimer.This disconnect is one that Earl Mund, a cattle and grain farmer from Langenburg, Saskatchewan, feels acutely.At 81, he doesn’t mind the 11-hour bus trip to Edmonton to visit his daughters. What he minds is the seeming indifference of lawmakers to an issue that affects rural communities uniquely.“A lot of people in my town rely on the bus,” says Mund, exhaling steam in the early morning sun on a stopover in Saskatoon. “I think it’s a kind of discrimination. I’ll probably visit my daughters less often now. Maybe I won’t be able to visit them at all.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a07503dfb1bab279b54e8c9d5cbcc9771837bbf/0_147_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35d0546c6dbc98a0c475a4a7941b445d","title":"lion air plane lost contact indonesia flight jt610 jakarta","story":"Communication lost with Lion Air plane carrying 189 people minutes after takeoffA passenger plane carrying 189 people crashed into the sea off Jakarta on Monday minutes after taking off on a domestic flight to an Indonesian tin-mining region.Lion Air flight JT610, travelling from Jakarta to Pangkal Pinang on the island of Bangka, lost contact with air traffic control about 13 minutes after it took off, shortly after its pilot had asked to return to base. Flight data showed that it made a sudden, sharp e into the sea.Officials said human remains had been recovered from the crash site, about nine miles (15km) off the coast, and that they did not expect to find survivors.The plane was a Boeing 737 Max 8 jet, a new model that was launched globally only last year. The specific plane had been in use for less than three months.Lion Air’s chief executive, Edward Sirait, told reporters the plane had suffered “a technical issue” on Sunday night but engineers had cleared it to fly on Monday morning. “This plane previously flew from Denpasar to Jakarta,” he said. “There was a report of a technical issue, which had been resolved according to procedure.”Sirait did not elaborate on the specific issue, and said he had no plans to ground the rest of Lion Air’s Max 8 fleet. The airline operates 11 of the Boeing planes.On Monday rescuers released footage of debris and personal items floating in the water at the crash site, including handbags, clothing, mobile phones, ID cards and driving licences. Dozens of ers from the national search and rescue agency and the military were working to retrieve the bodies of victims.At Soekarno-Hatta airport in Jakarta, relatives arrived at the airport crisis centre, many too distressed to talk to the media.Tugi, a Jakarta resident, came to inquire about his friend Wendy. “I came to try and get some information, but they can’t give us any answers,” he said. “They don’t know yet, so I am going home and will monitor the media reports from there.”Forensics officers have told family members of those on board that they can assist with the identification process by providing medical and dental records at the police hospital in East Jakarta.About 20 of the 189 people on board were Indonesian finance department officials who had travelled to Jakarta for a conference. Three children, two of them infants, and eight crewmembers were also among those on board.A statement from Indonesia’s search and rescue agency said the aircraft’s emergency locator transmitter had not sent out a distress signal despite being certified to work until August 2019.The plane went down in waters about 30-35 metres (98-115ft) deep. Indonesia’s disaster agency spokesman posted video of debris on Twitter.Another official said he could not confirm the cause of the crash, as the plane’s black box, comprising the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder, had yet to be recovered. But it was confirmed that the pilot had requested to turn back shortly after takeoff.“We will collect all data from the control tower,” said Soerjanto Tjahjono, the official. “The plane is so modern, it transmits data from the plane and that we will review too. But the most important is the black box.”On Monday afternoon the national search and rescue agency said it had determined the location of the black box, but had not yet managed to retrieve it.The Lion Air plane that crashed into the sea moments after takeoff on Monday had been used by the airline for only two months. It has been described as the “world’s most reliable airplane”.The 737 MAX 8 model was first operated for a commercial flight in May 2017 by Malindo Air, but has since been adopted by airlines globally. The plane is a variant of the Boeing 737 Max series, which is the fastest selling plane in Boeing history. Worth upwards of £70m, the Max 8 version has an air range of 6,570km and\u0026nbsp a passenger capacity of up to 210. The planes are built at Boeing’s factory in Renton, Washington, in the US.The plane has been purchased by airlines across the world, including American Airlines, United Airlines, Ryanair, Jet Airlines, FlyDubai, Norwegian Air, Iceland Air, SilkAir, Turkish Airlines, Korean Air, Air Canada and Malaysia Airlines.The crash in Indonesia was the first incident involving the 737 Max model. In a statement released after the Indonesia crash, Boeing said the company “stands ready to provide technical assistance to the accident investigation.The incident is the first to be reported that involves the widely sold Max 8, an updated, more fuel-efficient version of the common 737. The first Boeing 737 Max jets were introduced into service in 2017. Boeing and the US National Transportation Safety Board both said on Monday that they were providing assistance to Indonesian accident investigators.The Indonesian president, Joko Widodo, expressed his condolences in a televised address.Australian government officials have been instructed not to fly with Lion Air until the cause of the crash can be determined.Indonesia is one of the world’s fastest-growing aviation markets, although its safety record is patchy. The crash could potentially be the country’s second worst air disaster since 1997, industry experts said.Reuters contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b83c441387eb4e32b8f54f487c1d7e2d012538b3/191_30_1870_1122/master/1870.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e7a4e0236ae6932c515677071bb3478","title":"the remains of stalin gulag railroad soviet union a photo essay","story":"In Russia’s Arctic wilderness, the remnants of one of the Soviet Union’s most notorious gulag projects lie largely forgottenFrom 1947 until 1953, tens of thousands of prisoners, many of them “politicals” convicted for “anti-Soviet acts”, were shipped to northern Russia to lay a railroad through some of the harshest terrain on Earth.The railroad would have connected Russia’s Arctic waters with its western railway network.Most records relating to the gulags, the brutal network of forced-labour camps for dissenters, criminals, and other perceived threats, remain secret. But it is likely that Stalin, spooked by the incursion of Nazi submarines into the Arctic during the second world war, wanted the railway in place as a means of supplying a planned naval port. The railway also would have connected northern nickel mines to Soviet factories in the west.But just days after Stalin’s death in 1953, the project was cancelled amid the subsequent Soviet “thaw”. Since then, the railway’s gulag camps have lain abandoned, sinking further into the forest under the weight of each winter’s snow. Getting to the camps today is difficult outside of winter, with most lying beyond terrain that would bog a tank.Only specialised vehicles, like this balloon-tyred Trekol in which Chapple travelled, are able to move through the swampy region where the railroad was laid.But the biggest threat to survival, according to another former prisoner, came from the brutal winters, which frequently dropped below -40C (-40F).Prisoners were kept ided in gendered barracks. One survivor, Alexandr Snovsky, says the men would throw letters into the female zone to communicate in secret.Some remains, such as this shack that probably housed guards, have been maintained and are regularly used by hunters.Most engineers engaged on the railway were free workers, while the heavy labour was carried out by prisoners. Most of the railway, as evidenced by this old signal marker, has fallen into ruin.For Snovsky, who now lives with his wife near St Petersburg, the biggest tragedy was the project’s futility: “Tens of thousands of human lives for nothing. For me, the saddest thing was that it was for nothing.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3679878.1540843978!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"it was miraculous this procedure gave me back my life","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRachel Corbally: “I’m just so lucky someone invented this machine.” Photograph: Sasko LazarovPhotocall IrelandRachel Corbally knows the value of thrombectomy very well after it saved her life last January.The sports-mad 48-year-old from Naas had no reason to believe anything was amiss when she awoke one Monday morning, fresh from a vigorous gym session the previous evening.On getting up, however, she felt “a bit fuzzy” and then collapsed suddenly on the floor. Having lost power on her left and right sides, she was unable to move.Fortunately, her adult son was at home and realised the seriousness of the situation. An ambulance was called and brought her to Naas hospital, where doctors diagnosed deep vein thrombosis causing stroke. Under the State’s stroke programme, Naas patients are brought to the national treatment centre at Beaumont Hospital, Dublin. In little over an hour, Corbally found herself undergoing a painful procedure in which a tube is inserted into an artery in the groin. This is passed through blood vessels to the brain, where it sucks out the clot causing the stroke.Though painful, the procedure led to her complete recovery. Within days, she was out on a date, within a week she did a job interview and in little over two weeks she was back doing laps in the swimming pool. She has since begun a new job with demanding travel requirements.“It was miraculous,” she says. “It’s very seldom you come across something in life that is, but this procedure gave me back my life.”The success of her surgery also saved the health system a lot of money, as the costs of looking after the long-term needs of incapacitated stroke patients are considerable.“I’m just so lucky someone invented this machine, and that my local hospital had an agreement with Beaumont. It’s frightening to think that it mightn’t have been working due to a breakdown.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3679782.1540835170!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"number of refused british applications for irish passports rises dramatically","story":"Speaking at meeting of foreign ministers in mid-October in Luxembourg, Tánaiste Simon Coveney called on the British government to follow through on commitments made in Brexit talks.

Photograph: Bryan O’BrienThe number of applications from UK residents seeking Irish passports since Britain voted to leave the EU being turned down has risen dramatically.Passport applications from British residents being refused have soared from just one refusal in 2016 to at least 15,074 last year, according to latest figures.Overall hundreds of thousands of UK residents have applied for Irish passports since Britain voted for Brexit and the rate of applications continues to increase.The rise in requests for Irish passports from Northern Ireland is even greater than from Britain.Worldwide, the number of applications for Irish passports received from outside the State surged from 190,905 in 2016 to 227,223 last year and up to the end of September this year had hit 191,271, according to figures released to Social Democrat TD Catherine Murphy.Statistics supplied to Fine Gael Senator Neale Richmond by the Irish Embassy in London show that the number of passport applications from the UK has risen significantly since the year before the Brexit vote.In 2015 there were almost 99,944 applications from Britain and Northern Ireland, a figure that rose to 131,035 the following year.In 2017 there was a further increase of over 30,000 applications to 163,026.And figures this year to the end of May show 91,860 applications were made.The number of people from the North who applied to the Irish Embassy in London for an Irish passport rose from 53,715 in 2015 to 67,582 the following year.Applications jumped again last year to 82,274 and up to the end of May this year 46,898 people in the North applied for Irish passports.“Embassy officials predict that based on this, 2018 will be the busiest year so far for Irish passport applications in the UK,” Mr Richmond said.People born to Irish parents or grandparents are entitled to apply for an Irish passport through a claim to citizenship.“At least 10 per cent of the UK’s population, not including Northern Ireland, are estimated to qualify for an Irish passport and in light of Brexit” many were “staking their claim” to the passport, Mr Richmond said.Tánaiste Simon Coveney told Ms Murphy in a parliamentary reply that the passport service did not compile data on the number of passport applications refused.However, Mr Coveney told her that in 2016 a total of 63,452 passports were issued by the Irish Embassy in London, one fewer than the number of applications diplomats told Mr Richmond it had received from Britain.The Tánaiste also said 65,678 Irish passports were issued through the embassy last year, some 15,074 less than the 80,752 applications from British residents.Mr Coveney pointed out that the passport service “must be satisfied as to the identity of the applicant and that the applicant is an Irish citizen”.Mr Richmond said that “while many in the UK are concerned with the looming disaster of Brexit, we must seize the positives from this new wave of people reconnecting with their Irish heritage, our post-Brexit UK-Irish relations can be built on a strong, connected diaspora”.In contrast, applications from the Irish diaspora elsewhere around the world have dropped slightly.Ms Murphy noted that the number of applications has fallen annually since 2016 in locations with significant Irish populations including New York, San Francisco and Boston in the US although there has been an increase in applications to the Chicago consulate from 1,126 in 2016 to 2,046 last year and 1,435 up to the end of September this year.Applications outside the EU are also falling including those from Canada, New Zealand, Australia, United Arab Emirates, China and Japan.In Africa, applications from Nigeria, Mozambique, Uganda, and Tanzania have also fallen. In Kenya, there were no applications in 2016 or last year but four this year."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000177653497_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqrpfQw2hJyG_yckwxPAr0go9KzD8cVu9iguqnaKUswZA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"bbc legal correspondent wrong say nda signed freely","story":"BBC legal correspondent criticised for saying NDA was signed freely Court of AppealThe BBC has been told it is “inaccurate” to claim that women who entered into non-disclosure agreements after they had made allegations about sexual harassment did so “freely”.Media and employment lawyers have said it is likely there would be an “imbalance of power” during negotiations to settle a claim and therefore it was incorrect to view these contractual relationships as free of “abuse”.Yesterday, a BBC journalist claimed the judgment by the Court of Appeal “made clear that there was no evidence any of the NDAs resulted from bullying, harassment or undue pressure”.

Mr Chernikov believes that another such steam engine in the area was sold for scrap.“We didn\u0027t want this prize to fall into the hands of greedy people,” he told Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper. “For us it\u0027s a historical treasure, but for some it\u0027s just a bunch of scrap metal.”A truck and crane deliver the steam engine to a local museumThe steam engine was built by Richard Garrett and Sons Ltd, founded in 1778 in the Suffolk town of Leiston. After hearing about the efficiency of assembly line production from American gunmaker Samuel Colt at the Great Exhibition of 1851 in London, Richard Garrett III established the first such production line for steam engines.It was a huge success, exporting its products around the world, and the “Long Shop” in Leiston is still preserved as a museum.The firm that made the steam engine was the first in the UK to produce such machines on an assembly lineMr Chernikov said he\u0027s contacted the Royal Geographic Society to try to establish when the Krasnoyarsk steam engine was made and who bought it.It would have been shipped to Russia through the Arctic Ocean, then hauled by frozen rivers and roads to the mines. The 19th century Siberian gold rush began, according to legend, after a hunter discovered gold amongst the sand that had been swallowed by a grouse he shot.Workers first panned for gold, then later dug for it. A picture of another steam engine made by Richard Garrett and SonsMiners in Krasnoyarsk probably used the Leiston steam engine to pump out groundwater and pulverise rocks.  Mr Chernikov heard about its existence from a local who pointed out its rough location on a map, but couldn\u0027t find it when he and his partner bicycled to the area. He had to give up on his second attempt because the road was too muddy to cycle. On a third try, the pair got a lift on a petrol tank lorry and hiked 10 miles through the wilderness. “We took a break, ate lunch and decided to go a little further, and that\u0027s when we got lucky. Literally 100 metres along we ran into the machine,” he said. A pair of Russian historians travelled muddy roads and hiked more than 10 miles through the wilderness to find the steam engineIronically, it was the Russian sales of Garrett and Sons that helped bring about the firm\u0027s demise. Following the 1917 revolution, it couldn\u0027t collect the huge debts it was owed for machinery exported to Russia.The company went into receivership in 1932 and was bought by Beyer Peacock of Manchester, which closed down its Leiston production in 1980.Please review our commenting policyThousands of US soldiers \u0026#39to be deployed at border\u0026#39 as Trump escalates migrant caravan rhetoric \u0026#39Austerity is over,\u0026#39 says Philip Hammond as £12 billion windfall sees spending increaseSynagogue massacre suspect Robert Bowers in first court appearanceRestaurants swapping out sprouts for kale on Christmas menus after shortage of festive favouriteWaitrose magazine editor causes outrage by joking about \u0026#39killing vegans\u0026#39Comment: Austerity may be ending, but younger voters like me would benefit far more from a more fiscally restrained Budget Comment: Philip Hammond beat the hecklers – but his jokes went down the panWhy Brazil\u0026#39s president-elect Jair Bolsonaro really is the \u0026#39Trump of the Tropics\u0026#39Comment: A new 50p coin to commemorate Brexit?

She said on Monday she hoped to continue to help the emperor and empress as a former member of the Imperial family.The Imperial family’s loss of Princess Ayako – who receives a one-off payment of around £744,000 (107 million yen) from the state  – brings the total number of family members to 18, including 13 women.The figures reflect the growing succession crisis facing Japan’s shrinking royal family, with only four male heirs to the throne currently remaining, including Crown Prince Naruhito, who will take over when his father abdicates next year.While there have been growing calls for reform of the Imperial succession law in recent years, changes have been resisted by powerful conservatives who are strongly opposed to women inheriting the Chrysanthemum throne. Princess Ayako, who works as a research fellow in Social Work Studies at Josai International University in Chiba Prefecture, was introduced to Mr Moriya by her mother last December.Mr Moriya, whose hobbies include marathons and triathlons, attended schools in Paris, Switzerland and the UK before graduating from prestigious Keio University in Tokyo.The bride instantly connected with Mr Moriya, whose late mother was reportedly a long-time close friend of the bride’s mother, when they first met, telling media this summer: “I remember that our conversation got so lively that it didn’t feel like we had just met and that I had so much fun that I forgot about time.”Meanwhile, Princess Mako, the oldest grandchild of the Emperor, had also planned to marry her fiancé Kei Komura this year, before the nuptials were postponed for two years due to insufficient preparations.Please review our commenting policyThousands of US soldiers \u0026#39to be deployed at border\u0026#39 as Trump escalates migrant caravan rhetoric \u0026#39Austerity is over,\u0026#39 says Philip Hammond as £12 billion windfall sees spending increaseSynagogue massacre suspect Robert Bowers in first court appearanceRestaurants swapping out sprouts for kale on Christmas menus after shortage of festive favouriteWaitrose magazine editor causes outrage by joking about \u0026#39killing vegans\u0026#39Comment: Austerity may be ending, but younger voters like me would benefit far more from a more fiscally restrained Budget Comment: Philip Hammond beat the hecklers – but his jokes went down the panWhy Brazil\u0026#39s president-elect Jair Bolsonaro really is the \u0026#39Trump of the Tropics\u0026#39Comment: A new 50p coin to commemorate Brexit?

Their conflict has been simmering ever since, but flared up again in January this year.Ja Rule couldn’t help but lash out, and since then things have been more tense than ever, with their back-and-forths on social media serving as a by-product of a dispute that began in the streets.Most recently, 50 Cent decided to try and troll Ja Rule by purchasing 200 tickets to his forthcoming show in Las Vegas, for a total of around $3,000 – and leave\u0026nbspthe seats empty. Ja Rule seemed to find the prank just as amusing as Fiddy did (he still got paid, right?), and responded by posting an image of his rival with makeup photoshopped on (real mature, Ja).Here’s a timeline of their beef so farIn 1999, Ja Rule was robbed for his chain at gunpoint in Southside Jamaica, Queens while he was filming a music video. According to 50 Cent, Ja Rule was incensed after seeing\u0026nbspFiddy\u0026nbspat a club with the man who robbed him.\u0026nbsp“A friend of mine robbed Ja Rule,” 50 Cent\u0026nbsprecounted in his 2005 biography From Pieces to Weight. “That’s how the beef originally started. My man robbed him for a chain, and then this guy named Brown came and got the chain back for Ja. Later, Ja saw me in a club with the kid who robbed him. I went over to say, ‘What’s up’ to Ja, and he acted like he had a problem with me. But I’m not the one who robbed him.”But Ja, who later confirmed the robbery took place, denied he ever saw Fiddy with the robber. He claims that the bad blood between them stemmed from Fiddy being snubbed by the Murder Inc. crew during a video shoot for his single “Murda 4 Life”.Created with Sketch.10 of the biggest moments in the 50 Cent-Ja Rule beef Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 1) Ja Rule is robbed at gunpoint in QueensIn 1999, Ja Rule was robbed for his chain at gunpoint in Southside Jamaica, Queens while he was filming a music video. According to 50 Cent, Ja Rule was incensed after Fiddy at a club with the man who robbed him. 210 2) Fight breaks out between 50 and Ja in Atlanta50 and Ja Rule got into a physical altercation at an Atlanta nightclub, where they were both booked to perform. Both their neck chains were broken during the fight – a member of Fif’s crew found Ja’s pendant, and 50 claimed that a deal was made to return it in exchange for a Movado watch – Ja denied that was the case. In a 2016 interview, Chris Gotti offered his own take, which was that the two were talking one-on-one when Ja hit 40 Cent with several questions at once. Fiddy lashed out, then Ja Rule allegedly pulled his shirt over his head and began swinging punches. Whichever side you believe, the incident proved to be a massive catalyst for the events that followed.In March 2000, after receiving word that 50 was recording at the Hit Factory studios in New York, Ja and his crew decided to pay the rapper a visit. In the altercation that followed, Fiddy suffered a stab wound, and Ja Rule and Murder Inc. rapper Black Child (L) were both arrested. Black Child took credit for the stabbing on record, claming it was an act of self-defence. In interviews after the attack, 50 consistently downplayed the incident.410 4) Fiddy is accused of signing an order of protectionAfter the brawl at the Hit Factory, Irv Gotti (L) claimed Fiddy signed an order of protection against him and Ja, in an attempt to put his street credibility on the line. It was later confirmed that the order does exist, but was issued on 50’s behalf – not his request – as a formality by the NYPD. In June 2018, Ja Rule shared the order again on social media and called 50 Cent a rat. 510 5) 50 Cent’s management offices get shot up – January 2003An unknown gunman opened fire on the offices of Violator records and Violator Management (pictured) – which was handling Fiddy’s career at the time. No one was injured in the shooting and there were no arrests, but early reports tied it to the feud between Ja and Fif.In April 2013, Ja Rule came back with one of the most disrespectful diss tracks in hip hop history. “Loose Change” fired shots at 50 Cent, G-Unit, Eminem, Eminem’s daughter Hailie, Dr Dre, Busta Rhymes and Chris Lighty. Ja accused 50 of being a snitch, called Dr Dre a “faggot”, claimed all of the men mentioned enjoyed golden showers, called Eminem a cross-dresser and his wife a “slut”.710 7) 50 Cent, Eminem and Busta Rhymes diss Ja on “Hail Mary”Fans thought “Loose Change” was memorable, but 50 Cent, Eminem and Busta Rhymes were still able to come back with “Hail Mary”, which mocked Ja’s obsession with Tupac Shakur.During an interview with Hot 97 in September 2013, Ja Rule admitted he felt as though he and Murder Inc. had lost the war with 50 Cent.910 9) Ja Rule is caught up in the Fyre Festival fiascoDespite Ja claiming the feud had “flatlined” by this point, 50 Cent couldn’t help mocking his rival by sharing a photo of Donald Trump appointing him as “secretary of festivals”. This was after Ja was blasted for his role in the Fyre Festival fiasco of April 2017.1010 10) 50 Cent buys 200 tickets to Ja Rule’s concert so the seats will be emptyThe latest of many, many chapters in this ongoing and now quite exhausting saga is when 50 claimed to have purchased 200 tickets to Ja’s forthcoming show in Las Vegas, with the intention that there would be a bunch of empty seats at the gig. In the posts on Instagram, he shared a Photoshopped image of himself sitting among the empty seats, along with an edited video that showed Ja Rule performing to an empty venue. Ja Rule seemed more amused by the stunt than anything, tweeting in response: “I get under @50cent skin… I love it!” Later he posted a photo of 50 Cent, which was Photoshopped to look as though the rapper was wearing makeup and a wig.110 1) Ja Rule is robbed at gunpoint in QueensIn 1999, Ja Rule was robbed for his chain at gunpoint in Southside Jamaica, Queens while he was filming a music video.

This was after Ja was blasted for his role in the Fyre Festival fiasco of April 2017.1010 10) 50 Cent buys 200 tickets to Ja Rule’s concert so the seats will be emptyThe latest of many, many chapters in this ongoing and now quite exhausting saga is when 50 claimed to have purchased 200 tickets to Ja’s forthcoming show in Las Vegas, with the intention that there would be a bunch of empty seats at the gig. In the posts on Instagram, he shared a Photoshopped image of himself sitting among the empty seats, along with an edited video that showed Ja Rule performing to an empty venue. Ja Rule seemed more amused by the stunt than anything, tweeting in response: “I get under @50cent skin… I love it!” Later he posted a photo of 50 Cent, which was Photoshopped to look as though the rapper was wearing makeup and a wig.That same year, in October, 50 Cent released a single from his shelved debut album Power of the Dollar, which was a blatant diss directed at Ja and Murder Inc. It didn’t name Ja Rule directly, but it did mock\u0026nbsphis label’s signature “Murda” chant which gave fans enough of an idea about who the track was directed towards.50 and Ja Rule got into a physical altercation at an Atlanta nightclub, where they were both booked to perform. Both their neck chains were broken during the fight – a member of Fif’s crew found Ja’s pendant, and 50 claimed that a deal was made to return it in exchange for a Movado watch – Ja denied that was the case.Machine Gun Kelly responds to Eminem\u0027s \u0027Killshot\u0027 diss trackNothing But Thieves perform an acoustic session for Music Box series 4In a 2016 interview, Chris Gotti offered his own take, which was that the two were talking one-on-one when Ja hit 40 Cent with several questions at once. Fiddy lashed out, then Ja Rule allegedly pulled his shirt over his head and began swinging punches. Whichever side you believe, the incident proved to be a massive catalyst for the events that followed.In March 2000, after receiving word that 50 was recording at the Hit Factory studios in New York, Ja and his crew decided to pay the rapper a visit. In the altercation that followed, Fiddy suffered a stab wound, and Ja Rule and Murder Inc. rapper Black Child were both arrested. Black Child took credit for the stabbing on record, claming it was an act of self-defence. In interviews after the attack, 50 consistently downplayed the incident.After signing a multi-million dollar deal with ShadyAftermath records in 2002, 50 Cent and G-Unit released the mixtape No Mercy, No Fear. One of the tracks, “Wanksta”, was credited by Fiddy as being inspired by Ja Rule. It became his first hit single, peaking at No.13 on the Billboard Hot 100.After the brawl at the Hit Factory, Irv Gotti claimed Fiddy signed an order of protection against him and Ja, in an attempt to put his street credibility on the line. It was later confirmed that the order does exist, but was issued on 50’s behalf – not his request – as a formality by the NYPD. In June 2018, Ja Rule shared the order again on social media and called 50 Cent\u0026nbspa rat.\u0026nbsp50 Cent wasn’t happy at being called a snitch. He fired back on the G-Unit mixtape The Future is Now via several tracks that dissed Murder Inc. “I Smell Pussy” was particularly brutal – 50 called out Irv Gotti, Ja, Black Child and Cadillac Tah by name.50 Cent finally released his debut album, the universally acclaimed Get Rich or Die Tryin’, on 6 February 2003. It claimed the top spot on the Billboard 200 albums chart and featured the track “Back Down”, which questioned the authenticity and street cred of Ja Rule and Murder Inc.In April 2013, Ja Rule came back with one of the most disrespectful diss tracks in hip hop history. “Loose Change” fired shots at 50 Cent, G-Unit, Eminem, Eminem’s daughter Hailie, Dr Dre, Busta Rhymes and Chris Lighty. Ja accused 50 of being a snitch, called Dr Dre a “faggot”, claimed all of the men mentioned enjoyed golden showers, called Eminem a cross-dresser and his wife a “slut”.Fans thought “Loose Change” was memorable, but 50 Cent, Eminem and Busta Rhymes were still able to come back with “Hail Mary”, which mocked Ja’s obsession with Tupac Shakur.Ja Rule’s fifth studio album was released in November 2003, and marked a noticeable change in style from his previously more melodic work. It was critically panned and failed to match up to the success of his multi-platinum albums: Rule 3:35, Pain is Love, and The Last Temptation.During an interview with Hot 97 in September 2013, Ja Rule admitted he felt as though he and Murder Inc. had lost the war with 50 Cent.For the first time in years, the two rappers came face to face when they ended up on the same flight… on the same aisle. Ja Rule posted about the experience on Twitter but revealed, to the surprise of fans, there had been no issues between the two.50 Cent headlined the Hot 97 Summer Jam festival in 2014, and used his stage to mock Murder Inc (again) when he performed “I Smell Pussy” during his set. Ja Rule heard about the show and, rather than firing back, claimed Fiddy was obsessed with him.Ja Rule’s memoir was released in July 2014, and chronicled his rise to fame and all the tumultuous moments that followed. During one chapter, he claimed that it was 50s info that led to a federal investigation into Murder Inc – an accusation that 50 Cent has denied.Despite Ja claiming the feud had “flatlined” by this point, 50 Cent couldn’t help mocking his rival by sharing a photo of Donald Trump appointing him as “secretary of festivals”. This was after Ja was blasted for his role in the Fyre Festival fiasco of April 2017.Drake and Meek Mill spent summer 2015 in a battle of words, which some fans compared to the beef between 50 Cent and Ja Rule.\u0026nbspHowever, neither Fiddy\u0026nbspor Ja\u0026nbspwas impressed, and appeared to agree that the younger artists had nothing on their feud.The latest of many, many chapters in this ongoing and now quite exhausting saga is when 50 claimed to have purchased 200 tickets to Ja’s forthcoming show in Las Vegas, with the intention that there would be a bunch of empty seats at the gig.In the posts on Instagram, he shared a Photoshopped image of himself sitting among the empty seats, along with an edited video that showed Ja Rule performing to an empty venue.

As such, the market will have grown beyond recognition when bitcoin celebrates its 20th anniversary.Bitcoin is notoriously volatile, having seen a 2,000 per cent price increase in 2017 followed by a 65 per cent decrease so far in 2018.\u0026nbspSince early September, however, bitcoin has traded consistently at around $6,500, only ever fluctuating by a few hundred dollars.This trend has been helped by a lack of destabilising news in the cryptocurrency space, together with broader consensus on how to address some of the technological\u0026nbspchallenges facing bitcoin.stabilized in recent months (CoinMarketCap)Should such a trend continue, cryptocurrency expert Iqbal Gandham, who works for the online trading platform\u0026nbspeToro, believes the price of bitcoin will see steady gains over the coming years.Elon Musk posts bizarre bitcoin tweet about cryptocurrency scamsBitcoin has shown great resilience over the past decade.

The policy was explained “for the convenience of the house”, but Mr Hammond said he didn’t want to get “bogged down” in the detail.Jeremy Corbyn had a problem replying to, in effect, a Labour BudgetTax Calculator: see what today’s Budget means for your moneyWhat are the new economic forecasts and is austerity over?Chancellor ploughs extra £1bn into troubled universal creditThis is how Britain\u0027s austerity plans compare to the rest of the worldReducing business rates\u0026nbspwill give independent shops some much-needed breathing space and allow them to invest in their staff and stores said Jo Causon, chief executive of The Institute of Customer Service.“However, more still needs to be done to help the high street continue to be a place where communities come together, she added.“In an increasingly fragmented world, it is critical that consumers have choice and for many, it means their brand of choice needs a high street presence.”Pub landlords welcomed a freeze in alcohol duty which amounts to a saving of 2p on a pint of beer, 1p on a pint of cider and a 30p on a bottle of scotch or gin.\u0026nbsp“This early Christmas present will save brewers, pubs and pub-goers £110m and secure upwards of 3,000 jobs that would have been lost had beer duty gone up,” Brigid Simmonds, chief executive of the British Beer \u0026amp Pub Association, said.Tax on wine will rise in line with inflation from February which will increase the price of a bottle by 7p on still wines and by an extra 9p on sparkling and fortified wine, the industry’s trade body estimated.The Wine and Spirits Trade Association (WSTA) described the decision as “grossly unfair, unjustified and counter-productive”.Chief executive Miles Beale said wine has been the most lucrative alcoholic drink for the Treasury since it overtook beer in 2012.“The UK is the world\u0027s biggest wine trading nation and, as such, deserves the Government\u0027s support, not punishment,” he said.He added: “By increasing the UK\u0027s already excessive duty rates the Chancellor will clobber wine importing businesses - including thousands of small and medium enterprises - stifle growth of our flourishing English wine industry and raise prices for consumers.”Super-strength low cost “white cider” was also excluded from the duty freeze but will instead by the subject of a new rate of tax from October next year.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It’s\u0026nbsptime to change that to Dreaming Phil.Hammond’s dream is that his Government will somehow find a way of securing a Brexit deal that it can get through Parliament. If it can, his latest budget will count for something. If not we’ll be back here again in April, a\u0026nbsppossibility he alluded to in his speech.\u0026nbspAccording to the bookies he clobbered with an increase in the remote gaming levy, it’s still a toss up.\u0026nbspHammond’s Budget was anti-business and anti-opportunityChancellor ploughs extra £1bn into troubled universal creditHammond takes aim at Amazon, Google and Facebook with new tech taxThe Chancellor indulged in the usual waffle about building a new relationship with the EU we’ve come to expect from ministers.\u0026nbspBut he chucked a few extra hundred million on to rapidly growing contingency planning pile, acknowledging that the worst is becoming a distinct possibility.\u0026nbspAnd if that happens, “the strivers, the grafters and the carers” the “people who ask only of government that we protect the jobs that put food on their table” and look after the “public services that they rely on”\u0026nbsp are going to have some hard questions for him, such as “what did you do to prevent this other than issue warnings so you could say I told you so”.\u0026nbspEven if a deal is done, and his\u0026nbsp”double deal idend”\u0026nbspbudget stands, the forecasts are\u0026nbsphardly rosy.\u0026nbspPrime Minister Theresa May said austerity is over. The Chancellor’s formulation was a mite more cautious. It is, he said, “coming to an end”.\u0026nbspThat’s understandable given the outlook he faces. This year the economy is set to\u0026nbspgrow by just 1.3 per cent, if\u0026nbspthe Office for\u0026nbspBudgetary Responsibility has it right.\u0026nbspIts assessment of UK plc’s potential further out has improved\u0026nbspa bit but we’ll still be averaging growth of only 1.5 per cent.\u0026nbspIn its view, Britain will be stuck in the slow lane for the foreseeable future, even with the benefit of the fiscal loosening the Chancellor is planning. All his talk of ambition and the bright future for the “indomitable” British people\u0026nbspwon’t change that.\u0026nbspIn the meantime he confirmed that there will be some bones thrown and some sticking plasters applied. The NHS will get its extra money, but when set against what it needs\u0026nbspit’s only the bare minimum. There’ll be a few less potholes in the roads, thanks to the £400m or so set aside to fix them, a bit extra support for those facing the nightmare of Universal Credit. That carbuncle, a project that is turning into the Poll Tax for this generation of Tories, is here to stay, he declared. That may come back to haunt him.\u0026nbspThe Tories’ traditional supporters will cheer his bringing forward a tax cut, which is what the changes to the personal allowance and the top rate threshold planned for 2019 amount to.\u0026nbspAnd while Boris Johnson might have said ‘f- business’, the Chancellor wants to be its friend.\u0026nbspThe Institute of Directors, for one, gave its thumbs up to business rate relief for small firms, cuts to their apprenticeship levy, investment incentives, more funding for City deals.\u0026nbsp“But will there be support for SME Brexit planning,” it said archly, while criticising the Chancellor for “pulling his\u0026nbsppunches”.\u0026nbspThere were some good bits the commitment to end the private finance initiative in particular. The narrowly targeted digital services tax (aimed at Facebook, Google and their silicon valley pals) even looked bold, until the critics got their teeth into the details. The £400m it will supposedly raise is ho hum indeed.\u0026nbspIn his opening Hammond talked about the concerns of the people away from the Westminster bubble, who care about putting food on the table, clothing their children, running their lives.\u0026nbspHe boasted of the strongest wage growth in a decade, and the sustained real wage growth forecast for each of the next five years, that ought to\u0026nbspmake life better for them.Created with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

Under Irish corporate law you need the support of three times that.\u0026nbspBut it should be forthcoming. Some 30 per cent of Ryanair’s investors voted against Bonderman’s re-election the last time around.\u0026nbspThey had good reasons for opposing another year of the septuagenerian American. He’s been in post for more than 20 years. That would raise questions about his ability to serve as a check on the power of the CEO, and an independent voice on behalf of shareholders, at any company, let alone one run by a man like O’Leary.\u0026nbspWhen you serve for that long it’s not just furniture you have in your title. You become part of it.\u0026nbspBut this isn’t really about Bonderman. It’s about O’Leary, a man for whom pugilism is as natural as breathing is to the rest of us.\u0026nbspThe LAPFF, and other progressive voices among Ryanair’s investors, have raised issues about the aggressive way he runs the the company in the past.\u0026nbspBut he, and Bonderman, and the rest of the company’s directors, have been able to ignore them because of Ryanair’s previously stellar financial and share price performance.\u0026nbspThere aren’t many shareholders that will square up to a winner, even when the seeds of\u0026nbsptrouble are easy enough to see.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

The policy was explained “for the convenience of the house”, but Mr Hammond said he didn’t want to get “bogged down” in the detail.Jeremy Corbyn had a problem replying to, in effect, a Labour BudgetTax Calculator: see what today’s Budget means for your moneyWhat are the new economic forecasts and is austerity over?Chancellor ploughs extra £1bn into troubled universal creditThis is how Britain\u0027s austerity plans compare to the rest of the worldReducing business rates\u0026nbspwill give independent shops some much-needed breathing space and allow them to invest in their staff and stores said Jo Causon, chief executive of The Institute of Customer Service.“However, more still needs to be done to help the high street continue to be a place where communities come together, she added.“In an increasingly fragmented world, it is critical that consumers have choice and for many, it means their brand of choice needs a high street presence.”Pub landlords welcomed a freeze in alcohol duty which amounts to a saving of 2p on a pint of beer, 1p on a pint of cider and a 30p on a bottle of scotch or gin.\u0026nbsp“This early Christmas present will save brewers, pubs and pub-goers £110m and secure upwards of 3,000 jobs that would have been lost had beer duty gone up,” Brigid Simmonds, chief executive of the British Beer \u0026amp Pub Association, said.Tax on wine will rise in line with inflation from February which will increase the price of a bottle by 7p on still wines and by an extra 9p on sparkling and fortified wine, the industry’s trade body estimated.The Wine and Spirits Trade Association (WSTA) described the decision as “grossly unfair, unjustified and counter-productive”.Chief executive Miles Beale said wine has been the most lucrative alcoholic drink for the Treasury since it overtook beer in 2012.“The UK is the world\u0027s biggest wine trading nation and, as such, deserves the Government\u0027s support, not punishment,” he said.He added: “By increasing the UK\u0027s already excessive duty rates the Chancellor will clobber wine importing businesses - including thousands of small and medium enterprises - stifle growth of our flourishing English wine industry and raise prices for consumers.”Super-strength low cost “white cider” was also excluded from the duty freeze but will instead by the subject of a new rate of tax from October next year.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Because the company has managed to slice off some more of the bezel around the display, it is the biggest screen in a OnePlus phone but takes up less space on the front.OnePlus forced to change 6T release date because of Apple eventThe biggest new breakthrough is probably the Screen Unlock feature. That works like the fingerprint sensor on many other phones – but it is placed right beneath the screen. OnePlus\u0026nbspsaid it will be able to unlock in just 0.34 seconds, despite being hidden.As well as that feature, it includes a new processor, RAM boost and special software that the company claims will speed up apps. It also has a battery that provides a 20 per cent increase on the OnePlus 6, which can use its fast charging feature.The camera is also improved to include features such as Nightscape, which it claims can take much improved pictures in the dark.OnePlus hopes the latest phone can finally allow it to break into the mainstream. Alongside updates to the phones, it will also be available more widely than ever before, as exclusivity deals have been lifted to allow it to be sold on different networks and shops.The cheapest version of the phone will be sold for £499, with the price increasing to £579 for extra storage space.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

CEO Jack Dorsey said he did not like it and it would disappear soon, the report claims.Twitter \u0027deeply sorry\u0027 for failing to act on threat from Cesar SayocNow Twitter has said the button is being reconsidered and that it is possible that it could disappear in the future.As we\u0027ve been saying for a while, we are rethinking everything about the service to ensure we are incentivizing healthy conversation, that includes the like button, it wrote in a tweet that quoted the \u0027s report. We are in the early stages of the work and have no plans to share right now.Brandon Borrmann, who works in communications at Twitter, said specifically that claims it would happen anytime soon were wrong – but that it could be happening in the future.We\u0027ve been open that we\u0027re considering it, he tweeted. Jack even mentioned it in front of the US Congress. There\u0027s no timeline. It\u0027s not happening \u0027soon\u0027.Twitter has been explicit that it is thinking about the way its site works, in an attempt to address concerns about the healthiness of discussion on the platform.That discussion\u0026nbsphas sometimes focused on the role of the like and retweet buttons, which exist as a way for people to approve of posts. People including Kanye West have suggested that those numbers should be hidden entirely – a move that Mr Dorsey\u0026nbspdid not seem to reject.But it has been repeatedly criticised for failing to address some of its more central problems, including from users who believe it should be acting to ban people from the platform rather than\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It was in complete bad taste and was not funny nor entertaining.\u0026nbsp“The police have confirmed that they are treating this as a hate crime and rightly so. Nobody within our community should live in fear or intimidation from a group of people who through this action have offered nothing but that.\u0026nbsp“The Muslim community are contributing much to society in Northern Ireland. Everyone has the right to live here. I would ask the public to bring information forward to the police.”The photos were also called “unacceptable” and “disgusting” by\u0026nbspKellie\u0026nbspArmstrong, an Alliance MLA for the\u0026nbspStrangford\u0026nbsparea.“Everyone knows the history of the Ku Klux Klan,” she told the\u0026nbspBelfast , “what they stood for, the crimes the organisation committed and the connotations these outfits convey. This was not a mistake or an unfortunate choice of outfits.“It is not appreciated by our community, it is not funny and it should definitely not be treated as a joke.”The PSNI said the group’s presence in the area was reported to them after 5pm on Sunday evening, and that they are treating this incident as a hate crime.In a statement, Inspector Richard Murray said, “We are also aware of images that are circulating that show people dressed as Ku Klux Klan members.“Our enquiries are ongoing, and we are treating this as a hate incident at this time.Created with Sketch.Pope Francis visits Ireland – in pictures Show all 55Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pope Francis celebrates the Holy Mass at the Phoenix Park, in Dublin Pope Francis arrives at Phoenix Park for a Papal Mass of the World Meeting of Families in DublinA vigil takes place at the site of the mass grave which contained the remains of 796 named babies from the Bon Secours Mother and Baby home in Tuam.

We know the UK government has started making such plans as a result of the growing demand for such a vote, demonstrated by last weekend’s march.“The EU should do the same, because MPs who back the People’s Vote are fast forming the biggest and most cohesive bloc in Westminster.”UK-EU transport links after Brexit ‘increasingly a cause for concern’MPs ‘far more likely to reject Brexit deal’ if unable to amend itPound sterling falls to six-week low as Theresa May faces Brexit backlPlaid Cymru Westminster group leader Liz Saville Roberts, who also met with Mr Barnier, said she had used the meeting to push for an extension to the negotiation period to accommodate a referendum.“I pressed Michel Barnier on protecting Wales’s interest through the extension of Article 50 and a People’s Vote,” she said.“In Westminster, with the prime minister’s proposals amounting to nothing more than a mix of fudge and fantasy, a People’s Vote is more likely than ever.”The EU has previously reacted cooly to suggestions that the period could be extended, but has not ruled it out. An extension would require the unanimous approval of all 28 EU leaders on the European Council.\u0026nbspSadiq Khan visited Brussels on Friday\u0026nbsp(Getty)Brussels is particularly wary about extending the transition into May, when Britain would have to take part in the next European Parliament elections if it was still in the EU.Mr Khan, speaking after a separate meeting on Friday, said: “The point I made to Michel Barnier, really quite forcefully, is that there is a possibility of the British parliament rejecting the deal that Mrs May secures from the EU.Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Red smoke from a canister hangs in the air as around 100,000 demonstrators march through London during a People\u0027s Vote anti-brexit demonstration savings banners and placardsMayor of London Sadiq Khan takes part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.MP Chuka Umunna (left) and MP Vince Cable (right) as MP Anna Soubry (centre) addresses Anti-Brexit campaigners at a rally after the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.

It is only right that they have a say in their nation’s future.”Mr Hutton added: “This careful analysis shows just how badly young people – already disadvantaged by the breakdown of career structures and high housing costs – will be further hit by Brexit.”And Mr\u0026nbspOluwole said: “Now that the implications for our generation have become clear, we need a People’s Vote on the government’s Brexit deal.”The research comes as the Brexit talks remain deadlocked over the issue of the Irish border backstop – with just five months until departure day next March.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It also proves what I have said all along, that headlines are more important to them than the environment.“Our environment deserves better. Liberal Democrats will continue to fight for a ban all single-use plastic within three years, the introduction of a levy on all producers and retailers that produce or use single-use plastics and the introduction of a latte levy.Green\u0026nbspMP Caroline Lucas said it was the most nature-depleted Budget in decades and accused Mr Hammond of abandoning the pretence of caring about our natural world.Two weeks ago, the world’s top scientists warned we have just 12 years to prevent climate catastrophe – so today we urgently needed an emergency budget with major investment in green energy and jobs to protect the planet. It\u0027s unforgivable that Philip Hammond failed to even mention climate change.It\u0027s not clear what planet Philip Hammond is living on – but it is his responsibility to do something to protect those of us living on this one. His deluded Budget was built on a\u0026nbspfantasy future where the technical revolution will solve all of society\u0027s problems.There has been a mixed response from business leaders to the Budget.The Institute for Directors said it had inidual positive measures but ultimately, this was a Budget that pulled its punches.Director general Stephen Martin said:\u0026nbsp“Going into this Budget, IoD members urged the Chancellor to prioritise help for Brexit preparations. It is not enough simply to announce a potential ‘no-deal Brexit budget’, businesses need to get ready now. While we hope the Chancellor’s confidence that there will be Brexit deal is well-placed, firms have to look at all possible scenarios and will be deeply disappointed to see no funds have been allocated to helping them map out potential outcomes.“The Chancellor also acknowledged the scale of the productivity challenge, but most of the measures announced today were too small to even make it into the main speech.”\u0026nbspDr Adam Marshall, Director General of the\u0026nbspBritish Chambers of Commerce (BCC), praised the chancellor for listening to business amid an atmosphere of unprecedented uncertainty and\u0026nbspheightened\u0026nbsppolitical noise.He said: “The Chancellor responded directly to the BCC’s calls for bold incentives to\u0026nbspturbo-charge business investment,\u0026nbspfor steps to support high street businesses struggling with business rates, and for measures that cut the cost of apprenticeships for SMEs.Philip Hammond has sent important and positive signals to businesses across the UK, many of whom have been wavering on investment and hiring.Crucially, the Chancellor has avoided major increases to business tax to fund the government’s spending priorities, which would have undermined the confidence boost to firms from his commitments to supporting enterprise and growth.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBut Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI Director-General, said:\u0026nbsp“This was a rock-solid budget, bringing more treats than tricks for business.“It recognises the enormous contribution enterprise has made to balancing the UK’s books through jobs, pay and tax and responds to many of the recommendations that firms have made.\u0026nbsp“But while the Chancellor has reduced some of biggest barriers to growth, he has missed some opportunities.“That said, the new investment in broadband, research, housing and infrastructure will help tackle the UK’s glaring regional equalities head on.Reaction is pouring into the Chancellor\u0027s words.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell\u0026nbsphas said that the pledge to end austerity was a broken promise, like the whole budget:“It is now clear austerity is not over, the cuts to social security will continue and Philip Hammond gave no assurances that departments won’t face further cuts, he said.“Eight years of destructive austerity has damaged our economy, damaged people’s incomes and damaged our essential services. There is nothing in today’s budget to repair the damage to schools, the police and local councils.“The money promised for Universal Credit is less than a third of the £7bn of social security cuts still to come and today’s announcement on work allowances reverses just over half the cuts made in 2015.“While hitting those most vulnerable in our society, the Tories will have handed out £110bn in corporate tax giveaways by the end of this parliament.“This is immoral and Labour will end this unfairness, end austerity and rebuild Britain for the many, not the few.”Treasury sources said OBR figures had improved because there is expected to be lower unemployment which would lead to an increase in taxes, as well as much stronger tax receipts and slightly lower spending, particularly as a result of lower debt interest on bonds.Mr Hammond did not fix the spending envelope for the next review period because there is a chance it could improve as a result of the so-called Brexit deal idend, sources said.Here\u0027s the latest on universal credit from my colleague Ashley Cowburn.\u0026nbspAnnouncing the funds in the Budget, the chancellor bowed to intense pressure from charities and cross-party politicians, who have repeatedly raised alarming issues with the government\u0027s flagship welfare programme.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspTreasury committee chair Nicky Morgan is up now, and jokes that it must be something she said - as everyone has let the Chamber.\u0026nbspShe says Philip Hammond was in a difficult position and chastised Jeremy Corbyn for not putting forward any new ideas.\u0026nbspCaroline Lucas, Green MP, intervenes to ask\u0026nbspwhy the chancellor has not mentioned climate change?\u0026nbspMorgan says he did and dismisses the question. She gives the government a hard time on Brexit, saying it is vital for the government to give MPs enough information on the deal so they can make an informed choice.Corbyn has a dig at the government\u0027s \u0027bungled Brexit\u0027 approach and says there is no way Theresa May can get a deal when the cabinet can\u0027t even agree amongst themselves.\u0026nbspHe calls for a proper end to austerity.\u0026nbspAnd that\u0027s it from Mr Corbyn now.Responding to the Budget is a tricky job for the opposition leader, as you have no prior sight of the speech and\u0026nbspno one is really listening anyway. All the journalists dash off for a briefing with the Treasury and to dig into the detail from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR).Corbyn is doing a decent job knocking the proposals down though. He works methodically through the challenges facing different public services and the promise of ending austerity is a decent attack for Labour - who can easily point out how far from true that is.\u0027This government is harsh on the weak and feeble with the strong,\u0027 he says.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The leader told a news conference in Berlin it was “time for a new chapter”\u0026nbspin German politics.Brexit transition period could be too short, Merkel warnsMs\u0026nbspMerkel said she took responsibility for the CDU’s recent losses in local elections and told party members that she would not run again for the leadership of her party at a conference in December.This would leave her in the position of staying as chancellor while not being the leader of her own party. The German constitution has strict rules regulating\u0026nbspthe process of appointing the\u0026nbspchancellor, with parties nominating a named candidate for the position\u0026nbspahead of elections.The move would not be unprecedented: Helmut Schmidt, West Germany’s chancellor from 1974 to 1982, never led the SPD of which he is a member.“Firstly, at the next CDU party congress in December in Hamburg, I will not put myself forward again as candidate for the CDU chair,” she told reporters.Merkel allies face losses as voters flee to far-right AfD, poll saysMerkel’s top ally in Brussels launches campaign for EU presidency“Secondly, this fourth term is my last as German chancellor. At the federal election in 2021, I will not stand again as chancellor candidate, nor as a candidate for the Bundestag, and ... I won’t seek any further political offices.”She added that she would not run for chancellor if a snap election were held before 2021, and that she had made the decision not to stay on as party chair before the summer parliamentary recess.\u0026nbspThe chancellor said that two issues,\u0026nbspBrexit, and US-Russia relations, would be the main focus for her as long as she remained in office.Whoever becomes the new leader of the CDU to succeed Ms Merkel\u0026nbspwould be the front-runner to be the country’s new chancellor after the next elections. A vote is slated for December at the party’s regular congress.Three people are so far being widely named as possible successors.\u0026nbspAnnegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, a moderate\u0026nbspwho is politically close to Ms Merkel, currently serves as the CDU’s general secretary and was formerly the regional governor of Saarland.\u0026nbspThe dpa press agency says Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer, known informally in German political circles as as AKK, told a private meeting of senior party members she would stand for leader at the CDU congress in December.Health minister\u0026nbspJens Spahn​, who has been publicly critical of Ms Merkel’s liberal refugee policy,\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspRalph Brinkhaus,\u0026nbspwho leads the party’s group in the Bundestag having ousted one of the chancellor’s\u0026nbspallies from the post in a narrow vote last month, have also been linked with the position.\u0026nbsp​The outgoing leader confirmed that she would not formally back any of the candidates, however.Ms Merkel has been leader of her party since 2000 and was elected as chancellor in 2005. If she makes it to the end of her term in 2021 as planned she will be the second longest-serving chancellor in the history of the German federal republic, surpassed by only Helmut Kohl.Created with Sketch.

The waning of her party’s standing in the polls has sapped her once fearsome authority.The summer was also characterised by a policy\u0026nbsprow about refugees\u0026nbspwith the\u0026nbspCSU, the CDU’s Bavarian sister party with which\u0026nbspit has been in alliance since 1949.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

are plotting to destroy Theresa May\u0027s plan with a killer amendment (Image: )8.01pm update: Lord Bridges questions option of extending transition periodA Tory former\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspminister has challenged Theresa May\u0027s decision to keep open the option of extending the transition period after leaving the EU.Lord Bridges of Headley questioned how this squared with an earlier assurance by the Prime Minister that it would be time-limited, giving everyone the certainty that this will not go on forever.In response, the Government said no agreement had been reached and talks were ongoing.Mrs May told MPs last week that there may be limited circumstances when it is in Britain\u0027s interest to agree to a short extension to the transition period, but insisted the transition \u0026ndash currently due to end at the end of 2020 \u0026ndash would have to be over well before the end of the parliament expected in June 2022.But Lord Bridges said: Given that the Prime Minister wants to bring certainty to the situation, how does the option to extend the transition do that?Minister Lord Callanan said: I understand that the possibility of extending it has been raised in the discussions in Brussels, but no agreement has been made and discussions on such matters are continuing.7.27pm update: Corbyn blasts Hammond for broken promise Budget, half-measures and quick fixesLabour leader\u0026nbspJeremy Corbyn criticised Philip Hammond for delivering a broken promise Budget.The Labour leader said eight years of austerity has damaged our economy and delayed the recovery, adding the Government has not abandoned the policy despite the Chancellor\u0027s latest spending pledges.Leading the response to the Budget, Mr Corbyn also said the proposals announced will not undo the damage done by the squeeze on spending.He told the Commons: The Prime Minister pledged austerity was over \u0026ndash this is a broken promise Budget.What we\u0027ve heard today are half measures and quick fixes while austerity grinds on.And far from people\u0027s hard work and sacrifices having paid off, as the Chancellor claims, this Government has frittered it away in ideological tax cuts to the richest in our society.Mr Corbyn added: The Government claims austerity has worked so now they can end it.That is absolutely the opposite of the truth \u0026ndash austerity needs to end because it has failed.6.10pm update: \u0027We\u0027ll be worse off after Brexit,\u0027 claims former minister MorganBritain\u0027s economy will be worse off because of\u0026nbspBrexit, a senior Tory MP has claimed as she urged ministers to seriously consider alternatives to their current plan.Nicky Morgan, chairwoman of the Treasury Select Committee, said the UK has the best possible deal at the moment and suggested no\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspagreement will better it.She also voiced concerns over the forecasts which underpinned Chancellor Philip Hammond\u0027s Budget, given the uncertainty over what will happen in the coming months.The former cabinet minister told the Commons: Brexit is the greatest and most imminent source of uncertainty looming over this Budget.It\u0027s just stating the obvious to say that the nature of the United Kingdom\u0027s withdrawal from the EU could upend the economic forecasts on which this Budget is based.4.42pm: Bookie offers 4-1 on UK still being a member of EU on January 1, 2020Bookmaker Coral is offering 4-1 that the UK is still a full member of the EU on January 1, 2020.It is just evens for no deal to be agreed by the scheduled date of the end of March next year.Coral\u0027s Harry Aitkenhead. said:\u0026nbspThe Chancellor has announced today that another Budget will be needed for in the event of a no deal, but the way things are going you just can\u0027t rule it out.Our latest odds suggest that it\u0027s touch and go no as to whether a deal will be stuck by the start of April 2019.It is 3-1 for another referendum next year, whilst it is 10-1 that it takes place and a remain vote wins.4.08pm update: Britain can once again lead the world when it comes to technological innovation after Brexit, claims HammondMr Hammond predicted Britain would lead the way when it came to technological innovation after Brexit.He said: I want Britain to be one of the great winners of the technological revolutionAs we finalised our departure from the EU we must unleash the investment that will drive our future prosperityBritain is open for business.3.58pm update: Hammond sets aside another \u0026pound500 million for Brexit preparationsThe Chancellor said he was setting aside an extra \u0026pound500 million for\u0026nbsppreparations for the UK leaving the European Union.He added that if the economic or fiscal outlook changes materially in-year I reserve the right to upgrade the Spring Statement to a full Fiscal Event.Mr Hammond\u0027s words appear to confirm reports earlier this week suggesting a failure to strike a Brexit deal could force him to reassess his budget statement.3.50pm: Real wage growth in each of next five years, predicts HammondMr Hammond painted a rosy picture of the British economy heading into Brexit.He said: The OBR is forecasting real wage growth in each of the next five years \u0026ndash a far cry from the dismal picture the leader of the Opposition is desperate to paint every Wednesday.The deficit is down from almost 10 percent under Labour to less than 1.4 percent next year under this Conservative Government and falling to just 0.5 percent by 2024.We are no longer borrowing at all to finance current spending. Our national debt peaked in 201617.3.47pm update: Hammond promises a Brexit idendMr Hammond predicted a boost for Britain\u0027s economy as a result of leaving the EU.He told MPs: We are confident we will secure a deal that delivers that idend.Confident but not complacent so we will continue to plan for all eventualities.I have already allocated \u0026pound2.2bn to departments for Brexit preparations.\u0026nbspWe are working for the best outcome for Britain and preparing for every eventuality.\u0026nbspPhilip Hammond delivers his budget statement (Image: Youtube)3.40pm update: Hammond looks forward to life outside European UnionMr Hammond took a swipe at Labour as he looked forward to a future outside the EU.He said:\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoOur economy continues to confound those who talk it down and we continue to focus resolutely on challenges that lie ahead as we build a new future outside the EU.\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoLet us not forget the achievements of the British people in clearing up the aftermath of Labour\u0026rsquos great recession.\u0026nbsp3.37pm update: Last pre-Brexit budget heralds end of austerity, says Chancellor HammondChancellor Philip Hammond introduced his final pre-Brexit financial statement as a budget for the future for people who we are proud to represent.He added: British people put their faith in us to to the job and today we repay that faith.\u0026ldquoA budget for Britain\u0026rsquos future, a budget for hardworking families, the strivers, grafters and the carers who are the backbone of our economy\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoThis budget is unashamedly for you.

Here is a breakdown of the candidates who could step into Mrs Merkel\u0027s shoes:Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, 56, probably has the best chance of becoming the next CDU leader after Mrs Merkel herself decided in February to name her as party secretary general - a move seen as a succession plan.Dubbed a mini-Merkel by German media due to her rational approach to politics, Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer was premier of the tiny state of Saarland on the French border from 2011 to 2018.Her Catholic, western German background contrasts with Mrs Merkel\u0027s Protestant, eastern roots.                What Angela Merkel\u0027s decision to QUIT means for UK, EU and Brexit                German voters flee to the political marginsWhile socially conservative and known for opposing gay marriage, Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer is also a strong supporter of the minimum wage and workers\u0027 rights.In an attempt to distance herself from Mrs Merkel and her leadership style, Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer has said the CDU will need to regain some passion if it wants to attract younger voters.Sometimes known as AKK, she is the daughter of a teacher for mentally handicapped children, and is married to a mining engineer, with whom she has three children.Chancellor Angela Merkel announced that she will quit politics (Image: Hannibal Hanschke REUTERS)Mini-Merkel: Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer (Image: Hannibal Hanschke REUTERS)Current Federal Minister of Health: Jens Spahn (Image: Joachim Herrmann REUTERS)Jens Spahn, 38, has become one of Merkel\u0027s most outspoken critics within the CDU since her decision in 2015 to welcome more than a million refugees, mostly Muslims from war zones in the Middle East.He positions himself as a politician from Germany\u0027s rural northwest who is sceptical of urban liberals and the globalist elite.In an attempt to rein Mr Spahn in, Mrs Merkel this year named him health minister - a thorny portfolio that brings a lot of work and few headlines.A member of the lower house of parliament since 2002, Spahn has been praised as a rising star for years by senior conservatives such as Wolfgang Schaeuble.However, his anti-immigration rhetoric at the height of the refugee crisis cost him sympathy among Merkel allies.His public friendship with Richard Grenell, U.S. President Donald Trump\u0027s ambassador to Berlin, has also raised eyebrows among conservatives who dislike Trump\u0027s policy style.Mr Spahn is a Catholic like Kramp-Karrenbauer but, despite the church\u0027s opposition to gay partnerships, is married to Daniel Funke, a senior journalist at the glossy magazine Bunte.Member of the CDU\u0027s conservative wing: Friedrich Merz (Image: JENS BUTTNERAFPGetty Images)Friedrich Merz, 62, was the first to throw his hat into the ring on Monday after news leaked that Merkel would not run again as CDU leader, according to party sources.Mr Merz, a member of the CDU\u0027s conservative wing, has coined the idea of a German \u0027Leitkultur\u0027, or \u0027lead culture\u0027, with which he called on Muslim immigrants to assimilate and to adopt German values and traditions.He also is known for his proposal to simplify the annual tax return so that it could be written on a beer mat.Mr Merz is among the many conservative men who have seen their political fortunes dwindle under Merkel.In 2002, Mrs Merkel pushed him out of his position as CDU parliamentary leader to cement her grip on the party, on her way to becoming chancellor in 2005.A trained lawyer and former member of the European Parliament, Merz served in the German parliament from 1994 to 2009, and now holds numerous non-executive company board positions, including chairman of the German arm of the U.S. hedge fund BlackRock.He is married to Charlotte Merz, a judge, with whom he has three children.

He was the godfather of the family.Davidson emigrated from Grenada to west London in 1955, taking up work on the Underground. Before he left the Caribbean island, he was known as the fastest man on two wheels following his passion for speed and motorbikes.His death provoked Hamilton to pay tribute to his own father, Anthony, who worked four jobs to fund his junior career.Michael Schumacher is still the greatest of all time, Lewis Hamilton said today (Image: )Lewis and Anthony, rarely seen in the F1 paddock these days, are slowly rebuilding their relationship after an acrimonious managerial split almost nine years ago.I will always remember and I will never forget the things that he did in order for me to be here today, Hamilton added.I really do aspire to be like him, as a strong black man, as a father, and as a human being for doing what he did in the difficult times.All the work that he put in, my grandfather would be so proud, and I am proud to have the Hamilton name up there.The Mercedes star He has more pole positions than anybody else, and is 20 victories shy of Schumacher\u0027s record win tally.Lewis Hamilton is nearing Michael Schumacher\u0027s record for most F1 wins (Image: )At the rate he is going, Hamilton could do the unthinkable and surpass the German by the time his Mercedes deal expires in 2020.Michael\u0027s quite far ahead in terms of race wins so you have to say he is still the GOAT (greatest of all time), the Briton added.Fangio is the godfather and always will be, but I feel very honoured to have my name alongside his, that\u0027s for sure.Hamilton\u0027s post-championship media briefing on Sunday was briefly interrupted by the fashion designer, Tommy Hilfiger.In collaboration with the American, Hamilton has launched his new clothing range in all corners of the world, while producing some of the finest drives of his 12-season career.Lewis Hamiton said Michael Schumacher is the \u0027GOAT\u0027 - the greatest of all time (Image: )Naturally people will have opinions for and against the things that I do, Hamilton continued. I don\u0027t do everything perfectly, and I don\u0027t always say the right things, but one thing I do do, is I do me.Only I can live my life the way I live it, and it can\u0027t be steered by anyone else. I try to do the right things in order to be at my best.Hamilton, awarded an MBE after his maiden championship in 2008, is not entertaining thoughts about another trip to Buckingham Palace.A knighthood is really not something that is on my mind, he said. I\u0027ve been very fortunate and very grateful to have met the Queen on a couple of occasions.When I\u0027m on the podium I look back and see the Union Jack and I\u0027m very proud to raise that flag.

Recently, one of my teenage daughter’s friends died suddenly when she was run over roadside after getting out of a cab.“Her face was bruised and swollen but her mum wanted to see her. I cried for hours over her body – she was just  - but how could I refuse  I brushed her hair as I would my daughters.”Despite these sad moments, Debbie says her job is her passion, and she always makes light conversation with her customers as she works on them.Make-up for funerals is usually only needed for an open casket or when relatives have requested to see the body at a funeral home.By this stage, the embalming process - a treatment in which the body is preserved via injection with a chemical solution - has been completed, so the body’s eyes are shut and their mouth has been stitched closed.“I will always talk to the bodies, she says. I tell them what I’m doing as I go along, andthey have very evident injuries, like broken bones or tell-tale signs of illness like discoloured skin, I just say: I’m so sorry you had to go through this.“I have used embalming packs on faces, where the death has been particularly violent, or an illness has altered their facial features in drastic ways. It’s just like a face pack I leave on overnight and plumps up their skin.”Debbie’s job also involves dressing the bodies with items of clothing family have brought in.“About a month ago, I had two ladies, one of  and one of , both whom had young children, she says.They had both died of cancer and I put a special wig on one of them, and the other had requested she was buried in her wedding dress.As her job can often be very upsetting, Debbie says a pinch of dark humour is sometimes needed, too.“Sometimes I’ll get myself into a real pickle. The family will send in clothes that are far too small or large and I’ll have to cut bits and bobs here and there. Sometimes outfits, like mini-skirts, are just not appropriate for a dead body,” she says.“Once a family also requested that their loved-one wore fake eyelashes. In le she had used the same pair about  times so I stood there for ages just trying to glue them on.”She adds: “There are also the times where bodies move at the funeral home. It’s not quite like it sounds, but they do groan as they release gas so it’s just a little movement.”John Harris grew up around dead bodies and has worked as a funeral home director for as far back as he can remember.His great-grandfather founded T. Cribb in , and the company has now established a reputation for their effective embalming. This is the process of flushing a body with preservative chemicals, including formaldehyde, which stops the body from decomposing.The mouth is then sewn shut and eyelids are secured with caps – thick lense-like layers that stop your eyes from appearing shrunken.John says certain formulas for embalming fluid are as coveted as the Coca Cola recipe, with some embalmed bodies lasting for over two years without decaying.“We’ve made a name for ourselves because we can keep bodies for a long time in, for want of a better term, good condition, John says. Older formulas often made the body look very waxy and made them very stf. Bodies now are very natural to touch.John explains: “The fluid itself tends to be marked with a rose tinted colour, leaving the effect of a natural skin-tone in the deceased.“Very often, when somebody has died from a long-term illness or through an accident and families have watched their relatives go through and deteriorate – the embalming process makes them look much more like they did before.“The easiest way to describe embalming is like a blood transfusion. The fastest parts to discolour on the body are where blood flowed.“When somebody dies, the blood reaches the lowest point. Sosomebody’s face is laying to one side, that side of the face will be purple.“So the idea is to use the arteries system of the body and flush everything out. It can take anything from an hour to several days, depending on the condition of the body.”Johns company preserves corpses from all over the world, including Ghana, where he has one of his many funeral parlours. Here, bodies are often kept for months, and it isn’t unusual for relatives to ask for the body to be placed in the deceased’s favourite chair at home, so the family can pay their last respects.“We once had a lady who sold roasted sweetcorn on the side of the road, John says. After she died, we prepared her body to sit in the exact position next to her sweetcorn-roaster, so locals could see her just as they remember.However, the old joke about funeral workers always being in business isnt going to hold true forever.Now funerals can be so direct, John says. You can send someone a body and a cheque and they’ll send you back a pot of ashes.“I once spoke to a man whose mother died and he told me: Don’t do the funeral on a Monday, Wednesday or Friday, because I play tennis. That epitomises how le is now and the attitude to funerals – whatever is the most convenient.”Planning to go to university to study performing arts, le changed for Ellie Carr when she was offered a position at a funeral directors aged , and she has never looked back.Now a funeral director at A.W.Lymn in Nottingham, Ellie says: “My mum is a palliative care nurse so death has never been a taboo in our family.“I would find watching people suffer very distressing, but I love what I do. There is more control in helping people after death, and being there for their families.”Ellie says the stereotype of funeral directors as the Morticia Addams-type, with long-black hair and an obsession with all things death couldn’t be further from the truth.“It’s actually much more about helping people, there is a very old-fashioned view on the job sometimes,” she says.“There’s a lot more personalisation around funerals now. There are balloon releases, colourful clothing, and funeral favours are becoming popular.“They can be chocolate, or something like memory seeds – it’s a really nice touch.”“Making the experience so personal is something I take great pride in. I just treat people how I would like to be treated.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He will be ever so happy.When it comes out he will enjoy it. Guaranteed hell watch it, he wouldnt be able to not too. Hell have his little crew in the TV room, wont he “It prolongs the pain of the families - it will never leave them, but he’ll just keep picking the scab off the deep cut, and pouring a little bit of salt in it all the time.”Today, Joe is confident and bubbly, chatting over a cup of tea in a unicorn mug. But shell never be able to forget the campaign of abuse she endured at the hands of cruel Bellfield, who used to brag about raping other women while he was with her.I have a few questions I’d like to ask him, she says. What actual pleasure did he get out of it all ”Joe adds: “I told the police in an interview I did that I’d get back with him tomorrow - because he’d have the best meal, the best day, the best sex, and I’d slit the c***’s throat as he slept and put an end to all of it, because it’s all of us lot paying for him to live his le of luxury.”And she still stands by this sentiment, adding: The victims haven’t got that, so why should he be allowed to be a fat f**k in prison Joe initially met Bellfield in  when she was  and regularly went to a bar in Twickenham, called Rockys, where he worked as a doorman. But it wasn’t until some years later, in , that they began dating - and another decade would pass before Bellfields true depravity was revealed to the world. Bellfields first victim would turn out to be Milly Dowler, who went missing from Walton-Upon-Thames on her way home from school in .Her body was found six months later, dumped in a wood in Yateley Heath, in a horric case that went unsolved for nine years, with Bellfield eventually convicted in .Then in  Marsha McDonnell was hit over the head with a blunt instrument after she got off the bus near her home in Hampton, London, and in August  French student Amelie Delagrange was found battered to death in the street in Twickenham.Joe, who is now a horse groomer, can still remember in vivid detail the start of her horrying relationship with the hulking killer.  says: “He was huge. He was a big bloke. I didnt fancy him at first, but he was a proper ladies’ man - everyone knew that.“Then my dad died, and I was in a vulnerable place. He kept on askingI wanted to go for a drink and a meal, and in the end I did.“He stayed that night, and never left.”At the start of their relationship, there weren’t any signs Bellfield was evil. She says: “He’d turn up with flowers and was a gentleman. When he wasn’t psychotic, you couldn’t want for a better boyfriend.”However, almost immediately after Joe fell pregnant with their daughter Bellfield turned aggressive.Joe says: He started with the odd slap. He came home annoyed one night - there was no reason, it was out of the blue.“I was shocked, but my hormones were all over the place and I was still upset about my dad.“I believed him when he said it was because he loved me and he was jealous.“He was convinced Id been having affairs even though I hadnt even left the house - and he couldn’t help it and he was really sorry.”From there the abuse got worse, and by the time Joe fell pregnant with her son in , daily le had become hell.Joe says: “One time he came home from work and I answered him back and he went mental – punching, biting, kicking, pinching.“Towards the end of the relationship he’d use weapons. He hit me with a rubber mallet, he’d burn me with cigarettes - he’d bruise and cut me but it was always from the neck down.And the torment didnt end there, with rapist Bellfield frequently forcing himself on her at any hour of the day.It didnt matter where we were -he wanted it, he took it, she says. You didn’t argue. You could fight but you’d always lose. It could be weekly, daily - over that period it was over  times.“He’d call me fat, stupid, say how useless I was as a mum, that I had no friends. You start to believe it.” Le became a vicious cycle of control. She says: “He was brilliant when my daughter was born. Hed always have time for the kids, and they were always well-dressed. This is why I don’t understand how he can take other people’s children away from them, because as a father he was very good.“Even after he beat the s**t out of you he’d still buy you things – sovereign rings, Kickers shoes, take you on holiday, clothes, stuff for the horses. Sometimes he’d say he was sorry but he would then start to say it was your fault. It was like he had multiple personalities.“They make you believe you’re a piece of s**t on the floor.“When people say why didn’t you walk away the first time  Until you’re in this situation and you’re living that le, you can’t know what it’s like.“I was just target practice. He was just warming up.”Bellfield – who has converted to Islam now and goes by the name Yusuf Rahim while in HMP Frankland – regularly bragged about raping girls when he ed from work as a doorman, according to Joe. But without evidence, she was too scared to say anything.Joe says: “I knew about a lot of the rapes. He’d come home bragging about it, but when I was in that position with two kids, what could I do  I’ve got to live with the guilt every day knowing potentially I could have stopped him, but there was never enough people to come forward.Imagine knowing what he is, and what he’s like - he gets arrested, gets questioned and gets let out - who’s going to get it  I fought for my le everyday - I was terried for my own le.“He bragged about raping a disabled girl on the bonnet of the car in the car park of a club. There were doormen who were there that knew, and nothing was ever done about it.Joe eventually split from Bellfield after he beat her up while heavily pregnant with their son, who was born in . She sought an injunction but Bellfield ignored it.Despite moving on with another girlfriend, Bellfield continued to terrorise Joe for years – while going on to commit multiple murders over a three year period. And it was Joe who finally exacted revenge on her evil ex by helping to bring him to justice.Joe got in touch with police after spotting Bellfield’s car on a Crimewatch programme about the attempted murder of schoolgirl Kate Sheedy in .The -year-old had been hit by a white people carrier Joe recognised as Levi’s, reversed over, and left for dead.With the help of Joe’s statements, Bellfield was convicted in  and given a full le sentence for the murder of Marsha and Amelie, and the attempted murder of Kate. He was later given the same sentence in , when he was found guilty of murdering -year-old Milly Dowler.Recalling the time that she saw his car on Crimewatch, Joe says: I was still in touch with Levi, but no longer felt scared of him. Hed moved on, he wasnt living with me anymore and I had more freedom so it was totally dferent. I called the police anonymously and told them that white people carrier had been on my driveway a couple of weeks before and it was my baby father’s car.

You were always aware of him being around. Later that year Joe went to the police again, after the murder of Amelie.“I went into the incident room on Twickenham Green and told them Levi was a wheel clamper, had a white van and hated blondes.”Joe came face-to-face with Bellfield once again while giving evidence at Milly Dowler’s court without a screen.

She has created a new le and has been in a new relationship for nine months.“My son initially wanted to go and see Levi in prison when he was about ten, she says. I wasn’t happy about it but thankfully he changed his mind. It’s not my place to stop them seeing himthey want to.”She spends most of her time travelling for work or looking after her kids, her elderly mum and five horses, but she’s still scared by the psychological torment she suffered.She says: “I still don’t trust any guy.

But I’m happy to tell Sun on Sunday readers that their hard work is paying off.Our jobs market has defied many of the naysayers.Near record numbers of people have a job and unemployment has fallen in every region across the country.There are more than .million additional people in work since .While this is a huge achievement, sometimes it’s easy to forget that behind these numbers are thousands of people up and down our country who are now better able to provide for their families.They can get up every morning knowing they have the security that only a job can bring.And what’s more, they are being rewarded with a pay rise — this month’s figures show the strongest wage growth in almost a decade.Contrary to myths peddled by the opposition, it’s people at the bottom of the pay scale who have benefited most.The lowest earners working full-time have seen the fastest rise in pay thanks to our National Living Wage and the proportion of low-paid jobs is at a record low.Tomorrow I will deliver my Budget, where I will show how our careful focus on fixing the economy is bearing fruit.Thanks to the balanced approach we have taken — getting our debt falling, while keeping taxes low — and the hard work of the people of the UK, I will be able to set out how we will be investing in our future.Much of the talk surrounding Budgets is often technical. Many, many experts and commentators will have their own take on how the economy is doing.While this is, of course, important, what most ordinary people really care about is how the Budget will improve their day-to-day lives.And one of the issues which I know Sun on Sunday readers care a lot about is transport. With a thousand more people moving into work every day, it’s important that we help to get them there on time.Many of you preparing to start the working week tomorrow will know the frustration of having your journey to work ruined by delays caused by poorly maintained roads. Or of having your car or van damaged by potholes.This isn’t just a bad way to start the day, it’s bad for businesses large and small, and it can be really damaging to the wider economy as well.It’s estimated that congestion costs UK households more than £billion every year. That’s why tomorrow I will announce a bumper £billion investment in our country’s transport network — including a new £.billion fund ring-fencing vehicle excise duty raised in England for spending on our roads.As a former Transport Secretary, I know that these are the arteries that keep our country alive – and they need taking care of. Thirty-two years ago tomorrow, Margaret Thatcher officially opened the final stretch of the M.While few would claim to love this motorway, it’s easy to forget what a landmark moment this was for our country’s transport infrastructure. Three decades later, I am committed to honouring that legacy.And as important as our major roads are, smaller local roads are just as vital to our everyday lives.That’s why I will also announce tomorrow £million of immediate cash for councils to maintain and improve local roads — fixing potholes, repairing damaged roads and keeping bridges safe and open.A further £million on top of that will help improve local junctions, allowing better access to workplaces, high streets and other community facilities.This is also part of our commitment to bridging the gap between our regions. Those in rural parts of the country should have the same chances to get on in le and not have poor transport connections limiting their potential.The funding will help make journeys quicker and easier, while boosting productivity and improving access.And because I know that not everyone drives, I will also invest in local transport projects which could include new bus, tram and cycling routes.And I will also look to the future by investing in next-generation methods of transport, which could potentially include self-driving shuttle services.Not only could this revolutionise our transport network, it will also help us become a global leader developing future technologies.And finally, as I earlier announced with the Prime Minister, I am happy to confirm we will also be freezing fuel duty, for the ninth year in a row.This will keep the cost of fuel down for millions of drivers across the UK — saving people around £million this year alone.These measures are only possible due to our careful management of the economy over the past few years — and the hard work of the British people.This country has a bright future ahead, and — thanks to this vital investment package — the journey there just got a bit smoother.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It shows the strength and resilience of the UK economy alongside the efforts and hard work of families and households up and down the country.In conventional times voters might rightly expect the result of this to be lower taxes , more investment in our public services or to see progress in us paying off the ever ballooning national debt.Instead the Government is preparing to blow this cash - your money - by giving into even more of the EU’s demands.Until last week, Britain expected a  month “transition” or “implementation” period after we formally leave the EU next year on March , .Then, late last week the Government shocked everyone by proposing that we stay in the EU longer than we were originally told and that we extend the so called ‘negotiating period’ to leave the EU.Worse still, on Monday in the House of Commons, we were told that this transition period might last until June  – that’s six years after the referendum result. Whatever happened to Brexit means Brexit On top of our extended membership of the EU, we can expect a bill from the EU! That’s right more of your money with an extra price tag of approximately £ billion each year in contributions to the EU.The Treasury has budgeted for this until the end of  but for each year after , the cost will be as high as £ billion because we will have lost the £. billion a year rebate which was famously secured and successfully negotiated in  by Margaret Thatcher when she demanded our money back from the EU.The British people are once again being treated like fools. What we are now witnessing is a blatant attempt to keep Britain in the EU while Brussels continues to raid the pockets of British taxpayers.This must end and the Government should invoke the great Thatcherite spirit of Fontainebleau and say No, No, No to Brussels. Because pumping our money into an undemocratic and unaccountable system two years after Britain voted to leave the EU is simply not right or acceptable. It makes a mockery of our democracy and is an insult to the British public.It is our money and that money should be handed back to the people and communities across the UK to invest in our domestic priorities.It could help people across Britain– especially the least well off – by giving them back more of the money that they earn by cutting their taxes.For example,we cut the basic rate of income tax by a penny, that would cost us £ billion.By increasing the personal allowance by a £,, many more of the poorest paid households would be taken out of tax altogether, that’d cost us £. billion. Andwe cut beer and cider duty by  pence, that would cost us £. billion.So by easing the tax burden for the lowest paid and doing our bit to save British pubs from closing, we’d have invested £ billion into longer term economic growth in our economy.And with the other £ billion  How about supporting the millions of families who want to own their own home by cutting stamp duty for homeowners, we can again help the least well off and give them a hand up and support them in their aspirations to own their home.We could also take more first time buyers out of paying stamp duty altogether  If we raised the starting threshold of £, to £,, this would cost the Treasury £. billion.Then there’s the VAT we pay on domestic gas and electricity. The  per cent VAT charge on domestic fuel and power raised around £. billion in  . If we got rid of this we would make fuel cheaper and families would have a little extra left over in their monthly pay packets.What about the VAT charged on sanitary products for women  This should end now and not when we leave the EU s the Government previously promised, especially as leaving the EU will take longer than we were previously promised. VAT receipts from the sale of sanitary products costs approximately £. billion a year but importantly this one VAT cut that would unite women across the country.I could go on. There are so many important domestic key services and priorities to invest in.To govern is to choose and the choice being made our Government is to spend your money on an expensive and everlasting EU membership.And all this comes on top of the ridiculous capitulation where we have agreed to the EU’s demands to hand over a £ billion pay cheque for absolutely nothing in .Britain needs once again to have a long term economic plan that puts our national interest first.Let’s start standing up for Britain by investing in people, businesses and communities rather than the unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats of the European Union.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Chancellor should use this Budget to take immediate action and put an end to the suffering.A new report from the Commons Work and Pensions Committee last night said the system hadnt been offering enough support - and urged ministers to halt the rollout.Chair of the committee, Frank Field MP said: DWP must not push one more claimant on to Universal Credit until it can show that it will not push them over the edge.Just days ago the committee reported that the Department were failing vulnerable Brits and had been ignoring the problems with the new system.Universal Credit aims to roll six benefits into one monthly payment, but its already been plagued with problems.Mums have said the system penalises single parents, and one said she couldnt afford her kids school unorms either.Ministers have insisted they are adopting a test and learn approach and they will fix any problems with the new system as soon as they arise."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000445208558.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"new 50p coin brexit","story":"The Chancellor will unveil advanced plans for the seven-sided p piece in his Budget.It will be available from March  next year, the day Britain exits the EU at pm.And in a bid to send out a positive signal to the world, it is expected to bear the phrase, ‘Friendship With All Nations’.The Sun has campaigned for the Government to create an enduring gesture to mark Brexit as a landmark national moment, such as a special stamp or coin.The commemorative coin has had to be personally signed off by the Queen, as it will bear her head.A source close to the Chancellor told The Sun: “It’s an historic moment which will rightly be commemorated”.Tory MPs will see the announcement as Mr Hammond’s bid to win round angry pro-Brexit Tory MPs after two years of battles with them.Senior Tory backbench Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg yesterday branded the Treasury a bastion of Remoanerism ahead of the annual national blueprint for taxes and spending.But Treasury sources say the department has been working on plans for the coin in secret for months, before Tory MPs began to lobby for one over the summer.Mr Hammond has now issued an order to the Royal Mint advisory committee to draw up a design for the coin, which will be signed off later this year.But The Sun has been told that the friendship with all nations phrase instead of any symbol is the firm preference of ministers for its reverse side.Mr Hammond wants to use the coin to ram home Brexit’s positive opportunities, as it is expected to be very popular with Leave voters.The coin will also have Brexit’s date on it, enshrined around the monarch’s image.It will have the Queen’s head on one side and the phrase “Friendship with all nations” on the other — exactly the type of positive, outward-looking message we want to send.Despite the Remain naysayers’ claims, Britain remains a top global financial, diplomatic and military power.Unshackled from the EU, we will boom as a global business hub by developing new relationships.Despite the Government’s commemorative move, the Royal Mail refuses to release a Brexit stamp, claiming our exit will not be “an important anniversary”.

thats three quarters of the way around.Testicular torsion is common in teens aged between  and , andits not caught early can result in the testicle needing to be amputated.Doctors at Dayton Childrens Hospital in Ohio, US, noticed a visible bulge in his groin and his testicle was exquisitely painful to touch, according to the British Medical Journal case report.Medics were able to untwist the boys testicle with their hands after making an incision on the right-hand side of his scrotum.His hernia required surgery.The teenager recovered well and was discharged the following day.Our patient presented with worsening groin pain and a pre-existing diagnosis of an omentum-containing right inguinal hernia [a hernia that folds into the peritoneum], Dr Arturo Aranda wrote in the case report.The most obvious assessment was that this hernia had become incarcerated [trapped in the abdominal wall].Yet on physical examination, his high-riding testicle and exquisite tenderness prompted a more thorough investigation with ultrasound that confirmed decreased blood flow to the testicle.Early diagnosis can potentially be the dference between saving the testicle or its loss.Ultrasound should be performed early so that manual reduction can be attempted prior to surgical intervention.In our case, this provided immediate relief for the patient, and an intra-operative discovery of a  degree torsion, which is in a range correlative with testicular salvage.Had we successfully reduced our patients’ inguinal hernia in the emergency department, a  sense of security could have easily delayed our operative intervention until morning.Because of clinical suspicion and a testicular ultrasound, we knew that delay was not an option. This further supports the recommendation that all patients with inguinal and testicular pain should undergo ultrasound before any decision to delay surgery is made."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000445324299.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"angela merkel step down german chancellor 2021","story":"The veteran politician has faced calls from within her own Christian Democratic Partyto give up after they were given a drubbing in regional elections.Her predecessor, Gerhard Schroeder, stepped down as leader of his party in  but remained chancellor.Merkel has led the CDU since  and has been Germanys leader since .In the past she has firmly stated that Chancellor should also be a party leader but todays events appear to indicate a change of heart.The CDU haemorrhaged votes, losing more than  per cent of its support, with the Greens and far-right Alternative for Germanymaking big gains.Merkels decision to let in more than a million migrants in  deeply ided the country and helped spark an election backlash.German politics expert Nina Schick told The Sun: “This fast tracks her exit.

That was a big sht. In hindsight, however, it was hardly surprising.Philip Hammond needed as much money as he could get his hands on to both increase departmental spendingand to fund the giveaways previously announced by the prime minister, most notably the extra NHS spending.And thats before one gets to the rabbit out of his hat: increasing the tax-free personal allowance a year early.Is austerity really coming to an end  It depends how you measure it.If you ignore the NHS, per-capita spending cuts are due to continue in the coming years - albeit gradually.Include the NHS, and it certainly looks like austerity is over.Either way, the pace of cuts has reduced considerably - all at the cost, though, of higher borrowing and public finances that remain very weak.Indeed, the chancellors pledge to eliminate the budget deficit by the middle of the next decade has been well and truly broken, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility.The politics was as interesting as the economics.An end to austerity , abolishing PFI, introducing a tax on tech giants, putting billions into the benefits system and, most of all, the decision to spend rather than save the extra windfall in the public finances.One can hardly imagine previous Conservative chancellors doing that - but that is precisely what this government has done.Its hard to believe it was a Conservative budget. POLITICSBeth Rigby, deputy political editor Phillip Hammond said his was a budget for the \"grafters and strivers\" who get up early and go to work - as he tried to use his statement to assure them that \"their hard work is paying off and the era of austerity is coming to an end\".And he put his money where his mouth was, as he brought promised tax cuts for  million people forward by a year.The personal tax allowance is being lted to #, in April , while the level at which the higher rate of tax kicks in will also be raised to #, a year.Those cuts brought him cheers in the chamber, but when it came to wider public spending, it was a jam tomorrow budget for a chancellor boxed in by the economic uncertainty of Brexit. Fiscally, it is dficult to calculate how much the public finances will be affected by Brexit when we still dont knowthe UK will be leaving with a deal or not.There was a bit of extra money for social care , for defence , for schoolsand for potholes and road repairs .In reality, however, the big spending decisions will come next year in a post-Brexit spending review for the whole of Whitehall.But Mr Hammond did find money for Universal Credit to reverse swingeing cuts for Britains lowest earners, promising an extra #bn over the next five years to help ameliorate the worst effects of shting from the old benefits system to the new one.That was well below what some Conservative MPs had been demanding, though.Against the backdrop of Brexit, Mr Hammond was pretty constrained.Ending austerity is a post-Brexit project - and the current incumbents of No  and No  Downing Street may well not be the pair wholl end up delivering it. BUSINESSIan King, business presenterThere were some welcome announcements for business.Entrepreneurs relief, which some had expected to get the chop, lives for another day but the minimum qualying period will be extended from one year to two years to ensure it does genuinely work as intended.Small businesses dodged a bullet when the threshold at which VAT becomes payable was kept at #, for the next two years. Many had expected it to be lowered.There were also tweaks to the use by large private companies of private contractors to avoid paying national insurance. These measures have already been rolled out for the public sector.Then came the much-touted assault on the US tech giants.Digital s \"pose a real challenge to the sustainability and fairness of our tax system\", said Mr Hammond, highlighting the low taxes paid by the tech multinationals.Pointing out that progress was \"painfully slow\" in forging an international deal, he announced a new digital services tax, to fall on specically targeted companies.

All Budgets are exercises in sleight of hand. They offer the Government an uninterrupted opportunity to present the economy in the best possible light. So Philip Hammond was not unique in seizing his chance today to paint a picture of a country on the mend. This was, he said, a Budget for Britain’s future - a phrase whose banality was matched only by its duplicity. No Chancellor is going to announce a financial statement which deliberately took the country backwards. Yet history lay heavily on the Budget - the history of previous Tory Governments whose cuts have now come home to roost.  There was extra money for social care, extra money for the universal credit and a “little extra” for school kit. All of this is repairing the damage caused by previous cuts. The poundmillion for social care will not cover the pound.billion being taken from local authorities next year. The pound.billion to help ease the roll out of the universal credit is a fraction of the poundbillion of welfare cuts imposed by George Osborne. The additional poundmillion funding for schools is less than the amount being spent on repairing potholes . Mr Hammond wants us to be grateful he is no longer punching us with same force of the previous Tory bruisers. Many will welcome the increase in the personal allowance yet this is tax cut which does nothing to help those who earn too little to pay income tax and is skewed towards those on higher incomes.

Over a million people turned to high cost credit last year to meet basic living expenses, which is counterproductive both for households and the economy. If finances are tight and your fridge breaks down, the last thing you need is expensive credit - what you need is simply a replacement fridge. By taking away the additional high cost of borrowing, the new scheme will demonstrate how no interest loans can act as a realistic and better alternative to short term high cost credit. It can only be a good thing to reduce the risk of households building up problem debt as a result of trying to meet their basic needs. On breathing space, he adds: The fact that breathing space is being introduced is a great step forward, but it#xs vital that the government listens carefully to responses on how the scheme design should be finalised . There are three crucial elements still at stake. First, all debts and enforcement activity #x including debts owed to government #x need to be included in the breathing space. Second, there needs to be flexibility to extend the -day time periodnecessary, to avoid the risk of people who are in the process of sorting out their debts being put back to square onetime runs out before this process is complete. And third, the administration of the scheme needs to be proportionate, using the existing expertise of partner debt advice charities, to avoid becoming bogged down in expensive bureaucracy.\",\"author\":,\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"mainEntityOfPage\":\"https:www.mirror news politics budget--recap-philip-hammond-\",What the Chancellor said yesterday was that he would use the fiscal reserves that we have built up through hard work and sound economic management to ensure that Britain will succeed whatever the circumstances.The Chancellor has spoken on numerous occasions about having maintained what he would describe as #xfiscal firepower#x which he will be able to use in the event of a no-deal scenario.

Mr Hammond unveiled lower-than-expected borrowing and higher growth forecasts. But critics say the Chancellors declaration will mean little to workers who are now pound a year worse off than they were ten years ago. It echoes the claim by Theresa May at Tory Party conference about austerity which was similarly ridiculed. Labour say spending announcements revealed in the budget will do little to repair the damage to public services exacted by the Coalition and Tory governments. Jeremy Corbyn said the Chancellor had introduced half measures and quick fixes.  And they say the cuts were a political choice. Since  the Tories have cut more than , police officers while per pupil funding has fallen by %. Local councils will see a funding gap of pound. billion by  making it dficult for them to keep already struggling services afloat. While Universal Credit will see some families lose out on pound a month unless the government makes signicant changes. Mr Hammond insisted today that the savage cuts to the public sector since  were not ideologically driven.  Delivering his financial statement, Mr Hammond said it was a budget that paves the way for a brighter future. To loud jeers from the opposite side of the House, he said: The tough decisions of the last eight years were not driven by ideology. They were driven by necessity and by the failure of the party opposite in Government. That was our inheritance and, as ever, we did what was needed to be done. He insisted todays announcement were opening a new chapter in our countrys economic future.  Today I can report to the British people that their hard work is paying off and the era of austerity is finally coming to an end, he said. As part of Mr Hammonds final Budget before the UK leaves the EU in March . He promised poundbn a year extra for mental health by , million trees, cash for roads and a pilot scheme to offer low-cost loans to the poor.

Over a million people turned to high cost credit last year to meet basic living expenses, which is counterproductive both for households and the economy. If finances are tight and your fridge breaks down, the last thing you need is expensive credit - what you need is simply a replacement fridge. By taking away the additional high cost of borrowing, the new scheme will demonstrate how no interest loans can act as a realistic and better alternative to short term high cost credit. It can only be a good thing to reduce the risk of households building up problem debt as a result of trying to meet their basic needs. On breathing space, he adds: The fact that breathing space is being introduced is a great step forward, but it#xs vital that the government listens carefully to responses on how the scheme design should be finalised . There are three crucial elements still at stake. First, all debts and enforcement activity #x including debts owed to government #x need to be included in the breathing space. Second, there needs to be flexibility to extend the -day time periodnecessary, to avoid the risk of people who are in the process of sorting out their debts being put back to square onetime runs out before this process is complete. And third, the administration of the scheme needs to be proportionate, using the existing expertise of partner debt advice charities, to avoid becoming bogged down in expensive bureaucracy.\",\"author\":,\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"mainEntityOfPage\":\"https:www.mirror news politics budget--recap-philip-hammond-\",What the Chancellor said yesterday was that he would use the fiscal reserves that we have built up through hard work and sound economic management to ensure that Britain will succeed whatever the circumstances.The Chancellor has spoken on numerous occasions about having maintained what he would describe as #xfiscal firepower#x which he will be able to use in the event of a no-deal scenario.

It wasn’t so much a case of “I commend this statement to the house” as “take my Budget…please!” The gag about the speech not being “Hammond’s House of Horrors” was inevitable, given the Tories had moved the Budget back from Wednesday to avoid Halloween. But it got really bizarre when Hammond embarked on a y string of one-liners about about toilets during his keynote financial address.  You see, for some reason the Government is cutting taxes for public loos. “It’s virtually the only announcement in this budget that hasn’t leaked,” the Chancellor wisecracked. “Finally, local authorities can relieve themselves.” It’s a shame, then, that he still refuses to “spend a penny” where it’s really needed. As he sat down, a group of Waspi women started angrily shouting at Phil from the public gallery, furious that he’d spent more time on tax breaks for public conveniences than on sorting out their pensions. And the biggest joke of all was Hammond’s insistence that the era of austerity would soon be over. It certainly got a bigger laugh than his joke about helping schools that can’t afford to pay for pens and books out with more money for the “little extras”. That was a joke, right  RIGHT   Hammond’s hour-long set wasnt the kind of performance that gets you a slot on Live At The Apollo. Youre not likely to see him doing  minutes at the Comedy Store with this kind of material. He doesnt even put on the kind of show you’re likely to see opening for Cannon and Ball on Blackpool Pier. If Phil’s betting his fortune on a future as a comedian once he’s inevitably booted out of Number , he might want to invest a little more in Universal Credit first. He might just need to sign on.

Parents may have breathed a sigh of relief at the news, after years of their kids schools sending begging letters home for donations to pay for basics like pens, paper and toilet roll. And the Chancellor certainly made it sound like he would be helping struggling schools with his pound million cash injection. But schools wont actually be able to spend the money on the things they really need. The money has been allocated in the Budget red book as capital spending.  Capital funds are ringfenced for building maintenance and purchasing equipment. That means schools will be allowed to buy iPads with the extra cash, but not pens and paper. And its been noted the money hes set aside for schools is tens of millions less than has been allocated to fix potholes. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said that while the announcement was welcome, schools needed more.  He said: While we welcome any increased investment in schools, the poundm bonus announced today hardly scratches the surface of what is needed. The Chancellors comment that this money will help schools to buy the little extras they need shows a complete misunderstanding of the prevailing funding pressures. Many schools dont have enough money to provide a full curriculum or inidual support to pupils, let alone provide little extras. What they desperately need is improved core funding. He added that it was a sign of the governments priorities that it was spending more on fixing potholes than on fixing the school funding crisis.

Chancellor Philip Hammond finally acted after furious MPs including his own Tories warned families were being driven to rent debt, food banks and the brink of suicide. In a sensational verdict the Resolution Foundation think tank declared UC is now is more generous the system it replaced. But the move, worth up to pound a year for families, was also blasted as a sticking plaster over a gaping wound - and stops short of the Mirrors demand to halt the cruel rollout of the six-in-one benefit. It came as the top Tory claimed the era of austerity was ending in a Budget that banned PFI deals and launched a new poundm tax on Google and Facebook in Britains final Budget before leaving the EU. Mr Hammond promised poundbn for the Armed Forces and poundbn a year extra for mental health by  while beer, cider, petrol and spirits duties were all frozen - though taxes on cigarettes and wine are going up.  The Chancellor trumped hitting a Tory manesto pledge a year early by raising the Income Tax personal allowance to pound, and p rate - which benefits just % - to pound, from April. Stamp duty will be scrapped for more first time buyers, he said, and the minimum wage is going up to pound. for over-s. But Jeremy Corbyn warned it was a “broken promise budget” with “half-measures and quick fixes while austerity grinds on” - as women denied their pensions protested furiously in the public gallery. Mr Hammond unveiled two separate changes to Universal Credit in todays Budget. He revealed the work allowance - the amount people can earn from work before their benefits start tapering away - will rise by pound, a year from April. Currently it is just over pound,. The Mirror are demanding a halt to the expansion of Universal Credit and for a review to take place. We say there are three options:Redesign UC to be fit for purpose Axe it in favour of the old systemUC is unfixable Introduce a brand new systemSign our petition to stop the rollout of Universal Credit across Britain and to replace it with a fairer system by signing our petition. The change will mean .million families in low-paid work will get to keep pound of extra income a year, the Treasury claimed. It will cost pound.bn a year by  - poundm in  , poundm in  , pound.bn in  , pound.bn in  , and pound.bn in  . On top of this move there will be poundbillion in transitional cash - spread over five years. It will be worth just poundm in   as almost no one in transitioning to UC straight away. It will then rise to poundm in  , poundm in  , poundm in  , poundm in  , and poundm in  . But critics said it did not go far enough to undo poundbillion a year in Tory cuts that were bundled into the benefit when it first launched. Labour MPs howled in protest during the Budget that the extra transitional fund would make little dference - and it wont apply to million people on Universal Credit by December . PCS union general secretary Mark Serwotka - who represents Universal Credit call handlers - fumed: “Universal Credit has been a disaster for claimants and the cash injection today will do nothing to deal with the inherent structural problems that are blighting thousands of lives.  The Chancellor is trying to put a sticking plaster over a gaping wound. A statement by the Resolution Foundation think tank said: The pound, increase in Work Allowances will deliver a pound boost to low-income families, and means that UC is now more generous than the benefit system it is replacing. However, the Foundation cautions that austerity is not over when it comes to social security. The cash freeze in working age benefits is set to continue next year, saving the Exchequer pound.bn but costing a couple with children in the bottom half of the income distribution pound. Dan Scorer of disability charity Mencap, said: This is not an end to austerity for people with a learning disability and their families. The government has started to listen on the huge problems with Universal Credit, but has done little to address the massive loss of financial support faced by disabled people due to disability premiums being abolished. Emma Revie of foodbank charity the Trussell Trust welcomed the cash - but said it must go further. She said: By failing to ensure benefits cover essential living costs, the Government risks undermining the health, wellbeing and dignity of millions of people. “We know it doesn’t have to be like this. In a country that created a benefits system to anchor people from poverty, it is imperative that the Government goes further.  Campbell Robb, chief executive of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said: In the Budget today the Government has taken an important step forward in addressing a burning injustice – the rise of poverty among working families. This move will help make Universal Credit a tool for tackling poverty, and ease the burden for low income families. Labour and the Daily Mirror have demanded Universal Credits rollout is halted and a full review undertaken of the system. Budget documents quietly confirmed, for the first time, that the rollout has been delayed by nine months to finish in December . In apparent proof that the benefit is now costing more than the old system, the Treasury said delaying the rollout will save pound.billion in total by  .  Yet despite this Mr Hammond heaped praise on the system. During his Budget speech, the Chancellor said the old benefits system was broken, and the new system was here to stay. And he praised the “tenacity” of its inventor, former Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith. But he admitted rolling six benefits into one was an “enormous undertaking”. He said he’d already delivered pound.bn in help for people made worse off by being transferred on to the new system including pound.bn at last year’s Budget. Now there will be an extra poundbn package of additional protections over five years - but details will only be confirmed later this year.

The reality is that whatever the Chancellor claims today, austerity is not over, he said.The Government claims austerity has worked so now they can end it.That is absolutely the opposite of the truth.Austerity needs to end because it has failed.  The Labour leader said eight years of austerity has damaged our economy and delayed the recovery, adding the Government has not abandoned the policy despite the Chancellors latest spending pledges. Mr Corbyn also said the proposals announced will not undo the damage done by the squeeze on spending. He told the Commons: The Prime Minister pledged austerity was over - this is a broken promise Budget.  What weve heard today are half measures and quick fixes while austerity grinds on. And far from peoples hard work and sacrices having paid off, as the Chancellor claims, this Government has frittered it away in ideological tax cuts to the richest in our society. Mr Corbyn added: The Government claims austerity has worked so now they can end it. That is absolutely the opposite of the truth - austerity needs to end because it has failed. Mr Corbyn later said the precious NHS is a thermometer of the wellbeing of our society, adding: But the illness is austerity - cuts to social care, failure to invest in housing and slashing of real social security.  It has one inevitable consequence - peoples health has got worse and demands on the National Health Service have increased. Mr Corbyn also condemned the horric and vile anti-Semitic and racist attack in Pittsburgh, noting: We stand together with those under threat from the far-right, wherever it may be, anywhere on this planet. The Labour leader criticised pay levels for public sector workers, adding: Every public sector worker deserves a decent pay rise, but % of teachers are not getting it - neither are the police nor the Governments own civil service workers.

He suffered a bleed on the brain, but fortunately survived.Police are now investigating the circumstances surrounding the assault last year, which left a terried Euan soaked in blood.The young man, from Dundee, Scotland, recalled: As I got out of the taxi I just heard footsteps behind me and heard a loud bang.  Then I felt this immense pain in my head and I was knocked clean out. I was laid into when I was on the floor.I was left laying there in a pool of blood. He left me for dead. I woke up with blood in my eyes and my clothes were soaked. I stumbled into the kitchen and it looked like a murder scene. I had never seen so much blood. My whole body was in agony.I was so scared. He added: I needed  stitches on my face and I had a few broken ribs, a dislocated shoulder and a bleed on the brain. It has totally changed my le forever. Euan, who stands ft ins tall, claims the attack happened following what he thought was a harmless discussion about religion.  Medics reportedly carried out tests which showed he was struck with a thick metal pole, like a crowbar, during the attack. He says he was forced to shell out pound, for his medical treatment and now suffers with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder . I keep reliving what happened in my head, he said. I will never be the same again. Euan who was working on a farm at the time, had flagged down the yellow cab after a night out with a friend in Melbourne in June . He claims the driver became visibly annoyed when he said he was an atheist and when he expressed his views about religion. The architecture student recalled: He didnt like it at all when I started expressing my views... I tried to change the conversation but he kept going on about it. I could see he was getting wound up.  It was after Euan had got out of the car in Aberfeldie, in the early hours of June  that year, that the attack allegedly occurred.He claims that he was expecting the cabbie to drive off when he was suddenly smashed over the head and beaten to a pulp. When he woke up, he recalls having pain all over his body and believes the driver battered him as he laid unresponsive on the pavement. He stumbled into his home before collapsing on the kitchen floor. Euan claims he suffered bruised ribs, a battered shoulder and multiple cuts to his face, as well as the bleed on the brain, in the attack. He called an Uber to Melbournes Sunshine Hospital following the incident, where he stayed for around a week.He says he was forced to borrow money from friends to pay for a pound, medical bill. And he was treated on a specialist mental health ward after he started experiencing suicidal thoughts.  He travelled home to his family a few weeks after the attack. More than a year on, Euan has only just felt able to speak out. He has been reimbursed for his medical bills and awarded pound, in injury compensation by the Australian government. However, cops have yet to trace the taxi driver - and Euan says he is petried to step foot in a taxi, with his confidence shattered.The young man, who lives with his girlfriend, Sharon Macrae, , says he has been left mentally scarred and suffers with PTSD. He said: It has left me in a terrible place and has totally changed my le. I used to be a really confident person but since the attack I have terrible nightmares. It has seriously affected my mental health. Whenever I think about it I get upset. It was just absolutely shocking.  I just cant believe that someone would do that to me. Im a big guy, ft in tall and  stone, and I never thought anyone would be capable of that. Ill be stuck with PTSD for le. I wake up screaming and shouting in the night quite a lot. A Melbourne Police spokesperson said: Police are investigating the circumstances surrounding an assault in Aberfeldie on  June, . It is believed a man was standing outside his home address on Fawkner Street in the early hours of the morning when he was struck in the back of the head by an unknown offender. The victim, -years-old at the time, sustained serious head injuries. The victim reported having a verbal altercation with a taxi driver prior to the incident.

Others believe the doorman had acted in self-defence after she tried to hit him first. The incident was filmed outside the Oddfellows Arms in Chester, Cheshire, on Saturday night -although it is not immediately clear who employed the doorman. At the start of the clip both the man and the woman are on the ground, suggesting the fight had already started. The man stands up, his legs not too stable, and lts his arms in the air, appearing to goad the bouncer into a fight.  The bouncer and the man take positions in front of the pub, both facing each other. The man holds his arms out before suddenly taking a swing at the bouncer. The bouncer blocks this, attempts to grab the man and kick him, but misses. Beside them, the woman who was still kneeling on the ground, finally gets up. The man continues to provoke the bouncer, which merits him only a kick to to the legs, knocking him to the ground. The woman then approaches the bouncer and tries to hit him but is blocked and shoved hard to the ground. Off camera people can be heard protesting at the bouncers actions on the woman, with someone saying: “Oi, don’t touch her.” The bouncer then turns round, now appearing to pursue the people protesting, before the clip ends. The video was uploaded to Facebook by Kirk Johnstone, , whose brother filmed the incident when going for a Chinese.Kirk uploaded the clip with the caption: “My little bro went for a nice Chinese in Chester and this was going on outside.” The clip has been viewed , times since it was uploaded and most Facebook users were disgusted at the bouncer’s reaction against the woman. Sharon Cull said: “Thats terrible behaviour of the doorman. I didnt think they were allowed to touch people.” Kelly Littler wrote: “Shameful. I bet he dont have a wehe hits a woman. Bully.” Sharon Powell commented: “Big hard man hitting a woman.” Cathy Ward said: What a horrid doorman. He should be sacked for that, he looked so proud that he knocked a woman to the ground. I hope the police get this video or the chronicle news paper. However there were some who defended the doorman’s actions. Tanya Haddock said: “Both deserved. If she’s coming towards him and wants to try attack him like a man then get treated like one. He can’t smack her in the face, so yes push her away.” Ben Sykes wrote: Am I the only person here that sees the doorman being in the right  Two punches were thrown, both were at the doorman.

Incredibly the family set up their extensive decorations on October  as part of their three-month Christmas tradition that gets bigger and more extravagant every year. Speaking to Hull Live about how the tradition began, Mr Whitehead said: “I’ve been doing it since I bought my first property  years ago and previously with my parents. “It’s all about the kids. We’ve got three young ones and two older ones who don’t live here now and they love it. “It’s all about Christmas for me and the kids. Every year we add to it.

Orders are in for some big additions to his festive collection and he admits there is still much more to come until this year’s look is complete. “I’ve done about  per cent and there is about  per cent left to do. I’ve still got the back garden and the balcony to do,” the father-of-five said. “I want a big projector with Father Christmas coming down the roof. It’s coming from America and it costs pound. “Every year I’d like to add to it. I’ve got a snow machine coming as well.

According to researchers, parents who waited  to  months after their first child reduced the risk short and long term risks to both mum and baby. Whereas parents who had a little time between pregnancies were at risk of maternal mortality or severe morbidity. The researchers found a short gap between pregnancies affected mothers aged over , while risks to the infant were found for all women - particularly for those aged  to .  Laura Schummers, a post-doctoral fellow at the UBC, said: Our study found increased risks to both mother and infant when pregnancies are closely spaced, including for women older than . The findings for older women are particularly important, as older women tend to more closely space their pregnancies and often do so intentionally. The study is the described by the authors as the most extensive evaluation of how the role of pregnancy spacing could be impacted by maternal age. It is also the first investigation of pregnancy spacing and maternal mortality or severe morbidity - rare but le-threatening complications of pregnancy, labour and delivery - in a high-income country, the authors said.

Born and bred in Hull, Brook lives with her partner Aaron, , and first embarked on her modelling career at the age of  after she was scouted on social media. She told HullLive: Ive been on Page  a lot of times and usually shoot with them once a month. I do really enjoy it. At first, because Ive never done anything like it before I wasnt as confidence but that has grown and I just think that its my body that Im exposing and it is a natural thing. I never got into it through the sex side but through art and Id never go any further than what I do, but it is my body and I can do what I want with it. She had originally set her sights on a career within the music industry, but after she was asked to fly out to Budapest by a modelling agency, she soon realised that her skills were in strutting her stuff.  She was discovered after her friend, a photographer, asked to shoot her for a project. She posted one of the images on social media and was approached by the agency. She said: It is a dferent industry to music but my family and friends are really supportive of it. My nan collects all the pictures, she hasnt missed one. Ive been in a few magazines too and have travelled to a lot of places, which is the best part of it. Ive been to Australia and shoot in Portugal around three times a year and Ive been to Turkey but I do mainly shoot in London. You do get some time to explore and experience the places you are shooting too. It is dferent every day and I love it every day.  She said: The photographers Ive worked with in the past are really good. They message you before with what they needthey need any outfits or anything. The Page  photographer is a woman, who is really good, but I have worked with some guys and there is nothing. Theyre there to do their job and create their images. Despite having a job that revolves around her shape, she denies that she diets. Im not one of those who diets, so the upkeep isnt too bad, it is just making sure my nails are the colour they need on the shoot and washing my hair.  Sometimes you need to take your own clothes or lingerie with you, butits for a big company I get to keep some outfits and they have a stylist and hair and make-up which is always really nice. Brook said thatanyone approached her for advice on how to break into the glamour modelling industry, she would tell them to go for it while at the same time making sure it is what they really want. She said: I would just say to make sure that it is what they want to do, and before anything goes online because once it is there, it is out.

Inspector Richard Murray confirmed police received a report of a group of people dressed as Ku Klux Klan members and the incident was being treated as a hate crime. The group allegedly pushed their way inside a local JD Wetherspoon pub but left when bar staff refused to serve them. Chief Constable George Hamilton told the BBC NIs The Nolan Show: The incident was disgusting and distasteful. Theres no place for it anywhere in Northern Ireland. We will investigate it and report the evidence to the PPS. Footage obtained by BBC News NI shows the men inside the pub, but a spokesman for the chain said the group were refused entry by door staff, but pushed past them into the pub.  Spokesman Eddie Gershon added: They were told by bar staff that they would not be served. They remained in the pub for five minutes, unserved, and then left. An image of the group posing in the street was taken just a few doors down from the Bangladesh Islamic Centre in Newtownards. Belfast Islamic Centre executive treasurer Dr Raied Al-Wazzan urged those involved to come forward. If they keep it quiet for the next  hours, that means it was a deliberate act, he said. If this is just a joke, these people should come forward and identy themselves. To go there specically wearing that costume in front of the Islamic centre is not acceptable. Its similar to somebody wearing a Nazi unorm and going in front of a Jewish synagogue. Strangford MLA Peter Weir said: The appearance in Newtownards on Saturday night of a group of ten or so people dressed from head to foot as members of the KKK, together with a wooden cross is totally unacceptable. The Klu Klux Klan is a deeply repugnant racist organisation and anyone happy to associate themselves with such a vile body is clearly a moron.  That such a large group of people took the time and the effort to get their costumes completely correct, and above all the fact that they chose to pose outside the Islamic Prayer Centre in Newtownards, takes this episode of stupidity to a more sinister connotation. There are very good community relations in Newtownards, with a sense of friendship to all and neighbourliness.All communities are welcome within the town, and everyone should have a right to live free from intimidation and harassment. Local people will completely reject this sort of behaviour and stand against it. The PSNI will be investigating this matter, and I call on anyone with any information to come forward to the Police. Such boorish and malevolent behaviour has no place in our town and it is right that it is condemned across the board. Inspector Murray said: We received a report around pm yesterday, Sunday  October, about a group of people dressed as Ku Klux Klan members in the vicinity of Greenwell Street in the town on Saturday night . We are also aware of images that are circulating that show people dressed as Ku Klux Klan members. Our enquiries are ongoing, and we are treating this as a hate incident at this time. Hate crime, in all its forms, is totally unacceptable. It is the responsibility of each and every one of us to ensure that we live in a society where ersity is respected.

Royal fans have been wondering ever since how the former Suits actress bonded with the head of The Firm after marrying Prince Harry. However, it has now emerged that Meghan, who had officially joined the Royal family five weeks earlier, had turned up without a hat. The Daily Mail reports the Queens aides had told she would be wearing a green hat as a mark of respect to those who died in the Grenfell Tower fire.  The Queen is said to have been baffled when Meghan turned up without a hat as she didnt realise she was supposed to wear one too. A senior aide said: I dont think the Duchess fully understood. This was not a request. Those are for others to make, not the Queen. The Queens staff are said to have noted the Duchesss mistake or lack of deference.  There was another instance of confusion during the days events when Meghan didnt know which of them was supposed to get into the limousine first.

Anna Cornelius died in March this year, less than a year after her daughter Hannah Cornelius was killed. Four men are currently standing trial at Western Cape Court and face charges of rape and murder. In a Facebook post titled When Anna joined Hannah, the Hannah Cornelius Foundation confirmed that Anna died on Sunday, March . Her body was seen floating in shallow water by beachgoers in Scarborough, Cape Town. It said: Anna’s friends and family knew her as an amazing human being, full of light, abundant love and energy. Following her daughter, Hannah’s, death Anna founded the Hannah Cornelius Foundation in June .  It said: Anna was driven to ensure that Hannah’s legacy be remembered through her acts of goodwill, forgiveness and love. Through the Hannah Cornelius Foundation, Anna wished to support other young people to reach beyond the realities of their present circumstances and achieve their dreams through hard work, commitment and a passionate dedication to their own development. Anna was a lawyer and leaves behind her husband, magistrate Willem Cornelius, and son, Dries.  The Hannah Cornelius Foundation aims to help underprivileged children access the opportunities “Hannah had in her le” by offering‚ among other things‚ trauma counselling and help with unplanned pregnancies. Hannah Cornelius was carjacked by four men while dropping off fellow student Cheslin Marsh, , at his home in Stellenbosch, east of Cape Town, after a night out in May . Vernon Witbooi, , Geraldo Parsons, , Nashville Julius, , and Eben Van Nieberk, , face a string of charges including murder, kidnap, robbery and rape of the Stellenbosch University student.  One of the alleged attackers claimed Hannah told the gang they could have sex with herthey let her go afterwards. Parsons said he raped Ms Cornelius first, followed by Witbooi and then van Niekerk. He claims he tried to get them to release Hannah but they put her in the boot and drove her to a vineyard.  The court heard Hannah went through an “extremely painful” ordeal before she was killed. Hannah suffered severe vaginal and cervical injuries in the prolonged attack. The court heard how Parsons had plastic pearls embedded in his penis which would likely have made the sex attack more painful.Heavy bruising on her arms show she had been held down and it is believed that probably several of the gang lted the huge rock and dropped it on her head.  At an earlier hearing, it emerged that Hannahs parents were sent a letter from one of her alleged gang-rapists begging for their forgiveness. Eben van Niekerk penned the letter but claims he was told to write in by Sergeant Steven Adams. The letter was reportedly written after his arrest and before the four men first appeared in court. It was translated from Afrikaans and had a number of errors. The top of the letter says: This letter comes from Eben VNK and it was also signed and initialled.  When translated, the letter reads: Herewith I write this letter to Hennas mom and dad. I am sorry for what I did and I askthey can forgive me for what I have done… The girl was like a friend to me but the other accused, I was also scared of them and it wasnt nice to see.

The explosive revelations by royal correspondent Robert Jobson claim tensions were high in the run-up to the wedding, with Meghan and Harry even turning to acupuncture as a stress-buster. Now, Jobson has also revealed Harry would raise his voice on occasion, insisting Meghan had everything she asked for on the day of the wedding in May. As part of a serialisation of his book in the Daily Mail, he writes: The weeks leading up to the wedding had been far more tense for both Harry and Meghan than most people realised.  In the build-up to the wedding, says an inside source, he was ‘petulant and short-tempered’ with members of staff. Raising his voice on occasion, Harry would insist: ‘What Meghan wants, she gets. The book also details how Harry and his brother William would have extreme mood swings, with their volatility often mirroring that of their mother Diana. It says how Charles found it dficult to predict their behaviour, and how he was often shocked at the level of belligerence he encountered from his children.  Quoting a royal insider, Jobson writes: To this day, Charles admits he often finds it dficult to gauge either of his sons occasionally unpredictable moods. In that aspect of their nature, both princes are very much like their mother, one close source confirmed. A former courtier made the same analogy. They both have quite extreme mood wings, just as Diana did, he said. She could be your best friend one minute and the next, your worst enemy.

Paul and Gemma Black, from Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales, lost little Pearl on on August ,  - when a Range Rover rolled off its driveway, across a road and demolished a wall which crushed her. The parents have spoken out about the pain they will feel for the rest of their lives, and how not a second in the day passes where they dont grieve for their daughter. Now, Paul, who appeared on the TV talent show in , has undergone extensive tattoos all over his body in a bid to numb the pain - and has even come as close to self harm, reports Wales Online. He described how while using a razor to shave his head, he would dig the blade in to see his own blood. Speaking about his loss and heartbreak, Paul said: Ive used tattooing as my therapy, he said. Its literally been therapy for me because when I sit in that chair, for that amount of time, be it five hours, seven hours, everything goes away. I get into a meditative state. When Im getting tattooed its the only time that everything goes away.  For me I shut my eyes and I dont feel the pain anymore. Its become a huge part of my recovery process. Im nearly done now, Im nearly covered. He did, however, confess that he did start cutting himself but quickly stopped. When my head was shaved I did start to cut myself with a razor. I would stand in a mirror and experience the feeling of the razor going into my head so I could see the blood. I realised quickly that I was spoiling the tattoos. Ive never self-harmed until I shaved my head but I would imagine the tattooing is the closest thing that I would imagine someone who self-harms feels. But as I say it does help me through it. Theres no blood. Its nothing to do with the pain. Its that purely meditative state that I get in when Im being tattooed and I can sit for hours. All the other pain goes away. The former singer said he replays the moment Pearl was hit by the wall over and over in his mind every day. As a result he has been diagnosed with severe Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder . People see me walking down the street and they think I am confident because of this exterior and bravado, but I am absolutely crumbling inside, he said.  I defy any man living to see what Ive seen. No man will see their child getting crushed to death in front of them. No man has seen what Ive seen. He was forced to relive the tragic circumstances leading to his daughters death at the inquest this week and at one point could not bear to say the words out loud. In his heartbreaking evidence he recounted the events leading up to the tragedy and detailed the extraordinary s he went to in a bid to save his two children, Pearl and Ace. He told the court how when the vehicle careered towards him building up speed he threw Ace into the road and tried to step in front of Pearl, but wasn’t quick enough to throw her as well. “The Range Rover proceeded to crush her in front of me, he said. The weight of the wall. She was so small. “I’d rather not go into severe details. There was so much blood. “There was a lot of blood spraying. I could see the death just appearing on her face. “I lted the wall off her. I don’t know how I done it. I was saying: ‘Come back to daddy.’ She was literally limp and leless. “I was screaming: ‘She’s gone, she’s gone, my poor baby girl.’ I was covered in blood.” He told how he was so angry he started to smash up the Range Rover.  “There was a hammer lying on the wall, he said. I smashed every single window. I smashed the back window first. Smashed all the windows, the lights, the bonnet. “I was engulfed with pure anger and rage, as I’m sure you can appreciate. “In my mind, it was the vehicle had killed my little girl. In the  months since that day, Gemma said she still cant bear to visit the scene of where it happened near to her mother-in-laws house. “I havent been to my mother-in-laws house since last August,” said Gemma. “I cant turn left out of the house to go up there.” Paul said the hope that there would be justice for his beautul little girl was one of the things keeping him going. But they said they were devastated when they were told there would be no criminal prosecution against the Range Rovers owner Mr Williams. “We were distraught when the police told us, said Paul.  It was one of the things that was keeping me focused and positive in le - that there would be some sort of justice, some sort of recompense. “Nothing will ever make up for what has happened. No amount of justice would have been right for what has happened to Pearl but it was a huge blow.” The inquest at Pontypridd Coroners Court ruled that Pearls death was an accident. The police investigation had found the car wasnt secure with the handbrake on the empty Range Rover not sufficiently applied. Gemma and Paul are now campaigning for a change to the law, which they say has prevented a charge being brought. “Weve already made grounds to try and get the law changed,” said Gemma. “Weve had a meeting with our local MP Gerald Jones and hes very keen to take it on and to create a private members bill that will be put through Parliament. Were in the process of working through the logistics of this and how we go about this, so thats ongoing.” If you are affected by this story and need to speak to someone, the Samaritans are available   by calling   or by emailing jo@samaritans.org "},{"url":null,"title":"fiendish halloween puzzle features 10","story":"NewsFiendish Halloween puzzle features  hidden pumpkins - can you spot them all Artists have put together a cunning scene to test the beady-eyedShareCommentsByRichard Jenkins:,  OCT NewsDont look at the picture belowyou dont want to see the solution \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailYou’ll be absolutely PUMPEDyou manage to complete the latest fiendish puzzle haunting the internet.

The horrying video shows how the animal suddenly broke off from performing before it reportedly mauled the helpless child in Russia. One account claimed the lion sank its teeth into the victims head. The young girl, named as Ksenia, is in intensive care with serious face and chest injuries. She survived the incident but doctors say she will be “scarred for le” and a medic says she has been left with a bite mark on her face spanning from her ear to her chin.  The child had been waving a small flag and the lioness rushed from its trainer despite being on a leash and sprang on the child. One account said the wild animal broke a flimsy safety netting around the circus ring at Uspenskoye village in the Krasnodar region. Valentina Pavlova said she was a member of a medical team which treated the girl at the Central Republican Hospital in Krasnodar. “There is a bite on her face that goes from ear to chin,” she said.  She added that the lioness used its paw and pulled the child inside onto the arena and sank its teeth into her head. “The circus team pulled the lioness away and delivered the girl to the Central Republican Hospital. “She is now in stable condition, there is no danger to her le.”  The child is being treated in intensive care. Wild animals continue to be used for performances in Russian circuses, including many touring troupes that go from place to place. The latest incident is likely to lead to increase calls to ban the use of performing predators like lions and bears.

She was then hauled off the  by two female police officers while her partner was also whipped as punishment for standing too close to each other in public. The public punishment took place in the city of Banda Aceh - where Sharia law is strictly practised and enforced.  The crime of being in close proximity to someone of the opposite sex can be punished by up to  lashes. Other offences such as gay sex, adultery, drinking alcohol and gambling can result in up to  lashes. Aceh is the only province in the country to impose Islamic criminal law and was granted increasingly special powers in  when the government struck a deal with separatists.  Indonesia is one of the most largely populated Muslm countries in the world with more than  per cent of the  million inhabitants practising the faith. Earlier this year a bride-to-be and her fiance were also publicly thrashed in the same city, after being found guilty of getting too close. Closeness is seen as a step towards pre-martial sex which is against Sharia Law and as a result the couple each received  lashes, in front of gathering crowds.  The punishments take place outside a mosque and draw huge crowds, many of whom take pictures. Meanwhile, in Malaysia, two women aged  and  were caned for having lesbian sex in a car. The women were sentenced to six lashings each and a fine of pound despite a global outcry from activists who say the sentence has no place in any civilised society.

Training has been really good and I thinkyou asked any of the boys in the changing-room we’d all be the same.“It’s really gone up a level, we’re all enjoying it and I think that shows on a Saturday.“It’s been quite tough but I think we needed that. It’s been enjoyable at the same time, though, and we’re all buying into his ideas.”Off the field there seems to be an air of optimism around Tannadice but Booth knows getting results on the pitch is the only way to realise their hopes of promotion.And that means keeping their unbeaten run under the new boss going against a Dunfermline side that have already bagged a deserved win over the Tangerines.Booth added: “Four points from the first two games isn’t too bad but I think they were two good performances as well.“We feel hard done by we didn’t get the win over Inverness – I think most people there would agree with that but it wasn’t to be.“At least we put in a really positive performance and everyone is pulling in the same direction.“There is a good feel about the place and, hopefully, we can kick on now and go on a little run.“The players, coaching staff, fans all seem to be pulling in the same direction especially since the new gaffer has come in.“A thousand fans down at Partick, great backing and then same again last weekend.

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

So many of our players have had really big matches for their clubs in the lead up to the international but they are done now and our total focus is on Ireland this Saturday.#The spine of the squad is from Newtonmore and that should not be any surprise given they have just won the treble.#There are a few Argyll representatives aside from the team captain. Irvine#s Kyles team-mate Roddy MacDonald has also been selected and there are places for Oban Camanachd duo Lorne Dickie and Andrew MacCuish.The Scottish mantra in recent games has been to keep the ball on the ground and to use the wide open spaces to stretch the Irish defence and not allow the hurlers to build up a head of steam with their aerial game.Caberfeidh’s dead-ball expert Kevin Bartlett will again be key and he scored twelve of Scotland’s eighteen points a year ago.There are no rule changes as such this year but there will be an Irish referee, John Keane, which brings its own dimension.Garry Reid added: #The interpretation of the rules will be key. In general, Irish referees tend to let more go and there may be more of a tendency to get away with hands on the back and perhaps more pulling and shoving.#We’ll just need to be careful and concentrate on our game. However there’s no doubt this will make for a fast pace as it will let the game flow and that’s important for the international to remain a spectacle for the supporters.#Scotland squad:Stuart MacDonald Glen MacKintosh The match, which starts at pm, will not be broadcast live this year but the match will be shown in full on BBC ALBA from pm on Saturday October ."},{"url":null,"title":"aray take honours in sporting start to dunoon mod","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowThere is more to the Mòd than music and drams, and this year#s Royal National Mòd in Dunoon was launched with a festival of sport.Scotland’s biggest Gaelic cultural festival traditionally features shinty, and this year it was Inveraray and Col Glen adult teams contesting the Mòd Cup on Saturday October .A close and hard-fought contest  at Dunoon Stadium in wet conditions resulted in victory for Inveraray, who overcame the Glen  #  after a strong second half performance.Up at the Dunoon Grammar School all-weather pitches there was also a nine-aside women’s shinty match between Oban Lorn and Cowal Ladies, with the Oban team coming out on top -.The Mòd played host to the first ever Primary Schools’ Mòd Shinty Tournament, introduced to celebrate Scotland’s Year of Young People, in which Inveraray again came out on top, beating Kyles and Strachur by a goal to nil.In the Mòd Football Cup, Glasgow Islands came through with a  - win over local team Dunoon Amateurs, which even involved the Glasgow goalkeeper getting on the scoresheet.Chief Executive of An Comunn Gàidhealach, John Morrison, said: #We’ve had a great first weekend at the  Royal National Mòd in Dunoon.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13470760.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_AMP_SDR_150718_TRUMP0013JPG.jpg","title":"ayrshire dad who blocked president","story":"NewsDaft dad in the dock after blocking Donald Trumps motorcade while he popped into the Co-op for milkPeter Goudie was stunned to be confronted with armed cops when he came out of the Maybole supermarket with his shopping.ShareByStephen Houston:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsPeter Goudie came face-to-face with armed cops when he held up the Trump motorcade when he popped into the Co-op for milk \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHe had dashed out to buy some milk from the Co-op.

By the time he’d come out of the shop with his shopping, police were taking no chances and had removed his car from Maybole High Street. And Peter Goudie, , came face to face with officers, including armed police, who were twitchy that his Volkswagen Golf was in the way.  Donald Trump had already touched down at Prestwick in Air Force One and his cavalcade was heading to Maybole, en route to a weekend of golf and talks at Turnberry. And the convoy of the most powerful president on earth wasn’t going to be impeded by a naughty parker. The astonishing tale unfolded at Ayr Justice of the Peace Court last week. Goudie’s lawyer Peter Lockhart just managed to keep his client on the road, and he left with eight penalty points on his driving licence and a pound fine. Goudie, of The Loaning, Maybole, admitted stopping on a zig-zag line at a pelican crossing, having no insurance, taking his we’s car without permission and not having a full licence.  Depute fiscal Ed Sheeran told the Justice on the bench that at around pm on Friday, July  there was a major police operation on-going on the A. He said that it was part of a management plan due to the visit of the president of the United States of America. The court was told that there was a large police presence in Maybole High Street and that they had noticed the grey Golf was stopped on the zig-zags. They found Goudie inside the shop and the offences unfolded.  Mr Lockhart told the court Goudie’s we was out and he had decided to pop down to the Co-op to get some milk. The solictior added: “My client had not noticed the high police presence. “He was alarmed when he was approached by the police in the shop and even more alarmed when he came out and saw more police, including armed police in the vicinity.” Mr Lockhart explained that it had been a costly exercise as the police had removed and impounded his car. He added: “His we was furious when she found out as it cost pound to get the car back the following day. “He was in the dog house for his stupidity.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnEd SheeranVolkswagenJusticePrestwickDonald TrumpAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"ayrshire vets reveal cases sedated","story":"NewsAyrshire vets reveal cases of \"sedated\" and \"drowsy\" dogs on our beachesWidespread reports of dogs falling ill have sparked panic among pet owners in the region.ShareByPippa Smith:,  OCT NewsAyr beach \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailVets have been inundated with sick dogs on Ayrshires coastline, the Post can reveal.

first two children has also been attacked.And the Tory list MSPs attempt to justy the two-child cap this week was met with anger and disbelief.Ms Ballantyne told Holyrood: \"The two-child limit is about fairness.\"It is fair that people on benefit cannot have as many children as they like while people who work and pay their way and dont claim benefits have to make decisions about the number of children they can have.\"Universal Credit may have its flaws, but the thinking behind the system is sound.\"It is about making it better to be in work than not to be in work.\"MSPs were debating

The rampant home side completely outplayed the visitors who looked out of sorts and overwhelmed by the occasion.For those who witnessed the second half, what followed was one of the finest and most unlikely comebacks they will ever experience.Claremont blitzed the unsuspecting Pupils from the outset, scoring in their first attack of the match.Before a breath was drawn, a surging run and cross by Claremont’s tall centre-forward was promptly dispatched into the back of the net at the back post.It was a case of backs to the wall for the visitors who, after a number of close shaves, found themselves two behind midway through the first half.This time the damage was self-inflicted, when an innocuous cross from the left was palmed into the path of the incoming striker who scored with ease from close range.The alarm bells now ringing loudly, with  minutes of the half remaining the visitors somehow conjured a goal against the run of play.A breakout by Ryan Deans ended with a fine pass to set up Sary Rhama, whose pace and parting shot almost took the net away.The home side, however, were unrelenting in their efforts and deservedly restored a two-goal cushion with a goal just before the break.A reading of the riot act at half time appeared to have the desired effect as, after a number of changes, both positional and to personnel, the second period produced a whole new ball game.Leading the line from the front, the introduction of Cameron Wylie was the key to the comeback, his unrelenting efforts to close space soon rewarded as his team responded in kind.A quick interchange of passes between Deans and Grumoli brought its reward, leaving the latter free to curl a wonderful shot into the top corner of the net. The comeback was on.Liam Renton joined the act in the th minute of a strange match after a headed clearance met with a flush volley as a superbly struck shot thundered into the net for the equaliser.There was time aplenty for the Pupils to shoot themselves in the foot again, and Claremont regained the initiative when Fraser Wylie mistimed a clearance to send the ball into his own net.At the opposite end – possibly goal of the match.Astothe gesture, a deep free kick from Renton produced another equaliser, the home defence’s attempted clearance rebounding off a fellow team mate and into the net.So came the final moments of the game, with Cameron Wylie again involved.A crunching challenge on Wylie seemed to be an obvious free kick, but the referee waved play on.Gary Grumoli sent an inch perfect pass to the back post, for Ross Brown to score his first team goal and the Pupils# eventual, but by now, deserved winner.In a clf-hanging finish to a game that had everything, Alastair Ferguson produced a wonderful one-handed save to deflect a perfectly struck free kick to safety.Campbeltown Pupils are at home tomorrow with a pm kick off against second-placed Neilston.See posters and social media for further information.A previous celebration for Gary Grumoli and Liam Renton two stars of Saturday#s match. _cpupils_celebration"},{"url":null,"title":"letter perfect bus service","story":"Last week I went to Glasgow, travelling on the .am bus and arrived only  minutes behind schedule despite the Rest and Be Thankful road closure.I was very impressed with West Coast Motors# handling of the situation which must cause transport companies huge logistical problems.Margaret Mathieson,Campbeltown."},{"url":null,"title":"seniors sway at tea dance soiree","story":"Senior citizens and friends were serenaded at the last tea dance of the year.Singer Robert McCallum#s golden oldies got almost everyone dancing at Saturday#s event in Campbeltown#s Lodge St John’s No .At the event organised by the Monday Social Club, guests were also treated to traditional tunes courtesy of Carradale#s Alex MacKinnon and his accordion.It wasn#t just seniors who enjoyed the afternoon, as ten-year-old Hannah Conley, who attended with her granny, Isabel, who turned  on Tuesday, was rarely off the dance floor.The icing on the cake was the copious amounts of home-baking and tea and coffee on offer, making sure everyone who danced the afternoon away remained hydrated.The event raised £ for Monday Social Club funds.For more photographs, see next week#s Courier.Ten-year-old Hannah Conley, right, danced the afternoon away with her granny#s friend Anna Viola. _cteadance"},{"url":null,"title":"young footballers learn lifesaving first aid","story":"CDJFA groups have been learning basic first aid skills, from paramedic Lorne McArthur, which could help treat sports injuries.The youngster#s training included cleaning and bandaging up wounds, supporting broken bones, dealing with concussion and some CPR and  children in total took advantage of this opportunity.Imogen Todd practices resuscitation watched by other young players.

The remains of the castle are ancient and the oldest part is called Goblin Ha. It is partly underground, and its name means Goblin Hall.According to legend, a wizard named Hugh de Gford made a deal with the Devil nearly  years ago, and inan army of goblins swarmed up from hell and built Yester Castle for him. Goblin Ha is the part of the castle dating from that time and thatrsquos how it got its name.It is said goblins lurk in the shadows of the ruins, and especially in Goblin Ha itself. At sunset, when night falls, they come out of their hiding places and crawl about in the darkness.One autumn day quite recently a dad decided to take his two children on a trip to find Yester Castle. He worked long hours during the week so he kept weekends for his children.His daughter Suzie had just turned  and his son Jake was eight. Jake was mad about Harry Potter and wizards, and when he discovered there was a castle nearby made by goblins for a wizard he begged his dad to take him. Suzie was given the choice to stay at home with her mum, but at the last minute she decided to come.It was sunny when they set off. ldquoA perfect day to explore a castle made by goblins, said the dad jokingly. They parked at the golf course and walked towards the woods.ldquoMaybe the goblins play golf, Suzie joked to her wee brother.ldquoYou shouldnrsquot make fun, they might hear you, he said.They finally reached the edge of the wood and peered into it. Suzie found the bridge over the ravine that led to the ruins but then Jake ran ahead very excited, looking for goblins.It was dficult to imagine what the castle had originally looked like because it was so ruined. Jake said it reminded him of the ancient ruined temple in The Jungle Book movie. But one thing was for sure: it had an eerie atmosphere. As they explored, the dad walked under an archway and suddenly felt a shiver down his spine. He turned round and saw something move in the shadows.For a moment they stood absolutely still. Then a bird flew out, giving them a fright. The dad and Suzie burst into laughter.ldquoJust a stupid bird! said Jake, disappointed.After a careful search they found the entrance to Goblin Ha. It was a small entrance leading to a low, dark passageway. Jake bravely led the way, with his sister and dad close behind.A cold and damp atmosphere hit them as soon as they entered the chamber. Although it was dark, two windows above gave just enough light to see.ldquoSo all this was supposed to have been made by goblins  asked Suzie.ldquoYeah, said Jake, who was still getting over the excitement that he was actually in Goblin Ha, ldquoand they came from hell up that stairway. He pointed to the dark steps in the corner.All three stood peering into the dark stairway which plunged deep into the ground.ldquoAccording to the legend, this stairway was made by the Devil after he had done a deal with the wizard and it leads to hell. But itrsquos blocked up now, explained Jake. He looked at his father: ldquoCan we go down dad, please!ldquoSeems a bit dangerous to me son.ldquoAw, come on dad, said Suzie, ldquowe canrsquot come all this way and then not go down the stairway to hell.ldquoVery well, but Irsquoll go first and wersquoll use the torches on our phones, said the dad.Slowly they began to climb down the stairs. The light from their mobiles lit up the old walls and ancient worn steps as they descended. Suzie took photos in the darkness, although the flash wasnrsquot powerful enough to light up everything.Eventually they reached a point where great stones blocked the way so they couldnrsquot go any further. ldquoThey were put there to keep out the goblins, said Jake. His sister was now feeling a bit uneasy: ldquoCan we go now, dad  Itrsquos too spooky down here.ldquoScared of the goblins are we  her wee brother mocked.ldquoYes, letrsquos go back up, said the dad. Jake led the way up to Goblin Ha. ldquoItrsquos time we should be going, wersquove found the place so mission accomplished. Itrsquoll be dark soon, letrsquos go now while therersquos still good day light.So they left the ruins and walked back across the golf course, laughing and talking and admiring the beginnings of a sunset and a full moon in the darkening sky. They were at the car when Suzie realised she didnrsquot have her mobile phone.ldquoIt was in my back pocket, it mustrsquove fallen out, she insisted.ldquoAw no Suzie, it could be anywhere, her dad said, annoyed.ldquoDad, we have to go back to get it, please. I know I had it in Goblin Ha, it might have even fallen out there. The dad wasnrsquot happy but the mobile was expensive and so reluctantly he agreed.They retraced their steps all the way back to the castle. It had only been  minutes since they had left the ruins but the atmosphere in the dim twilight was very dferent.Finally they reached the entrance to Goblin Ha.ldquoYou go first, dad, said both children at the same time.And so the dad put on his torch and entered. His children followed close behind.When they emerged into Goblin Ha it was dark so the dad shone his torch on the ground, searching. ldquoWhere could you have left it  he asked Suzie.ldquoAnywhere, she replied, shrugging her shoulders.They couldnrsquot phone it as there was no reception, so they kept searching.It was Jake who heard it first: a faint sound coming from the dark stairway. He lted his head and looked in its direction but it was too dark to see anything. There it was again, it sounded like breathing.Jake froze in real terror. ldquoDadhellip he whispered, ldquodad, therersquos something there.ldquoStop it you wee bam, said his sister, ldquoyoursquore just trying to spook us. But then she heard it too. It was louder this time, a strange breathing sound. It was definitely coming from the stairway.Intrigued, the dad shone his light down the steps, although the mobilersquos torch wasnrsquot strong enough to completely light up the dark.Then suddenly a pair of red eyes appeared, staring back at him.The dad screamed, making his two children scream as well, and they instinctively ran for the exit. But it was dark and they couldnrsquot see the way.ldquoDad, for Godrsquos sake shine it over here, cried Suzie, now completely terried.The dad shone the torch and they ran through the passageway in a total panic. Once outside there was more light, from the full moon.ldquoWhy did you scream, you scared the hell out of me! Suzie shouted angrily at her dad.ldquoIrsquom sorry Suzie, it just gave me a fright, I didnrsquot mean to scare you, he said.ldquoWhat gave you a fright, what did you see dad  asked Jake, who was now scared himself despite his earlier bravado.ldquoNot sure really, I thought I saw, erhellipldquoYes, yes what  asked Suzie stretching out her arms impatiently.The dad hesitated, then said: ldquoWell it looked like eyes.ldquoI am now officially freaked out, said Suzie, ldquoplease letrsquos just get out of here, never mind the sodding phone.ldquoIrsquom sure it was some kind of animal, maybe a fox or even an owl, said her dad, trying to reassure her, ldquobut yes itrsquos too dark now, we should go back to the car and maybe we can come back tomorrow in the light to look for your mobile.Jake was suddenly distracted. He saw something in the passageway.ldquoDadhellip dad, whatever it is, itrsquos coming after us, look!The shadow of some creature was in the passageway, moving towards them.Both Suzie and Jake were now in a state of complete terror and they ran.ldquoNo, no, itrsquos dangerous, therersquos a steep fall there, donrsquot run! called out the dad.The kids stopped just in time. In the moonlight they could see they were standing on the edge of a steep fall. Their dad caught up with them and took their hands. They walked together carefully with hearts racing through the trees towards the bridge that led to the golf course.Behind them, a dark shadow came out of the entrance and crawled into the wood.They were just past the arched wall when they saw the dark shadow move in front of them, blocking the way. The dad shone his torch directly at it, and for a split second he saw it before it vanished into the darkness. He looked shocked.ldquoWhat the hell was that, dad  shrieked Suzie.ldquoI honestly donrsquot know, he saidWhatever it was, it was still in the woods, moving in the darkness. Then it came towards them once again, this time making strange noises.Jake suddenly yelled out: ldquoOur father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come thy will be done, in heaven as it is on earthhellip Whatever it was made a sound like a scream and retreated back into the dark wood towards Goblin Ha. Jake continued the prayer and finished with a loud ldquoamen.ldquoLetrsquos get out of here, said the dad. All three ran in the moonlight out of the shadows of the wood onto the golf course. They kept running until they reached the car park, legs aching and completely breathless.The dad fumbled for his keys while the children stared at the golf course, looking for a moving shadow.Finally the dad found his keys and they were in the car and away as fast as possible.Suzie was the first to speak: ldquoI ask again, what was it ldquoI think the dark was playing tricks on us, said her dad, ldquoit was an animal of some sort.ldquoBut what about that horrible scream  she asked.ldquoFoxes can make a strange screeching noise at night, Suzie, thatrsquos what I think it was, said her dad, trying to reassure her.ldquoIt was a goblin, wasnrsquot it dad  asked Jake.ldquoAye right, replied his sister sarcastically, ldquoyou read too much Harry Potter. And what was all that praying about  That was just weird.ldquoIt was a redcap goblin, said Jake, ldquoyou canrsquot outrun them and the Lordrsquos Prayer is the only thing that will stop them. I had memorised it before our visit, just in case.ldquoHowrsquod you know that  asked SuzieldquoI read about it, said Jake.Suzie was just about to say something when her dad winked at her and interrupted: ldquoWellit was a redcap then the prayer seemed to work. He hoped this would stop them arguing. And it did. Jake smiled and put on his earphones.ldquoIrsquom sure it was a fox, whispered the dad to his daughter, ldquoor maybe a big rat, but just let Jake think it was a goblin.They got home with a story to tell their mum!In a quiet moment, when the children were busy, she asked the dad: ldquoSo what was it you saw He hesitated to answer the question, ashe wouldnrsquot be believed.ldquoTo be honest, I donrsquot know, he said. ldquoI told the kids it was a fox because I didnrsquot want to spook them, but I really canrsquot say.Who knows the truth of it all  If Suziersquos phone is ever found, the photos she took in the dark stairway might reveal what was really hiding in the darkness on that day."},{"url":null,"title":"be-prepared-for-next-beast-from-the-east-says-council-emergency-planner","story":"Severe weather is the biggest risk to people living in East Lothian, according to Sandy Baptie.And he has issued advice ahead of a one-day workshop to help communities prepare for any future emergencies.It includes going back to old-fashioned handsets in a time when more people rely on mobile phones.Mr Baptie, East Lothian Councilrsquos emergency planning, risk and resilience manager, has been visiting community councils and groups in the wake of the lsquoBeast from the Eastrsquo snowstorm, which brought much of the country to a standstill in February and March this year.Heavy snowfalls and strong winds caused chaos on the roads and left many people stranded in their homes.It also saw a surge in community spirit, with tales of people helping neighbours and looking after the more vulnerable people.Now Mr Baptie is hoping that spirit will help all communities prepare a Community Resilience Plan which they can use in case another severe weather front hits the county.And he has issued some advice for people to prepare in their own home for what could happen.He said: ldquoSevere weather is the biggest risk to East Lothian.ldquoBeing prepared for it is important and people can do things themselves, such as keeping an old-fashioned phone in their house in case mobile signal is lost, having a torch to hand in case power goes.ldquoIt is also important to stock up on food when warnings that severe weather is on its way are issued.More than  people are expected to attend the community resilience workshop at The Brunton, Musselburgh, on Saturday.The one-day event, which is being funded by EDF Energy and the Scottish Government, will bring together representatives from community councils, groups and schools.Advice on a range of aspects of drawing up community resilience plans will be available, including ensuring groups who take on responsibility are covered by insurance.It will also inform people of services they can sign up to with energy companies to ensure they receive a phone callpower goes out.North Berwick Community Council, which already has a plan and implemented it successfully during the Beast from the East, will be there to talk about how they did it and what worked.Mr Baptie hopes the event will result in community plans from across the county, with each one appointing a Single Person of Contact or SPOC.He said: ldquoThe idea of a SPOC is that there is one point of contact between each community and the council so we can get information to them and they can let us know what is happening, for examplepower has gone out in one area.ldquoThe plans are about drawing up lists of vulnerable people in the community, finding out who has a x and can get medicine to people or take them to hospital or the doctor.ldquoIt is about being prepared.

This is a very concerning piece of news, especially given the fact that the Tesco bus also serves the health centre.ldquoIt comes at a time when we are being told that we need to use public transport more because of dire warnings about the impact of climate change and when massive house building will lead to gridlock unless newcomers can be persuaded onto buses.Mr Turner added: ldquoEast Lothian generally, and Musselburgh in particular, is now renowned for its excellent bus services so this announcement comes as a blow and runs counter to all that has been achieved on the public transport front in the last few of years.ldquoLetrsquos hope that the council, working with the operators, can come up with a proposal to replace the extremely useful Tesco bus, and in doing so letrsquos try to serve some places that are currently remote from buses ndash Edenhall Road and the Muckletts, for example, both had buses until a few years ago and theirwould, I am sure, be welcomed by elderly residents.ldquoI think the Tesco bus should be replaced by something very similar, perhaps marketed as the Musselburgh community bus. It should not just parallel other bus routes, which is what the Tesco bus does, but should serve some of the residential areas that are cut off from buses.

They are particularly concerned over secretive buy-ups of the nationrsquos cotton industry, with its record of slavery and environmental damage.Cotton workers in UzbekistanConcerns over both bribery in Latin America and opaque investments in the former Soviet Union prompted Britainrsquos big business lobby to issue a warning about SLPs.Tracy Black, Scotland director of the CBI, said: ldquoThese reports are concerning because they pose a risk to the hard-won reputation of Scottish business.ldquoWe want Scottish firms to feel confident about pitching for international projects and exporting to global markets.ldquoThis comes at a time when business is working tirelessly in partnership with the government to attract top talent and much needed investment.Over the last three years The Herald and former Sunday Herald have published scores of stories about the abuse of SLPs.

But there is also a fake Douglas, a counterfeit  Main Street, one that only exists online: the HQ, among other things, of a global corporation with offices in New York, Los Angeles, Tokyo, Copenhagen and beyond.This particular make-believe version of the draperrsquos shop has a two-storey glass and steel atrium, huge open-planned rooms and an army of hipster staff in designer glasses.It is, at least according to its own website, the Londonoffice of Falcon Business Services, an international ldquocreative advertising agency working for blue-chip clients like Starbucks, HM, Boeing, Cisco and even disgraced mogul Harvey Weinsteinrsquos now bankrupt movie-making concern.Falconrsquos internet offering may look slick ndashauthentic, it would be by far the biggest and most successful business in Scotlandrsquos under-pressure advertising sector ndash but the sitersquos gobbledygook English gives its fakery away.ldquoWe appreciate every culture, we are consist from many dferent culture from many country around the worlds, the agency boasts on its site about its ldquoLondon HQ in Douglas. ldquoThis place very big and cozy, this is our main office consist of large amount of employee across the world.How Falcon portrays its HQ, screen grab of its websiteBack at the real  Main Street, Lilli Clark bursts out laughing when she hears how Falcon describes her surroundings. Clark, with friend Sally Kerr, runs a small book-keeping practice at the old shop, including a ldquovirtual office where a Falcon Business Services is, indeed, registered.The pair find themselves on the edge of the surreal world of Scotlandrsquos notorious ldquotax haven firms: of ghost companies of here-today, gone-tomorrow anonymously owned corporate entities. That is because their address is the registered HQ of thousands of businesses, many created as global criminals exploit Britainrsquos lax and barely policed corporate transparency laws.Most are Scottish limited partnerships or SLPs, a kind of shell firm which anti-corruption campaign Transparency International describes as ldquoa vehicle of choice for money-laundering.Falcon is an SLP. There is no way of knowing who owns the business, how much money it turns over or evenit has anything to do with the website in its name.This, for Clark, is not funny. Because it means her address does not just feature on shlocky websites: it also stars in some of the worldrsquos biggest crime stories.Two years ago The Herald revealed ldquonumber  was the official home of firms at the centre of a major Ukrainian investigation in to allegedly corrupt side-payments on an arms export to the Middle East. Since then Douglas shell firms have rarely been out of the news.Clark stresses she knows nothing about any of the firms using her address. ldquoWe have no control over them whatsoever, she explains. ldquoWe want to get rid of them but we canrsquot.She sighs as she hears the latest on Douglas SLPs. That is because they number among a series of UK shell firms ndash with no identiable real world connection to Britain ndash which The Herald on Sunday has identied as being behind supposedly multi-million-dollar investments in the tyrannical Central Asian state of Uzbekistan.Just one SLP, called Quality Trade Supplies or QTS, is building a steel mill in the Uzbek capital, Tashkent, for just over  million euros. This ldquoBritish investment was announced by Uzbekistanrsquos president, Shavkat Mirziyoyev, with an official visit to its -hectare site, which, unlike Falconrsquos global HQ, is very real.Presidential press releaseTwo decades after the closure of Ravenscraig, a Scottish company is again investing in steel, albeit overseas. Or is it The Herald on Sunday has made multiple attempts to contact QTS, whose website says it has a representative office in Kazakhstan, as well as its official home at  Main Street, Douglas. We wanted to ask QTS who its owner was. The firm has failed to comply with new UK rules under which last year it should have named any ultimate beneficiary or PSC ndash a ldquoperson of signicant control.The firmrsquos website says the Tashkent Metallurgical Plant is a ldquostate project ndash while the state itself says it is a QTS project. The stated investment is one of the biggest carried out by a Scottish enterprise overseas in recent years.QTS on its site also said it was also building a km railway line with  stops across Kazakhstan, part of a major drive to improve transport links between China and Europe. That job, it said, would involve  construction workers. Again, this would be a nearly unprecedented venture for a Scottish firm.Uzbeks also have questions about who owns QTS. One prominent former Soviet oligarch has been named locally as being behind the firm. A London public relations firm acting on his behalf has denied any connection.Mirziyoyev has also given his official blessing ndash and visit ndash to another major ldquoBritish investment from a Douglas firm, a m cement factory in the underdeveloped western Uzbek region of Karakalpakstan.Shavkat MirziyoyevUzbekistanrsquos Ministry of Economy formally lists ldquoforeign investments in infrastructure or industry every year. These include a roll-call of SLPs with either opaque ownership or PSCs filed in the name of untraceable Uzbeks. At least five other Douglas SLPs are named in press reports or official bulletins as recent investors. None have transparent ownership or any real-world links to Lanarkshire.Uzbek authorities have also named a series of English and Welsh shell firms, mostly limited liability partnerships or LLPs, as ldquoforeign investors.Take Fortalia Consult, a now struck-off LLP. It put up m for a .m factory making washing machines, fridges and cookers. The plant, partly funded by the state National Bank of Uzbekistan, employed hundreds. LLPs have to provide more information on Britainrsquos corporate registry, including accounts. Fortalia, in its last year of existence, , made an operating profit of pound on a turnover of just over pound,. A company investing millions in a white appliances factory made a profit of under a tenner. It did, however, file a PSC. She was Uzbek.Official bulletins, government press releases and state-controlled media reports suggest SLPs and LLPs whose owners are either Uzbeks or unknown have made declared ldquoforeign direct investments of well over poundm in recent years.Other investments officially made by SLPs and LLPs are in real-world factories making everything from spinning equipment to probiotic dairy produce.One of the businesses investing in a major new business district, Tashkent City, is an Edinburgh SLP called Corso Solutions. Corso was created last year but has failed to comply with new rules under which it was supposed to say who its owner is. Fines for failure to comply are pound a day. None has ever been levied.TashkentHuman rights campaigners ndash Uzbek and international ndash have grave concerns about this. They want to know who is buying up chunks of the countryrsquos economy. They are especially concerned about equity and other investments in cotton, the nationrsquos biggest industry.Uzbekistan is currently reforming its cotton farms, which have a record of forced labour ndash slavery, effectively ndash and environmental abuses which have led to the near-disappearance of one of the worldrsquos biggest lakes, the Aral Sea. But reforms are only just beginning. They include partial privatisations that have seen SLPs and English shell firms buy stakes in both processing and picking enterprises.CottonTwo, Trontex of Stirling and Gratum Trading of Edinburgh, received import tax breaks under a Mirziyoyev decree. Both firms, like QTS, have filed at Companies House saying they have not yet attempted to identy a PSC.The Herald on Sunday has written to both Mirziyoyevrsquos press office in Tashkent and the Uzbek Embassy in London. We askedthe president knew who the beneficiaries of his tax breaks were. There was no reply. We also wrote askinghe was concerned that major ldquoforeign investors were failing to reveal who they were. Again, there was no reply.This worries Umida Niyazova. She is a journalist and campaigner who was jailed under Mirziyoyevrsquos predecessor, the authoritarian Islam Karimov. Now based in Berlin, she leads the Uzbek-German Forum for Human Rights .She says: ldquoThe cotton sector in Uzbekistan is entirely under the control of the state which sets the price of cotton and is the sole beneficiary of revenue from sales on the international market.\"Umida NiyazovaShe adds: ldquoUGF has been monitoring and reporting on state-organised forced labour in Uzbekistanrsquos cotton sector for over eight years. We can confirm that, despite some changes, mass mobilization of forced labour and extortion from organisations and employees to pay for cotton pickers is again ongoing during this yearrsquos cotton harvest, despite Mirziyoyevrsquos public commitments to eradicate it.ldquoFor decades, the production of cotton has been underpinned by a system ... in which Uzbekistanrsquos citizens are forcibly mobilised to pick cotton. This is a state-operated system of forced labour, in which the Uzbek government imposes regional cotton production quotas which are, in turn, allocated by regional officials to their sub-districts.ldquoRegional and district officials are responsible for meeting these quotas under threat of penalty.ldquoWe have observed a proleration of Uzbek entities registered as limited partnerships in Scotland and England, including a number of companies with direct ties to the cotton industry.ldquoWe are interested to know why these companies, in receipt of large swathes of foreign direct investment, want to register in Scotland. Why do these companies not disclose their ownership  Given that hundreds of millions of dollars in foreign direct investment are flowing into the country at this time, the UK government must ensure these companies are not a vehicle for money laundering.ldquoUzbekistanrsquos cotton sector has already disrupted the lives of millions. It would be criminalthey were to be robbed of revenue which should ultimately benefit the Uzbek people.Abandoned ships on the dried-out Aral SeaUzbek sources stress they have no evidence SLPs or LLPs investing in cotton or other industries are responsible for human rights abuses. Nor do they have evidence any nominally UK registered firms are fronts for government officials or others who wish to conceal their identities. They just want to know who is behind investment. They have reason to be concerned. SLPs have been widely abused where in the former Soviet Union, including as part of multi-billion-dollar schemes to launder money out of Russia, Ukraine and Azerbaijan.At last count, some  Uzbeks were named as the PSCs of SLPs. But multiple investigations reveal closer links. A nephew of former leader Islam Karimov in  was named as the effective controller of SLPs involved in a dispute over the ownership of hotels in Riga which culminated in an attempted gangland-style hit.Last year an international journalistic investigation alleged that Karimovrsquos youngest daughter, Lola, and her husband used three SLPs ndash two of which, Five Star Star Technology Support and Greenhall Management, are based in Douglas ndash as part of complex offshore scheme. None of the SLPs has named a PSC.Lola Karimova, from Getty ImagesMs Karimova is a multi-millionaire who last year launched her own fragrance at a party at the Cannes Film Festival attended by Juliette Binoche, Catherine Deneuve, Kristin Scott Thomas and Pamela Anderson.She denies detailed allegations of tax avoidance set out by journalists at a group called The Black Sea.This month Britainrsquos Serious Fraud Office announced it had begun a proceeds of crime investigation against Ms Karimovarsquos estranged elder sister, Gulnara, once touted as a replacement for her father.She is in prison near Tashkent on embezzlement charges, which she denies. British authorities are understood to be seeking to confiscate London properties linked to her and an associate. Swiss authorities have already seized some m in assets.Gulnara Karimova, from Getty ImagesMeanwhile, as The Herald revealed this year, The United Nations Development Programme has blacklisted five SLPs amid concerns over international aid fraud in Uzbekistan. The sanctions are against SLPs called Special Alliance Partnership, Investment Affairs, Trident Asia and Five Star Commercial Services.They are all registered either at  Main Street, or a flat in Edinburghrsquos Montgomery Street, number .The owners of this property, like Clark and Kerr, once ran a virtual office business. They too stress they have no control over the entities registered at what is their home. They also have tried and failed to get SLPs de-registered.Some SLPs have been transferred from Montgomery Street to Douglas. They include Tashkent steel mill builder QTS, whose website still has a map showing its Edinburgh HQ.Montgomery Street, EdinburghThe Montgomery Street flat has been the base for SLPs which played a key role in the -billion Russian Laundromat, one of the biggest and most elaborate money-laundering schemes ever uncovered.:A Baltic bank, a Belarussian bribe and a British embarrassmentNow government investigators in Argentina allege two SLPs using the address were used as part of one of the worldrsquos biggest bribery scandals.Earlier this year The Herald revealed the role played by Scottish shell firms in complex offshore structures used by a construction giant called Odebrecht to pay kickbacks to officials and politicians across Latin America and beyond. The so-called ldquomega scandal ndash nearly bn was paid out, Odebrecht admits ndash has rocked the western hemisphere and led to prosecutions against senior officials in multiple jurisdictions.A former president of Peru, who denies using an SLP based at a Glasgow law firm to take money infor a highway contract, is among those facing prosecution. A senior state oil official close to the outgoing president of Mexico also dismisses reports he took money from the construction firm through SLPs.In Argentina, government anti-corruption investigators have focused on a prominent entrepreneur called Jorge Rodriacuteguez, though he usually goes by the nickname ldquoCorcho, or ldquoCork.In a ldquobox office celebrity court case, Rodriacuteguez is accused of taking in bribes from Odebrecht, which was among companies bidding to build a metro line. He denies any wrongdoing.Corcho Rodriacuteguez, from YouTubeAn Argentinian government report suggests money was transferred the tax haven bank accounts of two SLPs to Uruguay.

If the SLPrsquos partners are offshore companies, then their ownership is completely opaque.ldquoThe great advantage of Britain as a place to register a company is that the company looks legitimate, because itrsquos British, but really is not. Our money-laundering regime is so lax, and Companies House doesnrsquot check the accuracy of any information supplied to it. This is why British structures are almost iniably found in the biggest financial scandals.The abuse of SLPs, Bullough stresses, is not a victimless crime. ldquoMore than a trillion dollars a year is stolen from the worldrsquos poorest countries, devastating their economies and spreading misery and destitution, he says. ldquoThat would not be possible without shell structures like SLPs, and itrsquos imperative the UK Government acts to reform them to they can no longer be misused in this way.A map of just some of the SLP scandals in recent yearsA spokesman for the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: \"The UK is leading the global fight against money laundering. \"Changes to the law last year have increased the transparency of these financial arrangements, reducing the likelihood of them being used for illegal purposes.ldquoWe carefully developed our recent reforms to further prevent these crimes without harming the legitimate businesses and pensions that invest through limited partnerships.Registrations of SLPs have fallen in the last year after new PSC reguilations were introduced and, crucially, banks in Latvia started refusing to handle their accounts.Comment: Alison Thewliss on why SLP reform cannot waitMore than three months have passed since the UK Government closed its consultation on the reform of limited partnerships, and despite calls for recommendations to be published, nothing has been forthcoming.Today we see yet more evidence linking limited partnerships to opprobrious behaviour abroad this time with regards cotton production in Uzbekistan.Agencies such as Amnesty International, and the Uzbek-German Forum for Human Rights, have gone to great s to expose the coercive and manipulative nature of this industry.Alison ThewlissThe purported involvement of financial vehicles registered in the UK ndash with little or no information offered on ultimate ownership ndash should be of serious concern to UK Government Ministers.Unfortunately, thatrsquos not likely to be the case as far as the UK Government is concerned.

They also called on the Scottish government to tackle the problem with action, not words.The \"paid by the minute\" scandal centres on the care industry where councils outsource care at home to private or charitable companies. Care staff are electronically monitored ndash clocking in and out of a clientrsquos home ndash using technology such as mobile phones or iPads.As an example,a carer has five jobs in an hour each lasting six minutes then they will be paid by the minute for a total of  minutes. If the worker is on the Scottish living wage ndash pound. an hour ndash this would see them earn approximately pound. for an hourrsquos work, or just under  pence per minute. Many are not paid for the time in between jobs, or for travel to and from jobs.Scottish Care, which represents private care providers, estimates that the practice of \"paying by the minute\" occurs in half of Scotlandrsquos  council areas. An estimated  per cent ndash or  people ndash of the private care workforce, which stands at ,, are on zero-hours contracts, where most of the \"paid by the minute\" work is found. However, the numbers on ZHCs rises to - per cent in the sector of \"older peoplersquos care\".Care providers and carers are also penalisedworkers stay over the allotted time per visit, in the event of a client being ill or distressed.Scottish Care said: ldquoOver the last few years Scottish Care has continually argued for improvements to conditions which make employment in the care sector precarious for too many iniduals. One of these is the call to offer properly funded contracts to providers to enable them to reduce dependency on zero-hour contracts ... While admittedly some staff desire the flexibility that such contracts provide them with, from our research the vast majority of providers wish to move to a situation where adequate funding makes full-time contracts for the care workforce a possibility.ldquoThe main reason for the existence of zero-hours contracts is the discriminatory practice around the way in which care is bought from charitable and private providers by the public authorities. A local authority only pays for the work which is done rather than what may be intended. This makes it impossible to guarantee hours for many, especially smaller care providers.\"Scottish Care believes that we need to radically change the way we commission and buy care services ... At the moment many, especially smaller organisations, are effectively paid by the minute and therefore by extension unless the provider has its own reserves and assets the worker is paid by the minute. This is no way to deliver care in the st century.ldquoWe are faced with a scenario where workers are pressurised to get tasks done in as quick a time as possible and are penalisedthey are late for their next client. For the person receiving the care this makes the whole experience less than dignied despite the best efforts of inidual care workers ... This is especially unacceptable when we are talking about supporting people with palliative and end-of-le care.Dr Donald Macaskill, chief executive of Scottish Care, said: \"There is something very wrong about a local authority treating its own staff fairly and well and yet treating the staff of services they buy in, whether they are employed by a charity or private care provider, in a manner which is little less than exploitative. Workers are made to clock in and clock out and their organisations are only being paid by the minute, and even thena worker is late or stays longer because someone needs more help or is ill they are being penalised.ldquoThese electronic call monitoring systems are treating care staff asthey cannot be trusted. They do not give dignity or value to a critical workforce. If we ever want to create a fair system of work we need a fair system for commissioning care.\"We have a massive challenge to attract people to do the fundamentally important job of care. People are being put off because of unfair conditions imposed by local authorities upon care organisations. How can we expect human-rights-based care in Scotland when we have created a system which denies the basic rights to the care worker and their employer \"Jim McCourt, one of Scotlandrsquos most prominent trade unionists who runs the Inverclyde Advice and Employment Rights Centre in Greenock, brought the issue of care workers being paid by the minute to the attention of The Herald on Sunday.\"Itrsquos the ultimate in the gig economy,\" says McCourt. He blamed the issue on care providers bidding against each other for council contracts and creating ldquoa race to the bottom in the market. ldquoThey bid with prices they canrsquot meet and it is their workers who suffer,\" he said.\"These private care companies are funded by the public purse as they are contracted by councils ndash so our tax pounds are propping up this system,\" said McCourt, adding: \"This is about looking after the most vulnerable people in society. We are looking at a value set here ndashpeople think there is money to be made in this way out of caring for the sick and elderly then there is something very wrong, especiallythe public purse is being used.\"One of Scotlandrsquos most senior care officials, who wished to speak anonymously, described the practice as \"hypocritical and obscene\".\"To impose penalties because a care worker has stayed longer than was thought necessary with a client who is distressed or unwell is the very antithesis of what the care profession is about. We donrsquot treat nurses like. This is the worst type of precarious employment. The current system needs to end.A spokesperson for Cosla, the Scottish council umbrella organisation, said: ldquoCouncils work closely with the providers in their area to deliver and commission social care services.

Suppliers were also paid cash in hand.ldquoOne week we were all paid cash in hand and told that tax was still being paid for us ndash but how did we know that was true  Sandra said. ldquoMost of my pay slips also had the wrong tax and national insurance information. Other staff who got pay slips found no tax had been taken off them even though they were earning over the threshold. I have no idea what on earth was going on when it came to the taxman.There were rodents in the food store ndash even though the venue has a prestigious reputation among diners. Staff were too scared to speak up about the problems all around them. ldquoThere were cases were people stood up to the bosses and they just didnrsquot get another sht. There were days when I was sick but came in and did a -hour sht as I was scared I would get no more work. Basically, the bosses were like greedy factory owners from the th century ndash they couldnrsquot get enough money and they didnrsquot care about staff.Sandra also spoke of bullying. On one occasion, staff had brought in their own food as they were working at a wedding reception all day. They left their lunches in bags in the staff room. A director tied the bags together and took bets on how long it would take hungry staff to get their food. ldquoThe impression you got is that we were not human in their eyes, says Sandra.Another member of staff describes her time at the restaurant as a ldquonightmare. She had no contract, her pay was late and she was given no payslip.ldquoThroughout my time there [the owners] consistently treated us like slaves, talked to us as though we were children and obviously considered us lesser human beings who didnrsquot deserve to be paid for the hard work we put in to keeping their business afloat.lsquoI have no idea how a waitress can be considered as self-employed, but I needed the workrsquoGwen Garret is  and now doing her masters degree in medieval history ndash but until recently she worked in one precarious job after another. ldquoThey were all terrible in their own way,rsquo she says. ldquoMost jobs were paying illegally with cash in hand. I would ask for pay slips and most refused.ldquoThere was a factory job ndash they paid with a pay slip. A cafe ndash that was cash in hand. A kebab place ndash that was cash in hand. A whisky bar ndash they paid with pay slips. A sushi place ndash they also refused to pay with a pay slip.Nerys, another masters student, also had a succession of precarious jobs ndash but her worst experience came when she worked for a social enterprise. Social enterprises are meant to help good causes ndash an example of a social enterprises doing what they are meant to do would be the Big Issue magazine which runs as a business but helps the homeless. Often, social enterprises get financial breaks and incentives from government.ldquoI have no idea how a waitress can be considered self-employed, but I needed the work, she said. ldquoThis was the most dodgy place I ever worked for. I also had all the down sides of a zero-hours contract ndash so I didnrsquot now how many hours I was getting or when I would get called on to work.Nerys said she worked for four months at the social enterprise and saw one person in all that time come to use the services for the disabled and elderly.The STUCrsquos Better Than Zero campaign is investigating this social enterprise and others.lsquoI ended up with anxiety ndash sitting in bed crying at nightrsquoBelinda was just  when she went to work as a waitress in a well-known Scottish restaurant. She experienced the usual zero-hours problems ndash random hours, unpaid overtime, tips not paid, split shts ndash and was also paid cash in hand. However, the schoolgirl was also touched inappropriately by a member of staff, and when she told her employer he said ldquojust stand up for yourself. No other action was taken.Kyle Scott also began working in hospitality aged just  and pulled pints in many bars around the Central Belt, where all of his employment was under a zero-hours contract. ldquoIt was always very dficult to get a day off as yoursquod be seen as a hindrance and the boss would just start cutting your shts. Irsquove seen people ask for a day off and just get told to get to f***, he said.He also spoke of sexual harassment of female staff by customers. ldquoYoung women would go to speak to the manager and be told lsquolook we need their revenue, they need to stay in the pubrsquo. So they arenrsquot kicked out. It happens widely across the hospitality industry.ldquoIf you are injured or sick or sexually harassed you say nothing as that could put you out of work ndash we basically have no rights. You drop everything do to what the boss says ndash asyou donrsquot, then you are scared you will never get a sht again.ldquoI ended up with an anxiety disorder ndash sitting in bed crying at night as I didnrsquot know what shts I was getting so I couldnrsquot plan my le. It was mentally and physically exhausting.Some weeks Kyle would work  hours, at other times he went without a sht for three weeks. ldquoYou have to suck up to the boss to get shts, and thatrsquos grim as you are put in direct competition with your peers and friends to see who gets the most shts.ldquoOne of my biggest memories is the number of people breaking down crying. Irsquod see that at least a few times a day as people were so mentally exhausted. We even had a joke that there was a lsquono crying in the glass washrsquo rule.Kyle is now working for Strathclyde student union after graduating and loves his new job in campaigns and policy. ldquoItrsquos a genuine breath of fresh air, he says, ldquoit is the first time I have ever been happy going to work. The contrast is from black to white.lsquoI want to make certain that other people donrsquot get stung like mersquoJosh Philliban had his taste of precarious employment in a pop-up food store ndash another sector heavily reliant on zero-hours contracts. He wasnrsquot paid a penny for a monthrsquos work, he says ndash and is still in dispute with his employer, who canrsquot be named for this reason.Josh says he worked nearly all of June and was owed almost pound. When he tried to get what he was owned, his employer hit him with allegations of theft, which Josh claims are lies. The row got uglier last week after the Herald on Sunday began trying to find out what had been going on.ldquoJosh said: lsquoI just want to make certain that other people donrsquot get stung like me.lsquoOur tax pounds are propping up this systemrsquoAmazon has courted more than a little controversy as an employer ndash and no-one knows more about what the giant gets up to than Jim McCourt, one of Scotlandrsquos most determined campaigners for employment rights, and the manager of Inverclyde Advice and Employment Rights Centre near Amazonrsquos Greenock plant.This is one of his busiest times of year as sub-contracted agency workers are drafted in to Amazon to work on the Christmas rush. ldquoThe worst and sharpest employment practices are bred in the sub-contract culture, McCourt says. ldquoThis is fundamental to how abuse and control takes place.Agency workers, says McCourt, are dismissed for the slightest infractions, such as too many toilet breaks orthey canrsquot make overtime. ldquoThey will get a phone call from the agency, McCourt says, ldquoand be told they are not required back. That terries the rest of the workforce.It also plunges people into poverty, says McCourt ndash as many agency workers were unemployed before entering the gig economy anddismissed will have to endure the wait for their benefits to be reinstated. Many have been sent by job centres to agencies and told to take the job the agencies offer them or risk being sanctioned.Amazon ndash which has around , UK workers and recognises no trade union ndash announced this month that it was raising wages for its staff employees. The move was hailed as a positive step forward by a company which has been under fire over employment practices for years. The Scottish Government had been criticised for giving Amazon pound.m in taxpayer money.Last month, though, new rules were announced that there would be no state handouts in Scotland for firms which did not pay the living wage. Shortly afterwards, Amazon announced it would raise wages for employees. What went pretty much unnoticed though was that Amazon simultaneously decided to phase out its bonus and stock award programmes for hourly workers.ldquoWhat that all amounts to, says McCourt, ldquois no benefit to the workers. Staff are furious but not surprised.In separate investigations, McCourt has also come across an increasing number of employers using absence management policies which seem designed to sack staff who have been off sick. ldquoThere is a growing occupational health industry which works hand-in-hand with employers to get staff dismissed, he said, citing cases where employers ignored details of sickness provided by GPs and consultants, but instead relied on assessments from private occupational health advisors which results in dismissal. ldquoThis is the world we live in, says McCourt.He has also uncovered a new scandal in the gig economy ndash workers being paid literally by the minute in the private care sector.As the care sector becomes increasingly privatised, companies are being hired by councils to provide care to the sick and elderly in their homes. Many care staff are on zero-hours contracts ndash but thousands are also paid by the minute.ldquoItrsquos the ultimate in the gig economy, says McCourt. ldquoCompanies bid against each other for a contract and it is a race to the bottom. They bid with prices they canrsquot meet and it is their workers who suffer.An example of a care worker paid by the minute would be as follows: a care worker has five jobs in an hour ndash going to the homes of clients to help with their personal needs and medication ndash each job takes six minutes, meaning the carer is viewed as having worked  minutes in an hour.ldquoThese private care companies are funded by the public purse, says McCourt, ldquoas they are contracted by councils ndash so our tax pounds are propping up this system. There is a big dference here to other employment practices as we are not talking about stacking CDs in a warehouse ndash this is about looking after the most vulnerable people in society.ldquoWe are looking at a value set here ndashpeople think there is money to be made in this way out of caring for the sick and elderly then there is something very wrong, especiallythe public purse is being used.Background: Workers are stepping back in time to darker ageA BROWSE through the files of Better Than Zero is like stepping into a time machine and travelling back to the days of the dark satanic mills of the Industrial Revolution.Itrsquos a litany of employees begging their boss for work, staff having to pander to management in order to secure shts, of bullying, harassment, humiliation, low wages, people living hand to mouth, and the steady erosion of pride and dignity. There are examples of female staff who have asked to change shts being texted by their male manager saying: \"My we is out tonight, why donrsquot you come round and then I will change your sht.\"\"The work is sold to the employee as flexible,\" says Sarah Collins of BTZ, \"but there is no flexibility for the worker.\" Staff are expected to take what shts are offered to them, regardless of how few or how many the hours are ndashthey cause a fuss and stand up for themselves itrsquos unlikely they will get any more work. \"All the control is with the employer,\" Collins adds.One of the latest issues within precarious employment is the rise of questionable practices within a small minority of social enterprise firms ndash companies meant to be doing a social good and often in receipt of financial support from the public purse. Some social enterprises are hiring staff on zero hours contracts ldquothen quickly sacking or dismissing themthey raise any concerns. BTZ spoke of firms claiming to be involved in sustainable transport initiatives pressurising and bullying staff on zero hour contracts, or paying cash in hand. There are reports of similar behaviour by social enterprise companies refurbishing kitchen goods or furniture for the poor and elderly to buy at cheap rates.\"On the surface they look great, and there are plenty of social enterprises doing great work but the model has been perverted by a few for bad reasons,\" BTZ said.\"Bogus self-employment\" is another new problem ndash it crossed over from the gig economy where some food delivery drivers were hired on a self-employed basis and is now in many sectors. The organisation cites the case of a beautician in a nail bar who was taken on as self-employed but was told by management when to come in, when to go home, and how much to charge.\"They are not self-employed at all,\" says BTZ. \"It is just a cost saving exercise as the employer is not paying tax, national insurance, sick pay, holiday pay, or pension contributions. There is a big issue here of the exchequer potentially missing out on huge amounts of tax.Self-employment has massively increased since the financial crash of . The largest increase is among women in the following three occupations: cleaners, child minders and hairdressers. Most people drt in and out of self-employment as they look for more stable, less precarious jobs.\"The Scottish Government is projecting Scotland as a wonderful place to visit, but who is checking on the labour conditions of the people in the tourism industry,\" BTZ says.At the core of the problems with zero hours contracts, in particular, is the bullying it seems to enable in the worst managers ndash staff who want to work as many hours as possible are unlikely to defend themselvestreated badly by their boss. Precarious employment also affects young workers in their late teens and early s more than other age groups.\"Bullying is everywhere,\" says BTZ. \"This leads to burn out, mental health problems...unemployment may be at an all time low but the human cost is Dickensian. Couple all this with the housing situation and you see that precarious work leads to precarious lives. If you donrsquot have a steady income and are just bumping from job to job and house to house, every aspect of your le is affected.\"If you are on zero hours you arenrsquot going to get a mortgage, and yoursquoll need a guarantor for private rented accommodation. Thatrsquos why sofa surfacing is on the rise, why people who previously lived independently are moving back home to their parents. It makes people vulnerable not just to loan sharking but even sex for rent. It all knits together. This is what young people have come to expect in Scotland in .Insecure work can also mean in-work poverty as well. Two parents in insecure employment can actually be worse off financially than a family on benefits.Precarious employment has a corrosive effect, with zero hour contracts now even affecting university lecturers it is little wonder, BTZ believes, that young people are leaving school with a jaded view of the world of work and the opportunities on offer to them.\"The most depressing thing is that young people think this is the norm,\" said Sarah Collins. \"They know what is happening is not right, but they donrsquot have any expectation of any other type of work.\"Better Than Zero said: \"It is all well and good saying we want a fair work society, a fair work economy, but on the frontline it is almost laughable how far these claims and aspirations are from the way that huge numbers of people make a living.\"BTZ said that the impact on mental health of precarious employment was a growing problem. Disabled workers are often the most vulnerable to exploitation too. If a disabled worker on a zero hours contract starts asking for wheelchair ramps, or other assistance at work, itrsquos easy for an unscrupulous employer to just take them off the rota, BTZ says.The night-time economy, where a lot of precarious employment is found, is only set to grow in Scotland as bars and clubs push for later licensing laws. Butyou are a young female member of staff on zero hours, with little power to argue for an earlier sht, then going home late at night becomes a hazard of work. Few companies pay for staff to get taxis even in the early hours of the morning.BTZ has accounts in its files of staff finishing work at am and waiting for the first bus in the morning to get home, or staff going to a casino that stays open until dawn and buying one drink to nurse until public transport starts again. There are reports of female staff being harassed and intimidated on late night streets.As the campaign team of BTZ say of all the cases they are investigating, \"is a little dignity, respect, and safety too much to ask \"The Herald on Sunday asked the Scottish Government to put forward the relevant minister for interview on matters related to precarious employment and the gig economy. No interview was forthcoming.Reaction: what the companies sayGRAND CENTRAL HOTELA spokesperson for Grand Central said they did not accept that the comments about the hotel ldquoin any way represent the experience of our valued colleagues.

due to leave the European Union next spring.In an interview with Skyrsquos Sophy Ridge on Sunday, he said that, despite the current impasse with Brussels over Brexit and the Irish border, his budget was based on there being a deal.While he thought a chaotic No Deal remained ldquoextremely unlikely, he added: ldquoIf we were to find ourselves in that situation then we would need to take a dferent approach to the future of Britainrsquos economy. We would need to look at a dferent strategy and, frankly, wersquod need to have a new budget that set out a dferent strategy for the future.He said thatthere was No Deal, the UK would see how markets and businesses and consumers responded, then take ldquoappropriate fiscal measures to protect the economy, to prepare us for the future and to strike out in a new direction that would ensure that Britain was able to succeed, whatever the circumstances we found ourselves in.On BBC rsquos Andrew Marr Show, Mr Hammond later said No Deal would be a jolt to business.He said: ldquoIf our businesses are no longer able to trade with European Union neighbours,their supply chains are cut off, they will have to find dferent markets and dferent ways of doing business. The economy will change. It will have to restructure itself over a period of time and that will be a fairly major transition.Despite Theresa May saying in her Tory conference speech earlier this month that austerity ldquois over, the Chancellor downplayed an immediate end to spending restraint.He said the main change would be in next yearrsquos medium-term spending review, though he did hint at extra cash today for the troubled Universal Credit benefit reforms.Mr McDonnell said he was ldquoreally shocked by the Chancellorrsquos remarks on No Deal.He said: ldquoHe seems to have accepted a no-deal Brexit and he does want us to be like Singapore, a tax haven which will undermine our manufacturing base and, I think, put peoplersquos living standards at risk.ldquoWersquove got to ensure that there is a deal, and the best way of doing that is Theresa May negotiating a proper deal that protects jobs and the economy.ldquoIf she canrsquot do that she should step to one side because therersquos too much at riskhellip let Labour get on with the negotiations or have a general election and let the people decide.Brexiter Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg dismissed the Chancellorrsquos warning as ldquoRemoanerism, and said the country should embrace a new economic model now instead of waiting.He said: ldquoThe Treasury has been the bastion of Remoanerism since the referendum and indeed before. It came out with all these lunatic forecasts... I think there is an element within the Treasury that is still grumpy about Brexit, and thatrsquos a pity.Among the measures Mr Hammond is expected to announce this afternoon are:* an extra poundbn a year in real terms for mental health south of the border by  * a pound.bn major roads fund for major routes, plus poundm for local pothole repairs* a pound.bn package to help the high street, including poundm in business rates reliefHe is also expected to find extra cash for defence, social care, and rural broadband.Much of the extra spending on England is expected to generate so-called lsquoBarnett consequentialsrsquo for Scotland.There are also likely to be changes on the income-raising side of the ledger.Mr Hammond has his sights on the ldquoeye-wateringly expensive tax relief on pensions enjoyed by middle and high earners, and has raised the prospect of a digital tax on internet giants such as Facebook, Google and Amazon.Derek Mackay called for a ldquomeaningful uplt in money for public services and the halting of the Universal Credit roll-out while its problems were fixed.The SNP Finance Secretary told the BBCrsquos Sunday Politics Scotland: ldquoThe Prime Minister said austerity is going to end and Irsquom saying to the UK Government: show me the money.The Scottish Tories demanded the SNP put extra money coming to Scotland under the Barnett formula because of English health spending into the Scottish NHS.But Mr Mackay said he would need to seethe Barnett consequentials resulted in a net increase in Holyroodrsquos budget, or were offset by cuts where.Shadow Scottish Secretary Lesley Laird said unless Mr Hammond ended austerity it would expose the Prime Ministerrsquos conference speech ldquoa cruel lie to families in hardship.She said: ldquoThousands of people across Scotland will be looking at the Budget today with hope after Theresa Mayrsquos vow to end austerity earlier this month.ldquoIf the Chancellor fails to make good on his governmentrsquos promise then the Prime Ministerrsquos remarks will be exposed as a cruel lie to the most vulnerable people in our society.ldquoLabour has outlined five key policies for ending austerity in todayrsquos Budget which will boost Scotlandrsquos economy and protect the vital public services we all rely on.ldquoMr Hammond must halt the botched national roll-out of Universal Credit immediately and implement Labourrsquos  emergency measures to alleviate the suffering of thousands who are already in receipt of it.ldquoThe next Labour government will invest a transformational extra pound billion in Scotland over a decade. The Chancellor must match that at the very least or it will be clear for all to see that only Labour can be trusted to deliver for Scotland.Scottish LibDem leader Willie Rennie called for an overhaul of inheritance tax, capital gains tax and pension tax relief, a freeze on whisky duty, and an end to the benefits freeze.He added: ldquoNo Budget can compensate the country for the huge financial Brexit blackhole that the Conservatives are set on delivering. An exit from Brexit would be good for business, wages and jobs."},{"url":null,"title":"moiras-run-attended-by-hundreds-including-elaine-c-smith-and-dame-elish-angiolini","story":"But the one thing uniting those taking part in yesterdays Moiras Run was a determination to reclaim Queens Park, on Glasgows south side, from the memory of the murder of Moira Jones.This year marked the tenth anniversary since her brutal killing in the park and all  participants were keen to show their support for the family of the -year-old businesswoman.In emotional speeches before the starting gun sounded, Moiras mother, Bea Jones, spoke of the \"friendship and warmth\" shown by the annual race, which raises money for The Moira Fund.She was followed by patrons of the Fund, Dame Elish Angiolini, the then-Lord Advocate who prosecuted Moiras killer, and comedian Elaine C Smith.Dame Elish remarked on the \"gathering of love and affection\" that marks out the Moiras Run as a special event.Each year staff from the nearby Neesons Bar make the effort to complete the race in fancy dress and this year a team of seven - including one on a mobility scooter - were kitted out as traffic cones.Dozens of familiar faces, who have turned out every year for the past fives years, completed the course, which was run by a team of volunteers.The event is also supported by the Scottish Violence Reduction Unit.Mrs Jones and Moiras brother, Grant, greeted finishers of the k with a hug and a medal.Mrs Jones said: \"Moira was a magnet for goodwill.\"So was Moirarsquos Run .

Will they help stimulate investment, productivity and employment  Will they favour particular sectors or income groups across the UK Second, we need to work through the implications for public spending in Scotland. Which changes will affect Scotland directly and which will work their way through the system via the block grant Third, we must consider implications for those tax powers, in particular income tax, which are largely devolved. At the least there can be effects on the base line from which adjustments for Scotland can be developed.As ever these days the new forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibilitywere critical - as will be the case in Decemberrsquos Scottish Budget with the independent forecasts from the Scottish Fiscal Commission .There was little change in the GDP growth forecast ndash tiny increases for next year and the year after but from then on as we were. The key point to emphasise is that UK growth is set to remain muted, .% per annum maximum rather than the % or .% we should be seeking.But the good news from the OBR was that they expect stronger employment and sustained growth in real wages in each of the next five years. After such an extended period of decline in real wages this,achieved, will be really positive for households across Scotland.In advance of the Budget there were estimates that, thanks to strong tax revenues, the fiscal deficit for   was likely to come in some billions of pounds below prior expectations ndash giving scope for expenditure increases. The stronger than expected performance in tax revenue is now expected to continue. However, Mr Hammond appears to have flexed up and to be prepared to live with a deficit each year of around pound billion, close on % of GDP. Nevertheless the level of UK debt will fall below forecast. He claims he will meet his fiscal rules while at the same time he also claiming that lsquothe era of austerity is finally coming to an endrsquo.Most of the public expenditure changes announced do not relate to Scotland directly, but will feed through via upward adjustments in the block grant. The Chancellor tells us that the feed through will mean an uplt for Scotland of pound million in   and lsquomuch largerrsquo increases in years to come.That will be good news for Derek Mackay and team. But they must make their own judgements on how to allocate these funds ndash taking note perhaps of what is proposed in England but following their own priorities.The changes in income tax allowances announced in the Budget will cause pause for thought. The increases in personal rate allowance and the higher rate threshold have been brought forward to April .Increasing dferentials between Scottish income tax rates and those in the rest of the UK would have fiscal and ndash potentially ndash economic incentive implications.Mr Hammond did stress his desire to unleash business investment and announced measures which he hopes will stimulate activity, and which will apply in Scotland. There is an increase in the annual business investment allowance more support for UK exporters and more funds for the British Business Bank. Not massive but helpful.We must now await whatever emerges in the Scottish Budget on th December. But, as Mr Hammond himself has made clear, a lsquono deal Brexitrsquo would mean that all Budget bets are off. It will be back to the drawing board to construct a much cheaper model for the next few years. Do not relax yet.Jeremy Peat is Visiting Professor University of Strathclyde"},{"url":null,"title":"budget-hammond-turns-to-toilet-humour-as-brexit-britain-prepares-to-go-down-the-pan","story":"This means that the annual deficit ndash the prime target of fiscal policy for the past decade ndash is around half what the government thought it was. The UK government is only borrowing around poundbn this year instead of going on poundbn. It seems that the real culprit was the Office of National Statistics which has been under-estimating the size of the UK economy and the tax revenues that it generates. In many businesses, an accounting error of such magnitude might be a sacking offence.But this is government, where no one is to blame. And anyway the Chancellor, Philip Hammond, is cock-a-hoop as they used to say in football commentaries, at his windfall. It has allowed him to declare the end of austerity, cut taxesby bringing forward the raising of the higher rate tax threshold, throw a couple of billion at the broken-backed Universal Credit welfare reforms , and promise poundbn for the National Health Service.It was the ultimate get out of free card for ldquoFiscal Phil as he styled himself yesterday in a Budget that was long on gagsrather shorter on reality. Austerity has not of course ended, eventhe deficit is set to rise marginally next year, for the first time in a decade. The freeze on working age benefits, like job seekers allowance, has another year to run, and local councils are still grinding through spending constraints that has led some of them to go bust, in England at least.But relief is at hand. The Chancellor made a groan-worthy bid for tabloid headlines by announcing business rates relief on public conveniences. Britain may be about to go down the toilet after Brexit, but at least well be able to spend a penny without that adding to the cuts in social care.ldquoIts the only thing that hasnt leaked, he quipped, in what sounded like a dig at the Prime Minister. Theresa May had pre-announced many of the headline items in the Chancellors Budget, like the freeze on fuel duty and the extra for the NHS. Which, as a number of analysts pointed out, isnt all that earth-shattering at .% per annum. The increases in NHS spending under Labour were far greater than that.But of course, according to the Chancellor, austerity was all the fault of Gordon Brown throwing our money down the pan in his Venezuelan years. You might have thought that the  financial crisis was caused by excessive bank-lending, sub-prime mortgages and the behaviour of the likes of Fred Goodwin of RBS. But no, it was ldquoLabours Great Recession, according to Mr Hammond yesterday.Jeremy Corbyn was furious about that in his Budget response in the Commons, which as usual failed to soar to oratorical heights eventhe indignation meter was off the scale. The Leader of the Opposition was also furious about the Chancellors claim that ldquoincome inequality is less today than under any of the last Labour governments.This is actually true ndash in a way. The bottom % of earners have indeed seen their earnings increase faster than the top %. But this is largely because median wages have been frozen for the last decade, while there have been signicant increases in the Living Wage ndash up to pound. after yesterdays hike. So, it is more statistical than real, and is actually a measure of how poorly the economy has performed for middle Britain ndash the very ldquohard-working families the Chancellor appealed to yesterday.Indeed, you could almost say that the relative increase in the earnings of the bottom % has largely been paid for by the longest pay pause in  years. It doesnt alter the fact that the top  richest families in the UK have doubled their wealth since the crash, or that CEOs now earn  times the average pay of their employees. The inconvenient truth is that people on higher incomes have done extremely well since the crash and will continue to benefit disproportionately from the Chancellors windfall.It will also help Mr Hammonds Scottish equivalent, Derek Mackay, out of his own budgetary hole. That poundbn for the NHS should push around poundbn north through the magic of Barnett Consequentials. It couldnt come at a better time. Following Audit Scotlands report last week saying that the Scottish NHS was ldquounsustainable, Nicola Sturgeons hard-won reputation for sound management of the health service was beginning to look distinctly shoogly. Wisely, Mr Mackay has promised to put every penny of the UK NHS uplt into health, where it belongs. Its not entirely clear that the Scottish government has always done this in the past, evenit has kept health spending ahead of inflation.The Chancellor said that Scotland stood to gain nearly poundbn in extra cash next year alone, when other factors were included. The slashing of business rates by one third for small companies will also have lucrative consequentials, though Mr Mackay isnt quite so certain that this will all be handed on. To be fair, the Scottish government has led the way in helping small businesses weather the storm on the high streets. Its long-running small business bonus kept many village shops from going under, and it seems that the UK government has noticed.There will be no changes to tax reliefs on North Sea Oil industry which will also come as a relief to the Scottish Finance Secretary. And there is no increase in whisky duty, to allow us to have ldquoa wee dram for Ruth Davidson as he Chancellor put it. What he didnt say is that we may need a drop of the hard stuff to deal with Brexit.This was the oddest Budget I think Ive witnessed. This is partly because of the unreality of the underlying fiscal figures: I mean,the OBR can get its numbers so massively wrong this year, isnt it possible that, in future, it may make a similar mistake the other way But it is also the last Budget before everything changes on th March next year as Britain crashes out of the European Union. The Chancellor hardly mentioned Brexit in his speech, except to offer the alliterative forecast of a ldquodouble deal idend. He gave no indication of how this might materialise, or how it squared with his own Treasurys forecasts of the negative impact on the UK economy of leaving the single market.Philip Hammond has made clear that his Budget only worksthere is a favourable Chequers deal, guaranteeing friction-free trade with the EU. That looks distinctly unlikely. On the very day of the Budget speech, the former Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson, penned another epistle in the Dailycalling on his Tory colleagues to ldquochuck Chequers which he believes will leave Britain at the mercy of malign Brussels bureaucrats, determined to bring Britain down.We may look back on this Budget as the last of its kind before Britain enters a new era of extreme economic turbulence and self-inflicted uncertainty.

However, that is not the approach adopted by Highland Council.Mrs Ross said: \"Having raised issues with the council regarding their approach to considering equalities and human rights in their budget process, particularly around the closure of public toilets, it was encouraging to hear that many councils around Scotland have placed such an approach at the heart of their budgeting.

We all love it.\"Gill Arrowsmith and Shirley Sinclair both thought the painting was \"fantastic\" while Annemarie Simpson thought that a similar venture in Wick would help tackle the \"towns eyesore\" buildings.While on that subject, one dissenting voice condemned the piece and said there was a \"masterpiece eyesore now in Wilson Street thanks to Caithness Horizons\".Beauty is, of course, in the eye of the beholder.The mural depicts a portrait of Thursos renowned botanist and geologist Robert Dick surrounded by a kaleidoscopic representation of the CHMAG facade and the scientists specimen collection.The bold use of line and colour based on modern urban graffiti cannot fail to be noticed just like the mural on nearby Tollemache House but is sited in a much less conspicuous space ndash the gallerys car park.CHMAGs curator Merran Gunn, who was instrumental in commissioning Delaye to create the work, said the artist had also spray painted a wall within the building as part of a show running called Graffito.His earlier piece has an explosive anime style figure punching out of the wall toward the viewer.\"Marcs work is bold and vibrant, electric colours jostle for dominance, and the new outside mural is no exception with tangerine skies set behind the historic Thurso of Robert Dick,\" said Gunn.Thursos illustrious scientist had his herbarium collection feature in an earlier work by the artist Joanne Carr which in turn is featured within Delayes mural ndash a clear case of one artist paying homage to another.\"Graffiti and street art is more relevant than ever whether it be in the art world ndash with the recent record sale of Banksys girl with a balloon ndash or here in the Highlands where graffiti has made its way onto the syllabus at Farr High School through art teacher Tracy Wilkinson,\" she said.After garnering great positive feedback from the current show Merran decided to \"have a moment of spontaneity\" and raised funds through a crowdfunding website and the Dounreay Communities Fund to commission Marc Delaye to breath some le into a fairly drab corner of the town.Tracy Dodson, commercial manager of CHMAG, said that the gallery was \"breaking boundaries\" with Graffito.\"It questions what actually constitutes art and what gets shown in a gallery. Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Monday  Oct  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"October ,  at : pmA special fund to help retell the remarkable tale of the scuttling of the German fleet in Scapa Flow almost  years ago has been launched by Orkney Islands Council .

It is a neurological disease which results in changes in animals# mental state, abnormalities of posture and movement and of sensation. The clinical disease usually lasts for several weeks and it is characteristically progressive and fatal.According to The World Organisation for Animal Health statistics very few cases of BSE — fewer than  each year since  — are reported in the UK.Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing said: “Following confirmation of a case of classical BSE in Aberdeenshire, I have activated the Scottish Government’s response plan to protect our valuable farming industry, including establishing a precautionary movement ban being placed on the farm.“While it is important to stress that this is standard procedure until we have a clear understanding of the disease#s origin, this is further proof that our surveillance system for detecting this type of disease is working. Be assured that the Scottish Government and its partners stand ready to respond to any further confirmed cases of the disease in Scotland.”Chief Veterinary Officer Sheila Voas said: “While it is too early to tell where the disease came from in this case, its detection is proof that our surveillance system is doing its job. We are working closely with the Animal and Plant Health Agency to answer this question, and in the meantime, I would urge any farmer who has concerns to immediately seek veterinary advice.Ian McWatt, Director of Operations in Food Standards Scotland said: “There are strict controls in place to protect consumers from the risk of BSE, including controls on animal feed, and removal of the parts of cattle most likely to carry BSE infectivity.“Consumers can be reassured that these important protection measures remain in place and that Food Standards Scotland Official Veterinarians and Meat Hygiene Inspectors working in all abattoirs in Scotland will continue to ensure that in respect of BSE controls, the safety of consumers remains a priority.

This is not some dry, academic debate. The potential health consequences of ministers failing to heed the advice of their own experts are serious.“I hope the Health Secretary will use her influence, therefore, to persuade her colleague, the Housing Minister, to accept the case for using a Rural Minimum Income Standard to help define fuel poverty in rural and island areas.  This is the only way of ensuring those who need help get the support they need.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Veterans, army and sea cadets and other groups will muster at the Royal British Legion, setting off shortly afterwards to form up on Broad Street.A short service led by the Salvation Army captain will lead to a two-minute silence at am, before a special Armistice Service takes place in the cathedral.In the afternoon, volunteers will begin to create a large-scale portrait in the sand at Scapa Beach, of an Orcadian soldier killed during WWI as part of Danny Boyle’s - NOW commission, Pages of the Sea. It was previously reported in last week’s The Orcadian that the event would take place at Waulkmill Bay, but this location has since changed to Scapa Beach.The artwork — one of  across the UK and the Republic of Ireland — will signy both the departure of the soldier from the county to serve in the war and, as the tide washes their image away, the loss of their le and those of many others.At pm, Orkney’s young people join forces with Orkney Rocks! Choir and others to remember those lost, and the impact the war had on those left behind, in a special concert at the Orkney Arts Theatre.Admission will be free and there will be an opportunity to make a contribution to the charity, Help for Heroes. Tickets for the concert will be released on Monday, October , and will be available at the council’s customer services points in School Place, Kirkwall, and Warehouse Buildings, Stromness.At .pm, a lone bugler at St Magnus Cathedral will join , inidual buglers from across the UK and oversees territories in sounding the historic ‘Last Post’.This will be followed by the lighting of a beacon on the St Magnus Cathedral kirk green at pm as part of the national Beacons of Light event which will see beacons lit across the country, symbolising an end to the darkness of war andto the light of peace.St Magnus Cathedral will remain the focus as, at .pm, the bells will ring alongside , others across the nation and beyond.Between pm and pm, the short film specially commissioned by the Kirkwall Townscape Heritage Initiative for the centenary of the armistice will be projected onto the cathedral for the last time.The convener of Orkney Islands Council, Harvey Johnston, said: “We are grateful to everyone who has worked with us so far to ensure we have a fitting programme of events here in Orkney for people to mark this momentous occasion and pay their respects to forbears who suffered so much. I hope people will involve and immerse themselves in these events as much as they can.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The Highland Council appreciate the work by Network Rail to introduce this innovative solution.\"Despite the reducedof daytime closure windows the road will remain shut each night from pm to am.

Inkson, have been fondly remembered down the years and credited with greatly boosting the French linguistic capabilities of those involved.As well as sowing the seeds for lasting friendships, one of the exchanges also led to the eventual marriage of Alistair Swanson of Dingwall and Belgian Marie-Anny De Landsheer. Alistair lived next door to Marie-Annyrsquos Scottish exchange partner, Sandra, daughter of the late Sandy and Lilly Macrae.With some of those attending a th anniversary meeting in Dingwall now in their s and s, there was much to catch on. One of those present, George Robertson, said the stark contrast between the new and old Dingwall Academy buildings amazed those present.\"The day began with a guided tour of Dingwall Academy, graciously hosted by rector, Mrs Karen Cormack and two equally charming assistants, Ceitidh Petrie of fth Year and head girl, Anna-Maria Stewart of sixth year. We were amazed by the change in the Academy mdash from the grim corridors with its memories of rooms with formal rows of desks, piles of jotters and frequent administrations of summary justice mdash with the lsquoLochgelly Specialrsquo mdash to the cosy, student-friendly comfort of modern classrooms, sumptuously equipped with digital projectors and interactive whiteboards.\"Gone are the dingy cloakrooms, in the corners of which, stressed-out procrastinators struggled furiously to finish their homework on time! Gone too, are the endless, uncouth nicknames we used to give our teachers, Pirrac, Froggy, Daisy-lugs, Kate Stew, Inky, Willie the War, Kramer, Horace, Scabbac, Sinkie, Snottery Tom and so on.\"He added: \"We soon realised that Dingwall Academy is a much happier, kinder place than the strictly regimented establishment, where we learned, suffered, cried, laughed and fell in, and out, of love! The old school, however, was not all bad, because we had the good fortune of being taught by many caring, brilliant teachers who inspired and challenged us, and whom we still remember with great fondness. J.K.Inkson was one of those par excellence, but kind and modest, despite his many gts.\"After welcome refreshments in the Academy cafe, the group enjoyed a tour of Dingwall Museum.Mr Robertson said: \"The culminating highlight of our day was, without doubt, the get-together and dinner in the Royal Hotel, Cromarty. We were able to catch up with more of our old friends and former schoolmates. We were formally welcomed by Sandra Collardand by Marie-Anny, who addressed us in flawless English. The dinner was a splendid affair, with a host of gastonomic delicacies, all excellently prepared.\"The old friends recalled the lasting benefits of their exchanges down the years. Mr Robertson said: \"We were particularly glad to have a representative of the Inkson family with us, in the form of J.K.rsquos daughter, Helen, and we were pleased to hear a message of greeting from his son, Kerr, who lives in Auckland, New Zealand.\"Kerr wrote of his pride in the job his father had done, developing and managing the exchanges. He also wished us all a happy evening together.

The ersion could then reopen to traffic shortly after a train clears the other side.Ross, Skye and Lochaber MP, Ian Blackford has been campaigning for the revised system with support from Scottish Transport Secretary, Michael Matheson.Mr Blackford said: \"This has the potential to be great news and work now must be put in place to make these plans a reality. I would like to put on record my gratitude to Network Rail for listening to concerns of the local community and of representatives like myself.\"Despite matters relating to Network Rail being reserved to Westminster, I knew the best hope was for the Scottish Government to try and make clear that the sorry state of affairs that we have all witnessed, couldnrsquot be allowed to continue. Let me be frank, these changes would not have been possible without the intervention of the Scottish Governmentrsquos Transport Secretary, Michael Matheson MSP.\"The local communities deserve a huge amount of credit as well. Local representatives have campaigned tirelessly and have sought to keep people informed when information wasnrsquot always forthcoming from Highland Council.\"I hope now that we can move forward from what has been an extremely trying situation for local communities.\"Network Rail confirmed the new system is something it is actively looking into, but that it was not yet in a position to proceed and had no specic start date for its introduction.But a spokesman added that the system was similar to one that was introduced on the same stretch of track in  after another serious landslide, so the idea is feasible.Monday  Oct  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Grown in sunlight, without hydroponic lights, and sprayed with a fine mist of salt water from the sea nearby. They taste and smell like the tomatoes we grew up with,” she says. A tomato whose taste is down to the concentration of minerals in soil enriched by millennia of stratication of lava, and as she talks, she’s taking me on a journey where taste is all about time. In a world of rolling news and   Twitter feeds, with , people following her Instagram posts, a new restaurant opened this year and another opening next month, “call it five” books to her name and another out this month, chef and food writer Gizzi Erskine wants us all to slow right down. That’s why her new cookery book is called Slow: Food Worth Taking Time Over, designed to teach the art of slow cooking and how to serve up stews, soups and hearty sauces. She’s fed up with quick cheats and cutting corners and wants us to prod the produce, take time trying out techniques and linger lovingly over the creation of a kale, spinach and ricotta conchiglioni. It’s time to stew, braise, bake, poach and roast.“We are so short of time in our lives that we forget that cookery does take time,” she says. Not that one of the first proponents of the pop-up restaurant doesn’t have time for fast food: “Sometimes you’ve just got to have something on your plate instantly, so you batch cook at weekends and have quick ready meals for the week. But I think losing yourself in the cookery process is therapy as well.”Taking time out to enjoy the process is close to Erskine’s heart after a busy year that started with her opening her first solo restaurant, The Dining Room, at Mare Street Market in a former office block in Hackney, and will end with the opening of vegetarian burger chain, Filth, a joint business venture with model-turned-nutritionist Rosemary Ferguson aimed at delivering healthy food to hedonists. The pair met at a festival, music being a passion of Erskine’s from hosting a cookery and cabaret stage at Latitude to what she calls a “penchant” for musicians, including Klaxons rocker Jamie Reynolds who she dated and split up with in . All this and her latest book, out this month, Gizzi doesn’t appear to be someone to whom you’d attach the adjective “slow”. After leaving school at  and home at , Gizzi – short for Griselda – was in a hurry to get on with le and success came early. While working as a body piercer in Camden, she trained at Leith’s School of Food and Wine in , graduated top of her year and won an internship at BBC Good Food magazine, writing and styling while working in kitchens and starting her own catering company. With her psychobilly flicky eyeliner and beehive hairstyle she was made for TV, and Channel  gave her her own show, Cook Yourself Thin, followed by Cookery School and Drop Down Menu. More TV followed with Sky Living. At the same time, she was turning out cookery books including Gizzi’s Kitchen Magic and Skinny Weeks  Weekend Feasts as well as writing for magazines and newspapers including InStyle and Sunday Times Style. And then there were the pop-ups, from a gourmet pie shop to food inspired by the New York Korean hole-in-the-wall scene, and one in Edinburgh during the Festival.But it’s time to slow down and talk about Slow. At , Erskine is at pains to point out she has been doing this for a long time. “I just wanted to be respected for the job I do it’s not just about how I look. I work very, very hard, I’m probably one of the hardest-working people in the industry. I’m good at my job and want people to recognise it. And I think that’s why people like Mark Hix, Angela Hartnett and Tom Kerridge, all the big guns, have always taken massive care of me, and that’s because they trust me as a cook. I dunno, it’s probably all my own shit to be honest, in my own head, but I just feel like I’ve been doing this for a long time now.”Erskine’s big purpose is to get us to slow down, embrace ingredients and technique – and for her own part, she also wants to be taken more seriously. Always a huge fan of methodology, she found the quick and easy recipes approach demanded by media for cookery frustrating. “I’m like, ‘You know what, I’m a chef, a real chef, and I really enjoy the process of cookery and I love technique – it’s what I get my kicks from’. “I’m really pleased with this book,” she says. “You know when you talk about rock stars making a brilliant album with a load of banging hits, that’s what these recipes are like. Often you lose something in a book, but they’ve kept my voice.“And one of the great things is it’s the first one I’m not on the cover. I’ve begged not to be on the cover of every single one – I think it’s a celebrity chef thing – but I don’t buy those books, I buy ones written by proper cookery writers or real old school chefs. “I want this book to stand for something. I don’t want it to be just like I’m spoiled and I’ve been on the telly and can write lovely recipes. I actually have a big purpose and I want to get out there and make changes,” she says. Not that Erskine doesn’t care about the visuals – like the shiny bob that replaced the beehive a couple of years ago – but she’s moved on from Cook Yourself Thin and Skinny Weeks  Weekend Feasts, having a more complex take on body issues these days. Of a recent post online where she mentioned putting on weight, she says: “I did that without thinking, but , people responded, so it touched a lot of people. But I don’t want it to be a thing that defines me. I put on that weight because I worked my arse off this year, setting up businesses, writing a book and helping build a house. It’s been an exhilarating, tiring  months and I lost my way in my diet. Is that the biggest thing you’ve ever been through  Absolutely not. Do I stand for more than this  Yeah! You know what, I don’t want to talk about it any more because I don’t think it’s very feminist. “Obviously my image and having a certain style has been a part in what I do and that’s been brilliant I probably wouldn’t be doing what I do without it. I’ve done a lot of TV – the last one was a Korean show for BBC One, My Seoul Food, where I got to live in Korea for four months, maybe one of my best experiences of all time. And I got to work with Idris Elba and Paloma Faith and Rankin on Sky  HD, and I pinch myself every day about that sort of thing. But the stuff I like best is educating people, showing them new things. “I’ve been doing this for more than  years, and won awards before I did TV, I’ve written a column for the Sunday Times for almost three years. I’ve earned my stripes. I’m a perfectionist and meticulous and I really want to be known for being good. That’s the first and foremost thing.”The wake-up call that her style was being valued over her stew came for Erskine when her annual appearance in the Evening Standard newspaper’s , Most Influential List saw her listed under “Party Girl” rather than “Food”. “I was like, f***, that is the worst thing! It’s my choice to do social media, because I love my fans and the fact I can have conversations with them, but when your lestyle choices make people see you dferently that’s no good. It was my fault and I deserved it. I thought I want to be recognised for doing my job, and I am good at my job, and it was important I stuck with it and showed how much I respect my industry. “Now I’m back in the Food section,” she says, satisfied, “have been for the past three or so years.” During her childhood, the family travelled a lot because of her mother’s﻿ work – Erskine and her two sisters spent time in Thailand, Switzerland and Spain after her parents’ orce. As Erskine puts it now, with a laugh: “I’ve had a very weird upbringing, there’s lots of weird shit gone on.” Food was always part of her le, with her mother teaching her recipes – her influence is in the new book. There’s also the Scottish grandmother from Edinburgh, Mona, a brilliant cook who married a Polish Jew who escaped the Nazis, and flitted between Communism, clairvoyance and Buddhism. She died when Erskine was a child, but came through to Erskine years later when she visited a spiritualist. “They said ‘Mona’s here’. I was still piercing at this stage and she said either you or your mother need to cook, because you both want to, so I went home and asked my mother what it was all about. She said, ‘That’s your grandma’, and it was on the nose. Mona has come through again, this time in the book with a Jewish chicken soup recipe.” Erskine’s father was also Scottish, from Dumfries, and she lived there briefly when she was very young. She still calls Scotland “the motherland”, priding herself on her mince recipe.It was the death of Erskine’s father on the day of her first GCSE exam that saw her leave school immediately at . “School wasn’t for me anyway,” she says, “and it turned out later that I had ADHD, which made sense. In  Erskine was officially diagnosed with the disorder and she’s very upfront about how cooking helps and is helped by it.“I can be hyper-focused and hyperactive at the same time, probably everyone ’s nightmare. So I’m either distracted and it’s knock me on the head to get attention, or bouncing off the walls and I find it very hard to listen. So cooking is like exercise, it’s therapy for me. “There’s also a side where I felt too clever for school, which is really knobby, and no-one really explained the importance of education. I was a bit of a dick in that I chose to leave but I was a nightmare at , going out, having a wild time, and my father died, so it was a bit of an excuse for me not to go back. “I was devastated by his death, but I didn’t face it. It took me five to ten years to really accept it. I put my head in the clouds and wanted to party. But now as a grown up, I don’t necessarily believe leaving school was the worst decision. “What would I have doneI’d stayed  Gone to art school maybe, but I don’t think I would have learnt as much as I did going out to work. I started piercing when I was  and I loved it and it set me up with the particular skills that I learnt from and transferred to cookery. That sounds like a ridiculous synergy, but I learnt things like wanting to be the best and investing in something, going on courses to improve. It was a brilliant lesson in how to be good at something,” she says.Erskine still loves piercing but has reduced her own ironmongery from  or  to just the one. As to its whereabouts – “I’m not going to tell you that.” She laughs. After seven years of piercing Erskine decided to pursue her love of cooking and enrolled at Prue Leith’s prestigious London cookery school, still piercing and working in restaurants to fund her studies. “My family is quite bohemian and we were very broke,” she says. “I lived on my own and ended up squatting, doing school in the day then in kitchens every night, and piercing and restaurants at the weekend, and yeah, probably partying too hard. So I lost it, I was just so exhausted.” Physically and emotionally something had to give and Erskine thought about quitting, but the school wanted her to stay and loaned her the fees for the last term. “They were so kind and saw something in me, so I was like f***, I’ve gotta do this!” Success followed, but nothing has given Erskine more satisfaction than her first solo restaurant at Mare Street Market, where she was hands-on in the kitchen until preparations for veggie burger eatery Filth took her away recently.“Cooking really good food people are coming back for… It was something I took a long time to get my head around, whether I wanted to be involved in business or not, but it’s been really satisfying and confidence-boosting,” she says. With Mare Street Market under her belt, she’s putting the finishing touches to the sustainable burger enterprise and is evangelical about the vegan burger she’s concocted with sidekick Ferguson. “We’ve spent a lot of time messing around over a cauldron,” she says. “We’ve made this patty that’s a real game-changer. Totally vegan, it feels similar to a traditional beef burger but has more protein, fibre, nutrition, and all the umami. I sound a bit Miss World,” she laughs, “but I’d love to make an impact with it, because what we eat is crucial and it’s time for a revolution in food.” So with a busy year behind her, Erskine might be forgiven for retreating to the warehouse she’s converting in Hackney with her ex-boyfriend, curling up with her cats Kimchiand Ponzuand taking time out to slow cook a ragu. “No! I’ve got another interview to do, five minutes ago!” she says, before briefly explaining her domestic set-up. “We were together for ten years and then broke up for five and now we’re building a house together. We’re best friends now, and it’s a lovely little set-up. We love each other, it’s great,” she says.With  just around the corner Erskine is happy with her le as it is. “I feel ageless. I don’t feel the need to settle down and have kids. I’m really satisfied and have a very fulfilled le and get kicks from so many things. I don’t have time for anything . “I’d like to do more cookery books but I want them to be for the right reasons. I don’t care about just churning them out. I want to spend time thinking about the next step, spend time making it good.” Slow: Food Worth Taking Time Over by Gizzi Erskine is out now, published by Harper Collins at £©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4820561.1540806636!/image/image.jpg","title":"ikm launches new mobile mapping technology","story":"Falkirk-based firm IKM Surveying, part of IKM Consulting Group, is launching a new mobile mapping service to boost the efficiency and safety of road survey procedures.Following a successful pilot with road maintenance provider Bear Scotland, IKM will launch its new technology at RoadExpo on  October and  November.It uses a vehicle-mounted system, multi-camera imaging and field software to capture data of roads, rail, land and waterways, as well as geographic information systemdata collection and asset management to efficiently map transport and infrastructure projects.

Having a conviction for driving without appropriate insurance that he picked up while a transport minister was not a recommendation.Every day the actions of Humza Yousaf suggest he is unfit for that office and the First Minister does not act, compounds the question surrounding her judgement. If the minister had any sense of self-awareness, and what is appropriate behaviour for a justice minister, he would spare Nicola Sturgeon her blushes and decide to relinquish his role and spend more time with his family. With Humza Yousaf’s penchant for being in the limelight such voluntary sacrice is as unlikely as the First Minister admitting she can be so demonstrably wrong in judging people.In an interview published this month Mr Yousaf talked freely of his upset at the criminal investigation into his former colleague and leader, Alex Salmond, on accusations of sexual misconduct. He described it as “utterly heartbreaking” but there was no report of his thoughts for those who might be intimidated about bringing such charges against men of power, no revelations about his concerns towards how alleged victims might feel. There was no sense of awareness how he – as Justice Secretary – might make those women, and other women in similar positions who are yet to speak up – feel by showing more concern for Salmond than for women potentially abused. Nor did he appear aware he might be contributing to a public perception – before any possible future jury trial – that Alex Salmond’s character is beyond question.Surely he should have refused to comment on the matter at all, other than to acknowledge the legal proceedings were in place and precluded him from revealing his own thoughts  The week then really took off when an Edinburgh Labour councillor, Professor Scot Arthur, who like Humza Yousaf, is a highly active tweeter, invited his followers to take part in a Twitter poll that he devised. For those that do not Tweet I can advise this is a common practice, sometimes in seriousness to establish opinion, sometimes in jest to poke fun at others. Cllr Arthur’s question was, “What attracted Humza Yousaf to politics ” A The   attacks, B The Iraq War, or C The photo calls Now I have not happened to mention Humza Yousaf’s religion in this article so far, which is intentional, because I do not think his religionshould matter in his conduct as Cabinet Secretary for Justice. For Humza Yousaf, however, Cllr Arthur’s Tweet was prejudiced against his faith and race, indeed it was so hateful that when it was brought to his attention he wrote to the leader of Edinburgh Labour Council Group and called for Cllr Arthur’s immediate suspension.Now at this stage you may want to read the Tweet again. It suggests there might be three reasons Mr Yousaf went into politics and one might guess that the point of such a poll was to ridicule the subject by putting the narcisstic attraction of photo calls as the last answer. But why list   and the Iraq War – was that racist or Islamophobic Actually the origins of those first two answers is that only a few days before Humza Yousaf had said in the same interview that   – when he was -years-old – was “hugely to do with where I am today”. This appeared to conflict with a previous comment given to the Herald where Mr Yousaf said, “The Iraq war was the trigger for my politics”.So was it   or the Iraq war – or was it that politics is attractive to people who like being in the limelight  A political opponent had spotted an inconsistency and no doubt thought it worth calling out the Justice Secretary’s forgetfulness.  was a crime against humanity in which, other than the evil perpetrators, hundreds of innocent Muslims died. As is often the case in Islamist terrorist attacks, be they bombings, shootings or vehicles mowing people down, Muslims are innocent victims too. The same goes for the Iraq War – which was prosecuted against a secular state and where people of all religions and none, and of many races died. The US Secretaries of State during its time were Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice, both black Americans. Many Muslims served in Operation Desert Storm and the campaigns that followed. It would be a perversion of the truth to suggest it was a war against Islam, or even a particular section of Islam.Nevertheless, such is the nature of social media outrage that it was not long that Cllr Arthur felt he had to unreservedly apologise for his Tweet and deleted it, while the Labour council leader reprimanded him publicly. I know I am not alone in looking at that tweet and not seeing racist or Islamophobic abuse. What I see is a politician undermining real cases of abuse by overreacting and playing the hate crime card. Humza Yousaf is a regular tweeter who is not backwards at attacking opponents and often winds-up supporters of Rangers FC. It’s never racist or sectarian, of course.The problem for those, like Mr Yousaf, who wish to flaunt their opinions about possible objectionable behaviour of others, is that it can easily lead to hypocrisy when comment is dficulta new example is too close to home. Unfortunately for the Justice Secretary, who is a Glasgow politician and can be expected to know what is happening in his own domain, an SNP Councillor, Russell Robertson, appeared in Glasgow Sherf Court last week after being charged with aggravated religious prejudice for allegedly calling his neighbour an “Orange bastard”.Was there a tweet from the Justice Minister  Maybe a letter to the SNP council leader, Susan Aitken, calling for his immediate suspension  No, he was utterly silent. Either the Justice Minister is embarrassed by Mr Robertson’s alleged bigoted behaviour or is at last learning that keeping his counsel is more befitting for the Justice Secretary. A long period away from Twitter is the least he could do for his leader.Brian Monteith is a director of think-tank Global Britain©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4821070.1540754779!/image/image.jpg","title":"lesley riddoch me too movements should embrace scotland s witches","story":"Was I alone in being repelled by the advertising pitch for this weekend#s Paisley#s Halloween Festival #Inspired by the town#s dark and deathly th century witch history #How can a weekend of spooky fun be “inspired” by the gruesome killing of seven people, whose only crimes appear to have been using herbal remedies and forecasting the weather by studying bird movements and cattle behaviour  Four female and two male “witches” were strangled on Paisley Gallow Green in ,Their bodies were burned and charred remains buried at a site still marked by a circle of cobbled stones.Not very funny. They’d been found guilty of putting a spell on -year-old Christian Shaw, the daughter of a wealthy local laird - to this day, there’s more interest in whether the attention-seeking child really was to blame. A minor historical detail still over-shadows the horror of seven unjust deaths  Why Is it not possible for modern Scots to empathise – to think about the horror of the situation  Seven people, facing horrible deaths over entirely groundless accusations - can we not imagine the terror  Now to be fair, the Paisley event seems to have been a joyful festival with a Mardi Gras atmosphere, acrobats, hundreds of youngsters in brightly coloured costumes and mercully few witches’ hats or broomsticks. But that flippant and facile connection between strangulation and fun, in every radio interview and press article means I, for one, have no urge to attend. Mention of witches still prompts a wee titter and immediate association with Harry Potter, broomsticks and crooked noses. Not the  people accused of witchcraft in Scotland between  and . According to historians Lauren Martin and Joyce Miller in their exhaustive study ‘The Survey of Scottish Witchcraft’  per cent of them were executed,  per cent were women and almost all were tortured. Of course, that’s disputed. Women were not generally placed in the “boots,” “rack” or thumbscrews. Edinburgh woman Agnes Sampson was shackled to her cell wall and stabbed in the face with a four-pronged iron fork, which pierced through her cheeks and tongue – after being accused of plotting to kill King James VI in . But most suspected witches were “only” stripped naked and shaved of all hair including pubic hair to look for “devil’s marks” which were pricked with pins to find insensitive skin “proving” guilt. The idea of being touched, prodded and intimately examined by strange men must have been terrying. The women were then kept awake for days and “encouraged” to confess. A similar witch trial took place at Tullibole Castle near the Crook of Devon in Kinross, home to William Halliday and his son John in . They held court over ‘covens’ in the village and ordered  suspected witches to be strangled and burned. Rosie Hopkins lives near the old execution site and has researched the trials. She says “The women and one man were kept in solitary and in the dark. There is no record of any defence or appeals. That’s how disenfranchised these women were. When they were strangled, every villager was required to watch. The humiliation and terror is still alive and meaningful to me.”Quite. I’m sure I’m not the only mouthy woman looking at these trials thinking, there but for the passage of time, go I. Or, to use a more modern idiom - “Me Too.”It’s important to tease out links between modern women and “witches” of yesteryear because the idea that most were old, poor, disabled or odd is just plain wrong. The Survey of Scottish Witchcraft found  per cent of accused women came from “middle range” homes. Few were lonely spinsters or widows –  per cent were actually married - but almost all were confident, outspoken and assertive. This is what caused offence. As historian Louise Yeoman puts it“The average witch lived in a small borough town. She had an occupation and brought money into the home in her own right. She had a sharp tongue and might have fallen out with neighbours – in other words, she was us.”This matters.Despite its relatively small population, Scotland was Europe’s biggest persecutor of witches. King James VI’s personal obsession meant Scottish “witch-finders” were also sent abroad. They burned and killed hundreds of Sami men and women in Arctic Norway – a memorial to those victims was unveiled in  by Norway’s Queen Sonja. But there’s been no similar recognition or rehabilitation here. A site at the entrance to Edinburgh Castle’s esplanade, commemorates the place where Agnes Sampson and three hundred other women were strangled and burned for being witches in .A plaque beside a fountain reads “The wicked head and serene head signy that someused their exceptional knowledge for evil while others... wished their kind nothing but good.”This of course is nonsense. Scottish society stopped believing in the powers of witchcraft  years ago, so no “wicked head” passing within inches of this plaque during its last terried minutes on this earth could possibly have committed harm by thought or speech alone. Yet the plaque remains.Ten years ago, a campaign to pardon Scotland’s “witches” was rejected by Holyrood’s petitions committee because they felt it was wrong to excuse people found guilty under laws of their own time and “dficult to apply modern concepts of knowledge and morality to centuries past”.Really  Earlier this year, thousands of gay and bisexual men prosecuted for having sex under old laws, were quite rightly pardoned by a unanimous vote in the Scottish Parliament. The slur on the reputation of the women slaughtered centuries back is essentially no dferent. As it is, the refusal to recognise witchcraft as the unjust persecution ofwomen means new generations of well-meaning folk are able to ignore the pain, terror and persecution of witch trials and find the quasi-judicial lynching of outspoken women somehow inspiring. But why should the organisers of Paisley’s Halloween Festival recognise this shameful aspect of our history when officialdom in Scotland hardly cares Perhaps next year, Paisley can lead Scotland in respectful commemoration of its persecuted women and ensure that forgotten acts of misogyny don’t get packaged into selling opportunities for black hats, broomsticks and detachable warts at Halloween.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4821474.1540834819!/image/image.jpg","title":"budget 2018 15 key announcements from philip hammond at a glance","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...An earlier than expected increase in the income tax threshold and the higher rate threshold were the highlights of the Chancellor#s Budget.Philip Hammond said the personal allowance, the income at which workers begin to pay tax, would increase to £, from April, with the amount when the top rate of income tax is applied rising to £, at the same time.

It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the th anniversary of the Milne Cup.Sadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.Many supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.While it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.But despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The - scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.Molloy’s introduction  minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubtanyone  in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.But the damage had been done in the first half – at - down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.Some have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.I felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.Two years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a - defeat in Kirkwall.There is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s th birthday.It’s just a pity we have to wait a whole  months until a chance of revenge.: : : : : : : :A couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.There are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.A score of - was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.The Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.A few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.I would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.: : : : : : : :Orkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening#s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John CouttsThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over  guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.Unfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.The speeches which followed,anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.It was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.Sinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous  game when he hit the back of the net five times in the - victory.: : : : : : : :And finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.On Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.Helped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.Robert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did -odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.The others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.The final score was a - win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate - football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"no shortage of goals in action packed weekend ","story":"There was loads of football action on Saturday with LK Galaxy claiming a convincing win against Tizers to win the Association Cup.Final score was an incredible -, with no fewer than five goals coming from Jordan Thomason.Meanwhile, the contest for the County Shield was won by Ness at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick.

The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League.

A lot of visitor experiences are going to be marred.\"Adam Gough, CairnGorm Mountain representative, who had told of the need for the slopes aimed at beginners and intermediates, was clearly stunned by the rejection.Asked immediately after the decisionan appeal was likely, he said that a statement would be issued later.CNPA head planner Gavin Miles had stressed from the outset the application had to be determined on planning issues ndash landscaping impacts in particular ndash and not on its commercial merits, which had generated much argument.He said the business case was a matter for Natural Retreats.Mr Miles told the committee the articial slope would not extend the ski area in any signicant way but the footprint of obvious development would increase.He commented: \"Initially the team were very concerned about the landscaping but as more information was given to us by the applicants it was considered that in the long term planting would mitigate against that. There would be an impact in the short term of the dry ski slope.\"Whether it will ever be an attraction in its own right and generate signicant income, who knows, but that is not a consideration of the planning process.\"In effect it is a ersication of business in this area and therefore acceptable andit was to strengthen the stability of CairnGorm Mountain then thats a good thing.\"He said there were some hefty planning conditions attached to control the development.CairnGorm Mountains representative said some  per cent of total visits to the resort were in just three winter months of the year.Mr Gough had told the committee Natural Retreats had explored several options in depth to remove the reliance on winter income including mountain biking and zip-wiring but this plan was the most viable at this time.He said it was imperative the attraction can provide year-round employment in order to retain its best staff. This site was the most sheltered for the ski slope and close to other facilities without impacting on other slopes, he said. It could also be used for tubing and other activities.Mr Gough acknowledged the clamour for better ski uplt at CairnGorm which has been overtaken as Scotlands most popular ski resort.He said: \"We would like nothing more than to be able to upgrade ski infrastructure to improve the snowsports experience for everyone but this has to be a long term process built on solid commercial foundations.\"He said the slope could be in operation for  per cent of the year outwith winter and ice would not be a problem as it was easy practice to break it up.ABA secretary Alan Brattey said history showed articial slopes at Scottish resorts including the Lecht, Glenshee and Glencoe had not worked.He also said a bright green Snowflex slope would stand out like a sore thumb and no consideration had been given by the operator to an alternative by market leader, Neveplast, which could be camouflaged.He said that of just over  votes on Facebook on the application,  per cent were against it.Tessa Jones, of the Badenoch and Strathspey Conservation Group, asked the committee: \"What are you going to say to the world about this peatland destruction \"Committee member Dave Fallows moved the application be refused and he was seconded by Carolyn Caddick.He said he appreciated the efforts to mitigate against the ski slope but said: \"It cant possibly soften in the long term the impact that this makes on the area.\"Mrs Caddick said: \"We are going to see it for miles and miles around.\"Peter Argyle had moved in favour of the application saying he had faith in the planning officers conditions but was not supported.Mr Brattey said after the vote: \"This was very much the right decision and wed like to congratulate the planning committee for deciding to reject this planning application against the advice of their planning officials.\"We very much hope that common sense will now prevail and that the plans for the Ptarmigan Building will be dropped.\"We are left to wonder just exactly why HIE allowed their tenant to take such a madcap plan all the way to the CNPAs planning committee who were very decisive in their rejection of it.\"He said HIE should ert the pound million to new uplt. \"The hill business requires to be funicular proofed as soon as possible,\" said Mr Brattey.Monday  Oct  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118063.jpg","title":"Green light for Dalwhinnie quarry work","story":"Gavin MusgroveA quarry operator has said that measures are in place to allay concerns that their excavation plans could lead to a surge in speeding lorries in a Badenoch village.Leithshas been given the green light by the Cairngorms National Park Authorityrsquos planning committee to recommence operations at the site at Carn Dhomhnuill Bhain on the doorstep of Dalwhinnie.The company has said that it is not contingent on winning a contract to supply aggregate to the dualling of the A but that the produce will be used for housebuilding and other local construction projects.The firm was granted temporary permission for  yearsatthe CNPArsquoslatest planning committee meeting at Boat of Garten Community Hall.Production will be stepped up dramatically at the quarry around one mile north of Dalwhinnie by the A.It was previously in operation up to .But now Leiths has permission to extend the site from two to  hectares.

Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service.

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. This is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27481  ","story":"• Mícheál Mac Donncha and Robert Ballagh Mícheál Mac Donnchaby Robert Ballagh published by Head of Zeus. back in the late s. For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them.

They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27484  ","story":"• RUC unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons Mícheál Mac DonnchaCivil Rights campaigners in Derry had been pressing for a march in their city which had long been a byword for unionist sectarianism and discrimination.Using gerrymandered electoral boundaries and a corrupt voting system which allowed wealthier citizens to have multiple votes in local elections, the unionists maintained a majority of members on the council in a city with a nationalist majority.Nationalists lived in very poor housing conditions and were affected disproportionately by the % unemployment rate in the city.Unionists had long regarded the old walled town as a citadel that could never be surrendered and their dominance was symbolised by the walls towering over the crumbling th century terraced streets of the nationalist Bogside. The last time nationalists had attempted to hold a parade inside the walls was on St Patrick’s Day  – when they were batoned by the RUC.Housing was a massive issue in Derry and the Derry Housing Action Committeeprovided the focus for leadership as the Civil Rights campaign took off. The DHAC had organised a James Connolly commemoration in the city in July  which was banned by the unionist government.The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Associationagreed to hold a march in Derry on  October. The loyalist Apprentice Boys organisation immediately announced a counter-demonstration with the purpose of forcing the unionist government’s hand to ban the Civil Rights march. But the regime at Stormont did not require forcing because the Home Affairs Minister was ultra-unionist William Craig, who promptly imposed the ban.NICRA held an emergency meeting with the DHAC. Many on the NICRA Executive and some Derry nationalist figures, including John Hume, wanted to cancel the march, but the majority of Derry activists were determined to defy the ban. They won out and the march was to proceed as planned.It was a relatively small march, beginning on Craigavon Bridge with several hundred people. The objective was the Diamond in the city centre.The march was stopped in Duke Street by the RUC. A meeting was held with speakers including Gerry Fitt, Betty Sinclair, Eddie McAteer, Ivan Cooper, Austin Currie and Eamonn McCann. Three Westminster Labour MPs were also present.After the meeting, the marchers found themselves hemmed in on all sides by the RUC. They could not disperse and after a tense stand-off the RUC, oblivious to the presence of TV cameras and photographers, unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons, boots and fists. Water cannons were then used.Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, then a young People’s Democracy activist, recalled:“Quite deliberately, they hosed in the upstairs windows and shopfronts, and they went right across Craigavon Bridge, hosing all the onlookers. The police just went mad.”The RUC attack in Duke Street brought the Civil Rights struggle in Ireland to a world audience for the first time. It was a complete eye-opener to many people in the  Counties and in Britain. But most profound was its effect on young nationalists.Derry man Mickey Devine , the last of the ten Hunger Strikers to die in the H-Blocks of Long Kesh in , recalled:“Like every young person in Derry, my whole way of thinking was tossed upside down by the events of  October . I didn’t even know there was a Civil Rights march I saw it on television.“But that night I was down the town smashing shop windows and stoning the RUC. I developed an intense hatred of the RUC. As a child I had always known not to talk to them or to have anything to do with them, but this was dferent.The RUC attacked the Civil Rights march in Duke Street, Derry, on  October .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27485  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering and pain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contested narratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.- Declan KearneyThis week the NIO consultation on dealing with the legacy of thepast in the north of Ireland closed.It will inform a legislative process and bringforward future legacy legislation.Failure to deal with the past remains one of the most signicantimpediments to political progress here.It is a barrier to the development of a comprehensivereconciliation and healing process in this society.British state policy has been the primary factor in preventinglegacy issues from being addressed or resolved.Powerful sections of the British military and intelligence systemhave never embraced the peace process. They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past. There isno single narrative despite the attempts of the British state and politicalunionism to assert otherwise.The past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering andpain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future. It is time to lay the foundations for reconciliation andhealing, and to open up a new phase of the peace

permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster. They had abolished the veto of the House of Lords and Home Rule was due to be implemented in . The Tories seized on the issue of Home Rule as the most effective weapon to bring down the Liberals. Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27490  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.- Declan KearneyLast weekend the Irish Congress of Trades Unionsand Irish Labour History Society organised a conference to commemorate William Walker in Belfast.Walker was an anti-Home Rule unionist who was a leader in the Belfast Independent Labour Partyin the early twentieth century.When James Connolly, Irelands most signicant historical, socialist republican leader called on the ILPs membership to support socialist unity in Ireland, his appeal provoked a rebuke from Walker.This led to a robust debate between both figures in the pages of Forward between May and July .Their debate came to be known as the Connolly Walker controversy and later became an historical reference point for the anti-imperialist struggle in Ireland.I participated in a  alongside veteran trade unionist Joe Bowers, Ulster Unionist councillor Chris Mc Gimpsey, and ICTU Assistant General Secretary, Owen Reidy, to discuss the post Walker years and the current situation in the north.Not surprisingly we delivered four very dferent perspectives on Walker and his legacy as well as, Brexit the north strategy and politics on the Left and, future prospects.A very challenging but fraternal debate ensued between the lists and the audience.I opened my comments by saying that any consideration today of William Walker’s legacy needs to be within the historic and contemporary reality that the advancement of socialist and Labour politics has been held back due to the effects of British colonial policy in Ireland.He was a product of his native Belfast and directly influenced by the communal environment within which he grew up.He was a protestant in a largely protestant workforce. Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8685736.1540823328!/image/image.jpg","title":"margaret recognised for 29 years of service","story":"Northern Ireland Chest Heart and Stroke volunteer Margaret McCrory receives an award for  years of service fromDeclan Cunnane, Chief Executive, and Sarah Travers at the charity#s annual conference.Margaret has been volunteering for for  years in the Ballymena area.Ballymena goes for gold at Bloom awards Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"try catch "},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8685096.1540801538!/image/image.jpg","title":"super savings on discount day","story":"Forget Halloween and Christmas, there#s only date that needs to be in your diary this year and it#s the biggest and best shopping day in Ballymena.

Now the proud pilot of an Easyjet airbus , Alex, , graduated from Oxford Aviation Academy earlier this year and is based in Venice.She lives with her Italian boyfriend Edgar, whom she met during her pilot training.It has been  years since Alex left her home in Waringstown at the age of  to start a new le in Canada.The move came about after her mum Alison – a flight attendant for many years – married a Canadian pilot whom she met on her travels. They married in  and the family now live in Kitchener, Ontario, roughly an hour outside Toronto. Inspired by her step-dad Doug Glussich, Alex gained her full private pilot’s licence, her first step towards her dream of becoming a commercial pilot.She said: “Mum was a flight attendant so I was kind of exposed to flying from an early age, but it was when I met my step-dad that I first thought that maybe I could be a pilot.”She admitted that having realised her dream, it was not all plain sailing given that her profession is male-dominated: “I’m based in Venice with EasyJet. I’m the only female first officer and there’s also a female captain. “There’s just the two females out of -strong flight crew.” She said: “I do think things are going in the right direction, especially with EasyJet. They have a scholarship called the Amy Johnson initiative which offers fully paid flight training to females who they pick. “They are trying to drive more females into it, but it is a slow process.” Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"She added: “It can sometimes be challenging. You feel you have to prove your worth.“A lot of the males, the captains, are very good. They take the sex out of it. If you’re a good pilot, your a good pilot – end of story.“Through training I felt that I had to be a little bit better than the boys because I’m a girl.“I have unfortunately encountered a few negative comments, not from any co-workers, but from passengers. It’s been especially from older male passengers when they see a female pilot sitting in the cockpit they things like, ‘maybe I’d be safer getting a dferent flight’. It’s said in jokey way, they’re from a dferent time, but I don’t like hearing it because to me being a pilot is not a joke.“I’ve only had two or three of those comments, it’s not a regular thing.”Talking about the longevity of a career as a pilot, Alex said: “Pilot retirement age is  simply for medical reasons. You have medicals once a year until you get to over , then your medicals come once every six months.”She said: “I’m very settled where I am for now. EasyJet is a fantactic company, they really look after their employees, the money is good, the benefits are good. “To start your career flying an Airbus  is fabulous – it’s one of the best jets around.“However I’ve always had my sights on going long haul. I’d love to try the Boeing ‘triple sevens’, or the s or even the Airbus s, because the bigger the better, right “Before my career ends I would definitely like to try a bigger jet.”She continued@ “The longest flight I’m doing now is from Venice to Edinburgh. It’s two and half hours but from October we’ll be doing Lanzarote and Tel Aviv – those will be three and half hours each.“The Airbus that I fly now simply wouldn’t have the mileage to do more than seven hours. To do that I’d have to go to a bigger airbus – a , or to the Boeing .”Going back to her first time on board an airplane, Alex said: “The first time I was on a commercial aircraft was when I was four years old. I was going to Lanzarote with my parents and brother. “I was really excited. The noise was a bit frightening, but I loved the speed of the take off. “Back in those days you were still allowed to visit the pilots in the flight deck, so my brother and I went up with a flight attendant and I remember wondering what all the buttons were for.”Alex is now pleased to offer the same opportunities to children: “After we land we’ll have young boys and girls coming in to the cockpit. They give you so much respect, and are so interested. “If I could give any advice to the girls out there thinking of becoming a pilot, I’d say go for it.”The reassuring tone of a pilot is something that goes hand-in-hand with air travel, but are the men and women in the cockpit putting on a special voice to talk to passengers or is it their actual demeanour Alex explained: “They say everybody has a PA voice, they just want to sound as professional as they can. When I speak on board, I don’t want to come on with a really thick Northern Irish accent because nobody will understand me. It’s about clarity and getting the message across.”She added: “Pilots don’t only do medical testing. We do psychoanalysis testing. Pilots are calm. It’s in our nature. If a bad situation occurs we need to be able to handle it quickly and efficiently.“They’re not faking the voice, that’s their personality and how they are. That’s why they’re pilots.”Of her own journey she said: “Training was loads of hard work. My programme with Oxford was  months. It’s non-stop.“You have to say goodbye to your social le, but what’s  months in the grand scheme of things.“As a pilot, I’m quite happy to be a passenger. We work hard so it’s nice for me to let someone  fly. I’m completely as ease because I know the training the pilots have been through.”Talking of the most challenging manoeuvres she has had to carry out, Alex said: “When we went to Oxford we had to do upset recovery training. “We went into an aerobatic aircraft which is designed to be able to do all sorts of manoeuvres. “They put us into barrel rolls, spiral es. “Because we’re flying the big jets it’s very unlikely they will be able to get into a spiral e because computer systems have protection it wouldn’t let you. “However we always have to think of worst case scenariothese protections failed.”She commented: “In high school my strong subjects were maths and physics, when it comes to the theory behind flying I didn’t find it too overwhelming.“To get to spin an aircraft is a lot of fun. I feel like I’m in the red arrows.“I’ve been in planes from a young age. “It’s second nature to me, I don’t even flinch at it.”But what of those people who more than flinch at the prospect of air travel Alex said: “EasyJet actually do have a programme from Luton once a year where they take nervous fliers up on a free flight. “They have two pilots up front and two pilots in the cabin with the passengers explaining to them step-by-step from the take off to the landing what is happening and what are the noises you hear.“I can promise you this,it was completely dangerous I wouldn’t be doing it every day. “I think it’s fear of the unknown that makes people afraid.”Askedthere was training in place to deal with terrorist attacks, Alex said: “We do hijack training. We’re trainedanything were to happen we’re able to send out a squawk code which sends a message directly to Air Traffic Control.“Even everyday stuff – before we push back for the taxi until we get to the gate – the cockpit door is closed and will only be open for examplewe need to go to the bathroom. “We need to call cabin crew and they need to come to guard the doorwe have to leave the cockpit. “We take measures to ensure the cockpit door will not be breached. It’s also bulletproof. They’ve changed everything since  .”She explained how she came to be stationed in Italy: “The reason why I’m in Venice is because I met an Italian called Edgar during the training.”Alex and Edgar, , who is from Milan, soon became an item.She said: “Towards the end of our course we were able to say where we wanted to go. Edgar and I said we don’t mind where we’re placed but we’d like to be together. They put us both in Venice.“I’m still struggling a bit with the language – Italian has a lot of grammar in it. To get by I know the basics. It’s great to have an Italian speaker with me, in Italy a lot of places are remote and they don’t speak English.”Asked how much they see of each other, Alex said: “For the first year with EasyJet you’re on a flexi-roster so you can be working for three days then have two days off. “Sometimes we’re on completely opposite shts. He could be starting at am and I can be on lates working pm to midnight. Sometimes we’ll just see each other in the crew room, say hello and that’s it. “Some weeks you pass each other but others we get time off together when we can do whatever we want. It’s part of the job.”Alex said she also tried to go back to Waringstown as much as possible to visit relatives."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8684387.1540633447!/image/image.jpg","title":"competition win up to 10 tickets for this week s calor ni leisure show","story":"Win tickets to the second annual NI Leisure Show which kicks off this Friday, November  and runs until Sunday, November .

We will have state of the art facilities, this will be a top rate training facility for local clubs and schools. Our kids deserve this. There will be high-tech lighting that will illuminate the pitch but won’t effect the houses near by.“It’s vital that local kids get full use of this facility, we want it filled to capacity every day with schools, we envisage coaches training kids here, Gaelic clubs, soccer clubs, after-schools activities and outdoor gym classes. I believe this will transform the community.”Work is due to begin in December andall goes according to plan it should be completed by the end of March.Cllr Baker said the investment by Belfast City Council is a big boost for the community. “This area suffered badly under Lisburn Council and we are delighted now that this huge investment has come into the area.

New graves are only available in Blaris cemetery when someone dies, the days of pre-planning your funeral or purchasing multiple graves are gone, we are almost at crisis point with our cemeteries.”Last year Lisburn and Castlereagh Council was tendered for a new cemetery, however the tender was unsuccessful.Cllr Corr said: “Because of boundary changes people in the Colin area are no longer Lisburn Council meaning they will have to pay more to be buried in Blaris because that cemetery  crematorium is no longer in their jurisdiction.“This is reaching crisis point, we need to have a radical approach, review and rethink around the issue of burials, cremations and cemetery spaces. We can’t wait until the day somebody is refused burial because there is no space.”With that in mind Belfast City Council have come up with the new cemeteries working group to look at these issues and to also come up with ideas around the development of our cemeteries.Cllr Corr said: “I am the party representative on the group and we are coming up with some excellent plans. For example, a new multi-million pound upgrade will be going into Roselawn crematorium.“We still need a new cemetery for North and West Belfast, it’s a very sensitive subject.“Our cemeteries are also in a position where they can become historical and tourist attractions. Look at Tom Hartley’s cemetery tours, they tell the tale of our city, from rich tombs and headstones to poor grounds where thousands of our poor are buried.“Glasnevin Cemetery in Dublin is one of the main tourist attractions on the island of Ireland, it went from being a crime hotspot to being a place of beauty and interest, because it tells the tale of the formative years around the formation of the Irish Free State – our cemeteries are no dferent.“There have been books written about the City Cemetery and Milltown Cemetery.”Cllr Corr continued: “Clton Street Graveyard contains the graves of some historically signicant families, including the Dunvilles, the Sinclairs and Henry Joy McCracken, one of the leading United Irishmen. It was closed to public access approximately  years ago due to anti-social behavior. This has now decreased and the local area of Henry Place has been re-generated and a new business hub has been formed. The graveyard remains locked due to concern regarding the safety of some of the monuments. There are currently regular requests for access from tourists and visitors with a genealogical or historical interest in the graveyard.“Our social, political, economic and religious history are in our cemeteries and we need to have them as places we can use for education.“Take for example the City Cemetery heritage project, we want to bring tourists, academics and school children in as well as the local community.Our cemeteries are at their safest when people are in them, Tom Hartley’s tours have proved that.“The purpose of this working group is to give an extra edge and focus while giving the issues of graves, cemeteries and monuments the attention they deserve.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"newington boss crossan demands swift improvement","story":"Steel and Sons Cup quarter-finalSt James’ Swts vNewington Donegal Celtic ParkNEWINGTON manager, Conor Crossan has demanded an improved showing from his side as they continue the defence of their Steel and Sons Cup title with a quarter-final away trip to St James’ Swts on Saturday. The North Belfast side suffered a - home defeat to Lurgan Celtic earlier this month as they lost ground to Championship  league leaders Annagh United. Last Saturday, they bowed out of the Intermediate Cup following a - penalty shoot-out defeat at Maiden City after the game finished - after  minutes. Crossan feels Saturday’s game is the perfect opportunity for his side to rediscover their form in a competition that is close to their hearts. “We are looking forward to Saturday, hopefully we can get back to winning ways,” said Crossan.“The boys know that the performances haven’t been good enough over the last couple of weeks. “We want to stay in as many cup competitions as we can because of the way the league is structured. “It was a poor result and a poor performance against Lurgan Celtic and we had a few players out last Saturday, but it was sore getting beat on penalties.“You always want to be going into the big games on the back of a win and our form of the last two weeks hasn’t been good. “We are going into this match against a team that has won  from  so they’ll be full of confidence. It will be up to me to get the team up for this game.” As defending champions, Newington will be the favourites to progress, especially considering they play in a higher league. Yet, the progress made by St James’ Swts hasn’t gone unnoticed in the north of the city and Crossan is refusing to underestimate the challenge posed by the Swts at Donegal Celtic Park on Saturday. “People might underestimate the Ballymena League, but you have some great teams in that league – the likes of Bangor and Coagh and teams who were in Championship  in recent years,” added the Newington boss. “They are playing at a good level and they have players who have experience of playing in the Irish League. “They’ll be full of confidence and I don’t think they lost too much sleep when they drew us.“They are the type of team who relish the challenge no matter who they face. “They’ve been making noise for a while now.“They will want to build on that start and keep going, but hopefully we can put a stop to that winning run on Saturday.” St James’ Swts assistant manager Dan Murphy, meanwhile, insists the club is “buzzing” ahead of Saturday’s eagerly-anticipated clash with the defending Steel and Sons Cup champions. The West Belfast side have made an incredible start to the   season and have won all  of their game so far. The only stain on an otherwise perfect start came when they lost the points following their - win over last year’s Ballymena and Provincial League winners Glebe after it emerged one of their players should have been serving a suspension arising from a ban with his previous club. St James’ are aiming to go a step further than they managed in last season’s competition when they bowed out after losing - to Linfield Swts in the last eight.  “The whole club is buzzing, we know how big this competition is. We got to this stage last year and we lost out to Linfield Swts,” said Murphy. “We were - down and we gave a penalty away and went - down. “We got a goal back and we threw everything at them to get an equaliser and we make a silly mistakes and they broke and made it -. “It was a bit gut-wrenching. We wanted to go on further in the competition and we are just hoping to go one step further this year and make it into the semi-finals.” Last season, the Swts challenged for promotion from the Ballymena and Provincial League Premier Division, but fell short at the end of a busy campaign. This season, they are, strictly speaking, unbeaten on the pitch and Murphy feels that is in no small part because of the summer signings made by manager Damien McStravick. “Last year, we knew we had a good team and we were playing good football,” said Murphy. “Towards the end of the season, it was just injuries and suspensions that killed us.“Our squad was a bit light and a few boys had to play with knocks. “During the summer, we made some brilliant signings thanks to Damien McStravick. He met boys who had played at a higher level and sold them on the ethos of the club. “We ended up with a smashing squad. “We kept all the players we had last year and we’ve added a bit more quality to it. “The new boys have all bought into what the club is about and they are enjoying their football.” This Saturday, St James’ bid to continue their incredible start to the season by dumping the holders out of the Steel and Sons Cup. However, Murphy is expecting a tough battle from the North Belfast side given that Newington went on to defeat Linfield Swts in last year’s Christmas Day final at Seaview. “They are a very dogged team and they work hard for each other.

As he was going off, McDonnell reacted to taunts and a plastic water bottle was thrown towards him.This led to punches thrown with several Newington players following him off the pitch as scuffles ensued. Things appeared to have calmed down with the players ing to the field, but the incident then sparked off again as McDonnell was being led to the dressing rooms. Again, players left the pitch, some it seemed were trying to calm the situation rather than join in, but the referee had seen enough, saying afterwards the chaotic scenes were out of control and he had no choice but to abandon the game.What happens now is up to the Co. Antrim FA. The draw for the semi-finals were made on Saturday with East Belfast awaiting the winner of Saturday’s gamethat is to be replayed or not.The Co. Antrim secretary was unavailable for comment this morning, but a decision is expected in the coming days.Click here to watch short Facebook video of the St James Swts v Newington game at https:www.facebook AndytownNews videos  "},{"url":null,"title":"chinabuilt titanic ii to set sail in","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The company behind the plan, Blue Star Line, said the new ship will include all the latest safety and technical equipment to make it fit for the st Century seas. Originally the Titanic was owned by the White Star Line.Reports claim there will be nine decks and  staterooms that can accommodate , passengers and  crew members, the same as the Belfast original.First, second, and third class tickets will be available, just like the original and there will be a swimming pool, gymnasiums, and Turkish bath.However, the engines will be diesel-powered rather than coal fired but the iconic smoke stacks will remain. Clive Palmer, the Autralian business man behind the project said the maiden voyage will take travellers from Southampton to New York on the same route as the ill-fated  voyage. Then it will cruise around the world from Dubai hoping to \"enchant\" passengers with the style of the old world mixed with the new.It has been rumoured the ship will first lt anchor in , however, the company has said it is still in the early stages of planning and due diligence for the plan. “Millions have dreamt of sailing on her, seeing her in port and experiencing her unique majesty. Titanic II will be the ship where those dreams come true,” Clive Palmer said, thereported. A computer generated graphic of the new Titanic II.“The ship will follow the original journey, carrying passengers from Southampton to New York, but she will also circumnavigate the globe, inspiring and enchanting people while attracting unrivalled attention, intrigue and mystery in every port she visits.\"Speculation over the project has gathered pace over recent weeks after a series of announcements from Blue Star Line. On Tuesday it announced it would base its European office in Paris as opposed to London which will open in March .The photograph shows bodies in sacks piled three high on the deck of the CS Mackay Bennett, before being tipped overboard as the ships priest conducts a service. Photo issued by Henry Aldridge and Son.“It is of little use having a European headquarters outside Europe,’’ Mr Palmer said.Mr Palmer confirmed discussions were underway between project’s World Director and suppliers and consultants world-wide to get Titanic II underway as soon as possible.And last week the company announced the appointment of a European director - who had originally been part of the project in  - for the project who will be responsible for commercial negotiations, recruitment and training for Titanic II, the company said. At the end of September, the company released a new technical specications update in a YouTube video. Palmer was a former elected member of the Australian parliament and has announced he is standing again for election under the slogan \"Make Australia Great Again\". He has a dinosaur theme park in Australia and the Titanic project plan has been described as his \"pet project\". A second Titanic II is also being built in a theme park in China. However it will remain docked and not take on sailings.

As a result of this review, which included getting further legal opinion, NI Water now accepts that its interpretation of Article  was too broad and that it therefore had sought to ban certain activities that were not envisaged under the legislation, as currently drafted.\"Because the Assembly is still suspended due to the political stalemate, the legislative processes which are required to bring Northern Ireland into line with Britains practice in regard to hosepipe bans have not happened.Westminster could legislate in the absence of a ing Stormont.But given the pressure of Brexit on business, it is unlikely that Parliament will choose to do so in the near future."},{"url":null,"title":"pictured gang dressed as ku klux klan outside islamic centre in northern ireland","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But they are not just about geology and include sites that are of interest for their history, archaeology, bioersity, folklore, cultural and local heritage.Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos current focus is on firming up the boundaries of the proposed geopark with those involved in compiling the designation confident it has the potential to deliver high quality tourism in the area, increasing the number of international visitors.Officials believe geoparks have a signicant role to play in empowering local communities and giving them the opportunities to develop cohesive partnerships with the common goal of promoting the arearsquos signicant geological and other heritage.There are currently  geoparks found in  countries across the world, all of which have been developed using a bottom-up approach with local communities playing a signicant role in this process. But the global geopark brand does not impose any restrictions on farming practices, planning or development.Further information on the geopark proposal is available via Facebook on Geotourism in Mourne, Gullion and Strangford or for specic queries email geopark@nmandd.org..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Gold for James at cyclo cross race in Belfast  ","story":"A LARGE number of Dromara riders competed in round five of the Ulster Cyclo-Cross series in Musgrave park on Sunday, the event organised by VC Glendale.It was a rainy start to the day, but it did not dampen the spirits of Dromararsquos young riders.Hugh Hetherington, Tom Cowan and Anna Armstrong were the first to take to the course in the U- race.

She loved her dress and having everyone there and danced the whole night. She loved her cake and all the party food.ldquoIt was great to be able to share some of the positive aspects of Meganrsquos le with our family, friends and supporters as there has been so much dficulty along the way.It was very much a family affair attended by Meganrsquos siblings, Hannah, Lily and Stuart, great grandmother Mrs Rosaleen Traynor and her aunt Kelly, who provides a lot of her care.Megan will never have the le that she should have had because of her condition.In many ways, even though the Traynors went on to have three other children who donrsquot have the condition, they were robbed of their hopes and dreams for their first-born.But Megan and her parents felt that it was only right that they should include people at the party who have helped them along their journey so far.In  more than pound, was raised to help Megan become one of the first children from the UK to have pioneering stem cell treatment in China.Unlike some other children who benefited from the controversial treatment, it did not cure or help Meganrsquos blindness.But the Traynors believe that it did help Megan in her mental development at the time, although that has now halted.When her epilepsy and major seizures began to impact on her already compromised quality of le, the local community again rallied around in  to help the Traynors create a safe back garden with sensory equipment, complete with a small hydrotherapy pool to help calm her.Leanne knows that they have been blessed with a lot of help, support and generosity from the local community.ldquoAll I know is that there are a lot of very good people in the Downpatrick area who really pull together when people need help, said Leanne.ldquoThey are people who have helped us and raised money, or who helped get us equipment or whatever, every time we needed it. We canrsquot thank them enough.She said that there were too many to name but she would like to make a special mention of local landscape architect Matthew Morrison, who helped with the sensory garden, the charities RNIB, Angel Eyes, and Murphyrsquos Bar who consistently fund-raised, and Downpatrick Lions Club who organised for a gazebo to be used in the garden for Megan.ldquoIn the early days with Megan, we really didnrsquot know what to expect for her.

It is vitally important the St Dillonrsquos Avenue site is used for the benefit of the community,he continued.ldquoAny future planning applications will involve a consultation process that enables the public to have their say on the future development.The Downpatrick councillor suggested that given the current parking and traffic flow issues at Edward Street, there was a need for an ultra-modern primary school in the town to continue to provide a high standard of childrenrsquos education.He declared: ldquoI believe the St Dillonrsquos Avenue site would be ideal for a new school development and will be writing to the Education Authority to ask that they investigate the sitersquos potential for such a development.ldquoI will also be asking Newry, Mourne and Down Council to review options for this site as it could also be ideal for other community facilities.A spokesman for the diocese of Down and Connor confirmed on Monday that the former St Patrickrsquos Boys Primary School site will be placed on the market for sale.He added: ldquoThe diocesan Trustees are legally bound to act in the best interests of the charity and to consider all offers made through the public market process.ldquoIn the case of sales of former school sites, the diocesan Trustees are required toa substantial percentage of the sale price to the Department of Education in Northern Ireland.A number of people have taken to social media in the wake of news that the former school site is to be sold and expressed concern about the impact its redevelopment could have on an already heavily congested part of the town.Several have suggested a new school should be built on the site, while others believe its redevelopment could have problems securing planning permission given the topography of this part of the town and traffic congestion in nearby Edward Street.A number of people said they would not be in favour of any form of retail development at the former school site..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Staff being followed home by unruly teenagers  ","story":"BUSINESS owners in Downpatrick have revealed that some members of staff have been followed home by unruly teenagers who are terrorising the town centre with their behaviour.The worrying revelation came during a meeting held last week to discuss mounting concern about increasing anti-social behaviour in St Patrickrsquos Square, the Grove shopping centre area and other parts of the town.Within  hours of last weekrsquos meeting concluding, a firework was thrown at a customer as he left a hot food bar in St Patrickrsquos Square, narrowly missing him.Business owners fear someone is going to have to be seriously injured or worse before the ongoing trouble is addressed.They say the anti-social behaviour cannot be allowed to continue in the area, or in any other part of Downpatrick, and insist there must be immediate action to be bring the trouble to an end.Last weekrsquos meeting between local police, business owners and elected representatives was organised by Downpatrick councillor Cadogan Enright, who has revealed there were a number of frank exchanges, with all those in attendance describing the talks as ldquoworthwhile.He also confirmed another session involving the parties is due to be held in mid-November.A businessman said it was ldquoentirely unsatisfactory that people who were trying to do a dayrsquos work should be terrorised by  and  year-old children operating outside the control of their parents and the police.ldquoIt is now getting dficult to recruit staff in Downpatrick town centre, he revealed.ldquoWe do not have these problems in Newcastle or Ardglass. Self-employed retailers pay tax and rates in an expectation that the government and Newry, Mourne and Down Council will ensure that the environment in our town centres is suitable for business and attractive to customers. We expect this situation to be turned around rapidly and not deteriorate further.During the meeting, business owners complained about having their staff harassed and having to close early, losing trade due to anti-social behaviour.Vehicles in the car park at the rear of the Grove shopping centre have been damaged, with business owners and local residentsrsquo group representatives expressing concern that police were not doing more to help bring about prosecutions.Residentsrsquo group members complained that they could no longer let their children play near the Grove or St Patrickrsquos Square, an area which they argued should be a major attraction in the town for adults and children alike.Fears were also expressed that this part of Downpatrick was now becoming ldquoout of bounds for the decent people in the town in the evenings.Cllr Enright said local police welcomed the opportunity to listen first-hand to what businesses and residentsrsquo associations had to say and agreed to meet met with them again next month to track progress in dealing with these issues.He also thanked South Down MLA Colin McGrath for attending the meeting and fellow MLA Emma Rogan for sending her apologies and confirming she will be at the November meeting.ldquoIt was clear that senior police officers were not aware of the scale of the problems in the town over the past nine months, Cllr Enright said.ldquoStatistics of reported crime did not reflect what was going on, with business owners surprised at the low number of prosecutions.ldquoThere appears to be a systemic problem in dealing with youth offending in the Public Prosecutions Service which insists on up to five repetitions of so-called lsquoyouth engagementrsquo by the police before considering bringing forward a prosecution.Cllr Enright suggested this left some of the worst culprits with little respect for or fear of the police.He confirmed that MLAs have been asked to raise this particular issue with the PPS, alongside concerns of people waiting up to  minutes to get through on the PSNIrsquos  number to report incidents.He said concern was also expressed about how reports of assaults, vandalism and intimidation were followed though, with some business owners keen for police to search young people whom they suspect of carrying fireworks.He added: ldquoThere was also criticism of the lsquoinvisibilityrsquo of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos community safety wardens, with some suggestions that robust action against anti-social behaviour issues at the Model Farm area may have been partly responsible for transferring the trouble to the town centre..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Traffic ‘worse than ever’ amid calls for filter lane  ","story":"ROADS officials have been asked to address mounting concern about traffic snarl-ups at a busy junction on the outskirts of Downpatrick.Local people and politicians have been campaigning for a new filter lane at the Ballynoe Road junction with the Killough Road which is dealing with a signicant increase in traffic at peak periods.Vehicles can be queued from the junction as far back as Bishops Brae in the morning with the upsurge attributed to the number of organisations now based at the Downshire Civic Centre.The public sector campus is home to Newry, Mourne and Down Council, the PSNI, Housing Executive and Fire and Rescue Service. The Downe Hospital is also part of the sprawling estate.Mrs Olwyn McColl, who lives at Vianstown Heights, says there has been a major increase in traffic using the junction over the past year and is urging roads officials to address the problem.She says there is available land to provide a filter lane which has the potential to signicantly reduce tailbacks.ldquoThe problem is getting worse and sitting in a tailback, especially in the mornings when parents are taking children to school and people are heading to work, can be very frustrating, she said.ldquoDue to the current layout of the junction, drivers wishing to turn left at the junction have to wait until the traffic in front of them clears. A new filter lane would help reduce waiting times.Mrs McColl said it would appear that an increasing number of drivers heading from the Newcastle direction in the morning were now using the Ballynoe and Bishops Brae roads, which was contributing to the congestion.ldquoThe problem is  times worse than it ever was, there is no doubt about that, she continued. ldquoThings are bad now and they could get worse when the nearby new civic amenity site opens early next year.ldquoMany of my neighbours share my concern and it would be greatroads officials could use the land which is available to provide a new filter lane. It would make such a dference.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran said he shared the frustration of those campaigning for the filter lane which has not yet been delivered.ldquoIn addition to the nearby Downshire Civic Centre, we have a large shopping centre, a nursery and primary school, leisure facility and very busy MOT centre which is all adding to the build-up of traffic at peak periods, he said.ldquoWhile I am delighted Downpatrick has a major public sector campus, we need to ensure the roads system can cope with the additional volume of traffic its provision has generated. An important step would be upgrading the Ballynoe Road junction with the Killough Road.Cllr Curran believes a filter lane would not cost a signicant amount of money to provide and would go some way towards easing the current problem.ldquoThis particular junction is extremely busy in the morning, with a long tail back of vehicles a common occurrence. The creation of a filter lane allowing drivers wishing to turn left out of the Ballynoe Road would help reduce congestion, he said. lsquoThe provision of a new filter lane is a no brainer.Cllr Curran said that while roads officials previously identied a scheme to provide a new filter lane, they subsequently decided that, due to the close proximity of the Glebetown Drive housing area, a new slip road would cause ldquoroad safety issues.He added: ldquoI firmly believe that the time has come to revisit this particular proposal.

It was a conflict in which his uncle, Charlie Dunbar had been persuaded to volunteer for ldquoto fight for his religion.But the experience of what Charlie saw left a deep scar and changed him forever.Adrian was the focus of the ldquoWho Do You Think You Are  on RTE on Sunday evening, and it was a fascinating watch.As we all get a little older, many of us seem to have an increasing interest in our own past, especially our own family history. In Ireland, family is still a powerfully symbolic and emotive part of our DNA, and the programme often reveals some interesting context for inidual celebrities.As Adrian said: ldquoAll of us are interested in our backgrounds where we come from and what yoursquore born into. Those things shape who you are.Therersquos no doubt that we will have been particularly interested in Dunbarrsquos journey into his background after all hersquos one of our own.But the interest in the programme went much deeper and much more meaningful. With several little vignettes showing the complexity of identity in Ireland.A word used frequently these days in all sorts of context is binary, meaning only two parts or ision into two groups. Itrsquos particularly apt to the world view of Northern Ireland. Protestant equals Unionist British, Catholic equals Nationalist Irish, would be the perception.It isnrsquot the case, of course, and shouldnrsquot be. But the troubled th century in Ireland, particularly the last quarter of it, saw both groups driven further into a silo mentality.Irsquove always felt that there was a certain irony in the fact that a violent Republican campaign to achieve Irish unity did, actually, create more ision.Now, the current circumstance of changing demographics in the north combined with the Brexit crisis are focusing on identity as we go forward.Adrian Dunbar is a clever inidual and, indeed, a perceptive one and the story of his family background in the programme was punctuated with comments which should evoke some thought about the past, present and future.Adrian was brought up in Enniskillen in a mainly Nationalist area, though for a few years the family moved to Portadown, Garvaghey Road in fact, where he recalls loyalist paramilitaries parading close by in a show of strength to people in Nationalist areas to know their place. The memory of two communities living apart is eloquently described by Adrian as ldquosocial engineering to suit sectarianism. While Enniskillen was much less hostile, the time, the place and the neighbourhood environment where he and his siblings grew up were far from ideal recruiting ground for the British military.And yet, on his mother Pauline Camplingrsquos side, there is an incredibly strong link and a history of service going back three generations.Adrian visited St. Michaelrsquos Church where Frankie Roofe was able to give him intriguing detail of his great-great-grandfather coming to Enniskillen as a soldier from England and converting from Church of England to Catholicism.Recounting some of the history of the Inniskilling Fusiliers, when the regiment ldquoheld the line for Wellington at Waterloo about half of the  men were killed, Adrian himself pointed out that about a third of the men spoke only in Irish. Itrsquos a quirk of how history develops that hundreds of years later the native tongue of men who died serving the British Army is somehow portrayed controversially as anti-British.Adrianrsquos grandfather, Walter Campling served in the Inniskillings, and three of his sonshad distinguished service in the British military in world war.The programme shows Adrian coming home to Enniskillen to discuss this with his brother Liam.Interestingly, though, Liam said that because they were brought up in Nationalist areas they didnrsquot go round talking about their ancestorsrsquo British military service. And Adrian himself said that the idea that he and his siblings would have followed the tradition of their three previous generations had gone.Such service to the British military by Catholic Nationalist families was common, as a look at the names of both communities on the Enniskillen War Memorial show.Yet, it was a feature not talked about in recent history and illustrates the complexities of identity that weave their way through our communities.Conversely, of course, the perception suggests that all Protestants consider themselves ldquoas British as Finchley and thatrsquos just as much an oversimplication. Surely the two identities donrsquot slot handily into their own homogeneous monolith There were a couple of telling moments, I thought, in the Dunbar programme.His uncle Charlie, whom Adrian remembers fondly dishing out sixpences, had been convinced in the late s to join the Irish brigade fighting for the fascist Franco in the Spanish Civil War under the guise of fighting to preserve the Catholic religion against the evils of Communism.On hearing some of the shocking atrocities that his uncle witnessed, Adrian reflected: ldquoPeople do a lot of things in the name of religion, donrsquot they  Sadly, as we know only too well in the north.And he added: ldquoThe combination of religion and politics is not a good one.And there was another line which struck me. Adrian was shown a photo of Queen Victoriarsquos state visit to Dublin in  when the city was still under British rule.He was shown the regimental band, including his grandfather, and considering the protest and fight for independence in Ireland which was about to change everything, Adrian referred to his grandfather and other comrades as being ldquoon the wrong side of history.A century on from that Royal visit, the country saw a war of independence, a civil war, decades of conflict in this part of the island and more recently more Royal visits by the current Queen both north and south of the Border.And now itrsquos a pertinent question to ask what side of history the ious identities are on now.The confusion and uncertainty over future membership of the European Union has thrown the subject of identity to the forefront, and there is the suggestionthat the issue of Irish unity is firmly on the agenda.To be honest, I donrsquot think evena Border poll was held that it would result in unity just now.But herersquos a thing. On Sky News last week, journalist Adam Boulton was interviewing Scottish Deputy First Minister, John Swiney and his opening question was: ldquoWhat do you think is more likely to happen first, a united Ireland or an independent Scotland The fact that he asked it seriously is telling, as is Swineyrsquos serious reply which began, ldquoItrsquos a close run thinghellip.In the current political climate, the DUP say they are engaged in a ldquobattle for the Union. Aside from the fact that all politics here seems to boil down to that, in this case the DUP may well be right.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I have been moved to tears by so many honest and heart-wrenching accounts.I canrsquot even begin to imagine the pain of losing a child at any stage of le it is inconceivable for those who have never suffered such a loss. But sadly, itrsquos more common that we imagine.It is estimated that one in four pregnancies in the UK ends in miscarriage, defined as a loss of pregnancy up to a gestation of  weeks and  days. A loss after that is considered stillbirth and in  there were , stillbirths ndash thatrsquos nine babies stillborn every day ndash and , neonatal deaths.As part of baby loss awareness week, bereaved parents, along with their families and friends have been coming together, joining with others across the world, to commemorate their babiesrsquo lives.The campaign was started  years ago and yet the fact remains that in our society, it is really only in the last couple of years that we have started to talk openly about baby loss.Indeed it remains a subject that few of us feel completely comfortable navigating. I will admit that before I became a mother three years ago, I had conversations with women who lost their baby during pregnancy and I know I didnrsquot handle those conversations very well.Maybe there isnrsquot a right thing to say, but I recognise now that that I, like so many of us do, shied away from much,any, conversation. Despite knowing that the phrase ldquoIrsquom so sorry was lacking, I refrained from empathising any further or asking questions because I felt I didnrsquot have the right words, I was afraid of saying too much, of saying the wrong thing, of being insensitive, and most of all I was afraid of upsetting that mother.But what I have learned since is that many women ndash and men ndash who have said goodbye to a child in pregnancy or during birth, want to talk about the loss. They donrsquot want you to cross the street to avoid them. Many want you to askthat baby had a name, or when his or her birthday would have been. Of course, itrsquos hard to know any of this unless we have the opportunity to have open and transparent conversations about such a sensitive and dficult issue.Talking about the subject of death is still quite taboo in our society, particularly when it is the death of a baby. But we shouldnrsquot underestimate the importance of talking about baby loss. Not only does it help those who are grieving, helping them to process what has happened, to stop blaming themselves and feel less alone in what can be an emotional and physical rollercoaster, it also gives us all the opportunity to develop the tools and language to discuss this emotive subject with greater understanding, helping to normalise something that is common - and indeed normal - but not talked about enough.Itrsquos ironic and perhaps a cruel reality of social norms that women are encouraged not to tell people about pregnancy until after the first trimester when sickness abates and the risk of miscarriage is greatly reduced. Surely the early stage is when pregnant women need compassion and understanding. The expectation to remain silent during the first  weeks of pregnancy means many couples faced with loss are left to grieve without the support that they need. After all, it doesnrsquot matter whether the loss of a baby is at eight weeks gestation or  weeks, the trauma felt by those who loved and wanted each child are the same. They had imagined their new family they had probably considered whether that baby was a boy or a girl and all sorts of other exciting plans.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This campaign is aided and supported by a number of the Prime Ministerrsquos own Conservative Party members.Sadly, what we are witnessing from many sections is an anti-British position rather than a debate based on any sound principles as to why there are not more pragmatic positions on providing a good deal for everyone involved.As someone who voted to remain within the EU I am extremely disturbed at the antagonistic stance being displayed by the European Union towards the democratic wish of the majority of the citizens of the United KingdomThis has brought me to thinking thatthis is their attitude in general to the UK, then we are better out of this vastly over regulated group. What is even more surprising is the attitude of the Irish Government. They are our near neighbours and have signicant trade with the UK, but are certainly making no attempt to have a conciliatory attitude to finding a positive deal.Given the potential economic loss to the Republic of Ireland, Irsquom curious as to why they are not attempting to use their influence, by their public utterances and in discussions with other EU members, to provide a more assuaging attitude to the situation. This I feel would be more conducive to sustaining beneficial trading relations between the two nations post Brexit.Thankfully the United Kingdom has a strong economy which has supported and assisted many smaller nations, including the Republic of Ireland in the EU for many years.It is hugely positive that Northern Ireland is part of the UK, the fth largest economy in the world. Moreover the UK is a signicant influencer throughout the world and a society that is a leader in freedom of democracy.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But late yesterday it seemed certain to pass without a deal on the UKrsquos withdrawal.Speaking after being briefed by the EUrsquos chief negotiator Michel Barnier, Mr. Tusksaid he saw ldquono grounds for optimism ahead of the European Council summit.ldquoAs I see it, the only source of hope for a deal for now is the goodwill and determination on both sides, Mr. Tusk told a Brussels press conference.ldquoHowever, for a breakthrough to take place, besides goodwill we need new facts.Mr. Tusk said he would ask Mrs. May whether she had concrete proposals on how to break the impasse saying that only such proposals can determinea breakthrough is possible.Reports from Brussels suggested senior European Commission officials were casting doubt on the prospect of a special Brexit summit being declared for Novemberthere is no movement on the key issue of the Border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.Mrs. May won strong support from Cabinet colleagues on Tuesday as she set out two key ldquosticking points preventing the conclusion of a withdrawal agreement.The issues relate to the ldquobackstop agreement demanded by the EU to avoid a hard Border by keeping Northern Ireland within the European customs area.Mrs. May has countered by offering to keep the whole UK in a customs union, but only for a temporary period.She issued a plea for unity as she said she remained determined to secure a Brexit that would respect the result of the  referendum, protect jobs and security and preserve the Union.ldquoIrsquom convinced thatwe as a Government stand together and stand firm, we can achieve this, she said.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Projected as three-screens, the film was cleverly edited to juxtapose the ying yellow line constructions, from the scouts lining up their yellow kayaks to the farmers forming their line of yellow bales.With the use of dramatic aerial shots, the formation of the yellow lines could be seen clearly as they cut through the landscape, representing both the Border and itrsquos people. The film received great response from the audience participants as they witnessed the powerful result of their involvement.With lsquoAcross and In-Between,rsquo Suzanne Lacy highlights the wit and cleverness of Border le in the face of political pressures, focusing on the power of play in creatively responding to complex issues.Suzanne commented: ldquoOur project draws those who live along the often-invisible boundaries between countries into a conversationmdashmetaphoric and literal ndash on personal and symbolic meanings of this border and by extension all such borders drawn by political forces.ldquoThe artwork explores inverse paradigms: visible and invisible, official and unofficial, rural and urban, the real border and imagined ones. For a brief time, we suggest there is a unique in-between identity for those situated between two countries ndash a Border people ndash and through playful acts we explore this liminal identity.lsquoAcross and In-Betweenrsquo was co-commissioned by - NOW, the UKrsquos arts programme for the First World War centenary, and Belfast International Arts Festival, with the support of the Government of Irelandrsquos Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade .Across and In Between was co-created with Cian Smyth, Helen Sharp, Mark Thomas of Soup Co, Pedro Rebelo, Conan McIvor, Helen Sloan, Eva Grosman, Garrett Carr and people in Pettigo, Tullyhommon, Castlesaunderson, Magheraveely, Newtownbutler, Cuilcagh Mountain, Counties Fermanagh, Cavan, Monaghan and Donegal.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Bring a large saucepan of salted water to the boil, add the potatoes and simmer until tender, about  minutes. Drain well, and while still boiling-hot, crushthe potatoes and allow the steam to escape - the drier the mash, the firmer your fish cakes will be.. Leave the mash to cool before stirring in the egg, coriander and green chilli. Generously season with salt and pepper. Set aside.. While the potatoes are cooking, whizz the salmon, ginger and lime zest in a food processor until they form a thick paste.. Peel the outer layer of the lemongrass and discard. Cut the stem in half ways and chop as finely as you are able. Add to the salmon paste, then add the salmon mixture to the cooled potato, combining well. Divide the mixture into eight and shape into patties.. Dip each one into the breadcrumbs to coat and put onto a large plate or baking tray. Chill in the fridge for at least an hour to firm up the fishcakes.. Place a large, heavy-based frying pan over a medium heat. Heat the sesame oil and butter together in the pan until beginning to foam, then fry the fish cakes in batches, until golden on both sides.. To make the dipping sauce, combine all the ingredients and pour into a small serving dish. Serve the hot fish cakes with the dipping sauce.Prue: My All-time Favourite Recipes by Prue Leith, photography by David Loftus, is published by Bluebird, priced £.

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here.

It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In factyou’d said to me  days ago there would be tourists in Portadown town centre I’d still have laughed.   The ghostly figure to the left of News Letter reporter Graeme Cousins However, last week I was one of nearly  tourists walking the streets of the Co Armagh town as part of a ghost tour organised by Portadown Heritage Tours, a branch of the local Orange Order.And it was to be a ghost tour with a rather appropriate ending ... when a ghostly apparition joined the touring party for a final snap.As the tour came to an end our guide Lisa Partridge gathered us together for a group photo close to the site of the  massacre at the Bann bridge. She remarked that it was the site in Portadown where a ghost sighting was most likely.She took the snap and I thought nothing more of it until Lisa shared the photo the next day.   An artists impression of the  massacre As I scanned the image my eyes were drawn to a figure just behind me in the image that hadn’t been there when the photo was being taken.In the space between the two ladies positioned fth and sixth from the right, what looks to be a lady in profile view, with her hair pulled back, can be seen lurking in the background.I don’t believe in ghosts and my explanation would be that it’s a coincidental arrangement of leaves at the fence behind us, but all the same it did send a few chills up my spine the first time I saw it.Others in the office agreed that it did look a lot like a human form, and was certainly a lot sharper than some of the blurred images often attached to ghost stories.   St Marks Church in Portadownthe spot where the last man was hanged in the town Lisa said: “It wouldn’t be the first time a ghost has shown up in a picture taken in that area.“We took a picture last year under the bridge down at the Bann river and we picked out what looked like the outline of a mother holding the hand of her child.“It fits in with the  rebellion stories and the massacre that took place at the bridge here.Road closed after serious collision Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"“We tell people that this area is where they’re most likely to get a sighting.”   Tour guides Ashleigh Todd and Lisa Partridge The -year-old explained how she got involved in historical tours of Portadown: “I’ve always had an interest in history, but was a bit wary of finding work after a history degree, so I did business studies instead.“I came to the heritage tours from a retail background. The idea of heritage tours is we want to move the Orange Order forward.”Portadown Heritage Tours was set up with the help of funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund.Lisa, a member of WLOL No  in Edenderry, said: “It’s about community tourism. It’s local people telling local stories about places people walk past every day but don’t realise the signicance of them.“Our normal three tours are a town tour, a Drumcree tour and then the tours ofhall.“Through the history we were gathering from the other tours, ghost stories started appearing. The majority surrounded the  massacre at the Bann bridge during the  rebellion.“For that there was actual documentation from witnesses about the apparitions.“When you start looking for something it’s everywhere. People started coming forward with ghost stories.“We ran a ghost tour last year as a pilot and it keeps growing.“We’ve started getting into more of the stories this year.“Anyone can claim they’ve seen a ghost, so we try to seethere’s an historical event that can be linked to the sighting orthere’s been any documentation of sightings in that area, in newspapers or from other sources.”She added: “Whenever I go on holidays I always try to do a ghost tour. You get dferent ones where people get into character, but for this tour I just wanted to strip it all back and focus on the stories. “There won’t be people jumping out at you or we won’t be embellishing the stories to make them more scary.“It’s suitable for all ages, though there’s some walking involved to get to the locations around the town.”The -stop tour begins at Carleton Street Orange Hall and finishes at the site of the  massacre at the River Bann. Askedshe had ever seen a ghost herself, Lisa said: “There’s one in Carleton Street Orange Hall. I haven’t seen it personally but I’ve heard it.“It’s the ghost of William John Locke . There’s times it’s just been me and another girl in the office and % we’ve heard footsteps going up and down the stairs.“There’s times you feel like someone is watching you.“That said, I wouldn’t say it’s a scary place to work.”Askedthere had been any objections within the local order to running a ghost tour, she said: “Everyone involved with the heritage tours are members of the loyal order. “Our ethos was that the Orange Order needs to move forward, and put out the hand of friendship.“To do this we’ve opened up the doors of the hall and invited people in to come and see. It’s not an Orange museum but it’s living history.“There’s been no objection from the Orange Order to the ghost tours, in fact some of them link back to the Orange Order. As well as Locke, the last man hanged in Portadown was an Orangeman. The  rebellion also has big links to the Protestant culture, there are memorials at the site.“While there are Orange links this tour is very much cross community. The people who are coming have been   from both sides of the community.“We’ve had a lot of people coming from the west – Tyrone, Dungannon.“We don’t have a set cost yet, we just ask for donation only. Things are still at an early stage and we want to add more stories as well.”Portadown Heritage Tours which is attached to the Orange Order have been running tours of the town for the past  months.They began running tours of Carleton Street Orange Hall as well as tours of the town and Drumcree. The ghost tour came about as a result of information uncovered on their other tours.The final ghost tour of the month takes place on Tuesday at pm from Carleton Street Orange Hall.

Ulster Business speaks to Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI and some of those burgeoning firms it has developed strong relationships with over the decades Long-term support is very much at the heart of the decades of partnership between Bank of Ireland and its business customers.And whether it’s offering a wide range of financial assistance, growth support or general advice, the bank has formed le-long partnerships with companies from right across the sectors, and from the large to the very small.It’s been there for three of its longest-running customers – with a combined almost -year history – from the start, and played a key role as a partner in each of their own growth stories.Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI at Bank of Ireland UK, told Ulster Business:“We base our business on a relationship management model – we spend a lot of time with the businesses, we know the owners and their management teams, their growth objectives and ambitions and understand the businesses.“That enables us to provide the right suite of products – challenging business plans, providing funding and help. There’s also the chance to introduce them to potential customers, signpost to expert advice, and become a partner to that customer, rather than just be a funder. It’s very much a partnership approach.“We provide lending facilities to business from the very small micro firm, right through their le-cycle, their growth phase, and scaling up to small and medium-sized businesses.”And for Gavin, it’s all about offering a range of services and assistance “under one roof”.“We have the ability to lend up to £m for business customers. There is the consistency to our approach, and that’s really important in the Northern Ireland market.”Partnership is a phrase that continues to raise its head in Bank of Ireland, regarding both its relationships with business customers, and the longevity and generational nature of the companies it’s developed long-term relationships with.“We would have many instances where a mother and father have built a business, and now the second generation is taking on the management,” Gavin said. “We are involved across both generations, and we are very privileged to be part of that family and business development.”“It’s in our interest that the company continues to grow and thrive and we have been very important in that role.”Nowhere is that more evident than with the hugely successful family-owned McKeever Hotel Group.What started out as a family restaurant business in Randalstown, Co Antrim back in , has blossomed into a burgeoning food and hospitality business boasting five hotels across Northern Ireland and Donegal.And the McKeever Hotel Group is still very much a family affair. In the last  years, the breadth of the business has grown to include Corrs Corner in Newtownabbey, the Dunsilly Hotel in Antrim, Ballymena’s the Adair Arms, Dillons in Letterkenny, and its latest hotel, the Dunadry in Antrim.Today, Eugene McKeever, along with his we Catherine, daughter Bridgene and son Eddie, run the thriving hotel empire which employs around  part-time and full-time staff.“The family business started in  when my parents opened the first restaurant in Randalstown – my dad was a chef and mum was teaching,” Bridgene, who is marketing director, said.“They then bought Corrs Corner. That’s when Bank of Ireland really become involved in the company and helped us out.“We have been supported by Bank of Ireland in a number of ways.”That includes the multi-million pound funding for the refurbishment of the Dunadry Hotel, in addition to funding support provided for the acquisition in .“Bank of Ireland has been with the company during its entire history. In , with the Adair Arms, we were one of the few people back then who were buying, due to the recession,” she said.“There has always been trust and the faith with the bank. My dad has always said – speak to your bank manager, and be honest with them.”The McKeever Hotel Group’s single biggest investment has been with the -bedroom Dunadry.Gavin says that one of Bank of Ireland’s core objectives is to help “customers to thrive”.“In doing that, it covers a lot of dferent things, and it’s not just about being profitable,” he said.“We specically tailor our packages to the customer needs. Their success, is our success and we are very privileged to be part of that growth story.”Eamon McCay started his cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff, boasting a turnover of £m.And he’s been helped along the way by Bank of Ireland amid ongoing expansion and growth. It’s a relationship which has so far lasted more than  years, and shows no signs of slowing down.“I started Frylite in , delivering fresh oil and collecting used oil. I combined all of the areas in one,” Eamon says.And that initial  sq ft building has grown to five depots across Ireland, with a further site on the cards for yet more expansion. “We supply our vegetable oils to hotels, fast food outlets, commercial businesses, bakeries, industrial food service sector… it’s been gradual growth.”A depot in Galway in  was followed by another two years later in Dublin, with Coleraine and Cork following a short time later. And its Strabane base is now a , sq ft building on a four-acre site.Since , Bank of Ireland has provided facilities to the business including invoice discounting, asset finance and term and cash flow ending, and also previously used stockline facility.Speaking about his strong relationship with Bank of Ireland, Eamon says a commercial finance package ensured the businesses growth.“The bank have gotten to know the business. I felt like I have had a partner, which is invested in the business. Building good relationships is one of the values,” he said.But it’s not just about providing help and finance to customers. Bank of Ireland is sponsor of Catalyst Inc’s Invent competition and is also working with organisations such as the NI Chamber and CBI to showcase and help companies improve skills, digital prowess and scale exports.Another business with a more than two-decade relationship with Bank of Ireland is Pinnacle.And just some of the Sage Platinum Reseller’s top customers include everyone from the Irish Football Associationand Ulster Rugby to Titanic Belfast and Mash Direct.The software partner, which was set up in Belfast in , now boasts a team of more than  experienced providers of Sage business management software solutions, IT services and support.“Going from humble beginnings, the company has grown into a £m business,” Fran McKee, Pinnacle’s marketing director said.The firm, which is headed by founder Ken Montgomery, has been supported by Bank of Ireland through its stages of growth, which has included organic expansion and acquisition. “We have a solid partnership with Bank of Ireland, which has nurtured our business since its inception in .”The firm offers businesses solutions from simple to more complex business needs with Sage. It now has  offices across the UK and Ireland, but according to Fran, there is “massive growth on the agenda”.“We want to be a £m business within the next few years and as well as growing our Sage ision we want to also grow our IT services offering and with the bank’s support we’ll achieve our growth ambitions.  You can come to us as a one-stop-shop for IT and software requirements.“Customers today are very focused on providing a good service as well as achieving their growth ambitions, so they want to have the software in place to help them make decisions and run their businesses effectively.”And Gavin says the key message is that Bank of Ireland is a “proven and consistent funding partner for businesses over a long period of time.”“We work hard to build a great rapport and great trust with our clients and these long term relationships are testament to that. It is exciting to share the journey of young and small businesses to growth and expansion and we’re keen to help the next generation seize new opportunities for their businesses.” ■View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"pinnacle marks  years with huge bash in portugal","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Belfast firm Pinnacle – a leading provider of Sage software and IT solutions – has celebrated  years in business by taking more than  of its staff to Portugal for an an all-expenses paid trip.The company, which has branches throughout the UK and Republic of Ireland, flew its workers to a five-star resort in Vilamoura, to mark the occasion.The five-star celebrations included welcome lunch overlooking the Vilamoura Marina, followed by spa treatments and water sports.

It’s through getting to know our clients and their business that we can best share our knowledge and advice around the type of financial support they need.“At First Trust Bank, having listened to what our customers wanted, we invested in six new business centres across Northern Ireland to support fast, local decision making. We also established a Small Business Centre to meet the needs of our smaller customers. Now firmly embedded in their respective communities, these centres – coupled with our expert sectoral advisors – are on hand to help business owners identy opportunity and risks and how best to mitigate or capitalise upon them.”Richard Donnan, head of Northern Ireland at Ulster Bank, says it “is strongly committed to supporting businesses of all sizes, from micro firms right through to large corporates”.“Our latest results show a % in small business drawdowns, and we continue to work hard through initiatives such as our Boost initiative and our Entrepreneur Accelerator to build mutually beneficial relationships with firms across Northern Ireland. “A key focus for the bank is the development of digital services that make it simpler, easier and safer for customers to bank with us. “Our digitally active customer base grew by % year-on-year and we are continuing to respond to that change, for example, by introducing our Business Growth Enablers and through the development of our digital s such as our mobile app.”But it’s not all bank financing. The Growth Loan Fund offers assistance to Northern Ireland-based companies who demonstrate growth, and tend to work within the manufacturing, engineering or tradable services sectors. “Loans will be typically unsecured and personal guarantees will not be sought. The loans provided are expected to be complementary to existing sources of finance, including banks, trade finance sources and equity investors.”Some of the companies availing of the finance include Belfast-based BLK BOX Fitness, which secured £, to grow its online  and boost exports, along with Fermanagh gin-maker Boatyard Distillery.Meanwhile, the BGF was set up in  with £.bn and has since backed close to  companies. Last year, BGF was the UK’s top institutional investor and ranked the seventh most active private investor in the world by number of investments. Upstream is a Belfast-based alternative finance company specialising in SME funding, and has also now introduced a trade finance option for clients. The market-first solution unlocks the ability for businesses to finance their working capital needs end to end, from supplier to buyer.Niall Harkin is director of customer journeys at Danske Bank. He says “personal engagement is still really important” when dealing with small and medium-sized firms looking at expansion.“That’s why last year we introduced a team of  dedicated small business advisers back in to key branches across Northern Ireland, giving customers access to expertise in their local area to discuss business plans and explore funding options,” he said.“Meanwhile, teams of experienced relationship managers supported by specialists in areas such as cash management, markets and trade finance, support our larger SME customers.“At the same time, we’re investing heavily in our digital offering, and recently added the capability for SMEs to get lending decisions in a matter of minutes in ious situations. ‘future financing’ makes the whole credit process much easier for our customers. For an overdraft, we’ve seen approvals in four minutes and access to money well within  hours. “In the future, customers should be able to go online and request an overdraft increase on a smartphone at home.”But aside from the financial support, businesses here can also turn to the support from hubs. That includes Ormeau Baths’s Barclays Eagle Labs – which is located at the south Belfast listed building – and the Ignite NI Propel Pre-Accelerator. The options are out there and available for companies wishing to take that next step, whether traditional banking or alternative streams are the way to go.

The Northern Ireland Hotels Federation said a \"shudder\" was going through the industry, which comprises  hotels and , bedrooms. In Belfast, , rooms were added over the past year, thanks to new construction of six new venues, including the Hampton by Hilton and the Grand Central, and extensions to two existing hotels. The federation said the market was going through a \"stutter\" with occupancy and room rates going down. \"It is important to note that demand for hotel rooms has grown over the last year, but it hasnt kept pace with the increase in supply,\" it added. A separate report by PwC put the cost of an overnight stay in a Belfast hotel at £.

Overall analysis shows a reduction in occupancy levels and a decline in rate.\" She said Northern Ireland needed a new tourism selling point - suggesting something like Failte Irelands Wild Atlantic Way promotion, but for the north west and west coast. \"Demand is growing, but this needs to be accelerated with a number of interventions, including increased promotion, a bigger marketing budget and a proposition of scale for Northern Ireland along the lines of the Wild Atlantic Way,\" she added. \"Measures like this will allow the market to adapt to and absorb new supply. There has been a seismic change and a response of equal measure is required to create new business.\" Ms Gault said challenges for the sector included skills and staff, as well as Brexit, which had led to \"considerable uncertainty\". \"Added to this are the issues around tax, in particular VAT, access constraints and capacity at key attractions,\" she said. \"You can see why the market is experiencing a shudder as we come to the end of an era of exceptional trading.\" And while  would be quiet in comparison to the flurry of openings in , it was \"far from dormant\", the federation said. There are to be new openings in Londonderry and Newry and Mourne, while ventures on the north coast are now \"dependent on what has become a protracted planning process\". But Ms Gault said that despite some problems, the hotel sector \"has strong prospects\". However, drawing in more visitors was paramount. \"We need to increase the size of the tourism cake to ensure that each hotel gets a good slice of business,\" she said. \"Having spent in the region of £m, the hotel sector is keen to see aon this investment and a realisation of the industrys potential.\" A full briefing on the forecast takes place this morning at a business breakfast at Hospitality Exchange, which is taking place at the Crowne Plaza, Belfast.

Belfast City Council’s planning committee approved Primark’s listed building consent application for the Bank Buildings. It means the conservation-led works to take down the top two floors of Bank Buildings can now begin. “Once these unstable elements are removed, works can take place to install a facade retention scheme,” the council said. “It will also make it possible to reduce the cordon and restore pedestrian access between Royal Avenue and Donegall Place, subject to health and safety considerations as work takes place.” It also means Primark will be able to open up once again, at the building’s new extension. Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium , said: \"This is terric news for Primark and for the retail hub of Belfast City Centre. Now that planning has been granted they can start the work to bring down the facade and put up the protection that will allow the cordon to reduce and for stores within the cordon to open. “This will be a le line for those traders in the cordon and those without who have seen their footfall drop by over %.
