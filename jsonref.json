This is vibrant and modern Middle East, where millions of people come every year for holiday and work.  Jamie\u0027s grandmother,  Fiona Oomes, said the youngster was \u0027having to endure more than most adults would be able to cope with\u0027.\u0027His physical health deteriorated considerably due to stress when incarcerated, and his mental health is fading. We are all desperately worried for his safety and his life.\u0027           Jamie\u0027s empty bed at home where he sleeps surrounded by his favourite toysCharlie,  from Nothumberland, and the boy\u0027s mother are in the process of orcing and he has faced the threat of arrest ever since his son refused to return to France.The unnamed mother is said to have claimed that her husband kidnapped Jamie and turned the youngster against her. She sought a French court order to force the child to return to France. But his aunt, Moira, based near Hexham in Northumberland, said she would be \u0027terrified for him if he goes back\u0027. She said the youngster had told a counsellor that while in France there were times when \u0027he went to sleep at night and wished he wouldn\u0027t wake up in the morning\u0027.She said 40-year-old Charlie, who works in shipping, would have been willing to go to one of UAE\u0027s prisons for his child - but realised he would not have been any help behind bars.Eventually, Charlie agreed to hand Jamie over to his estranged wife at a family centre court in the UAE in an attempt to \u0027keep on the right side of the law\u0027.But the family said Jamie screamed as he was taken away, refused to go with his mother and was then taken into the orphanage.Mrs Oomes said: \u0027What is a father supposed to do faced with trying to keep on the right side of the law by trying to return his son to France, whilst also trying to respect Jamie\u0027s wishes to stay with him in Dubai, and of course protecting his son\u0027s right to live in a protective, loving and stable environment.\u0027This is not a custody battle situation. Jamie refused to return to France before any custody was sought through French courts following the parents\u0027 separation. \u0027This is about a nine-year-old child being locked away because his wish is to stay living in Dubai with his father. This is about the human rights of a British child being completely ignored. This is about saving the life of a child who is not able to cope with his current predicament.          Family members have begged Theresa May to intervene after launching a petition to \u0027save Jamie\u0027s life and bring him home to his loving family\u0027           The family has said that the children’s centre near Dubai (file picture) has 25ft high walls and that it has been described by some as \u0027a cross between a jail and an orphanage\u0027\u0027Following Jamie\u0027s refusal to return to the family home in France saying he was extremely frightened of his mother, the relationship between his parents deteriorated with Jamie\u0027s dad respecting Jamie\u0027s rights and wishes, and wanting to protect him by providing a loving and stable environment at his second home in Dubai.\u0027Jamie has seen his father just once since then during a monitored visit and despite seeing his mother for the first ten days of his stay at the centre, remained adamant he would not return with her.The child, who has two younger siblings who live with their mother, had to be seen by medics because he could not stop being sick after one meeting with French officials, Moira said, adding hat she did not blame UAE authorities for the situation.The petition says: \u0027(Jamie\u0027s) human rights are being violated by the French authorities - not the authorities where he is, who have always been correct to Jamie, but are obliged by a bilateral agreement to grant the requests from the French authorities.

As many as 90 Tory MPs are threatening to defy her in the ‘meaningful vote’.Today the Treasury will publish a major economic analysis that is expected to show that a no-deal Brexit would be a disaster compared with the PM’s blueprint.The 150-page paper will set out the impact of scenarios, including Mrs May’s Chequers deal, the so-called Norway option, the ‘Canada Plus’ model and a no-deal exit.The analysis is expected to warn that no deal would have a dire impact. The Bank of England is also expected to publish an analysis showing it would hit house prices.          Asked to choose between Mrs May’s plan and leaving the EU with no deal, voters opt for no deal by 41 per cent to 35          In other Brexit developments yesterday:Boris Johnson tried to muscle in on a planned TV debate between Mrs May and Jeremy CorbynNo 10 said the PM would snub Donald Trump at this week’s G20 meeting after he said her proposals could wreck hopes of a trade dealIt emerged that Mr Trump’s intervention came hours after her plans were attacked by Nigel Farage on the President’s favourite TV showAllies of Mrs May warned Brexiteers that Britain could be forced into a permanent customs union if parliament rejects her dealCar industry bosses warned that failure to agree a deal would be ‘catastrophic’MPs warned of chaos at ports under no dealDowning Street confirmed it would publish only a summary of attorney general Geoffrey Cox’s legal advice on the backstopFormer defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon described Mrs May’s deal as ‘doomed’An attempt to woo Labour MPs appeared to have flopped after just 26 turned up to a briefing by Mrs May’s aides and none said they would back her plan.          Asked to choose between Mrs May’s plan and the prospect of a Labour government, voters favoured the Prime Minister by 46 per cent to 31 per cent          Today’s poll asked voters whether they agreed that Mrs May’s Brexit deal was ‘not ideal but the best on offer’ – 52 per cent agreed against just 19 per cent who did not          Today’s poll asked voters whether they agreed that Mrs May’s Brexit deal was ‘not ideal but the best on offer’ – 52 per cent agreed against just 19 per cent who did not.Forty-four per cent said the EU would not make further concessions to the UK if Mrs May lost. Nor do voters think a new Tory leader such as Boris Johnson would do any better, with only 25 per cent saying ousting Mrs May would increase the prospects of a better deal.Almost half of those polled said the Prime Minister would have no choice but to resign if she lost the Commons vote.Tory supporters are more sympathetic: well over half said she should stay in office in defeat. Tellingly, when the Brexit vote is framed in the way that Mrs May has put it – that Brexit is ‘the best deal for UK and MPs should back it because it is time to get on with Brexit’ – she gets a clear thumbs-up. A total of 49 per cent agree, with 22 per cent against. The results will be seized on by Downing St as evidence that while MPs are against Mrs May, voters are with her and are impressed by her dogged determination.The poll suggests however that this does not translate into enthusiasm for her deal.          Boris Johnson tried to muscle in on a planned TV debate between Mrs May and Jeremy CorbynAsked to choose between Mrs May’s plan and leaving the EU with no deal, voters opt for no deal by 41 per cent to 35. When asked to choose between the Prime Minister’s plan and staying in the EU, voters opt to remain by 46 to 37. And faced with leaving with no deal and staying in the EU, voters opt to remain by 50 to 40.Further support for staying in the EU is reflected in growing backing for the campaign for the ‘People’s Vote’ – in effect a second referendum.A total of 48 per cent support the idea with 34 opposed. But the public is in no doubt about the potential humiliation caused by any decision to reverse Brexit at the 11th hour – 47 per cent say it would damage our international standing against 24 per cent who disagree.Damian Lyons-Lowe, boss of Survation, the only polling company to get the result of the 2017 general election right, said: ‘The results show the deal doesn’t please anyone, but the public knows it is the end of the negotiations and think that they – and MPs – should be realistic.‘They regard Mrs May’s deal as the least worst option and better than a Labour government.’A total of 1,030 adults took part in the online poll yesterday afternoon.Brussels has launched a campaign to lure finance and insurance firms away from London. The Belgian government is hoping to poach them by pointing out that companies would have a ‘passport’ to the EU’s single market.It is hoping another draw will be the close proximity to key EU institutions such as the Commission.Cécile Jodogne, the country’s secretary of state for foreign trade for the federal region of Brussels, said: ‘Brussels is where key European decisions are taken.’    Changing tack now will only make things worse Analysis by SIMON WALTERSSome Tory MPs have said Mrs May’s deal is ‘as dead as a dodo’. But the Survation poll suggests that while the public regard it as an ugly duckling, they do not want MPs to kill it off in the Commons vote.The survey provides the clearest evidence yet of the mass confusion caused by Britain’s Brexit crisis.Bearing in mind it says MPs should back Mrs May’s deal, you would think her option would fare well when compared in a straight contest with the two other main options: ‘no deal’ favoured by Jacob Rees-Mogg, and remaining in the EU, favoured by Tony Blair.Not so. In a political version of rock, paper, scissors, when asked to choose between Mrs May’s deal and ‘no deal’, voters choose the latter. Asked to pick between her deal and Remain they opt for Remain. When asked to choose between ‘no deal’ and Remain, Remain wins.By that reckoning, Blair wins, with Rees-Mogg second and May last.          May at Queen\u0027s University in Belfast, during her visit to Northern Ireland, where she has been speaking about her Brexit dealBut that is all hypothetical.When the only question that matters for now is put – should MPs back Mrs May on December 11? – the answer is yes. How can these conflicting findings be reconciled?The public thinks Brexit has become a mess but it is too late to do much about it – and that to change tack now would risk causing an even bigger mess.  "},{"url":null,"title":"University chiefs admit tutors pressure inflate grades","story":"    Staff may be tempted to hand out more top marks because they fear bad reviews in student feedback surveys, they said (stock image)The confessions come in a report which claims that better teaching and more dedicated students have led to more top degree results – but a proportion of the change over the last decade remains ‘unexplained’.The study was commissioned by Universities UK, which represents vice chancellors, amid fears that degrees are being devalued. Some 24 per cent of graduates are now awarded firsts, compared with 12 per cent in 2008.Meanwhile, the proportion of degrees awarded at least a 2.1 – referred to in the report as an ‘upper degree’ – has jumped from 56 per cent to 71 per cent.\u0027Lynch them all\u0027: Horrifying video shows two white North...Mom, 45, shot dead by a Bronx gunman through her PEEPHOLE...Share this articleYet UUK says today that the rise risks ‘undermining confidence in the value of a degree’ and ‘making the classification system less useful’.Its report suggests around one in seven 2.1 and first-class degrees last year were likely to have been awarded due to factors such as grade inflation. For first-class degrees, 43 per cent could be attributed to this. The report notes for the first time that the pressure from students who want ‘good degrees’ has created ‘incentives to increase upper degrees’.It says: ‘There is likely to have been a system-wide inflationary dynamic that has contributed to the increase in upper classifications over time.’Professor Andrew Wathey, vice chancellor of the University of Northumbria, said: ‘This report shows that there is a clear need for the higher education sector to take action to grip the issue of grade inflation.’           Professor Andrew Wathey, vice chancellor of the University of Northumbria, said: ‘This report shows that there is a clear need for the higher education sector to take action to grip the issue of grade inflation.’ Pictured: City Campus East of Northumbria UniversityThe report was produced by UUK, GuildHE and the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education.It found some of the increase in firsts and 2.1s could be explained by factors such as ‘additional investment’ and ‘heightened student motivation’.However, a portion of the increase remains ‘unexplained’ and ‘could be due to unaccounted factors and, potentially, inflated grades’.The study says many employers screen out any candidates not achieving a 2.1 or first, meaning students are desperate to get these grades. In addition, tutors may be tempted to give out more high grades because they fear getting bad reviews from students in official feedback surveys.And because the proportion of 2.1s and firsts awarded at universities now features in consumer league tables, institutions are under pressure to hand out more too.The report even notes that some universities create targets for staff to increase the number of top grades they hand out.UUK said it was now planning changes to the degree classification system to tackle ‘perceptions of grade inflation’.Universities are independent of the Government and are free to set their own grading systems but are answerable to the Office for Students regulator."},{"url":null,"title":"Owner giant Perth steer named Knickers describes beasts huge appetite","story":"    The seven-year-old behemoth named Knickers is believed to be the biggest in Australia and one of the tallest in the world, measuring  6ft 4in (194cm) to his shoulders and weighing more than 3,000lbs (1,400kg)          Knickers was only slightly shorter than Mr Pearson\u0027s son Tex, 17, (left) who stands at 6ft 7in (204cm), and is even taller when measuring to the top of the massive beast\u0027s head          Even if the farm wanted to make him into thousands of hamburgers, he quickly became too big for any production facility to process          Knickers\u0027 huge size would affect his life expectancy, but Mr Pearson thinks he has a few good years left and so far didn\u0027t need any special looking after as long as he had enough food and waterCattle in general are also getting bigger due to selective breeding of the heaviest and therefore most lucrative cows for meat production.The average size of cattle across all breeds is 1,386 lbs (630kg) - up 18 per cent in the past two decades.Mr Pearson said his herd of 20,000 had a high turnover and all the steers Knickers started with were sold or sent to the abattoir at least three years ago, but he would stick around for the rest of his days.\u0027He\u0027s our favourite and one of our best assets, he\u0027s part of the furniture now,\u0027 he said.Holy cow!

We came up with some fun chants and the whole restaurant stood up when we sang \u0027Stand up if you love meat\u0027.\u0027A protest is fine, but they overstayed their welcome and were becoming annoying.

The other seven candidates were far behind Putin in the polls.Observers reported widespread ballot-stuffing and unprecedented pressure on Russians to vote, but that is unlikely to seriously damage Mr Putin given his popularity and his tight control over Russian politics.Mr Putin\u0027s most serious rival, opposition leader Alexei Navalny, was barred from the race because of a fraud conviction widely seen as politically motivated.The electoral commission said official turnout was 67 per cent, but the figure was marred by widespread accounts of workers being coerced to vote and numerous incidents of ballot-stuffing.           Putin (right) served two presidential terms between 2000-2008, then shifted into the prime minister\u0027s seat because of term limits. But he continued to call the shots while his ally, Dmitry Medvedev (left), served as placeholder presidentMr Putin has never faced a serious threat to his rule since he came to power on the eve of the new millennium. He won 53 per cent of the vote in the 2000 presidential election, 71 per cent in 2004 and 64 per cent in 2012.The massive victory gave Mr Putin new confidence to stand up to the West.The election came amid escalating Cold War-like tensions, with accusations that Moscow was behind the nerve-agent poisoning of a former Russian double agent in Britain and that its internet trolls had waged an extensive campaign to undermine the 2016 US presidential election.The accusations ultimately bolstered Mr Putin among a populace that sees him as their defender against a hostile outside world and the embodiment of Russia\u0027s resurgent power on the world stage.The election was such a foregone conclusion that Mr Putin gave only a perfunctory victory speech and said nothing about what he will do for his country.\u0027We are bound for success,\u0027 he told chanting crowds near the Kremlin at the time.Mr Putin\u0027s electoral power has centred on stability, a quality cherished by Russians after the chaotic break-up of the Soviet Union. But that stability has been bolstered by a suppression of dissent, the withering of independent media and the top-down control of politics called \u0027managed democracy\u0027.In his next six years, the president is likely to assert Russia\u0027s power abroad even more strongly. Earlier this year, he announced that Russia has developed advanced nuclear weapons capable of evading missile defences.The Russian military campaign that bolsters the Syrian government is clearly aimed at strengthening Moscow\u0027s foothold in the Middle East, and Russia eagerly eyes any reconciliation on the Korean Peninsula as an economic opportunity. "},{"url":null,"title":"George Amal Clooney set Prince Harry Meghans born childs godparents","story":"    George and Amal Clooney are all but confirmed to be among the lucky godparents of Prince Harry and Meghan\u0027s first-born child, DailyMail.com can reveal.

It is more than twice the height of the London Eye, the next-tallest moving visitor attraction in the capital.The planning application was lodged on 13 November and has already attracted some opposition from local residents.Manuel Kaiser told City of London planners during a public consultation that “the proposal reeks of desperation in its straining after ostentatious effect”.Anastasia Shteyn seconded Kaiser and said: “I don’t understand why we need this phallic-shaped attraction, with little aesthetic merit.

It will be published in September 2019.“Dear Readers,” wrote Atwood in a press release announcing the book on Wednesday. “Everything you’ve ever asked me about Gilead and its inner workings is the inspiration for this book. Well, almost everything! The other inspiration is the world we’ve been living in.”The Handmaid’s Tale follows one woman’s struggle to survive in a dystopian future America, renamed Gilead, where women possess few rights, are used as breeding vessels and are not allowed to read or write. The novel was first published in 1985, and quickly recognised as a modern classic.It has sold more than eight million copies in English and has gained a new readership in recent years, because of its perceived relevance amid global discussions of sexual harassment, abortion rights and the rise of populist politicians such as Donald Trump. The critical success of the 2017 television adaptation, starring Elisabeth Moss in the lead role of Offred has also helped extend the book’s audience.The Testaments will be set 15 years after Offred’s final scene in The Handmaid’s Tale and narrated by three female characters. It will not be connected to the television version, which has extended beyond Atwood’s 1985 novel to continue Offred’s story.The novel ends enigmatically, with Offred being placed in a van that will possibly deliver her to freedom outside Gilead. An epilogue is narrated by an professor delivering a lecture about the authenticity of Offred’s story in the year 2195, based on cassette tapes he discovered in Maine.“As a society, we’ve never needed Margaret Atwood more,” said Becky Hardie, deputy publishing director at Chatto \u0026amp Windus. “The moment the van door slams on Offred’s future at the end of The Handmaid’s Tale is one of the most brilliantly ambiguous endings in literature. I cannot wait to find out what’s been going on in Atwood’s Gilead ­– and what that might tell us about our own times.”Atwood has previously teased a sequel, most recently in an audiobook adaptation for Audible. At the end of the epilogue, she added a Q\u0026ampA session that ended with the lecturer saying: “I hope to be able to present the results of our further Gileadian investigations to you at some future date.”“I am in consultation with the professor, but he is being very cagey about this,” Atwood told Canadian website the Loop at the time. “He evidently doesn’t want to make any promises before he has finished authenticating his new discoveries.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc4cd54df61d1a9505d5017b1bb9b7c30978b67b/0_77_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=48adae54bb09ee2ed38b1c7b46c22c55","title":"ikea profits revamp takes toll","story":"Ikea’s profits have fallen by more than a third as the world’s biggest furnishing retailer invests in improving its online business and tests smaller city-centre stores.During the year, the group invested €2.8bn, the majority of which funded 14 new distribution centres to cater for online business. It also bought windfarms in Finland and Portugal and forests in Latvia and the US, as part of its sustainability efforts, and acquired the odd-job gig economy app TaskRabbit.The fall in profits came after Ikea said last week it was cutting 7,500 office jobs worldwide, including 350 in the UK, to focus on improving its online operation and city-centre format.The Swedish group, which employs 160,000 people, said the jobs would go over the next couple of years, and would mainly affect administrative staff in central support functions across the 30 countries where it operates.Juvencio Maeztu, the deputy chief executive and chief financial officer of Ingka, said: “During the year we have increased our efforts and investments to start to transform our business. While this has had an impact on our results, it is a conscious decision for us to start a three-year period to transform our business and be better equipped for the next 75 years. Our financial strength enables us to invest over the long term, and with purpose, in our own future.”Ikea stores worldwide are owned by 11 franchisees, of which Ingka is the biggest with 367 stores.

There were already some lovely tributes to him online, praising his determination to keep fighting against inequality and his desire that younger generations understand the horrors of war.I struck up a friendship with Harry back in 2013, when I read something he’d written for The New Left project about his time serving in the second world war and was moved to try to find him. The editor of the site kindly gave me his email and I dashed off a quick message asking him if he’d let us run the piece on the . To my surprise, he replied almost instantly, giving me permission and striking up a conversation. The piece is worth reading again, a passionate plea to the modern world to remember the ideals that those who endured the trauma of war pinned their hopes on upon coming home. “The Green and Pleasant land was for everyone after the war because we had bled for it and died for it. We demanded a truly democratic society where merit was rewarded and no one would be left behind because of poverty, poor health or an inadequate education.”We continued to email across continents – Harry in Canada, me in London. He was funny and kind to me when I was going through a difficult time in my life, and was always up for writing a piece, and filed on deadline – an editor’s dream! I think his two most-read pieces were probably his explanation for why he would no longer wear a poppy on Remembrance Day, and his eulogy to the NHS. People marvelled at the progressive and forthright views of this nonagenarian, railing against injustice and the creep of rightwing ideology, all at a time in life when most of his peers were either well into their retirement or dead.But my favourite piece he wrote for the  was about his son Peter’s struggle with schizophrenia. Mental illness is shrouded in stigma, and even now people often shrink from those with a diagnosis like the one his son was unlucky enough to be given, but Harry described tackling it with warmth and understanding and, above all, with love. Having dealt with mental health problems myself, his openness and acceptance moved me to tears as I read his copy. It was another example of his ability to learn and grow at any age, not fossilise and retreat into ourselves, as so many of us do. His son later died, another huge loss in Harry’s life. He suffered many tragedies in his long life, starting when his sister Marion died in a workhouse infirmary. He spoke of his grief bluntly, but never lost his optimism about the world, despite what he had experienced – a feat many of us could not manage.His articles in the  grabbed the attention of a publishing house, and he was commissioned to write a book about his life and his fury that the UK was returning to the inequalities of his childhood. Harry’s Last Stand came out in 2014, his first book published when he was a sprightly 92. He was flown over from Canada for the launch, which the publisher held, rather incongrously, at the Garrick club in London – a private members’ establishment for the elite. I was invited to dinner there, my first meeting with him after more than a year of communication. When I arrived, I was ushered over to meet him, a small man with oversized glasses and a flat cap on, drinking a shandy (I assume the barman at the Garrick has since recovered from the shock). He hugged me to him, and sat me next to him over dinner, where he held my hand and thanked me for ushering in this new phase of his life. Sometimes writers are a disappointment in real life, but Harry was better. He knew of what he spoke, read everything he could, stayed up to date with the modern world, took no nonsense.While in the UK, he was hugely in demand, defending the NHS at the Labour party conference, touring the country with his book, appearing on the news, debating with Owen Jones. He kept me up to date with his whereabouts – at a B\u0026ampB in Yorkshire, at a hotel in Wales. He had naps, but carried out a packed schedule, energised by the message he wanted to convey, and thrilled that people were listening.On a later trip to London, I took him to the pub with my friend Ollie, a photographer who has an interest in capturing veterans. After his usual shandy, we took him outside for an impromptu photoshoot, the results of which you can see above. He was game, as usual, and tickled that someone wanted to snap him, joking about his best side.I left the  a few years ago, but Harry kept on writing. His last piece for the paper was in September 2017, about Britain’s housing crisis. His unique skill came in combining tales from his past with warnings about our society’s future. He was not nostalgic for the prewar days, but keen to talk of the deprivation, the awful inequality, the lack of a safety net for those most in need of one. Having lived through those times, he was well equipped to speak about what he saw as a return to those days – creeping privatisation, the selling-off of the NHS, the growing space between the ultra rich and everyone else. He urged us to strengthen the social safety nets, to band together in communities, to demand more from our leaders than cuts, austerity and policies led by fear.His popularity was, in part, because his wisdom came from his long life. We have all lost something in his passing: a link to a time that most of us cannot imagine and have no desire to. For me, personally, I’ve lost a man who sort of felt like family to me in some way. My grandfathers both died some years back, and Harry felt like an wonderful last-minute gift. An unfailingly kind man, who lived his values and grabbed his chance at a second act with both hands until the very end. We should remember his lessons, and be thankful we had the chance to hear them. I shall miss him very much.• Bella Mackie is a freelance journalist and author of Jog On, a book about running and mental health"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e00ca7f46c80179411a8c110b67111b1047fa0b3/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=812753a71fb7d6cd35a575aedc7f2c3f","title":"jack ma ai dystopian cities communist party china","story":"On the outskirts of Hangzhou, eastern China, in Alibaba’s Cloud Town, a Silicon Valley-style working and leisure hub, cutting-edge research in artificial intelligence (AI) and smart city developments at one of China’s largest tech companies are showcased. It is a half-empty dystopia of almost comic proportions where the future of automation and infrastructure in southern China is played out. While Alibaba exhibitions and conferences occur sporadically, the full scope of what goes on there remains hidden.Having long claimed to be apolitical, Jack Ma, the billionaire co-founder and executive chairman of the tech giant Alibaba, was recently revealed to be a member of the ruling Communist party of China (CCP). It’s another in a long list of links between corporate and state apparatus that stretch far beyond the borders of China. Nevertheless, a glimpse into the projects the company is working on in Cloud Town, considered in light of these revelations, should set the alarm bells ringing with fear of a dystopian future of state and corporate control.Technologies in development at Cloud Town range from AI pedestrian crossing lights that use facial recognition to identify the age of a road-crosser and give them a longer green light if they are oldslow enough, to AI drone cars that can respond to passengers needs.The greatest feature of the car, explained the proud representative, is that its media panel, linked to the user’s smartphone, reads patterns of movement, food choices and potentially even photos and comments, and then crosses this with millions of data sets to make predictions about what the user might like to eat and how they might like to travel there or have the food travel to them. In short, the new citizen outsources part of their decision-making processes, and maybe even part of their desire, to Alibaba. Our very impulses are mapped and planned in advance. The triangulation between data, predictive technology and desire could be the single most important relationship taking us into the dystopian smart city future.It’s not so far from the technology of Google Now that has made headlines since plans for its implementation in 2012. Here a previously neglected aspect becomes visible: Alibaba could use its complex algorithms to privilege food outlets that use Alipay rather than those that use WeChat pay or have no e-payment system, for example. Likewise, if Google answers your questions before you’ve asked them, it also moves you down paths you might never have otherwise taken. It’s the early implementation phase of a predictive tech revolution in which desire is not only predicted but incrementally edited to suit particular agendas – in this case corporate ones.But the possibility made crystal clear by the revelation that Ma is now (and perhaps has been for some time) a formal member of the CCP is that this process of editing a population’s movements and desires might not only be in the interests of corporate parties but of the closely associated state.Alibaba’s rival Tencent is another major tech company with close connections to the Beijing government. Its heat map feature tells users where crowds of people are forming – taken to its extreme, such a tool could be used by authorities to prevent street protests. What Alibaba seem focused on, however, is developing subtler ways to organise the movements and even desires of citizens in the future city. Will that too be in the service of the corporate state?The danger here is that the focus in the west will be on what this shows about China’s extreme dystopian tendencies, which we posit in opposition to our own apparently democratic landscape. The tendency is to report on China’s hi-tech authoritarian future as if it is not our own. In fact though, what seems oddest about this revelation is how it chimes with patterns we’ve seen, at least in the US. As Srećko Horvat has pointed out, it is significant that former Google CEO Eric Schmidt was appointed head of a Pentagon committee designed to integrate Silicon Valley into the intelligence services.Ultimately, this is less about communism than it is about a new brand of corporate tech-driven capitalism. Without more visibility and awareness of what’s being built, we cannot see how these technologies are re-organising their citizens.• Alfie Bown is the author of The Playstation Dreamworld, a philosophy of games and politics"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a67ddfaadc772721ebee08d0f38f841bf8de8330/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=100aee9ef14e7de53b8b8b103661b71c","title":"john mcdonnell plan transform britain labour brexit","story":"You can’t doubt the dedication of the crowd packing out this London concert hall on a Tuesday night. For an audience with John McDonnell, they have braved all the muck that a November evening can throw at them. They line up at the end for selfies and book signings. And the very mention of rent controls is greeted with an ovation.Yet they’re here with good reason. Interviewing the shadow chancellor for this  Live event, it strikes me that what he says and does over the next few weeks matters more for him and for the rest of the country than at any time during his previous 40 years in politics.In just a few days, MPs vote on Theresa May’s Brexit deal. Beyond that lies the very real prospect of a general election, or even a full-blown constitutional crisis. And in the background hangs a big question: how radical can any Labour government be? Given the keys to No 11, how far can McDonnell change Britain?Because, rest assured, that is his aim. Asked about plans for the first 100 days of a Labour government, McDonnell says they must be “transformational”. He promises an immediate increase in the minimum wage, “putting money into people’s pockets”, and a restoration of rights to trade unions. Even without an election, Jeremy Corbyn is already petitioning May to meet senior civil servants about how to turn Labour policies into law. Meanwhile, each shadow frontbencher is going back through the 2017 manifesto and writing out their own department’s “implementation manual”.What about those much‑debated plans for nationalisation? McDonnell wants water and rail to be the first two industries taken back from the private sector. Energy will take longer, partly because he wants to foster more local energy companies, as is common across much of Europe.McDonnell has been talking for a only few minutes, and already he has outlined enough work to last any government a decade. Such expansiveness is remarkable for anyone around my age, whose political memory consists in large part of Labour leaders from Neil Kinnock onwards starting with modest, focus-grouped pledges and getting more cautious the closer they get to a poll. Not McDonnell, who now has a plan to recast the British economy in three parts.First there is what Paul Johnson, head of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, calls “the most radical tax-and-spend plans placed before the electorate by one of the main parties in more than 70 years”. Even they, mind, don’t add up to a reversal of the cuts we’ve seen since 2010. Then Labour proposes re‑engineering the financial system so that it does much more than simply lend money to homebuyers. The biggest and toughest job of all is changing the rules by which markets and businesses are run, such as putting workers on company boards and changing how executive pay is set.The obstacles to McDonnell’s plans are well laid out in a new book he himself has edited. Called Economics for the Many, this varied anthology of ideas and arguments includes a chapter by Simon Wren-Lewis. The Oxford professor writes: “If Brexit goes ahead and we leave the single market, the UK is likely to remain a depressed economy with low interest rates, and highly vulnerable to negative shocks. As if that were not bad enough, Labour will also face a media that seems incapable of thinking of fiscal policy as anything more than just good housekeeping, and which has not understood how large a mistake austerity was.”The word mistake might more aptly be substituted with “crime”, but as a summary this is hard to beat. McDonnell’s response is interesting: it is to signal a big change in Labour’s thinking on Brexit. “I’ve been working through the various scenarios,” says one of the most determined strategists in British politics. First, MPs will chuck out May’s deal, but probably set her the task of tweaking it. But even that, he thinks, will lose a second vote. Throughout, Labour will carry on calling for an immediate general election but McDonnell admits the parliamentary maths means this probably won’t happen. The hard-Brexiteers hate May’s treaty but they know turfing her out will be tantamount to their own career suicide. The DUP might similarly decide to prop her up. At which point, the shadow chancellor says, a people’s vote “might be an option we seize upon”.The ballot paper for any second referendum would have two choices: May’s deal and remain. In a 180-degree turn from the position he took during Labour’s party conference in September, McDonnell would not include an option for no deal “because of the damage” it would cause the economy. And yes, he would be a remainer. Labour, he says, is a European party.No wonder Theresa May pounced on these remarks in prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, because this could mark a turning point in the politics of Brexit. After years of what Labour insiders call “constructive ambiguity” on where they stand on leaving the European Union – the hasty call for article 50, the six tests that spell fudge – McDonnell accepts that “we’re running out of road” and that the party will have to jump one way or another. There is still some fantasising about Labour drawing up its own withdrawal agreement, but the sense I take away from Tuesday evening is the shadow chancellor has settled on a plan B – to be seen to exhaust all the options before reaching the destination of a second referendum, which he now describes to the BBC as “inevitable”.Two things stand out about Labour’s present thinking on the economy. The first is how many of the problems McDonnell wants to address have been tackled before by Labour governments. Harold Wilson’s government had plans for public investment institutions and wanted to create a department of economic affairs to rival the Treasury. It failed, and not just because George Brown wasn’t up to the job. A quarter of a century ago, Tony Blair latched on to Will Hutton’s The State We’re In, with its proposals to democratise the economy – until he dropped it for the candyfloss of the Third Way.The civil society that helped previous generations of Labour politicians generate those ideas is much thinner now. The Greater London Council, in which McDonnell began his career in politics, was once an incubator of alternative political ideas. But Margaret Thatcher did for the council and flogged off its base, County Hall. A similar decline and shrinking has befallen many of the other institutions that could foster alternative visions of society, from the unions to even the BBC. All of which means that, if McDonnell and his colleagues are to try to repair the damage that has been done to this country by austerity, and before that by the Thatcherite thugs, they will need more than the Labour party. They will need a full-blown social movement."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f930e2f6c0b1b1870b6501c7fcc9fd61dd2a44e6/0_162_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28b608521d518b99b48819df3d0a88bb","title":"theresa may support brexit deal","story":"Theresa May’s Brexit tour of Britain – she was in Scotland today promoting her EU deal – speaks simultaneously to her strengths and her weaknesses as a politician. The strengths are often too lightly dismissed, and not just by those who primly disdain her as simply an evil Tory. But it is May’s judgmental weaknesses that still shape the political landscape as she battles to carve out a Commons majority on 11 December.No one I have spoken to at Westminster this week believes May will get her deal through next month. But what a sleepless effort she is putting into overturning the odds. Selling her dog’s dinner of a deal, and in the face of daunting parliamentary arithmetic, May’s determination to succeed appears quixotic, going on suicidal. Yet her resilience in the face of a relentless schedule of Commons grillings, government meetings, speeches and summitry – her trips this week to Brussels, Belfast, Builth Wells and Glasgow are now followed by the sapping 14-hour flights to and from the G20 summit in Argentina – is awesome.What is more, her efforts are being noticed and approved of by the public. Last Thursday there was a 13-point opinion poll swing over only seven days in May’s favour as the best prime minister for Britain. And today a survey reported in the Daily Mail pointed to a similar shift of opinion in favour of her Brexit deal. Don’t get this wrong: the country remains deeply ided. But there is momentum in favour of May’s deal across the board – including among Labour and remain voters.Here is a prime minister doing her best to give politics a good name. The Tory party is luckier to have her than they know. Yet there is something seriously disjunctive about barnstorming around the country when the 649 voters who will shape the country’s fate are all across the road in Westminster. Watching May’s one-woman attempt to bring order and compromise out of the chaos of which she is in so many ways the author, it is hard not to conclude: c’est magnifique, but it’s not very good politics.Maybe we’re all wrong. Maybe May’s efforts to rally the public will create pressure over the next two weeks to push enough MPs into her lobby. But she would have had a far easier time if throughout the Brexit process she had reached out more thoughtfully to the majority of MPs, who would – and possibly still want to – support a workable compromise.Right now, though, it is defeat that looms for May. The consequences could be seismic. I bumped into a historically minded old colleague this week who immediately said, with a mix of excitement and horror: “It’s 1846 all over again. It’s 1886. It’s 1922. It’s one of those moments when everything is recast.”My friend may well be right. But in some ways May’s problem goes beyond those that were faced by Peel, Gladstone or Lloyd George. May’s problem is not simply that extricating Britain from the EU is itself hellishly difficult after 45 years of convergence. It’s that the crisis through which she is attempting to navigate is ensnared in a constitutional tangle that those earlier leaders never had to face – the conflict between referendums and representative democracy.Right from the start May seemed to intuit the size of the political trap that was created by a referendum vote to support an outcome – Brexit – that most MPs and all the main parties opposed. The wish to “parliamentarise” the referendum vote of 2016 lay behind her decision to call the 2017 general election. She hoped she could win a mandate to require Tory remainer MPs to back her version of Brexit.If she had won, then referendum and parliament might have been aligned, albeit in a bad Brexit cause. Her failure in the election did not just throw away the Tory majority and empower the backbenches and minor parties. It also left the conflict between referendums and parliamentary government fundamentally unresolved.As a result, all of the issues that were launched by the 2016 Brexit verdict have remained unresolved too. The referendum said leave. But it never said what it wanted leave to mean, beyond exiting the EU. It was silent on the terms of withdrawal and the future relationship. It never said what should happen if the terms were unsatisfactory or if they split the country. It never said what should happen if some of the component parts of the UK voted differently from the majority. It made no provision for second thoughts or for the kind of citizens’ assembly that helped Ireland to find a solidly based way through its recent abortion referendum.The 2017 election also meant that May had to change her approach to Brexit. She no longer had the votes in parliament or the authority over her party to deliver the hard deal she had proposed in October 2016. She needed to take a fresh approach but was culpably slow to learn this lesson, and it is why she is staring defeat in the face today. Her Brexit tour is thus a kind of general election campaign without the public vote.May has never been a good collegiate politician with other parties. As home secretary during the coalition frombetween 2010 and 2015 she simply pretended the Liberal Democrats did not exist. After June 2017 she was too damaged to take Brexit out of the hands of the Tory nationalists and to explore a version that other parties, and Labour backbenchers in particular, might have been persuaded to support. She stood up to the nationalists only towards the very end of the negotiation process, forcing several to resign but coming back with a deal that offends committed leavers and remainers alike.None of this has been easy in a hung parliament, with the two major parties both deeply split. None of it is simple in a political culture relentlessly undermined by an overmighty and not very good media. Attempting it is hard at a time when the digital revolution has usurped the earlier influence of now much diminished institutions, communities and interest groups that once helped to make parliament, for all its imperfections, the cornerstone of national decision-making.But it has to be done. The disruption of parliamentary politics by the referendum, combined with May’s failure to reach out to Labour, has left British politicians in a weak place from which to reassert the authority of representative government. But it is the problem to which Britain and other modern democracies need an answer. It is not just Britain’s relationship with the EU that will be on the line as MPs vote on 11 December. It’s parliamentary democracy too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c4490d4b8545aa1e89ffae9f3f12d19dd9af3f0/0_0_941_573/master/941.jpg?width=685\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3b0c4a09736ddfc8b460ca3ebe4f47d2 685w","title":"the arts have the power to change communities","story":"I worked at the British Film Institute when Jennie Lee was the arts minister (This philistine government is failing the arts, 26 November). We were grateful to her for persuading the Labour government to support the arts relatively generously. But this shouldn’t hide the fact that her view of the arts was a traditional one. When she visited the BFI, she thought its main role was to make films about established art forms. She had no sense that cinema might deserve the same interest as literature or painting. Oddly, the only arts minister I came across who had a sophisticated knowledge of cinema was a Conservative, Grey Gowrie, who on one occasion showed a good knowledge of who Samuel Fuller was.Alan LovellCoventry• I agree with Hannah Jane Parkinson on the state of arts funding and that Jennie Lee proposed the best hope for the arts in 1965. I benefited from this, along with other arts workers, but the funding engine seemed to run out of steam in the mid-70s. A number of theatre directors who worked in this period have said that although we took the arts to the people, in the end the people didn’t come to the arts as much as had been hoped. If this was the case, can anyone explain why? Those of us working to improve arts funding for future generations need to know.David CockayneWarrington, Cheshire• A big thank you to Hannah Jane Parkinson for her eloquent exposure of this government and the arts. As a footnote, may I offer the case of British theatre? Many years ago, it was argued, and won, that every town and city should have a public library. For years, I have tried to argue that the country of Shakespeare should have a theatre in every town and city. Young people should be as familiar with theatre as they are with internet offerings.Theatre companies should be residential in towns and cities so that they are identified as an essential part of the community. Plays should be put on by local people and performed back to back with Shakespeare, Wilde, Stoppard and Caryl Churchill. When researching this years ago, I spoke to cultural spokespeople at the German and Italian embassies in London. The German said (I paraphrase): “Why do you treat your actors they way you do? With us, they are respected and valued, like lawyers, teachers or doctors.” The Italian said anyone in Italy who got on a bike could see live opera.Who’s going to pay for this? The same as libraries and parks, it’s a fundamental component of every civilised British community.Ian FlintoffOxford• Like Paul Barry (Letters, 27 November), Hannah Jane Parkinson’s article brought back memories for me. In 1994, I was commissioned by the North West Arts Board to write an information pack on theatre in education. As the effects of Thatcher’s national curriculum and transferring of funding from local education authorities to schools hit the eight companies I studied, the pack’s purpose was to persuade schools to fund what had been the LEAs’ responsibility. Responses from schools suggested it shouldn’t be too hard. “He’s somebody else – he never listens normally,” said a Liverpool primary teacher, enthralled as her reluctant learner engaged earnestly with the ship’s bosun. “They want to learn, don’t they? It saves so much time and effort when pupils want to learn.”But the most telling response came from a Wigan teenager. “Before I went to see the production I did not like black people.” But “Ian asked us to read what was wrote. It made me sick what white people were calling black people, and when I got out of the production I was shaking with rage. I just can’t write enough to describe how much your production has made me question myself, like have I ever made fun of black people.”Thanks to Thatcher and Conservative policy, few teenagers are likely to have their lives changed so dramatically. Within a year that theatre-in-education company and two others had gone.John AirsLiverpool• David Cameron once made an interesting intervention on the subject of British arts. He said he thought British film-makers should concentrate more on making blockbusters in competition with the Americans. My suspicious mind wondered whether he was irked by the way postwar film-making, from Woodfall and the “kitchen sink” onwards, has often tended towards anti-establishment socio-political dramas. How often have Tory ministers ground their teeth at critical acclaim given to Ken Loach’s films? But, of course, this is what has given British films their unique flavour, just as the Beatles et al did for pop music. Cameron would doubtless have preferred a return to a McCarthyite era, where serious films gave way to light comedies or noir thrillers.But there was an amusing intervention of a different sort from a Tory, John Major, in the 1990s when, trying to surf the Cool Britannia craze, he praised The Full Monty, unaware apparently that this featured a group of workless guys reduced to stripping for a living because Major’s party had destroyed the industrial base of their city.David RedshawGravesend, Kent• Join the debate – email • Read more  letters – click here to visit guletters• Do you have a photo you’d like to share with  readers?

This will depend on better farming methods, wealthy nations consuming less meat and countries valuing food which is nutritious rather than cheap.The report, which was peer reviewed and took three years to compile, sets out the scale of the problems as well as evidence-driven solutions. The global food system is responsible for a third of all greenhouse gas emissions, which is more than all emissions from transport, heating, lighting and air conditioning combined. The global warming this is causing is now damaging food production through extreme weather events such as floods and droughts.The food system also fails to properly nourish billions of people. More than 820 million people went hungry last year, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, while a third of all people did not get enough vitamins. At the same time, 600 million people were classed as obese and 2 billion overweight, with serious consequences for their health. On top of this, more than 1bn tonnes of food is wasted every year, a third of the total produced.“The global food system is broken,” said Tim Benton, professor of population ecology, at the University of Leeds, who is a member of one of the expert editorial groups which produced the report. He said the cost of the damage to human health and the environment was much greater than the profits made by the farming industry.Reducing meat and dairy consumption is the single biggest way iniduals can lessen their impact on the planet, according to recent research. And tackling dangerous global warming is considered impossible without massive reductions in meat consumption. Research published in the journal Climate Policy shows that at the present rate, cattle and other livestock will be responsible for half of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, and that to prevent this will require “substantial reductions, far beyond what are planned or realistic, from other sectors”.Rearing cattle and other livestock causes the same carbon emissions as all the world’s vehicles, trains, ships and planes combined. “We have spent 30 to 40 years investing quite heavily on fuel efficiency in the transport sector,” said Benton. “We need do something similarly radical in the farming sector and the scope for doing that by changing the way we raise the animals is much smaller than the scope we have by changing our diets.”The IAP report notes that in poorer countries meat, eggs and dairy can be important in providing concentrated nutrients, especially for children. It also says other things livestock can provide should be taken into consideration, such as leather, wool, manure, transport and plough pulling.The UN climate change conference, COP24, which starts on Sunday in Katowice, Poland, is an opportunity for political action, said Joachim von Braun, a professor who co-chairs the IAP project. “Our food systems are failing us. Agriculture and consumer choices are major factors driving disastrous climate change.”Another member of the IAP editorial group, Aifric O’Sullivan, from University College Dublin, said: “We need to ensure that policymakers inform consumers about the climate impacts of their food choices, provide incentives for consumers to change their diets, and reduce food loss and waste.”The report recommends many actions that could help deliver the “whole-scale root and branch transformation” that is required, said Benton. These include crops that are more resilient to climate change, smarter crop rotation, soil protection, precier use of fertilisers and less use of pesticides. It also backs innovation such as laboratory-grown meat and insect-based foods."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/236a557d49d0fd71ddfd1afc997e6a2baff5b76e/0_0_1060_636/master/1060.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=22f3ae8ccc91bdb59ce678f929511387","title":"great barrier reef record heatwave may cause another coral bleaching event","story":"42.6C temperature in Cairns broke a November record that has stood since 1900 by 5.4CA record-breaking heatwave in north Queensland will further increase above-average marine temperatures, heightening the risk of another coral bleaching event on the Great Barrier Reef next year, scientists say.Dozens of record November temperatures have been recorded in the region, most along the reef coastline, this week.The most remarkable was at Cairns, where consecutive days reached temperatures of 42.6C and 40.9C. The maximum temperature on Tuesday broke a November record that has stood since 1900 by 5.4C.Extreme weather fuelled more than 130 bushfires, which the premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said on Twitter was “not the kind of fire we have seen in Queensland before”.“Heatwave records and fire weather is unprecedented,” Palaszczuk said.A dust storm, brought by strong westerly winds, covered the southern inland parts of the state. In the north, thousands of native flying foxes died due to the high temperatures.Reef scientist Terry Hughes, from the coral centre of excellence at James Cook University, said the summer heatwave was “terrifying” and lifted the chances of coral death on the Great Barrier Reef early next year.The reef sustained successive marine heatwaves, in the early part of 2016 and 2017, which killed corals and badly damaged the northern and central sections.Hughes said the bleaching forecasts were “trending upwards” but scientists would not have a clear picture until the end of January.Coral ecophysiologist Dr Neal Cantin, from the Australian Institute of Marine Science, said ocean temperatures remained below those recorded at the same time in 2015 and 2016, but warmer than historical averages.Cantin said the current heatwave would “add heat and warm up the ocean. It certainly adds heat to the system. We’ve seen record breaking land temperatures this week, which we expect to see into the future with climate change and everything heating up.“We’re in a watch phase. There’s definitely the potential and how the local weather patterns pan out in January and February will really determine whether we get a large scale bleaching event or not.“The hazard I worry most about is heatwaves,” Andrew Gissing, a disaster management expert from the firm Risk Frontiers, said.“Australia needs to be better prepared for heatwaves, with climate change we are already predicting they will get more severe.”Gissing told  Australia people often respond to extreme weather events and natural disasters based on their previous experiences. But he said governments, businesses and iniduals were often not prepared for the increasing severity and frequency of such events.“We did a lot of work in Lismore after Cyclone Debbie. So many people sheltered in their homes because that’s what they always did when it flooded. They just didn’t realise this flood was that much bigger“People really need to be attuned to what’s actually happening ... how the nature of climactic hazards is changing.”Gissing said businesses needed to start investing in climate change mitigation and adaption measures."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed53c3d5a97db12ee69ee721c8987a5f2ebc277f/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f44caa6c6b643cdc1f1e8a8bfeffea76","title":"guide party dressing men velvet dicky bows mortarboards","story":"Whether you channel Timothée Chalamet in a tux or keep it casual à la Ralph Lauren in jeans, there are plenty of glad rag options on the high street.

Then, while travelling in the Caribbean, I had a revelation: crisp sweet potato fries that made a virtue of the tuber’s natural sugars to give a deliciously caramelised result. They weren’t trying to be potato chips – which is fortunate, because their strong flavour and dense, creamy texture is never going to fool anyone – but this time, they were just as delicious.Some recipes specify there’s no need to peel, but, though generally a fan of the lazy approach, here I think a little work pays off: the skin makes the fries taste like baked potato wedges rather than chips.Cook’s Illustrated magazine cautions that “the typical sweet potato fry is cut thin, which means too little creamy sweet potato interior”, and I’m inclined to agree: much as I love french fries, the sweet potato has a tendency to dry out if prepared like this. Instead, make a virtue of its dense texture by cutting them into wedges, which will allow the interior to remain fudgy while the exterior crisps up.Sweet potatoes do have a relatively low starch content in comparison with the ordinary kind, but, just as when cooking rice, it’s important to get rid of as much of that as possible before cooking, because it will turn into sugar, which burns at high temperatures – some, such as Rebecca Lindamood of the Foodie With Family blog, reckon that excess starch stops the fries getting crisp – though rinsing, as with rice, should do the trick there’s no need to soak them for hours first.The Joy of Cooking fries its par-boiled potatoes without further ado, but everyone else coats them in some way before cooking.Alice Hart cautions in The New Vegetarian that sweet potatoes should not be seasoned with salt until the last minute: “It will only draw moisture out and make the sweet potato soggy.” Instead, she coats hers in cornflour, cornmeal hot paprika and dried garlic. Jamieoliver has no fear in adding salt, along with sweet smoked paprika and black pepper, while Cook’s Illustrated sticks with a simple paste of cornflour and water, which does indeed cling to the tacky exteriors of their par-boiled fries very effectively.Seasoning alone doesn’t seem to cut the mustard: the jamieoliver wedges are tasty, but soggy rather than crunchy. Having removed excess starch from the potatoes themselves, it’s time to add some back on to the surface to crisp up in the heat. Hart’s mix pleases testers the most: the cornflour provides an even coating, while the cornmeal adds a gritty crunch. Jamieoliver’s smoked paprika is optional, but recommended. As my recipe involves parboiling the potatoes first, it seems wise to salt the water rather than the coating, just in case any moisture might be drawn out.Look, I wanted to give you an oven-baked recipe, I really did – I made three of them and they were fine. But the truth is that, just as you can’t make truly great chips without frying (no, you can’t. Don’t fib), it’s not fair to deny the sweet potato the chance to fulfil its potential.If you really must bake them, then use Hart’s recipe (25-30 minutes at 220C (200C fan)425Fgas 8), it’s good, but not as good as the magnificent fries from Cook’s Illustrated, which are snaffled before I’ve even finished frying the second batch. I’m sorry, but hot fat is the price you’re going to have to pay for perfection. Deal with it.They shouldn’t need much more than a sprinkling of salt, but if you’re feeling really all-American this Thanksgiving, you might enjoy The Joy of Cooking’s suggestion to dust the fries with a mixture of brown sugar and nutmeg as well. Marshmallows sadly aren’t mentioned, but they’d probably work, too.2 large sweet potatoes2 tbsp salt 1 tbsp bicarbonate of soda100g cornflour1 tbsp smoked hot paprika (optional)100g cornmeal or polenta (optional)750ml neutral oil, for deep-fryingPeel the potatoes, then cut them into wedges about 2cm thick.

Drain well.Mix the cornflour with 120ml cold water and the paprika, if using, to make a thin paste, then add the wedges and stir to coat.Spread the cornmeal, if using, on a plate, then briefly roll the chips in it to coat lightly all over.Put the oil in a large, nonstick frying pan about 30cm in diameter and bring to 180C325F. Meanwhile, line the grill pan with foil and put in a low oven.Fry the chips in small batches until deep golden and crisp (the paprika, if using, will make it harder to tell, so look at the potato underneath), turning once, then scoop out with a slotted spoon and put on the grill rack to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining sweet potatoes, making sure the oil comes back to temperature before cooking the next batch.Season to taste and eat immediately.• Sweet potato fries: sweet treat, or the fibre-rich poor relation to the proper sort?

Sarri was quick to offer a reminder it was his team’s first competitive defeat of the season after an 18-game unbeaten start, but, having seen the warning signs in previous matches, he was dismayed the same issues had flared again in such a key derby.Sarri spoke inidually with his players on Monday in an effort to understand why their performance had been so flat. “I talked to them player by player, a meeting of five to 10 minutes with the iniduals,” said Sarri, who will rest Eden Hazard against Paok after the forward suffered an ankle injury against Spurs. “I had to think about everything because, on Saturday, we played very badly, a match without determination.“That’s not normal. We’ve lost one match after three and a half months, 110 days, but we have to understand why, especially from the mental point of view. It’s very difficult for me to understand why we played without determination in such an important match.Sarri’s criticisms of Kanté, another expected to sit out against Paok, were born of calls for the midfielder to be restored to the central berth in which he had excelled in winning consecutive Premier League titles with Leicester and Chelsea and the World Cup with France. Kanté, who signed a contract worth around £290,000 a week last Friday, has been given a slightly more attacking brief this season, with Jorginho, the club’s only outfield summer signing and a player around whom Sarri built his Napoli team, in the central role.“As you know, I want to play a central midfielder as a very technical player – a Jorginho or Cesc Fàbregas,” Sarri said. “I don’t want Kanté in this position. Kanté, in the last match, wanted to solve the match after the first 15 minutes but in the wrong way. He lost his position. He attacked too much the other box. I think this is not one of the best characteristics of Kanté but it was only a reaction to the difficulties.“Maybe it’s only a question of time before he learns the role. When the ball is on the other side, the left, Kanté has to stay very close to Jorginho.”Oliver Giroud said of Kanté: “We don’t need to question his position. He just needs to adapt to what the manager wants.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ab2ef1058124ef3dfe295567d4de24d5a3226d2/0_234_4381_2628/master/4381.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e433698916bef3e1658a5422fb42bed1","title":"richard scudamore 5m tip resentment premier league gordon taylor","story":"A friend once stepped aboard a super-yacht hired by a super-rich, and asked far more questions about how much it cost than I assume is regarded as polite. Naturally, such things are bogglingly, unimaginably expensive to rent – but it was amusing to hear that the tip is also mandatory. In the case of this boat, the tip was £38,000 per week.I was reminded of this as the Premier League clubs voted to thank outgoing chief executive Richard Scudamore for his service earlier this month, in the form of what amounts to a tip of £250,000. Each. So a round £5m for a man who has been in post for almost 20 years, and who last year took home just the £2.5m salary and undisclosed bonuses.Initial reports about the proposal suggested Premier League clubs were “stunned” by this request for a whip-round from Scudamore’s friend, the Chelsea chairman, Bruce Buck. (Incidentally, if you need help getting this chumocracy in order, Bruce shoots with Richard. Furthermore, their shooting parties reportedly also frequently include former Southampton chairman Rupert Lowe and former Manchester United and Chelsea Village idiot Peter Kenyon. To which the only reasonable response is: paging Dick Cheney. Or the late Willie Whitelaw I’m not fussy.)Anyway, perhaps the clubs were literally stunned, as they seem to have ended up being mugged for the donation after all. And that, somewhat stunningly, seems to be that. I am sure that Scudamore and the generous club chairmen will be delighted that the storm over the news has since been supplanted by stories about mid-Mesozoic PFA chairman Gordon Taylor OBE. Some confected row or other over the Sports Personality of the Year award might reasonably be expected to take care of much of December, meaning that Scudamore will be home and dry by the time he steps down next month, and this latest piece of big-bucks grotesquery will be conveniently forgotten. Or will it? I do hope not. This remains a scandal that upsets supporters of even the very richest clubs, and one that it is encouraging to see fans now dipping into their own pockets to return to, even after the news caravan has moved on. You’ve heard of straight-to-DVD. The £5m Scudamore tip turns out to be a decision that is straight-to-bedsheet. Or rather, straight-to-professionally-printed banners.Last Saturday at Watford v Liverpool, multiple banners were held aloft by travelling fans at Vicarage Road, where Scudamore was said to be in attendance. “11,662 Premier League season tickets,” read one. “56,180 weekly shops for food banks,” read another. “Scudamore’s £5,000,000,” ran the next. And the Premier League lion logo next to the word “Greed” finished off the display.As my colleague Paul Wilson noted a couple of weeks ago, it is not the amount involved – though that is clearly significant – but the apparent failure to understand the public impression that being so blase about it gives. Or not caring. Do chairmen not realise that people collect for food banks outside their games? Perhaps not, given such inconveniences are naturally kept well away from the VIP entrances.Yet there are signs that fan fury about the Scudamore whip-round is getting dimly through to some of the chairmen, who are duly getting what I imagine they’d call “out in front of the story”. For last Saturday’s game against Leicester at the Amex, Brighton \u0026amp Hove Albion’s chief executive, Paul Barber, wrote a veritable essay about it in his programme notes, in which his sighs at the misrepresentation of the £5m payment are almost audible.And what a truly warming vignette of modern football it must have been, to sit down in your hyperinflation-adjusted seat, with your match programme, and open it to discover that a man whose wages you contribute to is lecturing you on the subtleties of the Premier League’s audit and remuneration committee. “This is an entirely normal contractual agreement for very senior and highly sought after executives,” huffs Barber of the Scudamore golden handshake, in comments reproduced in the Brighton Argus, “and it has been designed by the Premier League’s board to protect the league’s commercial interests and those of it’s shareholders – including our club!”The clubs have made the decision to fork out, of course, even as their own fans continue to make their displeasure very clear. It’s the way of the league that Scudamore built. But the mistake is to think that these things blow over. They may appear to, or to be supplanted by other dramas – but in fact they simply add another resentment to the pile.There is no question that Richard Scudamore built an extraordinary global powerhouse – there is only a question as to what cost it came at. As he pockets this extra £5m, no doubt he will shrug off the ungrateful fans too foolish or benighted to understand what he has done for them.Yet my suspicion is that the more telling ignorance is the other way round. Scudamore will go goldenly into his retirement refusing to accept it. But he will be remembered as the guiding spirit of an era in which people talk more angrily, more cynically and more resentfully about football than ever before."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/012345a06aca1c52565649258e3fddd9cfb850b5/0_129_1007_604/master/1007.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1be90e8a6592dd0bb8b8a250871cbaf9","title":"mark hughes southampton var whinger","story":"Manager’s VAR anguish would be permissible if it did not entirely oppose his previous grumble over Southampton’s treatmentAlmost 20 years into his career as a manager, we finally appear to have reached peak Mark Hughes. Following Southampton’s Carabao Cup defeat on penalties at Leicester, he used his post-match interview to complain about a refereeing decision that had not gone his team’s way. In itself, that was not unusual – rarely a weekend goes by in which Hughes does not publicly lay blame for their many shortcomings at the door of officialdom. Long before Donald Trump developed a reputation for tediously ranting and raving about the perceived injustices repeatedly inflicted upon him by the Fake News Media, Hughes had earned one for railing similarly against referees.A fortnight later and apparently without a modicum of self-awareness, he stood before the cameras following a match in which VAR had been employed, only to bemoan the technology’s inability to help get things right.His frustration is understandable, his hypocrisy less so. His team are struggling badly, barn doors in Hampshire have never had it so good and such is the level of speculation swirling around his future that the pitch for this article was met with a thumbs up, “if you think you can get it written before he’s sacked”. Nevertheless, like so many of his post-match grumbles, his two most recent don’t even stand up to particularly strong scrutiny.Take the Watford game, where Austin’s goal was ruled out because Maya Yoshida was standing in an offside position when the striker fired past Ben Foster and wheeled away in celebration that would soon be curtailed.Replays suggest that while Yoshida was undeniably standing in an offside position, whether he was interfering with play is open to unwinnable and extremely boring debate. It follows that if VAR had been available at, Simon Hooper might well have consulted his pitchside monitor and upheld his decision to disallow the goal.Different referees have understandably different readings of offside, a law that in certain situations – not least that one – leaves itself open to no end of interpretation. Contrary to what Hughes seems to emphatically believe, the presence of VAR may not necessarily have resulted in Southampton’s “winner” against Watford being allowed to stand. What it almost certainly would have resulted in was a Watford penalty for a ridiculously rash Ryan Bertrand challenge on Nathaniel Chalobah that went unpunished. Curiously, for reasons best known to themselves, neither Austin nor Hughes saw fit to mention that incident as they vented long into the wet and windy night.And so to Tuesday’s defeat, where Southampton were denied a late winner against Leicester for a Nathan Redmond handball in the buildup to a disallowed goal. Acquiescing to the howls of protest from assorted Leicester players, the referee, Roger East, signalled for VAR and after a brief consultation decided to rule out Steven Davies’s strike.As decisions go, it seemed an extremely harsh one Hughes’s frustration was understandable and not without justification. Or at least it would have been if he hadn’t been citing the introduction of technology as the solution to all refereeing shortcomings in his most recent post-match rant. Like offside, handball is another of football’s laws that often leaves itself open to interpretation and on this occasion the technology Hughes regards so highly failed to work in his side’s favour.And therein lies the rub. Happy to complain about the absence of VAR when it is not used, only to pull a reverse-ferret and complain about its presence when it is, we are left to conclude that Southampton’s beleaguered manager isn’t even remotely interested in seeing referees make consistently correct decisions, but more keen on them making calls that consistently benefit his team."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65542ff3b9a74103f04ec44dde7654661079ac1d/0_356_5333_3200/master/5333.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61abf1aa1587de755876319d7bf182ad","title":"psg liverpool champions league live paris saint germain","story":"“Must admit that Liverpool lineup has me a bit worried,” confesses Jake Lynch. “Plan seems to be to contain the home side. Maybe Klopp will do as Zidane did last season in the Bernebeu, and throw on attacking weapons in the second half? As Asensio and Vazquez made the difference then, when they joined from the subs’ bench, maybe Shaqiri and Sturridge will tonight?”“I believe that Liverpool will beat PSG 3-2 once more,” announces Frank Muscat. “I expect Liverpool to let PSG attack and play on the counter after taking the lead early in the game.” That’s certainly possible. And I fancy you’re definitely right about this being a high-scoring affair.Klopp has decided to omit Alexander-Arnold and entrust the right side of Liverpool’s defence to Gomez, leaving Van Dijk to partner Lovren in the centre. Evidently he believes that Gomez, a slightly more accomplished defender, will fare better than Alexander-Arnold against Neymar, in particular. In midfield Klopp has plumped for tried and tested despite slack recent form from Henderson, in particular. You’ve got to think that in time Fabinho, Shaqiri and Keita wilform the first-choice trio but today they all start on the bench. For PSG, meanwhile, Mbappé and Neymar return from injury and Marquinhos, a centreback by trade, will aim to hold midfield while Di Maria will strive to do what Shaqiri might have done for Liverpool. Bernat, at left-back, is a weakness that Liverpool will probably seek to exploit. There were rumours in Paris that Rabiot had been left out of the squad entirely after rowing with manager Tuchel this afternoon but PSG have put him on the team sheet. Let’s see if he’s actually in the dugout. It couldn’t be that internet gossip was bogus, could it?What a showdown we have in store here! With each side boasting some of the best players in the world, both fancy their chances of being crowned European champions this season - and yet one of them could fall at the group stages. How embarrassing that would be, especially for today’s host! This duel is do-or-die for PSG and almost as decisive for Liverpool. Let’s start with the permutations:In short, this is a high-stakes meeting, a humungous test for both teams and an opportunity for the rest of us to assess their pedigree. It should be a bona fide belter. Mind you, Liverpool will lose if they play as badly as they have done in their most recent European away matches. And they can’t rely on PSG being as disjointed as they were when Liverpool won 3-2 at Anfield. Because Tomas Tuchel’s side have generally improved since then, playing with more intensity and actual cohesion, in Ligue 1 at least. PSG haven’t lost a group match at the Parc des Princes since 2004, although they needed a last-minute equaliser to avoid defeat by Napoli last month (that match, incidentally, came a couple of weeks after they inflicted a 5-0 battering here on Lyon, who’ve give Manchester City the run-around twice this season). Klopp’s approach is going to be intriguing: knowing that PSG must win, he has a choice between (a) embracing an open game and hoping his lads land more blows than Mbappé, Neymar, Cavani \u0026amp Co. and (b) Trying to absorb home pressure and striking on the counter, where Liverpool can definitely do damage.

A lighter box than the uniform black or grey, four joypad ports, a bizarre controller with a memory card that had its own screen and worked as a separate miniature games console. The name – a portmanteau of Dream and Broadcast – was strangely ethereal for a games console (Sega had apparently gone through 5,000 possibile monikers to get here). When a prototype was shown to the press in the summer of 1998, there was no Sega logo. This was a new dawn. This was the future.Then came the Sega Mega Drive (or Genesis in the US), a mighty 16-bit machine, with sleek arcade conversions and a new hero in the spiky form of Sonic the Hedgehog. 45m sales later, Sega shared half the market with its old foe. The 32-bit Sega Saturn followed in 1994 but by now there was a new competitor: Sony. The PlayStation was supremely powerful, expertly marketed and designed for the new era of 3D polygonal visuals. It destroyed everything in its path.But Sega had a vision. When work began on a successor to the Saturn, the company’s manufacturing isions began to rethink what a games console should be. This was the mid-1990s, the dawn of the world wide web as a mass phenomenon, the era of Netscape Navigator, America Online and emerging web-hosting services such as Angelfire and Geocities the internet was becoming a place to meet, communicate and play. At the same time, the PC was coming into its own as a platform for gaming, thanks to the arrival of specialist 3D accelerator cards, which boosted the graphics performance of the incoming Pentium-series machines. And somewhere amid all this, Apple was preparing to unleash its iMac vision on the world.Dreamcast embodied all of this epochal action. Inspired by the PC market, the machine was built from “off-the-shelf” components, rather than proprietary chipsets, to drive down costs. At its heart the Hitachi SH4 processor, married with a graphics chipset provided by PowerVR (one of the big names in the PC hardware acceleration market), promised unparalleled visual performance a deal with Microsoft saw the machine adopting the familiar Windows CE operating system, which would vastly increase the number of developers who could conceivably work with the hardware. Dreamcast was also the first major console to come with a built-in modem as standard, and Sega (which had already innovated with online games services on the Mega Drive) set about creating an online infrastructure to provide owners with multiplayer gaming, webTV, email and web browsing. It was something entirely new – a fully connected entertainment machine.The Japanese launch in November 1998 was a stumbling, halting introduction, thanks to trouble manufacturing the PowerVR chips. But customers queued in their hundreds outside the big game stores in Tokyo, keen to see this odd new console and its killer app, Virtua Fighter 3tb, a new version of the biggest fighting game in Japanese arcades, boasting detailed models of favourite characters, 13 beautiful arenas, and sleek 60fps animation. It was an enticing hint of what was to come from this graceful 128-bit machine.The Dreamcast, in its first two years, saw a burst of creativity and gameplay innovation that has perhaps never been surpassed. Sega’s talented internal development teams were utterly inspired. Games such as the urban skating adventure Jet Set Radio, the fast-paced puzzler Chu-Chu Rocket, the massively multiplayer role-playing adventure Phantasy Star Online and the open-world masterpiece Shenmue introduced whole new forms and conventions of interactive entertainment. There were astonishing arcade conversions in the shape of Crazy Taxi and Soul Calibur there were oddities including the subaquatic life sim, Seaman, and the zombie-infested keyboard tutorial, Typing of the Dead.The rules of game design were being rewritten true visionaries such as Yu Suzuki (Shenmue, Ferrari 355), Tetsuya Mizuguchi (Rez, Space Channel Five) and Rieko Kodama (Phantasy Star, Skies of Arcadia) were in their pomp. Established genres were being mashed together to create hybrid beasts not ided into regulated stages or levels but set in vast, open environments: Sonic Adventure, polis Street Racer, and of course, Shenmue, a game that required players to effectively live in a mid-1980s rendition of Yokosuka.The Dreamcast hinted at a new era of games: connected, open, complex and reactive to player curiosity. By building in a modem from the start, rather than requiring consumers to buy them separately, it made online features an intractable part of the console games industry, two years before Microsoft’s Xbox took that concept and really ran with it.But it was too early and it had too much baggage. Outside of Japan, major publishers hadn’t forgotten how the Saturn bombed against the PlayStation, and when Electronic Arts decided not to support Dreamcast, other companies followed suit. The original dialup modem was too slow for the coming era of multiplayer shooters (though it ran a wicked version of Quake III Arena), and the attendant online services too complicated and unwieldy.And on the horizon, just out of reach but utterly tantalising, was the PlayStation 2. Sony was preparing something special, a much more powerful machine with a hyperbolically named Emotion Engine processor, backwards compatibility for PlayStation titles and the capability to play DVDs. Dreamcast enjoyed a decent US launch in 1999, with 500,000 units shifting in the opening weeks, but this was a blip on its downward trajectory. When Sony premiered the PS2 at the Tokyo Game Show in September with Tekken Tag Tournament and Gran Turismo 2000, the game was up.The Dreamcast was the future in so many ways, but, like many technological groundbreakers throughout history, it had the right ideas at the wrong time. Its great highs live on, however – in the careers of Sega’s great designers, in the legacy of Shenmue, in the memories of players who first discovered the thrills of taxi simulations, graffiti sims and maraca-shaking rhythm action games. But by 2001, the dream was effectively over.There was nothing else out there quite like the Dreamcast. In many ways, there still isn’t."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b79559668f7ad136d222dcd36c15c0b30ec3d6f/0_0_4928_2956/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=efee944098ff5f2ca24a81b6ca7be6a6","title":"fir crying out loud share your photos of the worst christmas trees","story":"After the White House caused seasonal smirks with its latest offering, we want to see more seasonal decoration failsLike it or not, Black Friday has come and gone and with December approaching, Christmas is on the horizon.

More than 10 years ago the BBC, Channel 4 and ITV got together to build video-on-demand service, named Kangaroo, but that was ultimately blocked by the competition regulator.Despite the Sky warning, the idea of a British Netflix has received regulatory backing. On Wednesday, Sharon White, head of the media regulator Ofcom, again urged the UK’s PSBs to get together and build a British Netflix. “If the growth of Netflix and Amazon tells us one thing it is that viewers will flock to single destinations that offer a wide variety of quality content,” she said. “A common platform could combine the pulling power of Broadchurch, Blue Planet and Bake Off.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58b82d50a5b4f70f0f06794f3dbadae66e8d8dee/5_96_5598_3359/master/5598.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=36ee8326438b33c479aa9096006f9fc9","title":"quentin letts to leave daily mail the times brexit","story":"Theatre critic and sketchwriter ends 18-year association with title, which has changed Brexit stanceThe Daily Mail’s parliamentary sketchwriter and theatre critic, Quentin Letts, has left the newspaper as it continues its transformation under its remain-supporting editor, Geordie Greig.The Mail’s editorial line has shifted significantly following this summer’s departure of former editor Paul Dacre, a staunch proponent of a hard Brexit, leading some of the newspaper’s leading voices to look for work elsewhere.Letts confirmed he was leaving the Mail in the coming months and would be writing for a number of other publications. “I have had 18 busy and exciting years writing for the Mail and its fine readers but I have now agreed a future economic partnership – as  readers might put it - with the Times, Sunday Times and the Sun.”Although Letts is closely associated with the Daily Mail, which he regularly represented on shows such as Question Time, and is also the paper’s theatre critic, the pro-Brexit Herefordshire-based journalist is on freelance terms and had already begun writing for other newspapers in recent months.In addition to writing columns for the Rupert Murdoch-owned titles, Letts will become the Times’ parliamentary sketchwriter. His departure was first reported by the Guido Fawkes blog.Letts, a leave supporter, has previously described a soft Brexit as “baloney”. Last week, he attempted to sum up the House of Commons’ reaction to Theresa May’s Brexit deal and concluded that MPs felt it “ponged”.“To put that in continental terms, it was ein Stinker, basura, malodorant, puzzolente,” he wrote.In recent months, the newspaper’s editorial line has closely tracked Downing Street’s message and been strongly supportive of a deal, with insiders saying the tone is being guided by the new assistant editor, Simon Walters.On Wednesday, the newspaper asked “So NOW Will MPs listen?”, having commissioned a poll that showed the public backing May’s Brexit deal.The Daily Mail columnist Sarah Vine, the wife of the cabinet minister Michael Gove, also praised the Brexit deal under the front-page headline: “She fired my husband – but even I salute May’s true grit that’s won the deal to deliver Brexit.”Dacre had warned that any attempt to deviate from the paper’s pro-Brexit line would disillusion loyal Daily Mail readers, but Greig has repeatedly made clear his main objective is warning of the threat of a Jeremy Corbyn-led Labour government.Downing Street’s efforts to sell the Brexit deal have been largely successful among pro-Brexit newspapers. The , which has a new editor, has also given its full support to the proposals – meaning the Sun is the only major pro-Brexit tabloid to reject the proposals."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/473b9dc73bd9f3fb1ed2cf6f6ceb8015ad022b04/0_0_3500_2334/master/3500.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e57815e0d88dfc75114daa78c937f88d","title":"brexit breeds boredom bafflement and frustration in scotland","story":"Support for second referendum is strong but fishing and independence questions complicate political calculusRobert Holmes is one of the few on Bridge of Weir’s high street to offer an unqualified welcome to Theresa May, who was continuing her Brexit publicity blitz in Scotland on Wednesday afternoon.“She’s a hardy woman, dealing with all those clowns around her. She’s between a rock and a hard place, but she’s doing her best and if we don’t have a deal we’ll be in a right pickle.”Other locals in the rural Renfrewshire town express a mixture of boredom, bafflement and frustration at the latest iteration of the ongoing Brexit saga.“Personally I’d rather we were remaining, but people who think we can go back to the EU and get a better deal are living in fairy land.”Darren Bolton, sales manager for a renewables company, accepts May’s insistence that Scottish businesses want certainty – “People in my industry are apprehensive about spending money right now” – but is less convinced by her ability to deliver it with the deal she is putting to parliament.“To be honest I don’t think they’ve got a clue. They’ll need to have another vote, because there are all these big issues that still need clarification and so much has changed.”Kevin Pringle, former director of communications for the Scottish National party, who now works on behalf of the Scotland for a People’s Vote campaign, argues: “What’s interesting is that opinion south of the border has moved closer to opinion in Scotland. Yes there’s a fatigue about Brexit but the result is the exact opposite to the conclusion that the prime minster has drawn - what people want is not to get on and deliver it but to stop it.”Over the past week, the UK’s post-Brexit relationship with the common fisheries policy – especially loathed by Scotland’s North Sea fleets – has become a flashpoint, with first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, accusing Theresa May of “yet another Tory sellout”. The UK government has insisted that access to fishing will not be linked with final trade terms, but statements from EU leaders over the weekend suggest that access for their fishermen to UK waters will remain key to negotiations after March 2019.“The treatment of the fishing industry over the years has a totemic status in Scottish politics that it doesn’t have elsewhere,” Pringle explains. “But now it’s connected to the disillusionment that people have felt with the deal, because if there was one issue where the leave campaign had traction in Scotland it was fishing. In the rest of the UK a number of different arguments – immigration, health service funding - had force too, but in Scotland there was only one. If the deal is not seen to be delivering for the fishing industry then it invalidates the whole thing from a Scottish leave perspective.”When Sturgeon announced that SNP MPs would back a second EU referendum at her party’s conference in October – having previously declined to support the option – some activists raised concerns that this could create a damaging precedent for another independence vote. While others accept that the political conditions are not right for another campaign to leave the UK amid so much unfolding uncertainty, those concerns continue, especially after Sturgeon yesterday appeared to push back any announcement of plans for a second referendum until the new year.Despite claims from senior Tory Brexiters that Theresa May’s deal, in particular the Northern Ireland backstop, represents a threat to union, Curtice is sceptical. “The idea that Scotland is going to vote for independence because Northern Ireland might have a slightly different relationship with the EU, I’d be very surprised if it were to fly. And the difficulty for the SNP over fishing is that every time they raise it the answer is: ‘You guys want to stay in the EU’, end of story.”“The crucial thing for the SNP is whether Brexit goes pear-shaped economically and this changes the calculus for voters so far as the perceived economic consequences of independence are concerned. But, ironically, nobody is doing more at the moment to try and stop Brexit than Nicola Sturgeon. She’s trying to stop the one thing that actually might be to her advantage.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9faa55fd07ce16466c6eda8d02f5428fa67d9a53/454_36_1156_694/master/1156.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce5bfe7936a6e99c58f95de49541e563","title":"pmqs brexit analysis is meaningless corbyn tells may","story":"Labour leader tells prime minister: ‘MPs are queueing up not to back’ her Brexit plan• Follow the latest political developments - live updatesJeremy Corbyn has described the government’s economic analysis of the Brexit deal as “meaningless” in exchanges at prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, as Theresa May denied that the country would end up poorer under her deal.In testy exchanges in the Commons, Corbyn said: “MPs are queuing up not to back her plan.” More than 90 Conservative MPs have publicly confirmed they will not back the proposal.In turn, May said her deal was backed by “farmers in Wales, fishermen in Scotland, employers in Northern Ireland”, adding: “When MPs come to look at this vote, they will need to look at the importance of delivering Brexit in a way that protects jobs.”May said analysis released by Whitehall showed the country would be “better off with this deal” and said it did not show that people would be worse off.Corbyn hit back at the prime minister’s claims that the deal was the best on offer. “It’s not hard to be the best deal if it’s the only deal. By definition, it’s also the worst deal,” he said.He criticised the analysis of the impact of the deal as outlined in the political declaration, saying it was not legally binding. “There is no actual deal to model, just a 26-page wishlist,” he said.May said it was untrue to call it a wishlist and that it was politically binding on the EU, setting out “an ambitious broad, deep and flexible partnership across trade and economic co-operation, law, foreign policy, security and defence and wider areas of cooperation”.“What does Labour have to offer? Six bullet points. My weekend shopping list is longer than that,” she added.Corbyn said the prime minister would not conclude those future partnership negotiations in two years. “She has gone from guaranteeing frictionless trade to offering friction, less trade,” he said. “After these botched negotiations the country has no faith in the next stage of even more complex negotiations being completed in just two years.”May said her negotiators had proved predictions wrong before, turning the 16-page December joint agreement into a legal withdrawal agreement of more than 500 pages in less than a year.“At every stage people have said that we couldn’t do what we did… it takes hard work and a firm commitment to work in the national interest and that’s what the government has,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/958077564f10d2b2b0b97a65226b5f758da8ce02/0_282_4848_2909/master/4848.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b63aae1f00b3d305457ab8c713360f9","title":"uk significantly worse off under all brexit scenarios official forecast gdp","story":"• Follow the latest politics news - live updatesThe UK would be significantly worse off under all possible Brexit scenarios in 15 years’ time, according to a benchmark economic analysis produced by a range of government departments including the Treasury.Before publication of the analysis, the chancellor, Philip Hammond, said the UK would be worse off in the future after Brexit, saying: “If you look at this purely from an economic point of view, yes there will be a cost to leaving the European Union because there will be impediments to our trade.”The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, who was granted an urgent question in the Commons following the publication of the analysis, said it was ludicrous that officials had produced an economic analysis of plans based on the Chequers proposals, which the government had abandoned.“The one thing this document shows, the deal on the table is worse than the abandoned Chequers deal,” McDonnell told MPs.The chancellor had previously told the BBC that May’s deal would “absolutely minimise those costs” stemming from a looser trading arrangement with the EU. “The economy will be slightly smaller in the prime minister’s preferred version,” he said.The official analysis also concluded that:Public sector net borrowing would be up to £141bn higher in 15 years in the worst-case no-deal scenario, the official analysis concluded, where there was no net migration from the EU.In the base case, borrowing would be £119bn higher in a no-deal scenario, £96bn higher in a Canada-style scenario, and £27bn higher in the Chequers scenario. Migration would remain at similar levels if the UK adopted a Norway model, but allowing for migration, borrowing would be £22bn higher.Brexiters immediately accused the government of embarking on a propaganda onslaught akin to “project fear”. Davis, the former Brexit secretary, said: “Treasury forecasts in the past have almost never been right and have more often been dramatically wrong.”Business organisations, however, hit back. Rain Newton-Smith, the chief economist of the CBI, which represents employers, said: “These forecasts paint a bleak picture over the long term of a no-deal Brexit or a Canada-style deal. It surely puts to bed some of the more far-fetched ideas that a hard-landing Brexit will not seriously hurt the economy.”A regional breakdown also showed that in a no-deal scenario, the north-east of England would be worst affected, followed by the West Midlands, the north-west of England and Northern Ireland. London would easily be the least affected.In the best-case Chequers scenario, London and the south-east would be the worst affected, although the overall GDP impact would be much lower. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland would be the least affected.The headline analysis made an assumption that the UK would succeed in signing free trade deals with the US and a range of other big non-EU economies after Brexit, such as China, India and Australia.The comparative figures published in the analysis do not take account of any economic growth the scenarios selected were measured against the UK’s existing membership of the EU."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b1508b2249fd0f9b8c703faad9fd05731767d4a/0_199_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=414842f8901a5744f09f0ea8295afbaa","title":"scientist in china defends human embryo gene editing","story":"He Jiankui uses Hong Kong summit to reply to critics of his Crispr-Cas9 trials altering baby DNA for HIV resistanceThe Chinese scientist who claims to have altered the DNA of twin girls before birth – without going through the usual scientific channels – said he was proud of his work, and claimed another woman enrolled in his trial was pregnant with a similarly modified baby.The scientist, He Jiankui, spoke to hundreds of colleagues and journalists on Wednesday at the International Human Genome Editing Summit at the University of Hong Kong.He said details of the first births from the trial, which used gene-editing technology known as Crispr-Cas9, had been submitted to a scientific journal, which he did not name. Nor did he say when the results might be published.In a planned presentation, He, an associate professor at Southern University of Science and Technology, in Shenzhen, described how he used Crispr-Cas9 to modify a gene called CCR5 in a number of embryos created through IVF for couples with HIV-positive fathers.The modification was intended to mirror a natural mutation found in a small percentage of people which makes them resistant to the virus. Two girls named Nana and Lulu were born with the genetic changes, he said.The researcher’s 40-minute Q\u0026ampA offered a charged forum for scientists to publicly question a colleague caught in controversy.The Nobel laureate David Baltimore, an organiser of the summit, who is professor emeritus of biology at the California Institute of Technology, called He’s work irresponsible. “I think there has been a failure of self regulation by the scientific community because of a lack of transparency,” Baltimore said.David Liu, a biologist at the Broad Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts, challenged He on how the girls might benefit from having their DNA altered. The children were not at risk of contracting HIV at birth and he said there were many ways to avoid HIV infection later in life. “What was the unmet medical need for these patients in particular?” Liu asked.He said in defence: “I truly believe that, not only for this case but for millions of children, they need this protection since an HIV vaccine is not available. For this case I feel proud.”Matthew Porteus, professor of paediatrics at Stanford University, said: “He’s already at risk of becoming a pariah.” Scientists talked about their research plans years in advance with many colleagues, to get feedback before they set out. “Unless he starts to engage in the scientific process, it will get worse and worse,” Porteus added.At the summit He presented slides to an audience of scientists who expressed concern that he could have brought harm to his subjects and jeopardised gene editing research.The scientist said, however, he wanted to prevent HIV being inherited from a parent because so many children were affected by the virus in China. Eight couples had agreed to take part in the study, though one had dropped out. With each, the father was HIV positive, while the woman was clear of the virus.He told the audience he had worked on 31 eggs and implanted two altered embryos in one woman. One of the babies had only one copy of the CCR5 gene edited, which was not enough to confer HIV resistance. The health of both children would be monitored for the next 18 years.The gene-editing work had started three years ago, partly paid for by He, who had consulted, he said, with just a few colleagues about his plans.In the UK and many other countries it is illegal to create genetically modified babies, and scientists in the field have reached a broad consensus that it would be deeply unethical to try. Genome editing is not considered safe, and any genetic modifications – whether beneficial or unintentionally harmful – affect not only the child, but their children and future generations.“It is impossible to overstate how irresponsible, unethical and dangerous this is at the moment,” said Kathy Niakan, a scientist at the Francis Crick Institute, in London, who was present at the summit. “There was a worrying lack of oversight or scrutiny of his clinical plans before he started human experiments and a complete lack of transparency throughout the process. “I found it highly troubling that He avoided questions about approval processes, and his answers on patient recruitment and consent did not reassure me. The team don’t seem to have had adequate training on proper consent processes. Offering vulnerable patients free IVF treatment presents a clear conflict of interest.”On Tuesday it was announced that He’s work was being investigated by Chinese officials and his university in Shenzhen.He’s vague answers at the summit prompted more questions from the audience. Did He know enough about the technology to ensure that the children would be healthy, or might they contract other deadly viruses? He insisted he did know enough.“How do you see your responsibility to these children?” asked Eben Kirksey, an associate professor of anthropology, at Deakin University, in Victoria, Australia. He replied that the children’s medical care would be provided for, but offered no details.The missing information frustrated many in the audience. “This is a red line,” one conference attendee told He. “Why did you choose to cross it and conduct this in secret?”Robin Lovell-Badge, a geneticist at the Francis Crick Institute, in London, claimed that He was misguided. “He clearly made some wrong decisions. I’m very critical of calling this a scientific breakthrough because he’s messed up all along.” Lovell-Badge said he was inclined to believe that He had altered the babies’ DNA, but said the scientist needed to show proof of it. The only way to convince the world would be if an independent, qualified, lab tested the DNA of the parents and the two babies to show that the genes had been edited. “Nothing that I’ve been shown says it’s false. But the evidence I’ve seen is not yet good enough,” he added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e96976ed1b109bd7a299ec3b77d4cf4ea9625bb/0_141_4608_2764/master/4608.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9870d065f0a9bde9e017a99fea60afdb","title":"teenage boys and young men tell us what issues matter to you","story":"We want to hear from young men living in the UK for a project exploring the issues most important to youWhat’s it like for teenage boys and young men growing up in the UK?

Three mock races, which looked rather more like exercise gallops, were staged over three and a half furlongs on the road that runs inside the Grand National course in an experiment which satisfied the organisers that their ambitions are logistically possible, at the very least.An artificial surface was laid the previous day in only 18 hours but those behind City Racing admit they will have to be even quicker at laying and removing the track if they are to be allowed to stage events in anyone’s high street.Intriguingly, the layout for this trial was modelled on Constitution Hill, where it emerges from Green Park and turns left on to the Mall. That suggests one of City Racing’s ambitions is to stage racing right outside Buckingham Palace, which would certainly draw a crowd. The Queen’s eldest grandchild, Peter Phillips, is the company’s chief executive.Phillips said nothing should be read into this choice of layout. “It was an easy thing for us to replicate here and show it is a doable thing but it is just an example.” It is understood City Racing was, for a time, on course to stage its initial raceday early last month in Paris as part of the build-up to the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe. Money is said to have become the stumbling point, with the French authorities asking for rather a lot of it.There is still enthusiasm for the project in France, apparently, and Paris is one of the more likely locations for one of the two racedays being planned for the end of next year, details of which are promised early in 2019. Dubai is also thought to be in the running, its broad streets offering plenty of room and its ruler, Sheikh Mohammed, being an enormously important figure in world horse racing.Clearly, the British-based City Racing would love to stage some racing in central London but obtaining the relevant permission has proved to be challenging. That ambition will probably have to wait until year two of the project.“It’s a bloody good idea,” said Phillips after the first trial of eight runners had taken place in front of a crowd of journalists and potential investors. “I’ve spent my life trying to avoid horses and I keep getting drawn back into this sort of thing.”He insisted the aim was to help promote the sport, rather than compete with existing fixtures. Putting races on in the middle of major cities would help racing to reach people who would otherwise have no contact with it, including the younger audience it struggles to attract. Some have described it as racing’s answer to cricket’s Twenty20.Phillips acknowledged such an audience would be especially sensitive to issues of equine welfare, which he described as “our number one priority”. A panel of vets will examine the runners before races to make sure they are fit to compete.The surface, Equaflow, has been designed to provide plenty of cushion on top of a road or pavement. It consists of a high-tensile plastic base, covered by 180mm of all-weather surface and was used for the equine events at the London Olympics.Eight professional jockeys took part and praised how the surface coped, saying it rode as if it had been in place for months rather than hours. “They’re getting their toe in a little bit, which is great,” Hollie Doyle said. “Sometimes a new surface can ride a bit quick or kick up but it rode perfect. I can’t fault it. It’s quite similar to Wolverhampton.”There was only a furlong after the winning post to allow the jockeys to pull up, which explains why they did not race flat out. Doyle said a full five-furlong course with a two-furlong pull-up, as planned for next year, would be adequate."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3bafc1dec83ea326375cbd6f0467ac3b8c21396/0_139_4757_2855/master/4757.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b9eba9de84e46ecadfd3185bb4feedd","title":"davis cup atp world cup tennis","story":"Albert Costa, who won the Davis Cup for Spain three times, as player and captain, hopes tradition will be enough to stave off opposition to the radical changes engulfing the 118-year-old competition but predicts a merger with the ATP’s rival World Cup in the next two years could ultimately settle the conflict.“We know that one form of the Davis Cup is finished, and one is going to come,” Costa told the  on Wednesday, looking back on the last of the old finals – in Lille at the weekend, when Croatia beat France 3-1 – and forward to the experiment he will oversee as tournament director in Madrid next November.Meanwhile, the world No 1, Novak Djokovic – who will boycott Madrid – made Costa’s task significantly more complicated when it was revealed he is campaigning to scrap the rule that players can only be eligible for the Olympics if they play in the Davis Cup. If the leading players do not need to play in Madrid in November to play in Tokyo the following July, their already firm attachment to the 10-day ATP World Cup in Melbourne in January 2020 will be hugely strengthened.“ With a new competition, you don’t feel like this. I played before in the World Team Cup in Düsseldorf, which was something similar – although this is going to be bigger – and I never felt like I did when I was playing Davis Cup.”Pierre-Hugues Herbert, the French doubles specialist, echoed Djokovic’s cynicism in stronger terms in Lille at the weekend. “We hope the new format will not work and we will come back to the old one,” he said. “When we left the stadium, we took a photo of this moment because we don’t know if it will be repeated.” He had the moral support of his losing teammate, Lucas Pouille – and a majority of the crowd, judging by their sporadic booing of ITF officials.Almost daily developments suggest the power play between the ITF boss, David Haggerty, and his ATP counterpart, Chris Kermode, could be resolved in 2020 but Costa is not as purblind as some to the vigour of the opposition, and agrees there probably will be a merger for a unified world team competition, including the WTA.“That’s a reality,” he says. “Everybody is talking, and I think it’s an open door to make a mixed competition, and to do it together. That’s what my information is. At the end of the day, I think it will be best for all of tennis, but we’ll see how it goes. We have two years to try to convince the ATP and the tennis world that maybe two competitions are not good for any of us.”If there is to be an amicable resolution to an argument everyone but those in a position to avoid it could see, it will take the calm counsel of former players such as Costa to ease the way, because he understands both sides of the argument. He hears the players’ complaints about the timing of the final, for instance – just six weeks before the ATP event.“I can understand the players’ point,” he says, “but the reality is right now, if they are in the final, they have to play Davis Cup at that time anyway. It’s better now because you only have to play two weeks to have the chance to win the Davis Cup. Before you had to play four weeks, and over five sets. Your efforts were greater. Now, six countries only have to play one week, and the other 12 play only two weeks.”• The new Davis Cup will culminate in a season-ending, 18-team tournament at a neutral venue in November that the ITF hopes will be more attractive to elite players.• Countries can progress to the final from a 24-team qualifying round in February made up of home and away ties. The 12 winners advance the losers are relegated to Group 1 and play ties in AprilSeptember.• Davis Cup semi-finalists from the previous year will join the 12 qualified nations at the November finals, along with two wildcards.• The November finals feature six three-team groups in a round-robin format, with two singles matches and one doubles match per tie.

And it’s still a gamble, right? “Right now, maybe. At the moment, it doesn’t exist. We have to show people what it is going to be like, then maybe we can form an opinion. Right now we can talk. I can’t imagine how it’s going to be – and I love the idea.

The company believes it can make a significant return on its investment by securing lucrative sponsorship and television deals in the next decade.Each club would be armed with a payment of £20m. The aim is that it will be used for infrastructure projects and reducing debt with the salary cap pegged for the next two seasons, but sides are allowed two marquee players who are not part of the cap and Read is in that category.Read, 33, has said he is likely to leave New Zealand after the 2019 World Cup. “We have always thought as a family that we would like to go overseas and use that experience for the kids,” he went on. “That is probably the main option at the moment.” He revealed that he had plenty of options, with retirement being one of them.Racing 92 are confident that if Read does move to Europe, the northern half of Paris will be his destination. They had lined up the New Zealand centre Ryan Crotty, but that move has been shelved because signing both would take them over the Top 14’s salary cap.A number of All Blacks have played for Racing. Joe Rokocoko is in the current squad, Dan Carter last season finished a three-year stint there and Ali Williams ended his career with last season’s beaten European Champions Cup finalists.Racing’s president, Jacky Lorenzetti, has made signing Read his top priority, but reports in France claim that two Premiership clubs have made offers to Read, who took over the New Zealand captaincy from Richie McCaw after the 2015 World Cup.Other All Blacks will be targets for French and English clubs after the World Cup, not least the fly-half Beauden Barrett, the full-back Ben Smith and Crotty, while the prop Owen Franks, whose brother Ben plays for Northampton, has said that moving overseas is an option.The salary cap in France is £3m more than it is in the Premiership but the marquee player provision partly makes up the difference and in a season in which, approaching the halfway mark, eight clubs are in a relegation battle, the need for players who can make a difference is more acute.Worcester face losing their Wales wing Josh Adams, who is out of contract at Sixways at the end of the season. The Scarlets want to re-sign their former player and if they make him an offer which is turned down, Adams would not be available for his country under a rule that stipulates exiles who have opted not to play for a region need to have won at least 60 caps.“Josh would be welcome here, there is no doubt about that,” said the Scarlets head coach, Wayne Pivac, who will take charge of Wales after the World Cup. “Finances meant we were not able to retain him after he came through the academy. He went away, is playing some really good rugby and I hope he is coming back to Wales.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a7fbdcae17d8627a966781b159641d08018e335/0_0_2674_3870/master/2674.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e692bd48f3c3b87ea7375309da7e951 700w","title":"mike pompeo khashoggi us saudi ties downgrading mistake","story":"The Trump administration has attempted to persuade the Senate not to cut off US military support to the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, arguing that it was in the US national interest and was helping to limit civilian casualties.The defence secretary, James Mattis, and the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, presented a classified briefing to the full Senate, in a last-minute effort to block a bipartisan measure that invokes the War Powers Resolution to end US involvement in the Yemen war.However, several senators who had opposed the same measure in March declared themselves unconvinced, with several complaining about the absence of the CIA director, Gina Haspel, who they wanted to brief the Senate about the murder of the Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi.The CIA has reportedly assessed that the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, most likely ordered the killing of the dissident journalist in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October.Bob Menendez, the top Democrat on the Senate foreign relations committee, said Haspel’s failure to appear was “outrageous” and a “cover-up”.“Tells me volumes about what’s really going on here,” Menendez told reporters after the briefing, indicating he would support the Yemen bill, which he had opposed in March.Cory Gardner, a Republican senator from Colorado, said: “There are certainly members who are weighing the absence of the CIA director in how they will vote today.”Speaking to reporters after he addressed the Senate, Pompeo repeated administration claims that there was no direct evidence connecting Bin Salman to Kahshoggi’s murder.The murder of Khashoggi, a US resident, has significantly heightened the growing unease in Congress over the mounting civilian toll in Yemen, where more than 50,000 people are estimated to have died, many as a direct result of the Saudi coalition’s bombing campaign. Save the Children has said that many more, including up to 85,000 children, have died from starvation, in large part as a result of the coalition effort to strangle the economy in areas under control of Houthi rebels.The UN has warned that 14 million Yemeni lives are at risk from a famine it suggests is imminent.Before his appearance at the Senate, Pompeo played down human rights concerns in a commentary for the Wall Street Journal. He referred to them as “caterwauling and media pile-on” in the “salons of Washington”.In his speech to the Senate, made available by the state department, Pompeo argued that support of the coalition was critical to US interests, in particular the struggle against Iran, which the administration has made the cornerstone of its Middle East policy.“The first mission is to assist the Saudis and the Emiratis in their fight against Iranian-backed Houthi fighters. This conflict isn’t optional for Saudi Arabia, and abandoning it puts American interests at risk, too,” Pompeo said. He added that the US was also fighting al-Qaida in Yemen and seeking to protect Americans working in Saudi Arabia and traveling through the waters around Yemen.The secretary of state also argued that US cooperation was helping mitigate the civilian death toll. He said the coalition had stopped using cluster munitions and changed its rules of engagement in line with US recommendations.“The suffering in Yemen grieves me, but if the United States of America was not involved in Yemen, it would be a hell of a lot worse,” Pompeo said.In his presentation, Mattis made similar arguments.“While tragedies occur in war, we assess restraint and improved tactical judgment by Arab coalition pilots has reduced the risk of civilian casualties,” he told senators.The administration has made similar claims before, and human rights groups said that there was no sign that the civilian death toll from the bombing campaign was declining.Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee, said that, barring some last-minute change in administration policy, he would support the resolution to cut US military aid, but would seek to amend it in his committee, without giving details.The Democratic senator Chris Murphy, one of the authors of the resolution, suggested the administration’s lobbying had backfired and that he was more confident after the session that it would pass."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dfd69ee6e5a2a31743fe30aa2bba00fa848d70c2/0_350_4000_2398/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fdc31649c2f4e4cc4418b28f0576deed","title":"gay rugby player facing deportation allowed to leave holding centre","story":"Kenneth Macharia still fears being deported to Kenya, where he could face persecution for being gayA gay rugby player who is facing deportation to Kenya, where he says he will be persecuted because of his sexuality, has been granted bail allowing him to leave the immigration centre where he was being held.Kenneth Macharia, who plays for Bristol Bisons, a gay and inclusive rugby club, told of his relief at being allowed out of the immigration centre where he had been held for almost two weeks, which he likened to a prison..The 38-year-old, who has lived in the UK for nearly a decade, was granted bail on Wednesday at Hatton Cross tribunal hearing centre in Middlesex. He still faces the prospect of deportation.Nearly 100,000 people have signed a petition calling on the Home Office to halt his removal.The judge Edward Woodcraft told Macharia: “The fact I have released you on bail is not an indication that you will for ever more be allowed to stay in the United Kingdom.”Macharia, a mechanical design engineer by profession, appeared at the tribunal via video link from Harmondsworth immigration removal centre near Heathrow, where he had been held since 15 November. He wore a black and pink Bristol Bisons RFC T-shirt and was supported by teammates whowere also wearing the same shirts.Macharia was bailed with a series of conditions, including that he lives and sleeps at an address in Glastonbury, that he provides financial sureties and that he reports to an immigration officer. The Home Office has been told to consider how Macharia’s raised profile in Kenya affects matters while his fate is determined.Speaking after the hearing as he waited for his teammates to drive him home, Macharia told the : “I am extremely happy and grateful for everyone who has supported me.”He said the ordeal had caused him to suffer from depression. “I have never been to a prison but to me, this is a prison because I did not have my freedom and get to go where I want,” he said.“There is an extra anxiety during the first few days before they cancelled my removal. I was extremely anxious all the time and fearful they would dump me on to a plane at any moment.“I had felt relief because they cancelled my removal, but last night I could hardly sleep when I released they were still intent on removing me.”Asked how he felt about the prospect of going back to Kenya still hanging over him, he said: “It is something that really forces anxiety and fear. Due to the support I’m feeling a bit more hopeful for the future, but due to the way the Home Office is behaving they are not really showing me signs they will allow me to stay.”Macharia has been in the UK since 2009, arriving on a student visa. He has twice been granted extensions of his leave to remain, as a student and then as a highly skilled migrant.He claimed asylum in May 2016, arguing that he would be persecuted in Kenya because he is gay. Homosexual activity is illegal in the African country. The Home Office accepts that this is the case, but argues that this falls short of persecution.Macharia trains with Bristol Bisons and is also the match-day photographer. After the hearing, his teammate and friend of three years Murray Jones said: “We’re past the first hurdle … it buys us time so we can get more support and more funds to make sure that he can be granted permanence in this country.”Leaving the hearing room, Macharia’s mother, Jacinta, smiled and said: “I’m so happy.”The Home Office would not comment specifically on the case, but a spokesman said: “We are committed to delivering an asylum process that is sensitive to all forms of persecution, including those based on sexual identity or orientation. We have a robust assurance mechanism, which involves considering all available evidence in light of published country-specific information.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c28f4637b9dc36c5eb7408586f51c95c98c3409d/0_120_2129_1278/master/2129.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e16fdbdeaafb502949bea5423b3592e","title":"knickers the cow why australias giant steer is so fascinating","story":"Seven-year-old whose size saved him from the slaughterhouse goes viralFirst, the news, such as it is: there is a giant cow named Knickers in Western Australia and people have gone crazy.Technically he is not a cow, but a steer (a neutered male). But he is giant, standing at 1.94 metres (6ft 4in ) to his withers (the shoulder). This is just shy of the world record-holding steer, Bellino, who lives in Italy and stands at 2.02 metres. Knickers, a Holstein Friesian, weighs in at 1,400kg (220 stone) and is believed to be the biggest steer in Australia.And, for some reason, Knickers and his sizeable existence are the talk of the internet, making news all over the world.“It’s out of control,” says Geoff Pearson, Knickers’ owner, over the phone from his property in Myalup, south of Perth. “I didn’t expect it to go as far as it has. I’ve been called every 10 minutes since four o’clock this morning.”It is, perhaps, no surprise that a country obsessed with building giant things to line its highways – the Big Watermelon has just joined the Big Banana, the Big Prawn and the Big Potato – would be fascinated by an oversized animal.But it is not only Australians who have taken to Knickers. Pearson says he has spent the day fielding calls from the UK, the US, Canada and New Zealand, and the story has been picked up by the BBC, CNN, USA Today and the British newspaper the Daily Mirror.The US model and social media genius Chrissy Teigen tweeted to say that she pays for wifi on flights precisely so she doesn’t miss out on news like this.But why exactly are we fascinated by a large steer?Pearson believes it’s just a matter of novelty. “I suppose it’s just a different topic,” he says. “It doesn’t happen every day, you don’t get a steer of that size in normal production systems, and people like animal stories.”This – the baffling reality of Knickers’ unreal size – is certainly part of it, raising questions: was he bred to be this size? Pumped full of hormones? Does this mark a dawning era of bovine megafauna? How did Knickers get so large?“We don’t know that ourselves,” Pearson says. “It’s just a freaky thing.”Partly it’s because Knickers was given the chance to grow to his full height. Steers are usually sold to processing plants at the age of two or three years.“They probably don’t have the opportunity to grow to their full potential,” Pearson says. “There could be other animals that could grow to this size but didn’t get the chance.”But Pearson is adamant that Knickers, who is seven, is a “standout”. “You could go through thousands and thousands of animals and try to find one of this size and you wouldn’t be able to.”Plus, Knickers’ story is one of hope and reprieve. Pearson tried to offload him last month, only to be told by the meat processors said the steer was just too large for the abattoir.“He’s too big for the chain, he’s out of spec, he’d be too heavy for the machines and he’d probably actually be hanging on the floor, so there would be contamination issues, and his cuts of meat would be too large,” Pearson says.Which means Knickers can live out his days on the 3,000-acre property, home to 4,000 head of cattle, for whom he acts as a “coach” – showing them where to roam.“He just hangs around, he’s part of the furniture,” Pearson says. “Obviously he’s gained some stardom – that’s changed his identity a little bit.“We’ll have to see what happens with that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab803fb2e6205a6c69d2970215bb8f121129ddd9/0_0_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=97fd6ff264e8b2eca36e54a80f647b93","title":"the conservation conversation why we need to talk about trees","story":"With tree planting rates in the UK the lowest they have been in 40 years, and more trees being cut down than planted, action is needed to balance the losses. Can a pledge to plant a million trees in five years save our forests? By  Amy-Jane BeerIt’s easy to view trees as scenery. They don’t move about, their longevity gives them an air of permanence, and they support complex biological communities. They are habitat, but they are also inhabitants – fellow Earthlings, whose ability to sense and respond to the world around them we are only just beginning to understand.Despite government targets to increase tree cover, rates of tree planting in the UK are declining, with efforts in 2016 the lowest for 40 years, and failing to match the number of trees felled.The type of species planted is important in ecological and human terms. Native species offer far greater value for wildlife, but other factors to consider are the expected size of full-grown trees, the kind of management that might be required and what uses the tree might serve: for example, shading city streets, forming hedges or producing crops.The best time to plant a tree is autumn or winter, so that the saplings have a good chance to establish a decent root system before the next growth season. This greatly improves their survival chances.When choosing trees to plant, it’s best to avoid imported stock, and if you must plant non-native species, buy locally grown saplings from a reputable nursery. Catastrophes such as the arrival and spread of Chalara (the cause of ash dieback disease) might have been prevented by better attention to imports.Tree planting doesn’t have to mean forest creation. Recent years have seen an increasing interest in street trees, wood pastures and community orchards. Fruit trees have a lot going for them – not only do they provide an obvious return on investment, but they also develop so-called veteran features, such as rot holes, much earlier than native hardwoods. Dead wood is a crucial habitat for a huge array of other species, from fungi to hole-nesting birds and from the myriad invertebrates that use decaying trunks and fallen logs as nurseries to the badgers and hedgehogs that eat them.Planting trees is only half the story, and conserving the trees we already have has never been more important. Replacing a mature tree takes decades, yet the trees being lost are often old ones. At a community level, the loss of such trees can be deeply felt. Effective schemes to increase the visibility of established trees before they face a threat include adopting them, mapping them, and submitting them as candidates in tree of the year competitions. It all helps, and getting to know an inidual tree in all its seasonal moods has a power of its own. Try it – you might discover your oldest and most mysterious friend."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cbb9e34fb343adf4b0153176ecc951ed3faf913e/0_117_3504_2102/master/3504.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e415c131b167cbf3ecca3e8a4168d5c9","title":"how do trees survive in winter","story":"Some shed their leaves others rely on antifreeze in their veins (or pine needles) to survive the colder months. But trees couldn’t survive winter without the special relationship they have with birdsAside from the music of the westerlies playing through those skeletal canopies, British woods, when stripped of their leaves, tend to have an atmosphere of expectant quietude. Winter is a time of frugality, and the two major tree types, deciduous and evergreen, adopt very different strategies to cope with the double challenge of little sunlight and low temperatures.A deciduous tree operates by shedding all its leaves. This means that it lacks the means to photosynthesise and, thus, to generate fresh energy for five to six months of the year. However, there’s an upside to losing foliage, because it has ended the loss of moisture that occurs through leaves.This endless recycling of water from the trees to the atmosphere, known as transpiration, is costly. A single large mature oak may possess up to 200,000 leaves, and lose as much as 150,000 litres of water over the course of a year. A summer wood in full foliage conceals thousands of rising columns of tree-borne moisture, which is why it often feels so warm and humid within woods, when the surrounding countryside can be cool and breezy.Conifer trees reduce the stress of water loss by possessing fine needle-like leaves with minimum surface area and thick, waxy water-retaining cuticles. The adaptations slow down the process of transpiration. While the structure of evergreen foliage doesn’t have the energy-producing efficiency of a flat plate-like deciduous leaf, the fact that conifers can continue to photosynthesise year-round compensates for this. Some pines even have antifreeze in their needles, to enable them to work in icy conditions.The dormancy of winter trees means that this is the best time for planting or transferring them around our gardens. Choose a warm winter’s day so the earth is soft, dig a hole deep enough so the soil fully protects the roots from frost, then water well once planted. Observing how that new tree slowly grows and flourishes is one of the most satisfying processes in gardening.Trees also make use of the winter to do some self-propagation of their own. Much of the work for this process begins in the autumn, with the production of seeds and fruit. British oaks are a perfect example. From September onwards they leave a great larder of sugar- and protein-rich food for hungry birds or mammals, in the form of acorns. Squirrels, rodents and several species of crow store these nuts away to consume during the colder months. Yet, no species has more of a capacity to plan ahead than the creature that William Henry Hudson called the “British bird of paradise”: the European jay.In late autumn, this glorious pink-and-blue bird can be seen making repeat journeys to and from acorn-producing oak trees. The jay then buries them, sometimes flying several miles from the original source tree. Over the course of autumn, the average bird hides about 5,000 acorns. Across Britain and Ireland, the entire jay population stores somewhere in the region of 1.7bn acorns.The birds possess extraordinary memories for where they have hidden their stores, and yet – here is the clever part – they can’t remember them all. Not only do those forgotten acorns stand a strong chance of growing into oak saplings the following spring, but jays show a preference for open ground between tree cover in their choice of burial sites. In other words, they plant their acorns precisely where they might grow best.This acorn storage system thus benefits the jay twice over. Not only does it provide itself with food for the winter, but by forgetting some of its larder it also creates fresh habitat for future generations of jays. These birds are truly s of our oak woods. But it works both ways: by taking care of the birds, the trees ensure they prosper themselves.The dispersal of seed is, in fact, a major part of the woodland scene in winter. Hawthorn, holly, yew, mountain ash, crab apple, blackthorn and sea buckthorn – not to forget woodland shrubs, such as mistletoe and ivy, or garden favourites including cotoneaster and pyracantha – all produce fruit that birds love.Thrushes are especially drawn to these trees and consume vast quantities of their fruits. In return for this generosity, the thrushes then fly to their roosts in some hedge or tall tree at dusk and do what comes naturally. They poop out seeds during the night and leave each one in its own little store of fertiliser.So woods and birds are truly partners in reproduction. You can see how they interact on any winter’s day and in any wood, from John O’Groats to Land’s End, and from the mountain tops to the seashore. Because we legally “own” it, people like to imagine that they control the land, but the British woodlands have ways of shaping their own destinies.Yorkshire Tea and treesYorkshire Tea is planting a million trees over five years – with a bit of help from the Woodland Trust, UK schoolchildren and Kenyan tea farmers.

Photograph: Paddy Logue A dolphin has been spotted swimming in the river Liffey in Dublin on Wednesday morning.A number of people have taken to social media to share videos of the common dolphin, in particular around the North Wall Quay area and near Butt Bridge.The Dublin Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (DSPCA) said it has spoken to a member of the Marine Animal Rescue.Clowie Russell, marine mammal ecologist with the Irish Whale and Dolphin Group, said the sighting was “unusual” and possibly a result of Storm Diana.“Common dolphins are not usually seen in the river Liffey so it is unusual, they normally are seen in big groups and they’re normally seen in deeper water so it is unusual for him to be by himself far up. He could possibly have gotten lost due to the weather,” she told The .Ms Russell said the group will be monitoring the situation and are not “too worried”.“If he was strong enough to get up the river, he should be strong enough to get back out. Hopefully he’s gone back out now with high tide,” she added.“He does look quite healthy, he’s not lethargic but if it was the case that he was there for a couple of days and we thought he was in trouble, we could see if we could coax him out with a boat. We try not to interfere, that would be a last resort.”The Irish Whale and Dolphin Group said they received “several calls” from concerned members of the public on Wednesday asking what could be done for the dolphin.“Our reply is always in these circumstances not to interfere,” it said. “If this dolphin is, as the video suggests, in good health and was able to swim upriver into the city centre, then it should be able to swim downriver on its own steam.”The group said it received another sighting of a “small cetacean” (species unknown) on the river Liffey, around the East Link toll bridge on August 15th.A pod of around 20 common dolphins were also recorded from a commercial fishing boat off Laytown, Co Meath on November 8th.“We know this species is currently to be seen off our east coast,” the group added."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3709939.1543164372!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"suspect device the all metal hip replacement that caused untold hardship","story":"The DePuy ASR hip launched in 2004, was promoted as a game changer in orthopaedics, with 3,300 patients receiving the hip in Ireland.  Problems were discovered, resulting in its recall in Ireland in 2010. Video: Bryan O’Brien Report: Colm Keena\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGillian O’Sullivan: ‘He told me there was a lovely new hip on the market that could last a lifetime . . . I would never look back.’Scandals involving breast implants and all-metal hips prosthetics have raised global concerns and prompted regulatory reform in the European Union. Now the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) has conducted a major investigation into the medical device sector.The debacle that is the DePuy metal hip illuminates the ways medical devices are brought to market and the mayhem that can ensue if a product fails to live up to expectations.On a per capita basis, more of the DePuy hips were implanted in Ireland than in any other jurisdiction. In excess of 1,000 Irish patients have issued proceedings against DePuy. Hundreds have already settled.When Gillian O’Sullivan gets up from her chair to fetch some hip X-rays, you can’t but notice that one of her legs is shorter than the other.One of the difficulties with replacing hips is that the artificial implants wear out. As bone and tissue get destroyed when prosthetics are being implanted, replacing worn-out implants with new ones is not a simple matter. For this reason, the practice has been to wait until people are older, and less active, before giving them artificial hips. If you get the timing right, the patient may be dead before the hip implant has failed.But in the early 2000s, hip implant manufacturers started to market new, longer-lasting implants they said were suited to younger, active people.In 2005, when she was 40, Gillian O’Sullivan went to see the highly regarded local orthopaedic surgeon, Tadhg O’Sullivan, in the Waterford Regional Hospital. She was suffering from arthritis.“He told me there was a lovely new hip on the market that could last a lifetime . . . I would never look back.”Her surgeon was referring to a new metal product from DePuy, a subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson and a major manufacturer of orthopaedic products. The so-called ASR hip came in two variants. One was a hip resurfacing device, which covered the cup and ball of the hip socket, while the second was a total hip replacement product, which involved replacing the top of the femur with a metal device, which then sat into the metal cup.Both products differed from what was previously on the market in that both traditional hip implants used a metal ball and a polyethylene or plastic cup. The DePuy hip had a ball and cup made out of a hard-wearing cobalt chromium metal alloy.Tadhg O’Sullivan was one of six design surgeons who had worked with DePuy’s engineers to design the new product. It is standard practice for innovative new products to be developed with the assistance of clinicians.At the time he saw Gillian O’Sullivan, the Waterford surgeon was showing surgeons around the world how to implant the new product, and taking part in post-market surveillance of how the product was performing.In October 2005, Gillian O’Sullivan had a DePuy hip replacement device implanted on her left side at the Kilcreene Orthopaedic Hospital in Kilkenny. In May 2006, her second hip was replaced. She was told she now had the “hips of Brian O’Driscoll”.However, her operations were difficult and she experienced pain afterwards.“By Christmas 2006 we knew I was in trouble. I had no energy levels, I was really sick, and you could hear me coming down the stairs. There was a click, click, click, every time I moved.”Her children could hear the grinding of her metal hips.In May 2007, she went back to Tadhg O’Sullivan. “I said, I’m in trouble here. He argued with me. He said I was in better condition than I had been.”She was told that “the god of orthopaedics” had performed her hip operation and that she should wait and see.By this stage O’Sullivan had moved from the Waterford Regional Hospital to the private Whitfield Clinic, also in Waterford. “Between 2007 and 2010, I was in an awful state. I would say to myself, I think I am dying.”Gillian O’Sullivan now believes that during the years 2007 to 2011, metal ions from her hip implants were progressively damaging the flesh and bone of her hip joints.When the DePuy hip was withdrawn from the market in August 2010, Irish patients were advised that their future care would involve the monitoring of the cobalt and chromium levels in their blood.After the withdrawal, Gillian O’Sullivan got a letter for an appointment at the Whitfield and Tadhg O’Sullivan warned her that she would be hearing a lot of public debate about cobalt and chromium ion levels in the blood. He said it was “all bullshit”.“They are trying to frighten everybody.”She went to see Jimmy Sheehan at the Blackrock Clinic again and brought along her blood test results which showed very high metal ion levels. “He said, you need to get those hips out now. They’re poisoning you.”In 2011, the right hip was replaced by O’Sullivan at the Whitfield, and a year later the second hip was also replaced. The operations, which were paid for by DePuy, were difficult, she said, and left her with a left leg that was longer than her right.During her original operations and subsequent operations Gillian O’Sullivan met a number of other patients who were having DePuy hips implanted or replaced by Tadhg O’Sullivan. Among those she met was Kiera Kenneally, who had DePuy hips implanted by Tadhg O’Sullivan in 2005 and 2006, the first when she was just 16 years old.Kenneally, who now lives in Sandyford, Dublin, is originally from Hillview, Waterford, and Gillian O’Sullivan knew her family. Kenneally sued DePuy. Her case was heard over a number of days in the High Court in 2016, but the case was settled with the agreement including a confidentiality clause. However, the transcripts from the sitting days have been seen by The .In August 2005, Kenneally had a resurfacing procedure done by O’Sullivan in Kilcreene. In May of the following year, the second hip was resurfaced.The left hip implant was replaced by O’Sullivan in 2010. During the operation, substantial metal ion damage to her hip tissue was discovered and there was substantial loss of bone.Blood tests taken afterwards showed cobalt and chromium blood levels that were, respectively, 10 and four times above what would be expected, the High Court was told.Kenneally has since been advised she may in time need to have a Girdlestone procedure, which fuses the femur to the hip so that it can no longer bend. She may end up in a wheelchair.The medical records in Kenneally’s case showed that before her procedure, Tadgh O’Sullivan discussed both with her and her mother the concept of metal-on-metal hips, the possibility of failure, and the issue of debris (which in turn leads to the release of ions).Gillian O’Sullivan also sued DePuy. During her High Court action, she says, DePuy “fought me all the way”.She also enlisted Nargol as an expert witness and he told the court that 90-95 per cent of her problems were due to the DePuy implants. DePuy argued that 90-95 per cent of her difficulties were due to her congenital condition.Mr Justice Kevin Cross decided that 90 per cent of O’Sullivan’s difficulties were referable to the DePuy hips, and awarded her €740,000. DePuy said it would appeal and the matter was then settled for €520,000.Unusually for people who made settlements with DePuy, Gillian O’Sullivan did not agree to a “gagging” clause and so is free to discuss her experience.In his judgment in November 2016, Mr Justice Cross said O’Sullivan was an “honest historian” who did not consciously exaggerate, but that her difficulties prior to her hip operations were greater than she recalled.As was the case with the Kenneally trial, Tadgh O’Sullivan was not a party in the O’Sullivan case, was not called by either side, and no one criticised his surgical skills. The judge said he accepted that O’Sullivan’s relationship with her surgeon had broken down some time after the second DePuy implant operation.O’Sullivan would need future revisions and would continue to be severely disabled for the rest of her life, the judge said. “The plaintiff will also be in significant pain, probably for life.”Gillian O’Sullivan says, reflecting on what’s happened to her: “You make the most of your life. I can’t be on a beach. The balance is completely gone, and I would fall over nothing. I get pains and contractions. I was in bed for six weeks after Christmas.”She is a mix of being surprisingly upbeat, while also occasionally displaying a fierce sense of resentment towards Tadhg O’Sullivan. “I live my life. If I’m upright for the day, I’m happy.”The DePuy hip debacle may end up costing DePuy up to $4 billion (€3.53 billion) in damages. Other producers of metal hip implants are also being sued.Although figures are not available for the Republic, total damages of up to €80 million may yet be paid to Irish recipients of DePuy hips, with legal costs in addition to that. It is the largest corporate personal injuries episode to ever hit the Irish legal system.Despite the challenges a metal-on-metal product presented, a new all-metal hip resurfacing product, known as the Birmingham Hip Resurfacing (BHR) system, made by Smith \u0026amp Nephew, came on the market in the late 1990s and began to prove popular.The device was attractive for young, active people with hip problems, and Tadhg O’Sullivan was an early fan. A former GAA player himself, O’Sullivan was known for treating young athletes with joint problemsO’Sullivan told The  that it was because of his extensive use of the Birmingham hip that he was invited to work with DePuy in relation to its new product. At the time “I was probably one of the most experienced hip resurfacing surgeons in the world.”Companies developing new implants often engage surgeons to assist them. Although DePuy engineers put a huge amount of work into designing their new product, this did not including clinical trials, something that was not necessary under EU rules.Simulator tests were used, but critics say the tests did not replicate the repeated stop and start motion that is intrinsic to human joint use, and were restricted to larger model components, the sort used by larger framed people.“It would have been a very good design process if they were designing a washing machine,” says Trinity College Dublin engineering professor David Taylor. “They seem to have forgotten that it was going into a human being.”Taylor, who specialises in materials that are inserted into the body, has acted for a number of people who are suing DePuy. For him, a critical failure made by the DePuy engineers was not testing the proposed product on people prior to going to market.The head of medical device regulation in Ireland, Dr Niall MacAleenan, speaking generally, said clinical testing of medical device products was complicated by the fact that many devices were designed to be inside the body for years if not decades.Assessments as to the suitability of implanted devices involves a “risk benefit” assessment. “There is always risk. The question is if it is an acceptable level of risk.”In January 2004, DePuy got approval from a UK notified body, BSI, to market its two metal hip products throughout the EU. Approval across other, non-EU markets soon followed.For the US market, the company had to get approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which was considered a tougher regulatory authority than the multi-agency structure operating in the EU.English surgeon Tony Nargol was an early enthusiast for the new DePuy product. In September 2003, he travelled to Rome for the product launch, where he met Tadhg O’Sullivan and some of the other design surgeons. He agreed to become involved in a clinical study of the device to be used to seek approval for the product in the United States, and also to become an “opinion leader” for the device in the UK.Between 2004 and 2009, the Newcastle surgeon implanted about 500 of the metal devices, making him one of the highest users of the product in the world.However, by late 2006 a number of his patients were presenting with difficulties. Nargol began to study the performance of the DePuy product in his patients, working with hospital colleague Simon Jameson.Among the matters they began to examine was the role played by the “angle” of implantation of the cup. They also began to notice that it was smaller models of the device, used in smaller framed persons, that appeared to be causing the most difficulties.When he revised the DePuy hip in some of his patients, Nargol noted a “greenish grey” fluid in the hip joint while doing so. This was “tissue necrosis”, he told the courts in Australia in an affidavit in 2013.In early 2007, he asked Ian Newell, DePuy’s regional manager in the Newcastle area, if he knew of other cases involving greenish grey fluid and tissue necrosis. “Mr Newell replied that he was ‘not aware of any’,” Nargol said in his affidavit.The response he got from DePuy caused Nargol to think that the problems he was encountering were caused by his work rather than the product.At a meeting with Newell and others in a hotel in Durham in September 2007, Nargol discussed the apparent link between smaller devices and high ion levels.In response, Newell showed him the data from a DePuy study of 89 patients who had received the hips in the UK, Australia, South Africa and Germany. The study subjected them to regular blood-testing to see if their cobalt and chromium ion levels became elevated.In November 2007, two papers about the DePuy hips were presented at the American Academy of Hip and Knee Surgeons conference in Dallas, Texas, one by Nargol and one by Graham Isaac, the DePuy engineer who led the team that designed the new product. Both flagged problems with the device.Isaac’s paper was entitled Whole Blood Metal Ion Levels after Surface Replacement of the Hip the effect of Component Positioning, and the authors included Isaac, Tadgh O’Sullivan and the other design surgeons, as well as a surgeon from South Africa. The authors reported that 24 months after their procedures, the ion levels for 50 patients (40 male and 10 female) showed three female (30 per cent) and three males (7.5 per cent) had significantly higher ion levels than would be expected.These elevated levels were associated with their devices being implanted at particular angles, the conference was told.DePuy, O’Sullivan and the other authors were saying the negative outcomes were related to how the devices were implanted rather than attributable to any defects in the device.During 2008, Nargol continued to have regular contact with Isaac, Newell and other DePuy representatives. He also began to notice patients with difficulties whose implants had been put in at an angle that was at or near the “safe zone” that he and his colleagues had identified from their research.In time, Nargol came to believe that the product was at fault, not his work as a surgeon. The implants put in at particular angles tended to fail earlier than others, and so created the early impression that the angle was the source of the problem.In August 2008, Nargol stopped using the complete hip replacement product and in early 2009 he stopped using the DePuy resurfacing product also.A colleague, surgeon David Langton, had by this time noticed a new problem with the DePuy implant called “edge-loading”, which contributed to high wear and debris and was, in Langton’s view, the result of the design of the DePuy product.During a meeting with Isaac on March 11th, 2009, at DePuy’s offices in Leeds, Langton and Nargol outlined their latest findings.Nargol said there were problems with the DePuy product even when it was implanted at the recommended angle. There was a “design flaw”, especially with smaller cups.One of the DePuy representatives at the meeting said, “we’re f**ked”, Nargol said in his Australian affidavit. Isaac said the problem was “multifactorial”, with the factors involved including patient weight and activity levels.Requests submitted through DePuy for interviews with Isaac and Newell were declined.In time Nargol became one of the harshest critics globally of the DePuy product. He and Langton became involved in litigation around the world as patients sued DePuy for damages. Nargol, along with Langton, gave evidence in a lot of these cases and the surgeons are party to continuing proceedings in the US where, as designated whistleblowers, they stand to make significant amounts of money if DePuy ends up having to pay out to the US Government for implants sold to public health programmes.The judge did not have to rule on the mala fides issue because of the position adopted by DePuy in the trial, but he rejected the attack on Nargol’s evidence. He said the expert witnesses for both sides had given honest evidence. Nargol would not be interviewed by The  because of the ongoing litigation in various jurisdictions.In 2010, by way of his involvement in litigation, Nargol discovered that other surgeons had expressed concerns during the mid-2000s about the DePuy product, contrary to what he said he had been told by DePuy.The highly regarded Belfast orthopaedic surgeon, David Beverland, told Nargol he had stopped using the DePuy product in early 2007. Requests from The  to Beverland for an interview met with no response.Nargol contacted Beverland in 2010 after being told by a former DePuy employee that the Belfast surgeon had experienced problems with his patients.In his Australian affidavit, Nargol quoted a 2010 email from Beverland to Isaac: “All in all, this ASR problem has to date been the worst problem I have faced in my surgical career. It has been a real nightmare.”Nargol also said that in 2010 he was shown emails from the Dutch surgeon Paul Born to a DePuy executive, dated June 2006, in which he said he’d experienced a significant failure rate with DePuy and would no longer be using the product.Nargol said that on several occasions during 2007 and 2008 he had asked Newell, Isaac and their colleague Magnus Flett if other surgeons were noticing similar problems to him.“Mr Newell, Mr Flett, and Mr Isaac told me on several occasions that ‘no one else has had any problems with the ASR’.”The DePuy metal hip was voluntarily recalled in August 2010 after figures from the National Joint Registry for England, Wales and Northern Ireland showed it was performing badly when compared with its peers.The registry collects information on all joint replacement operations so as to measure the performance of the different implants that are on the market.In its most recent annual report, the registry said that for the 992,090 hip replacements monitored since it began collecting data in 2002, some 7.27 per cent have been replaced (or revised, as the medical term goes).The replacement rate would be lower if it were not for metal-on-metal implants which showed a replacement rate of 19-22 per cent. The most successful type of hip replacement, metal-on-polyethylene, had a replacement rate of 4.87 per cent.“Metal-on-metal resurfacings have a revision rate at 14 years of 14.76 per cent and their use, as with all metal-on-metal bearings, is now very limited.”After DePuy withdrew its product from the market, there was extensive discussion as to how it had been approved for sale in the first place.The EU and the United States are the world’s two most important bodies when it comes to the regulation of the medical devices sector. In the EU, there are multiple “notified bodies” each of which can award CE marks to proposed new medical devices, thereby allowing them be marketed across the union.In Ireland, the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) is the body that licenses new medical devices, while the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) has a role in monitoring the safety of devices that are on the market.The DePuy products were approved by BSI, a UK-notified body. Clinical trials were not required under EU rules, even though the products are recognised as among the higher-risk category of medical devices. Approval by an EU-certified body opened the way to the devices being marketed in other economies, including Australia and South Africa. Many of the world’s poorer nations rely on the developed world for the regulation of medical devices.In the US, the FDA decided that the DePuy hip resurfacing product was a significantly new product and required clinical testing. It allowed the marketing of the total hip replacement product.In 2009, DePuy was told confidentially by the FDA that it would not be granting approval for the hip resurfacing product after reviewing company studies that showed it had failed prematurely in “significant” numbers. In response the multinational quietly withdrew its request for approval.The DePuy hip replacement product was approved for the US market by way of a controversial pathway called “substantial equivalence”.Medical devices can be approved for the market in both the EU and the US if they can be shown to be substantially equivalent to a product already on the market, or if they can be shown to be made of parts that are substantially the same as parts already on the market.The rule applies even if the device or parts already approved have since been withdrawn, even for poor performance reasons.As a study in the New England Journal of Medicine put it in January 2013, approval by the FDA by way of substantial equivalence “does not mean that a new device is safe and effective: it means that the device is deemed no less safe and no less effective than a predicate”.The study looked at how the DePuy hip replacement device came to be approved for implantation in US citizens. It found that the lineage of the device involved 95 different devices or device parts that had operated as predicate devices or parts to which DePuy said its new product was substantially equivalent.The predicate devices included ones that were “discontinued long ago because their risk of revision was so much higher than that of other hip” products, the authors noted.The NSAI was not able to tell The  how many higher risk devices it had approved over the past decade by way of equivalence, or how many had been approved after clinical trials, even though the information was sought as far back as September 3rd last.However, MacAleenan of the HPRA points out that precisely because implanted medical devices designed to last a long time inside the body are hard to subject to pre-market clinical testing, the data that comes from devices that are already on the market is particularly valuable.There is another interesting aspect to the substantial equivalence phenomenon both here and in the US, according to a Newcastle University biomedical engineer, Tom Joyce, who has extensively studied the DePuy debacle“It happens all the time that a product comes onto market via substantial equivalence, meaning that it is supposed to be similar to a product already on the market, but it is then marketed as if it is wildly different,” said Joyce, who has worked with Nargol and Langon on behalf of Irish plaintiffs.The EU is currently introducing a new regime for the certification of medical devices that is in part a response to the DePuy hip and other high-profile failures.Tadhg O’Sullivan told The  that up to the date that the DePuy products were withdrawn, he never had a problem with any of his resurfacing patients.Despite the global controversy over the performance of DePuy hip, there is no mistaking O’Sullivan’s continuing enthusiasm for the product.During a lengthy interview in his consultation rooms in the Whitfield Clinic, O’Sullivan said the DePuy implant was an important innovation for patients with serious hip problems.Asked if in his view there was a design flaw with the DePuy hip resurfacing device, his answer was simple: “Not really. If put in properly, no.”Likewise, he said he did not believe there was a flaw with the ball and cup of the total hip replacement product, though there was a problem with the stem that attached it to the patient’s femur.He believed that DePuy, and J\u0026ampJ, were probably acting on the advice of lawyers when they decided to withdraw the product from the market. The decision, he says, was the equivalent of saying: “Sue the f**k out of us.”And that, he said, is what has happened.DePuy has “pumped an outrageous amount of money into putting this thing right. Unfortunately, the more they pump in, the more our legal profession want. They’re like an insatiable dog.”As well as assisting the DePuy engineers and attending design team meetings over a number of years, O’Sullivan was also the co-inventor of two patents registered in the name of DePuy that were associated with the hip product.Publicly available information in the US indicates that the two US design surgeons who worked with O’Sullivan on the DePuy project, Tom Schmalzried and Thomas Veil, received a number of million dollars each in royalties and other payments from the manufacturer.However, O’Sullivan says his royalty income from DePuy was “relatively small” and that if the time he had spent as a design surgeon travelling to meetings and conferences for DePuy had instead been spent working at the Whitfield Clinic he would have been equally well rewarded.He has earned more from DePuy as a result of the programme it has put in place for patients post the withdrawal of the hip product than he did while working as a design surgeon, he said.The enormous global medical legal battle that has erupted since the product was recalled has led to a great amount of misinformation coming into the public domain, the surgeon said. “We have poor people coming in here thinking they are going to die.” It is “very hard to get at the truth when there is a huge amount of money to be made from suing a company”. he added.O’Sullivan said he had not seen one paper which, read closely, showed heightened cobalt and chromium levels causing medical problems. Yet people were coming to him now, he said, with normal ageing problems such as becoming forgetful, and blaming it on their ion levels.The patient may feel fantastic, and may have no problem with their hips, but he tells them the only way to get their ion levels down is “to take out the generator”. It is their choice.Surgeons want to do what is best for their patients, he said. The DePuy project was about “trying to help people of 30 years of age who needed a hip and not be sending them home and have them not working for the next 20 years.”As matters now stand, most metal hip products have been withdrawn from the market and all major manufacturers are producing a similar ceramic ball and cup product. “They’re all giving you the basic Ford Focus.”The threat of being sued means doctors feel pressurised into doing what is safest in terms of legal exposure, rather than what is most appropriate for their patients.Surgeons know that if they put in a product that has been around for decades, but which fails, they cannot be sued, he said. And manufacturers, if they are going to fear being sued, are deterred from creating new devices.The loser in the end, he says, because of the stifling of innovation, is the patient.A special alternative dispute resolution (ADR) process has been put in place by the Irish courts such is the level of claims that have been lodged against DePuy over its metal hip product.The highest award to date has been €750,000, but the average is in the region of €100,000. If a settlement is not agreed, a claimant can take their case to court.As of July, 540 of the 1,108 sets of proceedings lodged against DePuy had been resolved. Many of the proceedings lodged do not qualify for the ADR.A spokeswoman for DePuy said she would not give a figure for total awards made in Ireland to date.“DePuy has no greater responsibility than to the patients who use our products,” she said in a statement to The . “We are committed to the wellbeing of our patients and believe the full history of the ASR system shows we have worked properly and responsibly to improve patients’ lives through innovation.“We will continue to stand by our patients.”A special investigation by The  in association with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3713608.1543430176!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit no deal may see pound tumble inflation soar bank of england","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGovernor Mark Carney during the Bank of England’s financial stability report at the Bank of England in the City of London. Photograph: Daniel Leal-OlivasPA Wire Britain risks suffering an even bigger hit to its economy than during the global financial crisis 10 years ago if it leaves the European Union in the worst-case Brexit scenario in four months’ time, the Bank of England said on Wednesday.Hours after the British government issued its own stark warning about the risks of a no-deal Brexit, the central bank said the economy could contract by as much as 8 per cent in the space of about a year.The separate reports could add to pressure on MPs to drop their opposition to a Brexit agreement that prime minister Theresa May struck with other EU leaders on Sunday, which is far from certain to be approved in parliament on December 11th.The BoE said the “disorderly” scenario, involving severe delays at UK borders and financial markets’ loss of confidence in British institutions, was not its base case.But if it happened, there would be a 25 per cent tumble in the value of sterling , taking it close to parity against the dollar, a spike in inflation to 6.5 per cent and a jump in interest rates. House prices would fall by 30 per cent.A merely “disruptive” Brexit, with goods flowing across borders but facing tariffs and other barriers, would cause a 3 per cent fall in gross domestic product, the central bank warned.“Our jobs is not to hope for the best but to prepare for the worst,” central bank governor Mark Carney told reporters at a news conference.Hours earlier, the government acknowledged that any Brexit option would be worse for the economy than staying in the EU, but said that leaving the bloc without any agreement with Brussels would weigh heavily on growth at least into the 2030s.By contrast, the plan that Mrs May agreed with EU leaders on Sunday “delivers an outcome that is very close to the economic benefits of remaining in”, finance minister Philip Hammond said.The government report was immediately criticised by supporters of a more definitive break with Brussels as a “Project Fear” attempt to scare opponents of Mrs May’s plan.But opponents of Brexit said it undermined promises by Brexit campaigners that leaving the EU would make Britain, and Britons, more prosperous.“These figures show that the government’s stated policy is to make our economy smaller and weaker,” said David Lammy, a Labour Party MP who wants Britain to stay in the EU.The government said that, in a scenario based on the Brexit plan that Mrs May announced in July, rather than Sunday’s amended agreement with EU leaders, national output would be 2.1 per cent smaller in just over 15 years’ time than if Britain remained in the bloc.If there was no deal, it would be 7.7 per cent smaller.The government’s forecasts assumed for the purposes of comparison that there would be no changes to migration rules, but that some non-tariff trade barriers would be introduced.However, perceptions that immigration was too high under the EU’s freedom of movement policy were a key reason why many Britons voted in 2016 to leave the EU.Assuming there was zero net migration from the EU in the future, the hit to the economy would be bigger: 3.9 per cent under Mrs May’s deal, and 9.3 per cent without a deal.The report said Britain’s automotive and chemicals sectors faced the biggest potential losses from a no-deal Brexit - more than 20 per cent of output. – ReutersDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

leaves european river cruise ships stranded low water","story":"People explore the exposed banks of the Rhine river in Cologne, GermanyTourists planning a winter getaway on a romantic cruise along Europe’s rivers are facing stranded ships and long coach journeys after the dry summer left water levels at record lows.Holidaymakers expecting to travel between Budapest and Vienna on the serene waters of the Danube have been told they will be bussed between the cities instead because the water is too low for the cruise ships to navigate.Instead of settling into a cabin for a week they will be forced to move between stranded cruise ships that have been turned into floating hotels as cruise companies frantically try to rescue as much of their itineraries as possible.But it has left many customers angry and frustrated. “We are starting to wonder how many bus trips we are going to have as we booked a seven-day river cruise on a boat not a bus trip. We have absolutely no interest in bussing around Europe or any other country let alone at Christmas time,” one Australian traveller wrote on an internet message board.There have already been months of chaos on Europe’s waterways after the summer drought brought river levels so low the German authorities had to warn people to beware of unexploded Second World War munitions being exposed by the retreating waters.But anyone hoping autumn rains have rectified matters will be disappointed. Rainfall has been low over northern Europe, and the river levels have continued to drop — in Budapest the Danube has fallen so low the remains of a bridge destroyed during the Nazi occupation have been exposed.The low water levels have proved disastrous for river cruises. The Danube may be Europe’s longest river, but the popular cruise routes run through the upper reaches, where ships have to negotiate a number of shallow stretches.People on the banks of the Rhine river, where water levels reached a record lowAs a result, some cruises have had to be cut from a week to just two days on the water. Vienna and Budapest, traditionally two highlights of a Danube cruise, are cut off from each other, so passengers face a three-hour coach journey instead. The German city of Regensburg, another highlight, is proving impossible to reach.Things are no better on the Rhine, where cruise ships are struggling to make it to Cologne or to the Rhine Gorge. And with the Christmas Market season getting underway in Germany, there are fears cruise ships will not be able to make it to the most famous markets.Cruise companies are trying to get round the problem by operating “ship swaps”, which see passengers bussed from one ship to another to avoid the shallow stretches.One company went to the length of chartering a local boat in Budapest so its passengers didn’t miss out on the traditional night cruise past the Hungarian parliament building.But many customers have been left disappointed. “Is it only me having too high expectations?  We signed up for a river cruise.  We expect to spend time cruising on the rivers, not riding a bus across Europe,” one wrote on a cruisecritic, an internet message board. Petrol supplies to the Rhineland area of Germany are carried by river, and several petrol stations ran out earlier this month after tankers were unable to get through“Romantic if you like bad airline seats, bus tours, missed ports, and significantly decreased port time due to long bus rides,” wrote another. “We did three ship swaps and sailed the only stretch of the Danube after dark. Lots of fun packing and unpacking.” “As a result of this season’s historic drought in Europe, low water conditions on the Danube, Main and Rhine rivers have persisted longer than expected,” Viking Cruises, one of the biggest operators, said in a statement. “In order to minimize the impact to each sailing, Viking has several contingency plans to bypass those areas where water levels remain too low. We always want our guests to feel that they have the most current information about their journey, so we will continue to directly contact all guests on itineraries affected by residual low water conditions until levels return to normal.”It may be of little comfort to those whose holiday plans have been ruined, but cruises are not the only river traffic affected. Petrol supplies to the Rhineland area of Germany are carried by river, and several petrol stations ran out earlier this month after tankers were unable to get through.Europe may have to get used to lower river levels. Climate scientists say dwindling glaciers in the Alps mean there will be less meltwater to make up the shortfall in the spring.Please review our commenting policyBrexit deal latest news: No deal could trigger worst slump since Second World War, says Bank GovernorJohn McDonnell says it is \u0026#34inevitable\u0026#34  Labour will back a second referendum in move that puts him add odds with Jeremy CorbynCanadian woman and 10-month-old baby killed by grizzly bear in Yukon\u0026#39Don\u0026#39t lock her up!\u0026#39: Ivanka Trump says use of private emails is not comparable to Hillary ClintonJohn Bercow warns ministers they could be held in contempt of Parliament if they fail to publish full Brexit legal adviceDutch railway firm to pay compensation for its role in HolocaustTK Maxx scraps \u0026#39obsessive Christmas disorder\u0026#39 range over complaints it trivialised mental illnessWinter solstice: The Feast of Juul, Thor and why pagans celebrate the shortest day of the year (a day late)Home Secretary gives backing to police who ram scooter criminals\u0026#39Miniature woodlands\u0026#39 which help beat pollution set to overshadow the traditional garden at Chelsea Flower ShowNHS should learn from McDonalds says Health Secretary Comment: Theresa May has achieved the impossible: a Brexit deal that everyone can agree aboutWorkshy dairy farmer son who \u0026#39hates cows\u0026#39 loses out on £1m inheritance \u0026#39Heartbreaking\u0026#39 final moments of Britain\u0026#39s oldest gorilla British security company G4S attacked by Taliban as huge explosion rocks KabulTheresa May warns EU its trawlers will be banned from UK waters if it threatens trade reprisals over quotasOlivia Colman reveals how she maintains Queen\u0026#39s stiff upper lipDuke and Duchess of Cambridge pay tribute to Leicester crash victimsSouthampton hospital forced to cancel surgeries after fire led to power cutWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/11/28/TELEMMGLPICT000182084317_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqH4D-jx1ezwmwmru7Y7fiE2wqu6Iu0FuYzRTYfHcrDC0.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"dutch railway firm pay compensation role holocaust","story":"Canadian World War II veterans put roses on the railroad tracks at former concentration camp WesterborkThe Dutch state railway company is to pay compensation to Holocaust survivors and their families, after accusations that it earned millions transporting Jewish people on the way to death camps.   In a statement on Tuesday, the state-owned NS, admitted that it “cannot look away” from its past,  “a dark chapter in the history of our country and our company.”Holocaust survivor Salo Muller, whose parents were arrested and transported to the transit camp of Westerbork, and then on to Auschwitz, has accused the NS of making millions from the occupying German forces in World War Two.The former physiotherapist for Ajax football team, who was five when his parents were taken away and murdered in 1942, had threatened to sue the NS for compensation.It has been widely reported in the Dutch media that the business earned about €2.5m from these transports.“The Nazis stole Jewish people’s gold, and used this to pay the NS,” Mr Muller told The Volkskrant. “The NS knew this, and accepted it for all of those people in cattle cars. And in the 75 years since, it has done nothing to recompense that on an inidual level. I believe that is unacceptable.“It recognised at the time that this was completely wrong but has not done enough to alleviate the suffering.”The railway, which apologised for the part it played in these deportations in 2005, has announced that it will set up a commission to recommend how it should should compensate “survivors and their direct family” on moral grounds.The 82-year-old Mr Muller has, it announced, met with its chief executive Roger van Boxtel and been asked to help with the selection and brief for this commission.“We decided together not to confront each other in court, but to set up a commission,” Mr Van Boxtel told the NOS Dutch broadcaster. “This commission will work out how we can put together inidual compensation packages for those affected.”Mr Muller told the NOS that this was an “extraordinary” result that he had not dared to dream of and that he is “very emotional and grateful.”A Dutch parliamentary commission and countless publications have looked critically at the role of the railway firm in the war, and in response it has invested in monuments, exhibitions and educational programmes, it added in a press release.The Daily  has contacted Mr Muller\u0027s lawyer Liesbeth Zegveld for a comment.Brexit deal latest news: No deal could trigger worst slump since Second World War, says Bank GovernorJohn McDonnell says it is \u0026#34inevitable\u0026#34  Labour will back a second referendum in move that puts him add odds with Jeremy CorbynCanadian woman and 10-month-old baby killed by grizzly bear in Yukon\u0026#39Don\u0026#39t lock her up!\u0026#39: Ivanka Trump says use of private emails is not comparable to Hillary ClintonDrought leaves European river cruise ships stranded because of low water levels John Bercow warns ministers they could be held in contempt of Parliament if they fail to publish full Brexit legal adviceTK Maxx scraps \u0026#39obsessive Christmas disorder\u0026#39 range over complaints it trivialised mental illnessWinter solstice: The Feast of Juul, Thor and why pagans celebrate the shortest day of the year (a day late)Home Secretary gives backing to police who ram scooter criminals\u0026#39Miniature woodlands\u0026#39 which help beat pollution set to overshadow the traditional garden at Chelsea Flower ShowNHS should learn from McDonalds says Health Secretary Comment: Theresa May has achieved the impossible: a Brexit deal that everyone can agree aboutWorkshy dairy farmer son who \u0026#39hates cows\u0026#39 loses out on £1m inheritance \u0026#39Heartbreaking\u0026#39 final moments of Britain\u0026#39s oldest gorilla British security company G4S attacked by Taliban as huge explosion rocks KabulTheresa May warns EU its trawlers will be banned from UK waters if it threatens trade reprisals over quotasOlivia Colman reveals how she maintains Queen\u0026#39s stiff upper lipDuke and Duchess of Cambridge pay tribute to Leicester crash victimsSouthampton hospital forced to cancel surgeries after fire led to power cutWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"enid blyton taught female friendship","story":"She may not be very fashionable, but we could all learn a thing or two from Enid Blyton Golly!

Even so, the majority of her themes are timeless. Nowhere is this more clear than in her treatment of friendship, and the bonds between women. Here’s what she taught me on the subject:Enid Blyton: casually racist and sexist, but can teach women a lot First, that society might pressurise us to find “the one” friendship-wise almost as much as it does...To continue reading this articleStart your free trial of PremiumAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekAccess one Premium article per weekRegister for freeAlready have an account?

the communications watchdog has announced. Ofcom said it has become “concerned about steep rises in directory enquiry prices”, and said some companies are charging almost £20 for a 90-second call to these services, while a 90-second call to the most popular service, 118 118, now costs £11.23.The “cost of calling many of these services is now well above what people expect to pay”, according to the regulator.Virgin Media should pay up and shut up in wake of OfCom fine Millions of consumers overpaying for mobile phones, watchdog warnsRoyal Mail fined a record £50m for breaking law with price changeOfcom’s research shows an estimated 450,000 people pay a combined total of £2.4m more than they expect to for directory enquiry calls every year – and some of those callers are struggling to pay their bills. The watchdog also said that while the number of calls to 118 numbers has been falling by about 40 per cent each year, more than a million people\u0026nbspstill use them, particularly the elderly. Jane Rumble, Ofcom’s director of consumer policy, said: “Directory enquiry prices have risen in recent years, and callers are paying much more than they expect. Our evidence shows this is hurting people, with some struggling to pay their bills.“We’re taking action to protect callers by capping 118 prices. This will significantly cut the cost of many calls, and bring them back to 2012 levels.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

In June Ineos announced ambitious European expansion plans.The company has attracted criticism in the past, notably when its founder and chairman decided to move its headquarters to Switzerland in 2010.It has also successfully pressured unions representing workers at its Grangemouth refinery to accept terms banning them from taking strike action for three years.Ineos\u0026nbspis the largest investor in UK fracking, the controversial and environmentally damaging method of drilling for oil and gas.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Half said no deal would make it harder for them to maintain their existing staff.“Leaving without a deal would be catastrophic – plants will close jobs will be lost,” said SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes.\u0026nbspHe added that the transitional period included in Ms May’s proposed deal was crucial\u0026nbspbecause it\u0026nbspallows the industry to step back from the “cliff edge”.Government urged to stop \u0027squabbling\u0027 and save UK car industryInvestment in UK car industry halves because of BrexitNo Brexit deal for UK car industry risks thousands of jobs, say MPs“We need a deal now, and we need an ambitious deal for the future that guarantees frictionless trade with our most important market – nothing else will do, and we urge all parties to remember what’s at stake.”The latest warning from car manufacturers comes as Ms May’s Brexit deal was denounced as the “worst of all worlds” by Sir Michael Fallon, once considered one of the prime ministers closest allies.The former defence minister said he would not vote for the “doomed” deal in a Commons showdown next month.Crashing out of the EU without an agreement puts the future of one of Britain’s most successful sectors in doubt.\u0026nbspAnnual car production has risen by a third to 1.67 million since 2010 with 80 per cent of those vehicles destined for export, the majority of them going to the Continent. The industry now employs 856,000 people but it depends heavily on parts crossing the border without checks or delays.\u0026nbsp“No deal is not an option,” said Tony Walker, Toyota Managing Director and SMMT president.\u0026nbsp“In the short term, crashing out of the EU would have immediate and devastating impacts, with border chaos disrupting the Just in Time basis on which our business depends. Disruption could last for weeks – even months.”Some MPs have attempted to play down the impact that leaving without a deal would have, pointing to the option of trading under\u0026nbspWorld Trade Organisation (WTO) rules.But Mr Walker said it was unimaginable that car manufacturers could implement WTO\u0026nbspimport and export procedures overnight.He added: “For the longer term, a ‘no-deal’ Brexit would harm our competitiveness, undermine sales and cost jobs… We need the certainty of a deal, not more uncertainty, and we need the smooth transition period based on current trading conditions… It is vital we have free and frictionless trade with common technical standards.

Why are they different? And what is the overriding message about the economic consequences of Brexit?What does the Government’s exercise show?It suggests that the Brexit (broadly) embodied in Theresa May’s\u0026nbsppreferred Brexit deal and the Government’s plans to cut back migration from Europe would knock 3.9 per cent hit off UK GDP, relative to staying in the EU, over the next 15 years.There would, under the Government’s modelling exercise, be a small boost to UK GDP from new trade deals. Yet these gains would be more than offset by the economic costs of new trade barriers with the EU and a hit from lower net migration.A no-deal Brexit, on the other hand, where we merely trade with the European Union on bare World Trade Organisation rules is seen knocking 9.3 per cent off the UK’s GDP over the same period.A simple Canada-style free trade deal is also negative, seen as holding back GDP growth by 6.7 per cent.What do the other forecasts show?Niesr’s exercise pointed to a 3.9 per cent hit to the UK’s GDP by 2030 from Theresa May’s Brexit deal, bang in line with the Government’s.It also saw a hit to growth from the no deal scenario of 5.5 per cent over that time, which is less damaging than\u0026nbspthe Government’s estimate.Economists from the UK in Changing Europe projected a 5.5 per cent hit to GDP per capita (the size of the economy ided by the size of the population) from Theresa May’s Brexit by 2030.This is higher than the 1.2 to 2.7 per cent hit to GDP per capita indicated by the Government’s analysis.Why are they different?All three exercises used different modelling techniques and assumptions.The Government and the UK in Changing Europe both used “Computable General Equilibrium” models, but different varieties.Niesr used its “NiGEM” model, which is less strict on “microfounding” the behaviour of economic agents.The input assumptions were different too. The Government’s exercise modelled the “Chequers” White Paper on Brexit and then added some assumptions of trade frictions on top, rather than explicitly modelling the Withdrawal Agreement and the Political Declaration.The modellers also had to make judgements about how much new trade friction is implied by Ms May’s somewhat vague proposals.They all stress the inherent uncertainty involved in their estimates.But what’s the overall message? It is the opposite to the one implied by Theresa May, who told the Commons on Wednesday that analysis of the impact of leaving the EU “does not show we will be poorer”.In fact the Government’s own analysis does show precisely that. Relative to staying in the EU we will be worse off due to Brexit – and this is true even of her favoured deal.And this official analysis is broadly in line with the credible analysis done by independent outside experts. The fact that they all produced similar results despite using different modelling techniques reinforces\u0026nbspthat message.All the credible modelling evidence suggests that leaving the EU, from an economic perspective, is a damage limitation exercise. There is no upside.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The cliff edge of no deal, or trading with the EU on World Trade Organisation terms.As the date on which the UK is meant to leave the European Union approaches, and as the terms of the deal negotiated by Theresa May have been released, a raft of new economic forecasts has appeared. We at the UK in a Changing Europe have contributed our own assessment. But what do the forecasts say? And, more importantly, what do they mean?Theresa May’s Brexit deal may yet get through ParliamentFirst, the top line results. Our findings are based on considering the impacts of the deal on trade and immigration, and forecasting their effect. Our analysis suggests that the Brexit deal negotiated by the Prime Minister could reduce UK GDP per capita by between 1.9 per cent\u0026nbspand 5.5 per cent\u0026nbspby 2030, compared to remaining in the EU. The cost to the public finances would be between 0.4 and 1.8 per cent\u0026nbspof GDP over the same period, with the corresponding figures for a no-deal Brexit 1 to 3.1 per cent.So far so economicky. But what, exactly, do these figures mean? Well, to get a sense of the scale of the fiscal impact, the deal negotiated by the Prime Minister would reduce tax receipts by some £9bn\u0026nbspby 2030 – more than the entire budget for GPs in England. And this is the low end of the range. The worst case is a hit of some £37bn\u0026nbsp– almost equivalent to the current entire health and social care budget.And to compare to a recent economic crisis. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has estimated that the impact of the financial crisis on the economy was £300bn over a decade. The equivalent forecast from our study for the withdrawal deal is a range between £40bn and £110bn. This is a large range, obviously, but it does underline that the scale of the hit will be smaller than that inflicted after 2008. But, of course, our economy has been seriously weakened already by the financial crisis, making it less resilient to another shock.The next question, then, is how the Brexit impact will reveal itself. Which brings us back to cliff edges. The problem with this analogy is that the implications of leaving the European Union will not be felt overnight. Rather, as John Springford has pointed out, they are already being felt, and will continue to be so over time as we actually leave the single market and introduce friction to our trade with our largest and closest trading partner.A better analogy is a slow puncture. For two reasons. First, it can take a while to notice a slow puncture. And, second, it is hard, once it has become apparent, to remember when and where you picked it up. When it comes to the politics of the economic impact, in other words, the simple causal story that “Brexit has made us poorer”\u0026nbspmay be harder to tell than many Remainers think – not least given the lack of faith in forecasts that was one result of the referendum campaign itself.Talking of the politics, we could do with a bit more honesty from both big parties about what Brexit might mean. Perhaps the most depressing thing – among many competitors – at the last election was the way the manifestos seemed to assume that, post-Brexit, it would be business as usual. It won’t. The public finances will be even more stretched and the economy will not grow as fast as it would have done. At the very least, some planning for this eventuality would be most welcome.Obviously, economic modelling is not an exact science, and in order to produce the analysis set out in our report, we have had to make a large number of assumptions, some of them subjective. Moreover, economic models provide at best an imperfect map of the world. For example, our model requires us to transform the legal language of the Withdrawal Agreement into assumptions about percentage changes in non-tariff barriers. This is relies on informed judgment more than scientific measurement. Equally, there is insufficient detail in the Withdrawal Agreement to know exactly how the customs backstop would operate or the extent of future regulatory ergence between the UK and the EU. This introduces additional uncertainty into our assumptions.Yet all this notwithstanding – and it is important to accept the limitations of this kind of work – these findings represent our best judgement about the impact of the deal. That does not mean they will be correct—indeed, they almost certainly will be inaccurate to some extent – but we would maintain that are our broad conclusions are credible.Brexit will inflict some harm on our economy. Which is not necessarily a compelling case against it. But is something we, and our political leaders, should be honest about.\u0026nbspAnand Menon is director and Matt Bevington a policy researcher at\u0026nbspThe UK in a Changing Europe\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

This will significantly cut the cost of many calls, and bring them back to 2012 levels.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

In June Ineos announced ambitious European expansion plans.The company has attracted criticism in the past, notably when its founder and chairman decided to move its headquarters to Switzerland in 2010.It has also successfully pressured unions representing workers at its Grangemouth refinery to accept terms banning them from taking strike action for three years.Ineos\u0026nbspis the largest investor in UK fracking, the controversial and environmentally damaging method of drilling for oil and gas.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Half said no deal would make it harder for them to maintain their existing staff.“Leaving without a deal would be catastrophic – plants will close jobs will be lost,” said SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes.\u0026nbspHe added that the transitional period included in Ms May’s proposed deal was crucial\u0026nbspbecause it\u0026nbspallows the industry to step back from the “cliff edge”.Government urged to stop \u0027squabbling\u0027 and save UK car industryInvestment in UK car industry halves because of BrexitNo Brexit deal for UK car industry risks thousands of jobs, say MPs“We need a deal now, and we need an ambitious deal for the future that guarantees frictionless trade with our most important market – nothing else will do, and we urge all parties to remember what’s at stake.”The latest warning from car manufacturers comes as Ms May’s Brexit deal was denounced as the “worst of all worlds” by Sir Michael Fallon, once considered one of the prime ministers closest allies.The former defence minister said he would not vote for the “doomed” deal in a Commons showdown next month.Crashing out of the EU without an agreement puts the future of one of Britain’s most successful sectors in doubt.\u0026nbspAnnual car production has risen by a third to 1.67 million since 2010 with 80 per cent of those vehicles destined for export, the majority of them going to the Continent. The industry now employs 856,000 people but it depends heavily on parts crossing the border without checks or delays.\u0026nbsp“No deal is not an option,” said Tony Walker, Toyota Managing Director and SMMT president.\u0026nbsp“In the short term, crashing out of the EU would have immediate and devastating impacts, with border chaos disrupting the Just in Time basis on which our business depends. Disruption could last for weeks – even months.”Some MPs have attempted to play down the impact that leaving without a deal would have, pointing to the option of trading under\u0026nbspWorld Trade Organisation (WTO) rules.But Mr Walker said it was unimaginable that car manufacturers could implement WTO\u0026nbspimport and export procedures overnight.He added: “For the longer term, a ‘no-deal’ Brexit would harm our competitiveness, undermine sales and cost jobs… We need the certainty of a deal, not more uncertainty, and we need the smooth transition period based on current trading conditions… It is vital we have free and frictionless trade with common technical standards. Without these, we risk losing all we have achieved in building a world-class automotive sector.”\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

We will continue to engage constructively with the CMA over the weeks ahead to seek to address its concerns ahead of publication of the CMA’s final report early in the new year.”The CMA has asked for views on its provisional findings, to be provided by 19 December.

Try to peer back further, though, and everything changes. The visual, intellectual, spiritual, and day-to-day world of the age that came before seems maddeningly hard to grasp.Back in the 1930s, the authors of 1066 And All That captured something of the frustration: “Egg-Kings were found on the thrones of all these kingdoms, such as Eggberd, Eggbreth, Eggfroth, etc. None of them, however, succeeded in becoming memorable – except in so far as it is difficult to forget such names as Eggborth, Eggbred, Eggbeard, Eggfish, etc. Nor is it even remembered by what kind of Eggdeath they perished.”However, the low middle ages are not truly lost. Pre-conquest England is there – it is just well hidden. Occasional church towers or windows and museum cabinets of jewellery hint at a vibrant period, but it is in books and manuscripts that the Anglo-Saxons come vividly alive, delineated in everything from pale rusty ink to lush gold and lapis. In these texts we meet a vigorous and confident cast of warriors and saints, queens and kings, thegns and villagers, dragons and gods.Anglo-Saxon books are now spread all over Britain and Europe. In a moment of inspiration in 2013, the British Library decided to gather an unprecedented number of them together under one roof.Anglo-Saxon Kingdoms: Art, Word, War is now open, and its 180 exhibits froth and bubble with the whirlpool of fresh ideas and vibrant images that animated England for 700 years. With modern Britain unable to formulate a coherent 21st century identity for itself, the timing of this voyage into the past could not be more relevant.A quick reminder. Anglo-Saxon England thrived from the early AD400s to 1066. As Roman administrators and military commanders hitched their skirts, clambered onto boats, and waved “Valete!” to Britannia, boatloads of Angles, Saxons, Jutes, and Frisians eagerly arrived to fill the vacuum.\u0026nbspThe precise details of these migrations remain unclear. Some of the settlers may have been invited as mercenaries to fend off the raiding Scots (from Ireland) and Picts (from Scotland), while others almost certainly arrived to pillage and conquer. Many indigenous Britons were not thrilled. Warlords like Arthur (who may merely be an avatar for others) fought back hard. Yet despite the fierce resistance – the Historia Brittonum tells us Arthur alone slew 960 at the battle of Mount Badon – the settlers prevailed, put down roots, and built communities. Before long the newcomers from modern-day Denmark, Germany, and the Netherlands had taken over, and Angle-land (England) emerged.The British Library’s timing is impeccable because the energetic imagination and international adventurousness of the Anglo-Saxons points to a profoundly dynamic period in which England buzzed at the intellectual, spiritual, artistic, and mercantile heart of Europe.9th century\u0026nbsp(British Library)Although there is little room for the Anglo-Saxons in crammed television schedules and bookshops already groaning with Plantagenets and Tudors, the Anglo-Saxons were every bit as important to the development of England. In fact, more so, as they founded it.“The Anglo-Saxon period was a formative one, both for the English and their British and European neighbours,” says Dr Levi Roach, a leading expert from the University of Exeter. “Be it in our towns and villages, our shires and counties, even our names for ourselves (‘English’, ‘Welsh’, ‘Scottish’), they have left an indelible mark.”If you look hard enough, life in modern Britain still has countless legacies of the Anglo-Saxons. Undoubtedly their most important bequest was their language: Ænglisc. (In Old English “sc” is pronounced “sh”, as in biscop or scip.) While the language has always been important in Britain and was exported to the New World and empire, its significance has grown even more in the last generation, with globalisation establishing English as the planet’s emerging lingua franca.This is very likely the first time in their long history that the codices have been together in the same place it’s easy to imagine them as in dialogue with one anotherEnglish may now be ubiquitous, but we rarely credit the Anglo-Saxons for its deep beauty and profound flexibility. For many – like the prime minister – “Anglo-Saxon language” is merely a periphrasis for swearing. This is a pitiful characterisation. Anglo-Saxon (these days rebranded as Old English) is the bedrock of modern English. And actually, there is no evidence any Anglo-Saxon ever uttered the F-word, the notorious monosyllable, or a wide range of other four-letter words.When we want to laud the beauties of historic English, instead of celebrating Anglo-Saxon, we usually skip straight to Shakespeare and the King James Bible. But while both have given us shimmering words and phrases, they were doing no more than wrapping ropes of fairy lights around an already solid, beautiful, old\u0026nbspand leafy tree. The fact is that long before the Globe Theatre rocked with applause, and even before Chaucer’s pilgrims met at the nearby Tabard two centuries earlier, the Anglo-Saxons were speaking and writing the earliest, luscious English.\u0026nbsp“English is a Germanic language,” explains Dr Alison Hudson, co-curator of the British Library’s exhibition. “Anglo-Saxon is the basis of some of its vocabulary and structure.” But the Anglo-Saxons were also devoted linguistic magpies, adept at incorporating new words and ideas. “One of the language’s unique marvels is its flexibility to absorb other elements, like Latin, Old Norse, and Norman French. In this period, we see loan words like ‘pepper’ and ‘cinnamon’ coming into English for the first time. It’s a wonderful reflection of the fact that the British Isles have always been a multicultural place. They even had the word ‘ylp’ for elephant. It’s one of my favourite Old English words. They had no idea what one actually looked like – they imagined it had white polka dots on pink skin – but it was an important enough part of their intellectual world to create a word for it.”Language weaves its way through the exhibition in a similar way to the bright swirls of decoration burnishing many of the old pages. At the dawn of the Anglo-Saxon era we see jagged runes cut into objects from a time when daily life revolved around the old gods and goddesses. As, in a small way, ours still do. Tiw, ruler of sky and war, is still honoured by a day of the week, as is Woden, head of the gods, Thunor, the thunder god, and Frige, goddess of the home and love. Some of these inscriptions are charmingly timeless, like the discreet marketing on the reverse of a piece of delicate gold, ivory, and garnet jewellery: “Luda repaired the brooch”.Æthelberht of Kent’s law code, composed around 600 (Dominic Selwood)The Anglo-Saxons did not cling to the old Germanic gods for long. In 597 St Augustine arrived to re-Christianise England, and one glass case holds an astonishing 6th century book of the four gospels, in Latin, believed to have been in his luggage.Augustine and his companions persuaded the Anglo-Saxons to adopt the religion of Rome, and the new converts became some of its most devout followers. Christianity was a book\u0026nbspand writing-based religion, and the old runes fell into disuse as Anglo-Saxon scholars adopted the Roman alphabet for Latin and Old English. For a while, though, runes clung on in places. The exhibition has a replica of the 5.5-metre high Ruthwell Cross with its spectacular carvings from the life of Christ, along with several verses incised in runes evoking lines from “The Dream of the Rood”.The oldest proper text in Old English is King Æthelberht of Kent’s law code, composed around 600. It is the earliest known utterance of English law, and is the standout exhibit in the exhibition’s first room. It is an extraordinary reminder of just how old our quirky legal system is, with so much of it – including trial by jury – reaching back to principles of Anglo-Saxon justice.As you would expect, the exhibition features stellar examples of Anglo-Saxon art. The mesmerisingly vibrant decoration of the Lindisfarne Gospels (circa\u0026nbsp700) needs no introduction, but equally fascinating are the small words glossed in red ink under the main Latin text. They are in Old English, and represent the earliest known version of the gospels in the vernacular. Strange as this sounds, translating the gospels into English was not that uncommon. The Wessex Gospels – also in the exhibition – were widely copied English versions of the four gospels: something later Tudor scholars in the Protestant Reformation pretended to be undertaking for the first time.What’s amazing about the four great codices is that, for all their riches, they represent just an accidentally surviving tip of an iceberg of poetry long since lost to usThe cases of books in the darkened series of rooms are interspersed with artefacts conjuring up the Anglo-Saxons’ physical world. The Alfred Jewel has pride of place, as do objects like the 5th century pottery Spong Man, which is the earliest Anglo-Saxon sculpture of a person. There are also crowd pleasers from Sutton Hoo and the Staffordshire and Binham Hoards.When Anglo-Saxon England died as a political entity at the Battle of Hastings in 1066, embroiderers depicted the run-up and battle in 58 captioned scenes on 70 metres of linen. Many of its panels show daily life either side of the Channel, preserving one of the richest records of late Anglo-Saxon society. Although the political and military narrative in the Bayeux\u0026nbspTapestry is Norman propaganda – telling their story of why William had God on his side – it is notably sympathetic to King Harold of England, and one of the reasons may be that the embroidery was perhaps made by Anglo-Saxons in Kent. Anglo-Saxon needlecraft – opus anglicanum (English work) – was world famous. The Bayeux Tapestry is not, however, in the exhibition, although President Macron has promised to send it for a visit in the near future, which will be the first time it has crossed the Channel in 900 years.The Anglo-Saxons were energetic travellers and traders, in constant contact with Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. In one glass case there is an astonishing late 4th century book that made it to Anglo-Saxon England all the way from North Africa – possibly in the baggage of Hadrian, a “vir natione Afir” (man of African birth) who travelled to England in 669 and ended up as abbot of Canterbury. In another is a gold coin minted by Offa, who ruled Mercia from 757-96. Although it predictably reads “Offa Rex” on the front, it is modelled on an Islamic dinar, with Arabic writing on the back including “there is no God but Allah alone”. With travel came a thirst for knowledge, and the Anglo-Saxons were also scientists. Books in the exhibition contain diagrams of the planetary orbits and affirmations that the Earth is round.For the real soul of the Anglo-Saxons – the rhythms of their lives, loves, and deeds – there is one standout case. In it are just four books whose names will have any manuscript nerd’s pulse racing. The first is the British Library’s own Cotton Vitellius A XV. It is fire ravaged, but magically preserves the sole surviving copy of Beowulf. Alongside it lies the Vercelli Book – in Britain for the first time in 900 years – containing the only manuscript version of the mystical and haunting “Dream of the Rood”. Next to it is the Junius\u0026nbspManuscript from the Bodleian. Its poems have largely religious themes, and the page is open on “Genesis A”, which offers a good sense of their preoccupations with its nine mentions of heofan and helle. The final volume is the Exeter Book, on loan from Exeter Cathedral. It shimmers with dozens of well-known, ravishing poems, including “The Seafarer” and “The Wanderer”, and lies open on a riddle asking which creature eats words but gains no wisdom. (Spoiler: a bookmoth.) Apart from the transcendent beauty of the words and imagery in these four books, an equally extraordinary feature of them is that they contain around 75 per cent of all surviving Old English poetry.Spong Man, which is the earliest Anglo-Saxon sculpture of a person, from the 5th century (Dominic Selwood)“What’s amazing about the four great codices is that, for all their riches, they represent just an accidentally surviving tip of an iceberg of poetry long since lost to us,” explains Professor Carolyne Larrington, an expert in Old English and medieval European literature at Oxford. “This is very likely the first time in their long history that the codices have been together in the same place it’s easy to imagine them as in dialogue with one another.”The single manuscript copies of Beowulf and “The Dream of the Rood” witness the remarkably poor survival rate of Old English texts. This has nothing to do with either the amount the Anglo-Saxons wrote or the quality of their materials. They wrote prolifically, and their vellum and bindings were perfectly robust, as many books in the exhibition demonstrate, with thumping leather-tooled and richly gem-studded covers showing no signs of fragility.\u0026nbspThe loss of so much Anglo-Saxon writing has far more to do with the purposeful and systematic 16th century destruction of monastic and university libraries by the Tudors, whose religious policies saw bonfires and rubbish heaps made of books that referred to England’s medieval faith. Religious sculpture, too, was also decimated. The original Ruthwell Cross, with its extraordinary runic poetry inscriptions, was smashed into fragments by Protestant extremists in the 1640s, but was meticulously reassembled in the 1820s, and now stands inside Ruthwell Church in Dumfriesshire.\u0026nbspLater, a handful of notable figures tried to repair the damage and locate the books and manuscripts that had been scattered. “Despair over the fate of the contents of monastic libraries crossed confessional boundaries,” explains Professor Helen Parish, an expert in late medieval and Reformation history at the University of Reading. “The former Carmelite turned ardent evangelical, John Bale, had little sympathy with the trappings of monasticism, but still complained bitterly that the dispersal of the libraries was to the shame of the country. Matthew Parker, first archbishop of Canterbury in the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, worked hard in the 1560s to recover lost books and records. His library at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, provided the building blocks for a new history of the English church, and a burgeoning sense of national faith and identity in which the Anglo-Saxon church was the cornerstone.”\u0026nbspOne especially notable feature of the surviving corpus of Old English poetry is the prominence of women characters. Hudson explains:\u0026nbsp“There are a surprising number of Anglo-Saxon epics of strong women. Biblical characters like Judith, saints like Juliana – a Middle Eastern martyr who battled and conquered demons – and royalty like the Empress Helena. In the Genesis poem in the Junius manuscript, even Eve emerges as a notably prominent character.”Strong women are not only part of the Anglo-Saxons’ poetic world. They were part of everyday life, too. Æthelflæd, daughter of King Alfred and wife of Æthelred of Mercia, was named “Lady of the Mercians” and did more to bring England together as a country than possibly anyone else. Her deeds are recorded in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which sits in the same room as the four poetry books. Less regal Anglo-Saxon women’s lives are also fascinating. The exhibition has the late 10th\u0026nbspor early 11th century will of the noble widow Wynflæd, and it contains two arresting provisions. On her death she freed some of her slaves, but not Eadgifu the weaver or Æthelgifu the seamstress. And she could read, as she carefully passed on her prized collection of books.\u0026nbspIf asked to name an Old English poem, many people would nominate Beowulf. It is rightly one of the most famous stories in Anglo-Scandinavian literature, and the original manuscript does not disappoint. The poem’s 3,182 lines throb with a ripping tale of the warrior Beowulf’s mortal combat with the monster Grendel and his mother and, years later, with a dragon. The epic’s ability to transfix and delight wins new admirers every generation: most recently with Nobel prize winner Seamus Heaney’s free translation in 1999 and Hollywood warhorse Robert Zemeckis’s epic A-list motion capture blockbuster in 2007.\u0026nbspAfter Beowulf, the most famous Old English poem is “The Dream of the Rood”, in which the cross of the crucifixion tells its version of the passion story. It opens with the writer having a vision of the cross that will soon speak to him:Listen! I wish to tell of the best of dreams,\u0026nbsp(You only need to know two things to read it aloud: “æ” is pronounced “a” as in “cat” and “ð” and “þ” are both pronounced “th”.)\u0026nbspIf you read, it, two things pop out immediately. The first is that the sound and cadences are deeply rhythmical, and almost certainly mean it was recited to music. The second is that the phrases are built up with a hypnotic alliteration that is perhaps the most defining characteristic of Old English poetry.\u0026nbspIt is, obviously, more challenging than Shakespeare or Chaucer as it has many unfamiliar words and comes complete with case endings. We have managed to get rid of most of them in modern English, although a few like “them” and “whom” stubbornly remain. To add to the challenge, many Old English words have also changed their meaning over time. For instance, “spell” simply meant “story” to the Anglo-Saxons.Old English also had dialects which evolved. The main ones were based in Northumbria, Mercia, Kent, and Wessex, with Wessex eventually coming to dominate, as it was the language of King Alfred – who was a fervent promoter of literacy – and later of Ælfric, abbot of Eynsham, who wrote and standardised the language prolifically.Selwood)Despite the strange look and feel of some Old English words, there is no reason to be put off. It is not as alien as it may sometimes seem. Neither does it only live in universities, libraries, and museums. JRR Tolkien was an Oxford professor of Anglo-Saxon for years, and if you enjoy any of the vocabulary of Middle Earth, you are revelling in his profound skill at playing with ancient Germanic-style languages.\u0026nbspOther standout treasures in the exhibition include the pocket-sized St Cuthbert Gospel, which belonged to St Cuthbert of Lindisfarne (died 687). It is the oldest European book with an original intact binding, in this instance an exquisitely decorated red goatskin cover, all miraculously preserved by having been placed into the saint’s tomb alongside him.Another is the bible known as the Codex Amiatinus. It was produced alongside the St Cuthbert Gospel at Wearmouth-Jarrow but, by contrast, is vast. With a spine over a foot thick, it takes two people to lift it and is the largest book in the exhibition. It was once one of three identical copies, but Amiatinus is the only one to survive, as soon after it was finished Abbot Ceolfrith (died 716) took it to Italy as a gift to the pope, and its homecoming to England for the exhibition is the first time it has been back in over 1,000 years.\u0026nbspIn the final room of the exhibition, beautifully lit and residing in a central case, is the most famous book ever produced in England. At Christmas 1085, William the Conqueror ordered a survey of his country, its land, and how it was occupied. Foremost in his mind was – as so often with rulers in any age – the question of property ownership and how much tax he could raise from it. Thanks to the Anglo-Saxons’ meticulous organisation of England into counties and hundreds, the research only took his commissioners until\u0026nbsp1\u0026nbspAugust the following year. When it was all written up, the result was nicknamed the Domesday Book, from the Old English “domesdei” – meaning the Day of Judgment – because the book’s record, like that of the Last Judgment, was unappealable.\u0026nbspHistory books will be harsh on us for ignoring YemenA brief history of pop-culture feudsWhy your Halloween witch’s outfit is rooted in a gendered stereotypeOn one level, the legacy of the Anglo-Saxons is something that is better appreciated outside England. We call the world’s English-speaking countries the “Anglosphere”, whereas the French choose the more nuanced “le monde Anglo-Saxon”, hinting at a distinct historic, linguistic, cultural, and philosophical heritage.\u0026nbspThe French also have no real concept of “the Dark Ages”, and the equivalent period in France has no label implying that it was unenlightened. Of course, as the exhibition demonstrates unequivocally, there never was a dark age. It is a myth dreamed up by Whig historians wanting to believe that Europe collapsed from glory into barbarity with the fall of Rome, but from the Normans onwards the British Isles marched unstoppably towards ever more profound progress and civilisation. The other reason the French have no dark ages is, of course, that they did not experience a regime as violent with history and cultural property as the Tudors.It is shameful that we so often start our islands’ history and lists of kings and queens with William the Conqueror, as if before his arrival there was a void with darkness over the deep. Britain had spectacular cultures before 1066, of which the Anglo-Saxons were one. Theirs was an intense, vibrant, literate, artistic, creative, spiritual, intellectual, practical, adventurous, outward-looking, European world. It was also a prize well worth conquering, which is why Cnut the Dane seized the throne in 1016 and William of Normandy followed him 50 years later.

After all, these Instagrams have timestamped my life since 2012.That’s not to say that Instagram doesn’t often behave. The bad things are myriad: waiting for Instagrammers to take pictures of your pancakes at brunch, or then artfully arranging your coffee and sunglasses and Moleskine around a cold plate of eggs. Trying to enjoy the pink-purple-blue sunset on Bali’s Seminyak beach and finding you have a row of Instagram screens blocking the view. Or the ninth circle of Instagram hell, which is queueing for a snap of Santorini’s sunset or for the small-time sunflower field in Canada which banned visitors thanks to Instagram overload.These are bad things, but it doesn’t mean Instagram is a Bad Thing: even if the Vienna Tourism Board currently thinks differently.Its current campaign “See Vienna, not #Vienna” is asking tourists to “see the city behind your pics”. It’s a progressive idea, particularly because so much destination marketing rests on the halo effect on social media. (Although its Instagram page, endorsed by almost 100,000 people, is still asking snappers to share ‘Vienna pics by including #ViennaNow’.)\u0026nbspSome Instagrammers might be badly behaved, but on the whole the platform is a force for good, especially in travel, and destinations should use to it their advantageIt’s a clever campaign, but one that rather bites the hand that feeds. Some Instagrammers might be badly behaved, but on the whole\u0026nbspthe platform is a force for good, especially in travel, and destinations should use to it their advantage.Mostly because of the staggering number of users. More than one in eight of us globally have Instagram. Users upload 400 million Instagram Stories a day. There are commercial gains, too: more than 72 per cent of users have bought something they saw on Instagram, according to Business Insider. For a tourist board, this provides a rich seam of free (free!) content, even if many of the snaps don’t deserve to be hung on the mantelpiece. Even the Vienna Tourism Board isn’t above using Instagram indirectly to promote its new campaign.Few people argue that being more connected than ever before – through Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or even, howl, LinkedIn – is a bad thing. After all, it’s the primary reason so many people travel: they want to be connected to another world. Instagram facilitates that, albeit virtually. When I lived abroad, Instagram was one of the many platforms I had at my disposal to give a sneak flavour into my life in Asia. (Instagram was for delicious food pictures, Twitter was for snark.) It was also useful when I didn’t want to have janky Skype calls with friendseditorsmy mother – they could simply check into my Instagram to figure out where I was and what I was looking at.103rd floor of the Willis TowerFor journalists, no platform can be discounted: we need all the tools we can get to understand our audience. And if our audience is on Instagram, then we need to be on Instagram too. Especially working in travel, where spectacular images are so important to help sell a destination (alongside, ahem, fantastic words). Personally, Instagram has given me work opportunities I wouldn’t have found elsewhere: I’ve been commissioned to write features based on the destinations I’ve tagged myself in via Instagram, although I’m still waiting for a blurry photo of a cityscape to be bought by a picture editor…That brings me on to my next point: Instagram is great for meeting new people and picking up tips. Often I’ve geotagged myself in a particular destination and locals have messaged me about some cool new restaurant, a must-visit tea shop, or even offered to meet up for a beer to show me around. A photo I posted of the rust-red National Museum of Cambodia last year prompted a friend to message and say she was in Phnom Penh at the same time – and did we want to grab a Khmer beer later?\u0026nbspThen there’s the inspiration side of Instagram. I once organised a bucket-list trip to Tanzania based on a photo so flat-out spectacular that I knew I’d have to see it for myself. A journalist I followed (in the days before influencers) had snapped a picture of herself in an infinity pool at a safari lodge in the Serengeti, overlooking a watering hole. And so two weeks of annual leave was booked around visiting that particular lodge. I didn’t get the same shot (or even want to) but watching elephants bathing in the water while lazing in a cool kidney pool was every bit as blockbuster as the Instagram snap promised. And really – how is booking a holiday based on an Instagram post any different from flicking through an analogue Thomas Cook catalogue?Travellers forget that Instagram is also practical, because it’s real-time information. The app holds a mine of data. How big are the queues at Anne Frank’s house in Amsterdam? Check Stories tagged at that location. What is the weather like for a weekend trip to Berlin – are people snapped in light jackets or thick coats? Is it currently bucketing it down in Hong Kong? All you have to do is check out a handful of the 95 million (ish) posts per day.Yes, unplugging from Instagram while on holiday might mean you notice how gorgeously rococo Vienna’s Schönbrunn Palace is. But by snapping an Instagram of it, you’ve given yourself a memory to return to again and again. The world is better when we’re connected to it. And in this miserablist world, sometimes it just helps to have a nice picture to look at.Why we should all take a leaf out of Vienna’s book and unhashtag our livesGazing out over the picturesque expanse of Lisbon from my hotel’s rooftop bar, its pastel-shaded, higgledy-piggledy buildings interspersed with verdant trees, I try to take it all in. The sky, amber-hued as the sun sets the Tagus river and accompanying Ponte 25 de Abril, sparkling roguishly in the distance the storybook-perfect Castelo St Jorge, set high upon a hill in all its glory. I look and look and look – but I don’t reach for my smartphone.Yes, ladies and gentleman – I may be the only travel writer on the planet who doesn’t have Instagram. I’m not alone but I certainly seem to be in the minority friends and colleagues never fail to meet my app absenteeism with disbelief.“But you go to all those amazing places!” they say. “It’s such a waste!”My standard response is a curt, “I don’t like taking photos or looking at other people’s.” Which usually stumps them.They’re right in one respect. I do get the opportunity to visit some phenomenal spots – luxury hotels with infinity pools, white sand beaches lapped by cobalt waves, Michelin-starred restaurants with tasting menus so damn good I feel drunk on decadence. (Do you hate me yet?)Yat Sen Memorial ParkMuch of it is Insta-heaven, just begging to be caught, captioned and catapulted onto the internet’s favourite photo-sharing platform. But, while I obviously love heading out into the world to explore and experience, I haven’t the slightest desire to distil each destination into one staged shot, timed to perfection and filtered beyond all recognition.And now there’s at least one place which won’t expect that of me, one place that actively discourages such behaviour despite the allegedly increasing influence of “Instagrammability” as a factor in people’s holiday choices.Vienna’s bold new tourism campaign, Unhashtag Vienna, is targeting the social media generation with a simple message – put down the smartphone and enjoy the moment instead. Signs reading “See Vienna, not #Vienna” are there to greet visitors at the airport and, for the month of November, the tourist information office on Albertinaplatz will be giving out instant cameras with just 10 shots. The aim is that tourists spend less time snapping and more time actually experiencing.While I obviously love heading out into the world to explore and experience, I haven’t the slightest desire to distil each destination into one staged shot, timed to perfection and filtered beyond all recognitionIt might seem antagonistic to some but to me it’s plain refreshing. I salute Vienna for both their innovation and bravery in daring to suggest that perhaps there might be a better way to see a city than through a screen.Long before I became a travel writer I started to resent the impact smartphones had on travel – and on all activities, come to think of it. Dining with a friend and them only half listening while I shared my news, their attention far more invested in an ever-changing news feed going on trips where I had to repeatedly wait out of shot before I could sit down as colleagues secured the desired pic watching the sunset, my view marred by a hundred obtrusive, winking camera phones. I could go on.I’m not Amish. Of course I recognise that social media isn’t without its blessings and benefits. There’s just something about it that seems to suck all of our attention, vampire-like, in a deeply uncomfortable way. And there’s something about the aspirational quality of Instagram that sells us a dream – particularly when it comes to travel – filtering out the ugly, the uncomfortable or the just plain boring, until all that’s left are the bright and shiny parts. It kind of sets a place up to fail. How can the reality ever live up to the over-saturated promise? How can a “bucket-list destination” ever be more than a slight disappointment?Travel influencers also have a lot to answer for when it comes to promoting “bad behaviour” to get the money shot. Just this month, blogger and influencer Patricia, otherwise known as One Ocean Away, was called out for posting a picture of herself walking on railway tracks while a train travelled towards her – some said it could encourage others to emulate her in a more dangerous setting.Of course, all that’s only half the story. Truth time: what really freaks me out about Instagram is the idea of how closely tied my fragile ego would be to my travels.It would be nice to think that, when we post things on social media, it’s done merely for the pleasure of sharing our lives and connecting with others we just want to be part of that big, beautiful conversation.YangonIt would be nice – but it wouldn’t be true. For most of us, it’s the endorphin rush of seeing those numbers climb – follows, likes, shares, comments – that keeps us coming back for more. Whether we like it or not, we are all approval junkies for whom those figures are inherently bound up in our self-worth. In the era of the ubiquitous selfie, it seems inevitable to associate thousands of likes with the idea that thousands of people like you and, conversely, that a dearth of interactions means you’re essentially an online pariah.It happens on every platform, but Instagram is one of the worst offenders when it comes to making us feel our value can be measured numerically – particularly as statistics show that pictures with people in tend to perform better than those without. Ergo, people are judging you as much as they are the backdrop, whether it be Kyoto’s bamboo forest, Santorini’s blue-capped buildings or Singapore’s rooftop infinity pool.Blac Chyna under fire for promoting skin bleaching creamHailey Baldwin appears to confirm marriage to Justin BieberNick Jonas opens up about having diabetes in candid Instagram postTo be frank, I just don’t think I could hack it. I can already see how things would go – here’s me enjoying that Lisbon skyline. Here’s me honing the shot to find the best angle, filtering it so the buildings really pop, cropping out the messy table in front of me. Here’s me posting it. And, several hours later, here’s me checking it, and rechecking it, and rechecking it, ad infinitum, to see how many interactions I’ve had. I ignore the sweeping landscape before me I ignore the cocktail in my glass I even ignore the person sitting opposite me. I don’t need a crystal ball to see my inescapable Instagram future.Instead, free from such constraints, I’m able to live – not just in the moment, but in the place. I devour the view with my eyes, rather than observing it second hand. I savour each sip of my velvety espresso martini. I talk and listen and laugh with my companion, who is far more deserving of my attention than a collection of strangers online.Forget Unhashtag Vienna – I reckon it’s high time we unhashtag the world.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

For decades protesters have demanded they be repurposed as social housing.\u0026nbspOliver Bennett unravels the highs and lows of a phenomenon with global foundationsClick to followThe IndependentSquatters occupy Centre Point, advocating its use as a residential block instead of an office in the SeventiesCentre Point must be one of the most isive landmarks in London. Erected in 1966, it instantly dominated the West End and while some celebrated it –\u0026nbsparchitect Erno\u0026nbspGoldfinger called it “London’s first pop art skyscraper”\u0026nbspand amazingly, likened it in spirit to The Beatles and Mary Quant – the brainchild of reclusive developer Harry Hyams has had a mixed reception over its 52 years.But perhaps Centre Point’s most curious fate has been to remain more or less empty. It never fully worked as offices. In 1972 Camden Council tried to requisition it. Harold Wilson wanted to nationalise it. It was occupied for a weekend by housing activists in 1974 – one was Labour politician Jack Dromey, Harriet Harman’s husband. A major homelessness charity was named after it. Then a Grade-II listing and a recherché desire for Brutalist\u0026nbspicons (it came from the feted drawing board of Richard Seifert’s master architect, George Marsh) bought its zig-zag façade back into favourable view and it become luxury flats, synced to the new Crossrail development. What could go wrong?Labour mulls plan to force landowners to sell cheap to stateWell, the Centre Point curse has struck again. In October its developer Almacantar decided that offers on its remaining luxury flats were “derisory” and “detached from reality”, and decided to take them off the market. So Centre Point has now cemented and updated its footnote in London folklore as one of the capital’s benighted\u0026nbsp“ghost towers”.From Centre Point to the Shard, from Battersea Power Station to the sky-reaching baubles of Nine Elms\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspeven in The Independent’s old neighbourhood in City Road – the past six years or so has seen London become filled with tall glass and steel icons\u0026nbspthat are conspicuously under-occupied: built in a time of optimism for an overseas market and now languishing unsold or OLE: owned and left empty.The problem is that housing is an extraordinary failure of the market. It’s an oligopoly that controls the supplyThe immediate prognosis is not good. It has been said that half the 1,900 luxury apartments built in London last year failed to sell, and it’s estimated that there are around 2,500 to 3,000 unsold but complete luxury new builds, with many still entering the market. Property analyst Molior London noted that sales of new homes in London fell by a fifth last year, and that the number\u0026nbspof unsold apartments continues to grow. And the more expensive they are, the more likely they are to be unoccupied: 39 per cent\u0026nbspfor homes worth £1m to £5m, 64 per cent\u0026nbspfor those places over £5m. There are reports of people trying hard to sell and to complicate matters, there’s the impending known-unknown that is Brexit.It seems an odd characteristic of the past 10\u0026nbspyears that things have been so difficult for buyers in one direction and so easy in the other. These luxury apartments are commonly between £1,000-£1,500 per sq ft, against the average UK price of £211 per sq ft. But, their posh locations aside, one of their key drivers has been the post credit-crunch migration of capital.“We’ve seen an\u0026nbspera of low interest and cash into assets,” says Henry Pryor, a property-buying agent. “When money is unsafe, or doesn’t inflate, the rich put it into other things: cars, art, houses.”The high-water mark was about six or seven years ago when then mayor Boris Johnson went on a spending spree and encouraged others to do likewise. London became what Pryor calls a “speculation paradise” – and that spike is now heading in the opposite direction.So, if housing is a free market that can go up as well as down, why does Almacantar not take the hit with its Centre Point flats and sell them for less? “It doesn’t work like that,” says Michael Ball of the Waterloo Community Development Group and a seasoned housing activist. “The problem is that housing is an extraordinary failure of the market. It’s an oligopoly that controls the supply.”Battersea\u0026nbspPower Station sat empty for\u0026nbspyears but is now being developed as a retail\u0026nbspand residential space (AFPGetty)The seeds of the current zombie-tower wobbles came with George Osborne’s stamp duty reforms in 2014, which took the froth off the market, leading to developer grumbles – wasn’t he one of us, they wailed? Then the long lead-time of developments began to show as a significant constraint, for as well as “skyscraper syndrome”\u0026nbsp(where a glut of tall building supposedly presages a downturn) there’s also the problem that many developments are financed by upfront sales.“Many were designed to be sold off-plan to release capital for building,” says Roarie Scarisbrick of Property Vision. “Now people are waiting until properties are actually built, which squeezes developers badly.” Increased scrutiny on money laundering may also play a part which, as Pryor says, “is still too easy”.Plus, some high-end properties were simply never meant to be\u0026nbsplived in but just to be “gold bars in the sky” as Ball puts it. It’s hard to find out how many of London’s luxury flats are truly unoccupied. “You can look at census, but it’s tough to find out numbers,” says Ball. “I don’t think we know the extent of it. The records are really poor.” And as ever with property, the winners crow and the losers remain silent.There are a few other factors to observe, including the move of real estate into a high-end branded fashion buy, as the Candy Brothers did with their developments. “That aspect took me by surprise,” says Pryor. “It turned out that people wanted to be able to specify that they had a Candy apartment as they sat in Monaco, as if boasting about owning a Bulgari watch or a Montblanc pen.”There’s also an argument that some parts of London, such as Eaton Square in Belgravia, have long acted as pieds-à-terre for the rich and were probably ghost-like in the 18th and 19th centuries. “Remember, in Downton Abbey they occasionally come down to ‘Grantham House’ in London,” says Adam Challis, head of residential research at real estate company JLL.“That old ‘country seat and the London house’ combination is now a global rather than national phenomenon, and a London apartment became part of a wider property portfolio.” He points out that while these spectral apartments may appear unoccupied, it could well be that their ultra-rich owners may only use them for six to eight weeks a year.I sometimes wonder what would happen if all the owners turned up at once to these places.\u0026nbspIt would be a disasterNine Elms is a typical new London “owned and left empty”\u0026nbspzone. A swathe of land between Battersea and Vauxhall, it was a low-value industrial hinterland dominated by the Cold Store –\u0026nbspa piece of charismatic dereliction used in an episode of The Sweeney – and the only respite being London’s flower market. Now it’s a parade of gleaming hi-tech towers.“When private developers get hold of the land it leaps in value tenfold,” says Michael Ball. So in a way, however many apartments have been sold here, it may have already fulfilled its profit promise. Sometimes, adds Scarisbrick, such places are not even designed for full occupancy. “I sometimes wonder what would happen if all the owners turned up at once to these places,” he says. “It would be a disaster.”US politicians question Trump\u0027s ties to scandal-struck Panama projectHow drones are revolutionising construction and real estateThere are precedents to all this. In earlier eras luxury housing went up as well as down, and lost out to new tastes. Michael Ball says that St Georges Buildings\u0026nbspin the Elephant and Castle area was built as a luxury development in the 1880s. “By the post-war era it had become squatted, then became social housing. Now it’s luxury housing again.”The ghost tower phenomenon isn’t confined to London or the UK. There are similar qualms in South Africa, Canada, New York and Mumbai, where a string of luxury skyscrapers in the Worli and Prabhadevi districts have recently struggled to find buyers. Emptiness is a fact of life in the construction industry and just last month it was reported that a fifth of China’s new housing is empty: an extraordinary total of 50 million ghost homes. But another aspect of construction, says Challis, is that it attracts “huge economic growth. So empty homes are an endemic feature of the world’s most important cities.”The extent of London’s ghost towers may even have been overestimated. “Evidence from the LSE for Sadiq Khan showed that unlived-in apartments were actually under 1 per cent\u0026nbspof new build properties,” says Peter Murray of NLA, who adds that London properties are still selling well in Singapore and Hong Kong. Meanwhile, London has 510 tall buildings in the pipeline: up from 455 in 2016. Even with its current depredations, property in London is still considered a safer bet than many financial vehicles.But there’s no doubt that ghost towers fail the political and social smell test: as visible reminders of disposable wealth in a city where most can’t get a foothold.So, given that ghost towers and unsold luxury flats currently exist, whither their luxurious wenge-floored acres, gyms, pools and media rooms? Will developers have fire sales just to get rid of them? (Molior London has said that 10-15 per cent\u0026nbspreductions are typical and 20-30 per cent\u0026nbspreductions achievable, and that it would take more than\u0026nbspthree years to sell the glut of ultra-luxury flats at the current rate).Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The InSight lander offers the chance to have an unprecedented look inside Mars itself, finally giving us clues about what it\u0027s made up of and what\u0027s going on in its interior.New Nasa Mars lander sends back \u0027beautiful\u0027 selfie from surfaceThat, in turn, could tell us not only where it came from but might give us a new understanding of how our own planet formed.For now, InSight is charging up its batteries using the solar array that successfully unfolded after the dust had cleared from its perilous landing. Even in the first hours after its arrival, it sent back stunning photos of the Martian surface – and of itself.Now mission control will get to learning about InSight\u0027s\u0026nbsplanding site. They\u0027ll be looking for the best place to deploy, particularly searching for somewhere it can stick its deep sensor into the ground to take readings of the underneath.Once all of that is decided, engineers back at Nasa will build a reconstruction of the landing area to go alongside the already completely accurate clone of the lander itself they have down on Earth. That will allow them to practise on a precise recreation of the situation back on Mars, making sure that everything is perfectly calibrated and ready to get moving.They\u0027ll make sure the InSight lander\u0027s arm can grab the sensors and equipment and place them into the right place on Mars. As well as putting them in place, they will also have to put a shield over the seismometer that keeps it from being damaged by the extreme environment of Mars.All of that is incredibly important because the work up on Mars is so difficult: engineers liken it to playing a claw machine game except without the claw. And it is incredibly\u0026nbspdifficult, too,\u0026nbspbecause messages take so long to be relayed to the lander – in the minutes they take to get between, the thing they have asked the lander to do has already happened, so they are unable to respond quickly.That will take a matter of months. Once everything\u0027s in place, the heat probe will have to actually hammer itself deep down into the Martian surface, using special technology to dig five meters down.Altogether, that\u0027s likely take as many as five months. After that, the actual science work that InSight\u0026nbspaims to do will begin properly.That will involve taking Mars\u0027s vital signs: feeling its temperature, checking its pulse and looking at its reflexes. Taken together, that will give an insight into the way the planet is made up and offer hints at how it came to be.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

But by the time he achieved that year’s stunning double-punch of Jurassic Park and Schindler’s List –\u0026nbspthe latter of which had its world premiere 25 years ago this week – the director was already Hollywood’s undisputed miracle-worker, operating at a level far beyond even his most acclaimed contemporaries.Perhaps that’s why the audacity he demonstrated filming and releasing two wildly different, equally boundary-breaking blockbusters within 12 months of each other passed almost without mention. He had carried off the apparently impossible – and the world considered it more or less banal.\u0026nbspJurassic Park has long been considered both a popcorn classic and towering feat of filmmaking. The dinosaur romp to rule them all ushered in a new era of computer-generated effects. Loud, dazzling, occasionally terrifying, it is arguably second only to Jaws in the countdown of Spielberg’s great thrill rides.\u0026nbspBut as it marks its quarter century, Schindler’s List surely stands as the more impressive achievement. It respectfully honours the victims of the Nazi genocide, yet is also a riveting drama, with Ralph Fiennes, as real-life concentration camp commander Amon Goth, one of the most skin-crawling villains in recent cinematic history.\u0026nbspThe Holocaust movie had been Spielberg’s ultimate grail for decades. It was all the way back in 1982 that he was first alerted to the true life story of Oskar Schindler, the gadabout Moravian industrialist who, during the Second World War, saved the lives of an estimated 1,200 Jews in Nazi-occupied Krakow by putting them to work in his factories.Yet Spielberg fretted for years that he was too flashy – too much a creature of Hollywood – to do justice to a real story about real suffering. Only after turning 40 and enduring relative failures such as The Color Purple and Hook – the lukewarm reviews of which cracked his wunderkind reputation – did he feel at last prepared to tackle the greatest challenge of his professional life.\u0026nbspDern and Sam Neill in ‘Jurassic Park’ (Rex)Jewishness was complicated for Spielberg. He was raised by Orthodox parents in Phoenix, Arizona. But growing up “ethnic” in the American sun belt in the Fifties and Sixties was not straightforward, as he was reminded on a daily basis.\u0026nbsp“People coughed the word ‘Jew’ in their hand as they passed me in the hallway,” he told The New York Times. “Pennies were thrown at me in the study hall in a very quiet room of 100 students ... We couldn’t stop it. So my mom picked me up in her car every day after school and took me home.”He was very familiar with the Holocaust throughout his childhood. “We lost cousins, aunts, uncles ... My life has always come back to images surrounding the Holocaust,” he would recount. “The Holocaust had been part of my life, just based on what my parents would say at the dinner table.”\u0026nbspSchindler’s List’s journey to the screen was long and tortuous. The original Thomas Keneally nonfiction book, Schindler’s Ark, was inspired by a chance conversation the author had in 1980 with the owner of a leather goods shop in Los Angeles.Leopold Page’s real name was Poldek Pfefferberg: he was one of the “Schindler Jews” saved by Oskar Schindler. Upon discovering Keneally was a writer, Page insisted on sharing the entire tale – “the greatest story of humanity man to man”.\u0026nbspKeneally was hooked and, working initially from documents furnished by Page, assembled his eventual bestseller. But when Hollywood sought to option Schindler’s Ark it ran into problems. Page had been attempting to turn a spotlight on his saviour for decades and, in the Sixties, sold the rights to his version of events to MGM producer Marvin Gosch for $50,000.\u0026nbspThat project eventually sputtered out, but not before Gosch had hired Casablanca co-writer Howard Koch to write a script and interview Schindler Jews around LA. Spielberg, for his part, was alerted to Schindler’s Ark as he was toiling on ET. His mentor Sidney J Sheinberg, then president of MCA, gave him a copy of the Keneally tome. “It’ll make a helluva story,” Spielberg supposedly responded. “Is it true?”Neeson in ‘Schindler’s List’ (Rex)Reluctant to bring Schindler to the screen himself, Spielberg instead touted the idea to his old movie-making pals. Roman Polanksi and Brian De Palma said no, but Martin Scorsese expressed an interest and was eventually attached to direct. Then, surrounded by pirates and clockwork crocodiles on the set of Hook, Spielberg had an epiphany.He had, he believed, matured sufficiently as a filmmaker and was ready to adapt Schindler’s Ark. Indeed, it was arguably the undertaking towards which his entire career had been leading. All he had to do was win back the rights from one of the greatest directors of his generation.\u0026nbspAcross town at the Beverly Hills HQ, home to the almighty CAA agency, a Holocaust biopic was the last thing on the agenda. CAA’s co-founder Michael Ovitz, however, had a dilemma he would have regarded as no less pressing than Spielberg’s desire to wrest back ownership of Schindler’s List. How could he persuade Steven Spielberg, Hollywood’s most unassailable hit-maker, to sign with him?\u0026nbspHe had an idea – and it hinged on proposition his old friend Michael Crichton had brought to CAA. Ovitz and Crichton were close, the agent having shielded the author and director from prurient attention when he went through two years of devastating depression. Now Crichton was gung-ho about a new concept for a novel – to be set in a theme park where genetically engineered dinosaurs go on the rampage.\u0026nbspHow Jeff Goldblum stole the first Jurassic ParkSpielberg beat James Cameron to Jurassic Park film rights by hoursIt would, Ovitz immediately appreciated, make for a cracking read – and an even better movie. And who better to direct that the doyen of rip-roaring family entertainment, Steven Spielberg? He wasn’t representing Spielberg – who famously did not have an agent at that time. But with a little persuasion, Ovitz hoped to remedy the situation and have Spielberg both make the movie and sign with CAA. Thus Ovitz would have landed the biggest fish in Hollywood.\u0026nbsp“We offered Jurassic Park exclusively to Steven Spielberg – who still hadn’t signed with CAA,” Ovitz writes in his autobiography, Who is Michael Ovitz?. “Steven was the one director Michael and I knew who possessed both the technique and the sense of wonder to pull the plot off. Playing favourites on this one would alienate a lot of our other filmmakers, but it was worth it.”Spielberg blazed through the (still unpublished) novel in a single evening and, for the first time in his career, attached himself to a picture that was unfinanced and had yet to receive a studio green light. At that moment, the only people in on Jurassic Park were Crichton, Ovitz, Spielberg and his producing partner Kathleen Kennedy (today, dark lord of Disney’s Star Wars franchise).\u0026nbspOvitz next called Sheinberg – the very mogul who had introduced Spielberg to Schindler’s Ark a decade previously. He explained to the producer, now honcho-in-chief at Universal, that he had “good news and bad news”.In any other industry, the scenario would have seemed farcical. In Hollywood, it was business as usual. Spielberg wanted to make Schindler’s List but Scorsese held the rights. Sheinberg, who had turned Spielberg onto Schindler’s List, wanted to make Jurassic Park – but Spielberg and his collaborators had it in their back pocket. Meanwhile, Spielberg was attached to a mooted remake of the 1962 Robert MitchumGregory Peck thriller Cape Fear – a project he was keen to pass on to Scorsese, despite his old pal’s strict “no-remakes” rule.\u0026nbspScorsese\u0026nbspinto swapping ‘Schindler’s List’ for ‘Cape Fear’ (Rex)This being Hollywood, a solution beneficial to all parties was hammered out. Spielberg talked Scorsese into swapping Schindler’s List for Cape Fear – the carrot being that he could cast Robert De Niro as the villain played in the original by Mitchum and thus reunite with his favourite actor. Meanwhile, Universal agreed a complicated profit share with Ovitz, Spielberg and Crichton. They would walk away with nothing if Jurassic Park flopped – but enjoy a lucrative slice of the box office should it do well.\u0026nbspSheinberg also agreed to let Spielberg adapt Schindler’s Ark, even assenting to a three-hour running time, black and white photography and a comparatively hefty £23m\u0026nbspbudget. There was a\u0026nbspcaveat, though – he had to do Jurassic Park first.\u0026nbspAs 1992 began, Spielberg was thus juggling two remarkably different undertakings. He’d decided to forgo a fee for Schindler’s List. Payment for telling the story of the Holocaust would, he felt, be tantamount to “blood money”.\u0026nbspHe also had to find his Schindler, and rejected pressure to cast a star (Kevin Costner and Mel Gibson both auditioned). Warren Beatty talked his way into a script reading – but was ultimately rejected because, according to Spielberg, he would have ended up with Oskar Schindler-as-Warren Beatty rather than the other way around. In the end, he went with the comparatively unknown Liam Neeson, who had impressed Spielberg in a Eugene O’Neill play on Broadway.An even bigger headache was bringing realistic dinosaurs to the screen. Spielberg had assumed early on that Jurassic would utilise “go motion” – an updating of the ancient “stop motion” effects as featured in King Kong and immortalised in the Fifties and Sixties by the “creature features” of Ray Harryhausen.\u0026nbspThe creator of “go-motion” Phil Tippett – celebrated in Hollywood for creating the Imperial Walkers in The Empire Strikes Back – was hired and test sequences of the famous T rex and velociraptors-in-the-kitchen scenes were shot. Spielberg’s children were entranced when he showed them the footage. Yet something nagged at the director. King Kong was 60 years old. Surely technology had moved on?\u0026nbspEnter Industrial Light and Magic, which presented Spielberg with a primitive CGI showreel of a walking T rex. Even in rough form, it was many times more realistic than go-motion. Spielberg turned to Tippett and quipped:\u0026nbsp“You’re out of job.”\u0026nbsp“Don’t you mean extinct?” Tippet shot back – a line Spielberg put in the script (Tippett stayed on as “dinosaur supervisor”).Schindler’s List’ (Rex)Filming on Jurassic Park had wrapped but special effects were still unfinished when Spielberg arrived in Krakow in March 1993 for the 72-day Schindler’s List shoot. He had put himself under time pressure because he wanted to make the Holocaust movie in the bleak Polish spring. He could, it is true, have waited another year. But he feared that if he delayed (and especially if Jurassic Park flopped), the studio would reconsider bankrolling his passion project.\u0026nbspSchindler’s List was intensely personal for the director –\u0026nbsptraumatic simply by dint of the subject matter. Day after day, he would recreate the horrors of the Krakow ghetto and of the nearby Płaszow concentration camp, presided over by monstrous SS second lieutenant Goth (Fiennes’s mere presence in a Nazi uniform is said to have reduced Holocaust survivors to tears on visits to the set).\u0026nbspThen\u0026nbspat night\u0026nbspSpielberg would communicate via satellite uplink with Industrial Light and Magic in San Francisco. Here, he was required to make final decisions over how the T rex ought to roar and whether a brachiosaurus should rise on its back legs when eating. It was difficult and depressing – and Spielberg grew to resent Hollywood for putting him through the mill in such a fashion.\u0026nbsp“When I finally started shooting ... in Poland, I had to go home about two or three times a week and get on a very crude satellite feed to northern California ... to be able to approve T rex shots,” he remembered at an anniversary screening of Schindler’s List at Tribeca Film Festival.\u0026nbspOne of his methods of coping was to call Robin Williams, whom he had befriended making Hook. Never one to refuse an audience, Williams took it as his mission to cajole Spielberg out of his blue moods.\u0026nbsp“Robin knew what I was going through, and once a week, Robin would call me on schedule and he would do 15 minutes of standup on the phone,” Spielberg said. “I would laugh hysterically, because I had to release so much.”Neeson (Rex)With laughter and determination, he got through it and achieved one of the remarkable one-twos in film. Released on 11 June 1993, Jurassic Park became the monster that devoured the box office whole, earning nearly $1bn. Of that, Spielberg pocketed an estimated $250m\u0026nbspthanks to the deal Ovitz had thrashed out in pre-production.\u0026nbspAnd then, on 15 December, Schindler’s List opened in US cinemas, revealing a very different side to Hollywood’s great conjurer. (It would open in the UK in early 1994.)\u0026nbspThe movie was powerful, haunting and lacking the trademark sentimentality that Spielberg for so long feared made him temperamentally ill-suited to directing it.\u0026nbspBoth films were universally adored. The New York Times praised Jurassic Park as\u0026nbsp“a true movie milestone, presenting awe- and fear-inspiring sights never before seen on the screen”. The Independent approved, too: “The best thing about Jurassic Park is the way that fear never drives out wonder, wonder at the special effects that have realised dinosaurs so convincingly, but also at the dinosaurs in their own right,” it said.\u0026nbspSchindler’s List received an even more positive response. “Schindler’s List, with its grave documentary thoroughness and moral complexity, rewrites film history,” said The Independent. “It is one of the cinema’s finest achievements.” “Rising brilliantly to the challenge of this material and displaying an electrifying creative intelligence, Mr Spielberg has made sure that neither he nor the Holocaust will ever be thought of in the same way again,” added The New York Times.\u0026nbspJurassic Park and Schindler’s List went on to clean up at the Oscars the following year. Jurassic Park won for best sound editing, sound mixing and special effects. But this was eclipsed by Schindler’s List, which finally lifted the Academy Awards curse that had hung over Spielberg since ET was trumped by Gandhi a decade previously.\u0026nbspAmong the seven Oscars awarded to it were ones for Best Film and Best Director. Yet far from exulting, James Cameron-style, in his sweep, Spielberg cut a sober figure. The presence beside him on the podium of producer Branko Lustig – who as a child had spent two years at Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen – was a reminder there were more important things than accolades and ovations.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Yet the series almost immediately transcended its format to deliver a moving and very funny rumination on depression and middle-age malaise. Will Arnett plays BoJack – one time star of Nineties hit sitcom Horsin’ Around – as a lost soul whose turbo-charged narcissism prevents him getting his life together. A valentine to the Spielberg school of Eighties blockbuster, with Winona Ryder as a small town mom whose son is abducted by a transdimensional monster. ET, Goonies, Close Encounters, Alien and everything Stephen King wrote between 1975 and 1990 are all tossed into the blender by Millennial writer-creators the Duffer brothers. It was clear Stranger Things was going to be a mega-smash when Barb – the “best friend” character eaten in the second episode – went viral the weekend it dropped. Netflix’s Marvel shows tend towards the overlong and turgid. An exception is the high-kicking Daredevil, with Charlie Cox’s blind lawyercrimefighter banishing all memory of Ben Affleck\u0027s turn donning the red jumpsuit in 2003. With New York’s Hell’s Kitchen neighbourhood as backdrop, Daredevil is caked in street-level grit and features a searing series one performance by Vincent D\u0027Onofrio as the villainous Kingpin. The perfect antidote to the deafening bombast of the big screen Marvel movies. Did he do it? Does it matter considering the lengths the Durham, North Carolina police seemingly went in order to stitch him up? Sitting through this twisting, turning documenting about the trial of Michael Peterson – charged with the murder in 2003 of his wife – the viewer may find themselves alternately empathising with and recoiling from the accused. It’s a feat of bravura factual filmmaking from French documentarian Jean-Xavier de Lestrade, which comes to Netflix with a recently shot three-part coda catching up with the (very weird) Peterson clan a decade on. Stranger Things: the Euro-Gloom years. Netflix’s first German-language production is a pulp romp that thinks it’s a Wagner opera. In a remote town surrounded by a creepy forest locals fear the disappearance of a teenager may be linked to other missing persons cases from decades earlier. The timelines get twisted and it’s obvious that something wicked is emanating from a tunnel leading to a nearby nuclear power plant. Yet if the story sometimes trips itself up the Goonies-meets-Götterdämmerung ambiance keeps you hooked. 625 A Series of Unfortunate EventsThe wry and bleak Lemony Snickett children novels finally get the ghastly adaptation they deserve (let’s all pretend the dreadful 2004 Jim Carrey movie never happened). Neil Patrick Harris gobbles up the scenery as the vain and wicked Count Olaf, desperate to separate the Baudelaire orphans from their considerable inheritance. The look is Tim Burton by way of Wes Anderson, and the dark wit of the books is replicated perfectly (Snickett, aka Daniel Handler, is co-producer). If you’re curious as to how Cary Fukunaga will handle the Bond franchise, his limited series, starring Emma Stone and Jonah Hill, drops some delicious hints. It’s a mind-bending sci-fi story set in an alternative United States where computers still look like Commodore 64s and in which you pay for goods by having a “travel buddy” sit down and read you adverts. The Breaking Bad prequel is starting to outgrow the show that spawned it. Where Breaking Bad delivered a master-class in scorched earth storytelling Saul is gentler and more humane. Years before the rise of Walter White, the future meth overlord’s sleazy lawyer, Saul Goodman, is still plain old Jimmy McGill, a striving every-dude trying to catch a break. But how far will he go to make his name and escape the shadow of his superstar attorney brother Chuck (Michael McKean)? Don’t tell Channel 4 but Charlie Brooker’s dystopian anthology series has arguably got even better since making the jump from British terrestrial TV to the realm of megabucks American streaming. Bigger budgets have given creators Brooker and Annabel Jones license to let their imaginations off the leash – yielding unsurpassable episodes such as virtual reality love story San Junipero and Star Trek parody USS Callister, which has bagged a bunch of Emmys. David Fincher produces this serial killer drama based on the writings of a real-life FBI psychological profiler. It’s the post-Watergate Seventies and two maverick G-Men (Jonathan Groff and Holt McCallany) are going out on a limb by utilising the latest psychological research to get inside the heads of a motley assembly of real-life sociopathic murders – including the notorious “Co-Ed” butcher Ed Kemper, brought chillingly to live in an Emmy-nominated performance by Cameron Britton. A right royal blockbuster from dramatist Peter Morgan (The Queen, Frost  Nixon). Tracing the reign of Elizabeth II from her days as a wide-eyed young woman propelled to the throne after the surprise early death of her father, The Crown humanises the royals even as it paints their private lives as a bodice-ripping soap. Matt Smith is charmingly roguish as Prince Philip and Vanessa Kirby has ascended the Hollywood ranks on the back of her turn as the flawed yet sympathetic Princess Margaret. This drug trafficking caper spells out exactly what kind of series it is with an early scene in which two gangsters zip around a multi-level carpark on a motorbike firing a machine gun. Narcos, in other words, is for people who consider Pacino’s Scarface a touch too understated. Series one and two feature a mesmerising performance by Wagner Moura as Columbian cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar, while season three focuses on the notorious Cali cartel. Reported to be one of Netflix’s biggest hits – the company doesn’t release audience figures – the fourth season turns its attention to Mexico’s interminable drugs wars. A cloud hangs over Aziz Ansari’s future after he was embroiled in the #MeToo scandal. But whatever happens, he has left us with a humane and riveting sitcom about an Ansari-proximate character looking for love and trying to establish himself professionally in contemporary New York. One of Netflix’s early blockbusters, the sprawling soap opera updates Dallas to modern day southern Florida. Against the edge-of-civilisation backdrop of the Florida Keys, Kyle Chandler plays the local detective and favourite son of a well-to-do family. Their idyllic lives are thrown into chaos with the return of the clan’s black sheep (an unnervingly intense Ben Mendelsohn). The story is spectacularly hokey but searing performances by Chandler and Mendelsohn, and by Sissy Spacek and the late Sam Shepard as their imperious parents, make Bloodline compelling – a guilty pleasure that, actually, you shouldn’t feel all that guilty about. You can almost smell the shoddy sanitation and horse-manure in this lavish murder-mystery set in 19th New York. We’re firmly in Martin Scorsese\u0027s Gangs of New York territory, with a serial killer bumping off boy prostitutes across Manhattan. Enter pioneering criminal psychologist Dr Laszlo Kreisler (Daniel Brühl), aided by newspaper man John Moore (Luke Evans) and feisty lady detective Sara Howard (Dakota Fanning). Judd Apatow bring his signature gross-out comedy to the small screen. Love, which Apatow produced, is a masterclass in restraint compared to 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up etc. Paul Rust is Gus, a nerdish movie set tutor, whose develops a crush on Gillian Jacobs’s too-cool-for-school radio producer Mickey. Romance, of a sort, blossoms – but Love’s triumph is to acknowledge the complications of real life and to disabuse its characters of the idea that there’s such a thing as a straightforward happy ending. Hipster LA provides the bustling setting. Who says reality TV has to be nasty and manipulative? This updating of the early 2000s hit Queer Eye for the Straight Guy has five stereotype-challenging gay men sharing lifestyle tips and fashion advice with an engaging cast of All American schlubs (the first two seasons are shot mostly in the state of Georgia). There are laughs – but serious moment too, such as when one of the crew refuses to enter a church because of the still unhealed scars of his strict Christian upbringing. A high-gloss revamping of the traditional TV food show. Each episode profiles a high wattage international chef across its three seasons, the series has featured gastronomic superstars from the US, Argentina, India and Korea. A disastrous group interview in which actor Jason Bateman “mansplained” away the bullying co-star Jessica Walter had suffered at the hands of fellow cast-member Jeffrey Tambor meant season five of Arrested Development was fatally compromised before it even landed. Yet Netflix’s return to the dysfunctional world of the Bluth family stands on its merits and is a worthy addition to the surreal humour of seasons one through three (series four, which had to work around the busy schedules of the cast, is disposable by comparison). Netflix does Bladerunner with this sumptuous adaptation of the cult Richard Morgan novel. The setting is a neon-splashed cyberpunk future in which the super-wealthy live forever by uploading the consciousness into new “skins”. Enter rebel-turned-detective Takeshi Kovacs (Joel Kinnaman), hired to find out who killed a (since resurrected) zillionaire industrialist while dealing with fallout from his own troubled past. Rumoured to be one of Netflix’s most expensive projects yet, for its second run, Anthony Mackie (aka Marvel’s Falcon) replaced Kinnaman as the shape-shifting Kovacs.2125 Rick and MortyDan Harmon, creator of cult sitcom Community (also on Netflix), finds the perfect outlet for zany fanboy imagination with this crazed animated comedy about a Marty McFlyDoc Brown-esque duo of time travellers. Every genre imaginable is parodied with the manic energy and zinging dialogue we have come to expect from Harmon.Mad Men’s Alison Brie is our entry point into this comedy-drama inspired by a real life all-female wrestling league in the Eighties. Ruth Wilder (Brie) is a down-on-her luck actor who, out of desperation, signs up a wrestling competition willed into being by Sam Sylvia (podcast king Marc Maron). Britrock singer Kate Nash is one of her her fellow troupe members: the larger than life Rhonda “Britannica” Richardson.Deadpan animated satire about an idiot super spy with shaken and stirred mother issues. One of the most ambitious modern comedies, animated or otherwise, Archer tries on different varieties of humour for size and even occasionally tugs at the heart strings.Breaking Bad for those with short attention s. The saga of Walter White took years to track the iconic anti-hero’s rise from mild mannered everyman to dead-eyed criminal. Ozark gets there in the first half hour as nebbish Chicago accountant Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman) agrees to serve as lieutenant for the Mexican mob in the hillbilly heartlands of Ozark, Missouri (in return they thoughtfully spare his life). Bateman, usually seen in comedy roles, is a revelation as is Laura Linney as his nasty wife Wendy. There is also a break-out performance by Julia Garner playing the scion of a local redneck crime family.A heavenly comedy with a twist. Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell) is a cynical schlub waved through the Pearly Gates by mistake after dying in a bizarre supermarket accident. There she must remain above the suspicions of seemingly well-meaning but disorganised angel Michael (Ted Danson) whilst also negotiating fractious relationships with do-gooder Chidi (William Jackson Harper), spoiled princess Tahani (former T4 presenter Jameela Jamil) and ex-drug dealer Jason (Manny Jacinto).A cartoon about a talking horse, starring the goofy older brother from Arrested Development… on paper little about BoJack Horseman screams “must watch”. Yet the series almost immediately transcended its format to deliver a moving and very funny rumination on depression and middle-age malaise. Will Arnett plays BoJack – one time star of Nineties hit sitcom Horsin’ Around – as a lost soul whose turbo-charged narcissism prevents him getting his life together. A valentine to the Spielberg school of Eighties blockbuster, with Winona Ryder as a small town mom whose son is abducted by a transdimensional monster. ET, Goonies, Close Encounters, Alien and everything Stephen King wrote between 1975 and 1990 are all tossed into the blender by Millennial writer-creators the Duffer brothers. It was clear Stranger Things was going to be a mega-smash when Barb – the “best friend” character eaten in the second episode – went viral the weekend it dropped. Netflix’s Marvel shows tend towards the overlong and turgid. An exception is the high-kicking Daredevil, with Charlie Cox’s blind lawyercrimefighter banishing all memory of Ben Affleck\u0027s turn donning the red jumpsuit in 2003. With New York’s Hell’s Kitchen neighbourhood as backdrop, Daredevil is caked in street-level grit and features a searing series one performance by Vincent D\u0027Onofrio as the villainous Kingpin. The perfect antidote to the deafening bombast of the big screen Marvel movies. Did he do it? Does it matter considering the lengths the Durham, North Carolina police seemingly went in order to stitch him up? Sitting through this twisting, turning documenting about the trial of Michael Peterson – charged with the murder in 2003 of his wife – the viewer may find themselves alternately empathising with and recoiling from the accused. It’s a feat of bravura factual filmmaking from French documentarian Jean-Xavier de Lestrade, which comes to Netflix with a recently shot three-part coda catching up with the (very weird) Peterson clan a decade on. Stranger Things: the Euro-Gloom years. Netflix’s first German-language production is a pulp romp that thinks it’s a Wagner opera. In a remote town surrounded by a creepy forest locals fear the disappearance of a teenager may be linked to other missing persons cases from decades earlier. The timelines get twisted and it’s obvious that something wicked is emanating from a tunnel leading to a nearby nuclear power plant. Yet if the story sometimes trips itself up the Goonies-meets-Götterdämmerung ambiance keeps you hooked. 625 A Series of Unfortunate EventsThe wry and bleak Lemony Snickett children novels finally get the ghastly adaptation they deserve (let’s all pretend the dreadful 2004 Jim Carrey movie never happened). Neil Patrick Harris gobbles up the scenery as the vain and wicked Count Olaf, desperate to separate the Baudelaire orphans from their considerable inheritance. The look is Tim Burton by way of Wes Anderson, and the dark wit of the books is replicated perfectly (Snickett, aka Daniel Handler, is co-producer). If you’re curious as to how Cary Fukunaga will handle the Bond franchise, his limited series, starring Emma Stone and Jonah Hill, drops some delicious hints. It’s a mind-bending sci-fi story set in an alternative United States where computers still look like Commodore 64s and in which you pay for goods by having a “travel buddy” sit down and read you adverts. The Breaking Bad prequel is starting to outgrow the show that spawned it. Where Breaking Bad delivered a master-class in scorched earth storytelling Saul is gentler and more humane. Years before the rise of Walter White, the future meth overlord’s sleazy lawyer, Saul Goodman, is still plain old Jimmy McGill, a striving every-dude trying to catch a break. But how far will he go to make his name and escape the shadow of his superstar attorney brother Chuck (Michael McKean)? Don’t tell Channel 4 but Charlie Brooker’s dystopian anthology series has arguably got even better since making the jump from British terrestrial TV to the realm of megabucks American streaming. Bigger budgets have given creators Brooker and Annabel Jones license to let their imaginations off the leash – yielding unsurpassable episodes such as virtual reality love story San Junipero and Star Trek parody USS Callister, which has bagged a bunch of Emmys. David Fincher produces this serial killer drama based on the writings of a real-life FBI psychological profiler. It’s the post-Watergate Seventies and two maverick G-Men (Jonathan Groff and Holt McCallany) are going out on a limb by utilising the latest psychological research to get inside the heads of a motley assembly of real-life sociopathic murders – including the notorious “Co-Ed” butcher Ed Kemper, brought chillingly to live in an Emmy-nominated performance by Cameron Britton. A right royal blockbuster from dramatist Peter Morgan (The Queen, Frost  Nixon). Tracing the reign of Elizabeth II from her days as a wide-eyed young woman propelled to the throne after the surprise early death of her father, The Crown humanises the royals even as it paints their private lives as a bodice-ripping soap. Matt Smith is charmingly roguish as Prince Philip and Vanessa Kirby has ascended the Hollywood ranks on the back of her turn as the flawed yet sympathetic Princess Margaret. This drug trafficking caper spells out exactly what kind of series it is with an early scene in which two gangsters zip around a multi-level carpark on a motorbike firing a machine gun. Narcos, in other words, is for people who consider Pacino’s Scarface a touch too understated. Series one and two feature a mesmerising performance by Wagner Moura as Columbian cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar, while season three focuses on the notorious Cali cartel. Reported to be one of Netflix’s biggest hits – the company doesn’t release audience figures – the fourth season turns its attention to Mexico’s interminable drugs wars. A cloud hangs over Aziz Ansari’s future after he was embroiled in the #MeToo scandal. But whatever happens, he has left us with a humane and riveting sitcom about an Ansari-proximate character looking for love and trying to establish himself professionally in contemporary New York. One of Netflix’s early blockbusters, the sprawling soap opera updates Dallas to modern day southern Florida. Against the edge-of-civilisation backdrop of the Florida Keys, Kyle Chandler plays the local detective and favourite son of a well-to-do family. Their idyllic lives are thrown into chaos with the return of the clan’s black sheep (an unnervingly intense Ben Mendelsohn). The story is spectacularly hokey but searing performances by Chandler and Mendelsohn, and by Sissy Spacek and the late Sam Shepard as their imperious parents, make Bloodline compelling – a guilty pleasure that, actually, you shouldn’t feel all that guilty about.

Well, almost everything! The other inspiration is the world we’ve been living in,” Atwood said.Speculation of a follow-up was rife after Atwood released an audiobook of The Handmaid’s Tale which came accompanied with a special extended version of the epilogue in which a professor tells a crowd many years after the book’s events:\u0026nbsp“I hope to be able to present the results of our further\u0026nbspGileadian\u0026nbspinvestigations to you at some future date.”\u0026nbspIt seems Atwood’s sequel will do exactly that.Moss won an Emmy and Golden Globe for her portrayal of Offred in the series set in a future in which\u0026nbspfertile “handmaids” are forced to bear children for the brutal theocrats of a new government called Gilead. Her co-stars include Yvonne Strahovski, Joseph Fiennes and\u0026nbspAnn Dowd.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

This raises fundamental issues about the lack of commitment and urgency in this scandal’Click to followThe IndependentThe immigration minister admitted the department had made ‘no specific attempt’ to inform 49 people confirmed to have been removed to Nigeria and Ghana last year that the Windrush settlement scheme had been establishedThe Home Office has made no attempt to inform people deported to Commonwealth countries that the Windrush\u0026nbsptaskforce exists, prompting concerns that people who were wrongly removed do not know they can have their cases looked into.The immigration minister admitted the department had made “no specific attempt” to inform 49 people confirmed to have been removed to Nigeria and Ghana last year that the Windrush settlement scheme had been established.Caroline Nokes said\u0026nbspiniduals who believe they qualify under the\u0026nbspWindrush\u0026nbspcriteria could access the relevant\u0026nbspinformation on the government website, saying it was regularly updated with information about how to apply for status.Citizens from 64 countries have been referred to Windrush taskforceWindrush generation members to be refused UK citizenshipCampaigners said it was “ridiculous” to expect people who had been wrongly deported to visit the government’s website without being notified about it, and accused ministers of having “learnt nothing” from the Windrush crisis.People from Nigeria and Ghana are among the Commonwealth nationalities that have been caught up in the scandal, which has seen people who were invited from former British colonies to live and work in the UK after the Second World War targeted by immigration enforcement despite living in the country for decades.The Independent recently revealed\u0026nbspthat nearly half of overseas enquiries to the government’s Windrush taskforce are from countries outside the Caribbean, indicating that the immigration issues  beyond the West Indies.Green Party MP Caroline Lucas, who obtained the response from Ms Nokes in a written question, said: “It doesn’t seem much to ask for the government to tell people they’ve kicked out of the country that the Windrush taskforce exists.“Ministers know their treatment of the Windrush generation is a national disgrace. That they haven’t bothered to contact people who’ve been deported suggests the government hasn’t learnt\u0026nbspanything from the public backlash against its\u0026nbsphostile environment.”Windrush campaigner and ex-Labour councillor Patrick Vernon said the response from Ms Nokes showed the Home Office was “failing” in its\u0026nbspcommitment to resolve the Windrush issue.Windrush ‘tip of iceberg’ as other Commonwealth citizens targeted“After the scandal broke, ministers apologised and pledged to ‘right to wrongs’, saying people who have been deported should be given the option of coming back and being recognised as part of the compensation scheme,” he said.“They’re not righting the wrongs, and they’re failing in their commitment to resolve the Windrush scandal. It’s not just people who have been treated shoddily in the UK. It’s people who have been deported or refused entry back into the country. All of them should be treated on equal footing.“There might be people out there now who do have the right to be here but don’t know. This raises fundamental issues about the lack of commitment and urgency in this scandal.”He added: “With all due respect, if you’re living in a community in the middle of Nigeria, are you going to go onto the UK government website and do a search under Windrush? Let’s be real.“To expect people to do a search on Google and find the government website link, without being told they should do so,\u0026nbspis just\u0026nbspridiculous.”Mr Vernon added that while Caribbean leaders had been made very aware of the issues, there had been considerably less effort from the UK government to reach out other Commonwealth countries in Africa, which many people left for Britain in the 1960s.Created with Sketch.Windrush generation: threat of deportation from UK Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 arriving at Tilbury Docks from Jamaica, with 482 Jamaicans on board, emigrating to Britain.Jamaican immigrants being welcomed by RAF officials from the Colonial Office after the ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 landed them at Tilbury.

The Brexiteers may lose their Brexit.”Ms Rudd also cast doubt on Ms May’s plans to seal the Brexit deal at a summit with EU leaders on Sunday, acknowledging there are still obstacles in the way.“Hopefully it will get through this week,” she said, adding: “There is still a negotiation going on in terms of actually getting this agreement through.”The comments make Ms Rudd the first cabinet minister to rule out a no-deal Brexit – and the first to suggest an agreement at European level could yet be derailed.They came as the prime minister prepared to head to Brussels for talks with Jean-Claude Juncker, the head of the European Commission, under huge pressure for further “wins” in the final text.Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Red smoke from a canister hangs in the air as around 100,000 demonstrators march through London during a People\u0027s Vote anti-brexit demonstration savings banners and placardsMayor of London Sadiq Khan takes part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.MP Chuka Umunna (left) and MP Vince Cable (right) as MP Anna Soubry (centre) addresses Anti-Brexit campaigners at a rally after the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.

If we can\u0027t achieve that - the government can\u0027t achieve that - we should have a general election but that\u0027s very difficult to do because of the nature of the legislation that David Cameron brought forward.If that\u0027s not possible, we\u0027ll be calling upon the government then to join us in a public vote.It\u0027s difficult to judge each stage, but that\u0027s the sequence I think that we\u0027ll inevitably go through over this period.Asked if it was inevitable that there would be another vote, he said: That\u0027s right. Our policy is if we can\u0027t get a general election, then the other option which we\u0027ve kept on the table is a people\u0027s vote.Labour MP Stephen Doughty said his comments were “very welcome, adding: It would be good to see this repeated and reinforced as it becomes clearer by the hour that we need a way through this Brexit chaos.It\u0027s clear that it is the will of Labour members and voters across the country.”May’s EU deal doesn’t honour the referendum – we need a Final SayEvery kind of Brexit will make people worse offHow Brexit is putting the future of Britain\u0027s curry industry at riskUK \u0027to be worse off and wages to fall\u0027 under every Brexit scenarioWhat is the \u0027meaningful vote\u0027 on Brexit?The Independent has launched a campaign for a Final Say referendum on Ms May’s Brexit deal, which has attracted more than a million supporters so far.In a separate interview, Mr McDonnell also said for\u0026nbspthe first time that\u0026nbspstaying in the bloc should be one of the alternatives offered to the public in the event of a public vote.He came under fire at the party\u0027s annual conference when he said Labour would “go for a people\u0027s vote” if MPs rejected Theresa May\u0027s deal but without the option to halt Brexit altogether.Pro-EU MPs were dismayed by his comments, with one MP telling The Independent that denying voters the choice to remain in the EU as farcical.Mr McDonnell told a  event: If we can’t get a general election, people’s vote is on the table and that might be an option we seize upon.The Labour frontbencher\u0026nbspsaid he would vote to remain in a fresh poll\u0026nbspand dismissed the idea of presenting the public with the option to crash out of the EU without a deal.“We can’t have no deal on the ballot paper,” Mr McDonnell said.Created with Sketch.

With current flows, the reduction\u0026nbspwould be 2.1 per cent.The long-term economic analysis also finds that borrowing could be pushed up by up to £26.6bn by 2035 under Ms May’s plans – and by as much as £119bn under a no-deal Brexit.Created with Sketch.

Britain would apply EU rules and standards and follow a common external tariff rate.Northern Ireland will remain in a much deeper customs arrangement from the rest of Great Britain and will also be signed up to a number of EU single market rules and regulations on goods.This has sparked outrage among many Brexiteers, who say the deal allows the EU to still dominate the UK.

but the EU has warned that would render the mechanism pointless.It would ensure that no tarfs, quotas, rules of origin or customs processes would be applied to UK-EU trade.At the same time the UK would be able to strike free trade agreements with other countries.On November , thereported that Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab demanded the right to pull Britain out of the EU’s Irish backstop after just three months.The paper claimed the hardline pitch to the Irish government “stunned” officials.Its claimed Mr Raab’s proposal was put to the Irelands deputy prime minister Simon Coveney in a private meeting in London.However, the Irish Prime Minister told Theresa May that he will not accept a Brexit deal which gives the UK the unilateral power to halt backstop arrangements for the border with Northern Ireland.The EU has suggested a backstop that would see Northern Ireland staying in the customs union, the EU VAT system and parts of the single market.This will essentially draw a customs border down the middle of the Irish Sea, potentially damaging the union of the UK.Mrs May has suggested a backstop that will see all of the UK aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time after .Brussels has two issues with Mays plan.The first is that May wants the backstop to come to an end after a certain time period the EU thinks this would be self-defeating as its possible no solution for the Irish border would be found.The EU also thinks this risks leaving Britain benefiting from the customs union and single market for years after Brexit - reaping all the benefits without having any of the obligations that full membership would entail.In June  European leaders said Britain was running out of time to do a deal because of the unsolved border problem.In July Theresa May quoted Shakespeare as she insisted the UK would not be broken up with a border down the Irish Sea.Theresa May has told EU leaders she is looking at ways of keeping Britain under their rules for at least another year as part of efforts to break the Brexit deadlock.Addressing the  national bosses at a tense summit in Brussels on the night of October , the PM said she is “ready to consider” extending the  month transition period after the UK leaves the EU next March.The potentially incendiary move has been drawn up by the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier to try to end a bitter impasse over the Irish border.It would mean abiding by all Brussels rules until December  at the earliest.The news comes after talks on Sunday, October , hit a brick wall once again, as the issue of the Irish border continues to cause a headache for Theresa May.Theresa May has insisted any backstop arrangement must apply to the UK as a whole so not to create a border in the Irish Sea.However, talks broke down after the EU had insisted on a second backstop arrangement - just involving Northern Ireland -the UKs version wasnt ready in time, according to Downing Street sources.Brussels admitted in a draft trade agreement that technology COULD be used to solve the thorny issue of the border, using Max Fac solutions at the frontier as part of a future deal between the UK and EU.But the backstop - which keeps Britain in the customs unionno alternative is agreed to keep the Irish border open - will stay in the withdrawal agreement as an insurance policy.Ex-leader Iain Duncan Smith said: The withdrawal agreement will make it very clear that should we struggle with a negotiation for a free trade arrangement and not complete that process, we will fall into the Northern Ireland backstop.I would hope that she would now consider that none of this is at all workable unless we get the withdrawal agreement now amended so that any arrangements we make strip out that backstop.Former minister Owen Paterson added: As long as the backstop is in existence in a legally binding document, there is a danger that should talks fail the backstop becomes accepted.We would have the horror of falling into a customs union, the horror of having Northern Ireland separated from the rest of the United Kingdom.Mrs May dubbed the continuing row with Brussels over how to avoid a hard border in Ireland as “the one real sticking point left, but a considerable one”.The Democratic Unionist Party has vowed to oppose any new checks on goods passing between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Irelands Foreign Minister, Simon Coveney, said that EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier indicated that the European Union will allow extra time for talks about the border.Mr Coveney said he was frustrated and disappointed that it was going to take more time than people had hoped.On November , , the PM faced crunch Cabinet showdowns with her ministers where she will set out the details of the agreement she struck with Brussels the previous day.A number of pro-Brexit ministers are feared to be on the brink of walking out over the deal.They believe it would leave Britain tied to the EU customs union for years to come, because of the controversial Irish backstop arrangement.If the Cabinet does block Mrs Mays deal, she could find her position is untenable - leading to a Tory leadership crisis."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000451030531.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"get on with brexit corbyn government","story":"Well, it has been a very interesting week.The British people — asthey needed further confirmation after what has gone on over the past few months — have been let down by the political class and the establishment elite.The Tories are torn apart by ideology.The party’s historically masterful, pragmatic ability to compromise has disappeared on the one hand and naked political ambition is very evident on the other.Labour has shown total disregard for everyone. Securing a general election is the only thing that matters to them.Jeremy Corbyn is showing scant regard for statesmanship and putting our country’s best interests a poor second to sheer tribal and selfish ambition.I will tell you one thing about Theresa May: No one can say she is putting herself through this for personal political ambition.Hers has been a tormented week of continued public duty and personal, selfless service.Stoic and steadfast, the Prime Minister has shown a resilience seen rarely in politics, probably last admired when another woman ran the country.The stance of Arlene Foster’s DUP is carelessly irresponsible in the extreme.A lot of the “backstop” stuff and the — unacceptable in my view — possibility of the EU being able to block our exit, has been caused by a bona fide effort from May to accommodate the DUP’s wishes.For me, it has been an interesting week in another way as well.I have presided over the board meetings of several of the six private companies I have the honour to chair.Dferent sizes, dferent sectors, dferent parts of the country, yet they are all saying the same things. That business is doing fine. Not what the doomsayers want to hear, but true. It is hard work but certainly not Armageddon.Companies up and down the land are demanding a diet of “boring, stable predictability”. It means they can invest more cash and employ more people. It is uncertainty that kills us.I am hearing from boardrooms that the Brexit proposal is fine, with one big caveat.On the plus side, a Single Market for manufactured goods will work.Anyone selling into the EU — yes, even China and Trump’s USA — has to abide by EU regulation.“Taking it” from Berlin, er, Brussels in this area is not a problem whatever ideologues may say. It secures hundreds of thousands of jobs and tax revenues.The proposed deal means business will be free to recruit essential immigrant labour on the basis of their skill and not where they come from.Choosing from a global, not just an EU, pool of talent is so, so helpful and will assist our international competitiveness hugely.But the one message ringing through my ears is, “Get on with it.”Regardless of whether a business is in Birmingham or Barcelona, Sunderland or Stuttgart, the wealth-creators of Europe, the payers of the tax that builds schools and hospitals, the job-providers just want their politicians to stop this rowing now.Stop the bullying, Berlin stop the rowing, Tories stop the naked, tribal, selfish manoeuvring, Labour — and just do it.One big caveat: You cannot expect anyone in our country — businesswoman or a guy on the line alike — to accept a deal that gives Jean-Claude Juncker’s lot the final say on when, indeed,we leave. Chief negotiator Michel Barnier and his team have bullied us enough.While there are a million dferent beliefs on what the majority of Brits voted for in the referendum, one thing is certain: They DID vote to leave.Giving the EU the final yes no on that is unacceptable and surely no deal is better than that.No deal means no £billion to the unelected, unaccountable Eurocrats. No deal means fewer jobs in troubled Germany and faltering France.Yes, it would be harder for UK business for sure. But not fatal. There would be a price to pay, but whoever said freedom does not come at a price There was one other thing businesses were clear on at my meetings last week.The quicker this country understands there is a greater threat to prosperity, jobs, tax revenues and a successful economy than Brexit, the better.A Corbyn government would turn this country into Venezuela in short order talent and capital would leave so quickly that John McDonnell would have nothing left punitively to tax.The message from small business is as clear as it is strong.The Conservatives, Liberals, big business and the establishment must stop obsessing about Brexit and focus on the greatest threat this country has faced for decades.And that is a bunch of extreme hard-Left business-haters who would ruin this great country and probably blame their abject failure on Brexit.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The British people will rightly expect a goodon that money.Yet, when it comes to taking back democratic control over our laws, the final terms are worse than membership of the EU.We would still be bound indefinitely by EU-imposed rules on customs, trade, employment, social policy and tax – with no say over those rules, and no ability to exit the regime.The government rightly resisted pressure to accept Free Movement of people from EU countries, to allow us to regain control over our immigration policy.But, the current deal leaves it open for the EU to refuse a permanent trade deal unless we cave in during the second phase of negotiations, after March.As for the dream of a global Britain trading more energetically from Asia to Latin America, the EU has tied our hands, hobbling those ambitions.Much has been made of the Northern Ireland Protocol. No-one wants to see ato the hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.Instead, the EU’s real game is to try to prise Northern Ireland away from Great Britain, aligning its laws with the EU – a direct threat to the integrity of the UK.Scenting weakness, the EU is now threatening to exclude Gibraltar from a future trade deal.We are being blackmailed and bullied into a flawed deal. The EU has used the negotiations to stle the opportunities and optimism that fired people up to vote Leave in .In truth, there are risks in any course of action we take now. But, by far the gravest is to succumb to the EU’s terms, stay tethered to Brussels, and accept a deal that prevents us from becoming masters of our own destiny.Over the long term, that would drain the strength of our economy, when Brexit should be a boost for workers and consumers. And those who voted Leave would feel cheated, shredding trust in our democracy.Of course, the EU were never going to welcome Brexit. Some sour grapes were inevitable. That’s why we worked hard to leave on positive terms, extending the arm of friendship.In , the EU has taken every concession and gesture of goodwill as a chance to try to bully and control us – at times treating our Prime Minister, and our country, with outright disdain.We need to be honest about the situation: there are risks in a No Deal scenario.But, they can be mitigated and managed by the government -it exercises grip and demonstrates political will. So, let us steel ourselves, and reject this miserly deal.We should make our best final offer to Brussels, then ready ourselves to leave the EU on  March - whatever their response.That way, we can deliver on the verdict of the people, and grasp the opportunities of Brexit.

I only want to be with her. I can never wait to see her.”Cue the nation emitting a collective swoon and ’Arry becoming odds-on favourite to take the jungle crown.“Aw, he’s sooooo lovely,” gushed one twentysomething TV commentator, asHarry had just bequeathed all his worldly possessions to help save an endangered species.Given the borderline hysterical response to this “man still loves we after  years” declaration, he might even be considered one himself.But is it really so unusual  To those dating in this Tinder-centric age where people start swiping right the second there’s a minor hiccup, perhaps. But to my generation, less so.Shortly after my Uncle Jack died in his early eighties, my Aunty Mabel announced that she wouldn’t be around for much longer because she couldn’t bear to be without him. Sure enough, she literally lost the will to live and died soon after.It was the same story with my godparents and, as a trainee reporter, I interviewed countless golden wedding coupleswho had endured all manner of marital bumps in the road but lasted the course.How many of today’s liaisons will reach that -year milestone When Harry and Sandra took their vows, they clearly both understood the now largely outdated concept that love is a decision, not just a feeling.In other words, there might have been plenty of niggles and quarrels along the waybut they pushed on through in the knowledge that reaching old age with your spouse and best friend by your side is one of le’s greatest pleasures.The shared experiences, the joy of shared memories, the private jokes, the non-awkward silences and the companionship — bliss.Interestingly, Harry and Sandra’s marital set-up is one that’s increasingly regarded as outdated in this supposedly “progressive” day and age — that of the man bringing home the bacon while the woman runs the house and does the lion’s share of parenting.Consequently, Harry, now , freely admits he can barely make a cup of tea because Sandra does everything for him.It wouldn’t be my, er, cup of tea, but it has worked for them and perhaps it’s because Harry clearly doesn’t view Sandra as “just a housewe”he sees her as the boss and someone whose input he values and respects.And therein lies the key to a happy marriage. It doesn’t matter what the dynamic is as long as each feels appreciated and respected in their chosen role.Harry is what many might consider to be an old-fashioned gentleman, when men were allowed to be one without fear of being branded patronising.He turned away from the female contestants while they were showering and, whenever he gets the chance, awards “the ladies” the rare camp comforts on offer instead of the men.A magnanimous gesture, I notice, that they all accept readily without a passing thought that it might be unfair to the male contestants in these times of supposed equality for both genders.Ashley Roberts danced her bobby socks off in the Lindy hop on Saturday’s Strictly and performed a crackingly good samba too.But she ended up in the bottom two.Why  Because the public never like what they think might be a foregone conclusion.And however much the show tries to dress her up as a plucky amateur, her previous dance experience makes it as implausible as putting Bear Grylls in the I’m A Celebrity “jungle” and seeing him scream at the sight of a cockroach.Remember that moment in Crocodile Dundee when a yob pulls a blade on Mick Dundee in New York and he responds by saying “That’s not a kne”– “that’s a kne”.Fast forward  years and consider the story of Alun Powell, of Newport, Gwent, who takes part in medieval role-playing contests as “Sir Fightalot”.A court heard that when he arrived home to find his father being plagued by a gang outside the house, he pulled a sword, axe and knuckleduster from the boot of his car and “took up a fighting stance”.The prosecution added: “They saw the weapons and got so frightened that they left as quickly as possible.”Job done. End of. Right Nope. Alun ended up in court, convicted of possessing bladed articles in public and given  hours of community service.Perhaps this is why more members of the public don’t get involved when they see trouble.Becausethey don’t have a weapon themselves, they could get hurt.Andthey do happen to have one in their house or car, and brandish it in self-defence, there’s every chance they’ll end up in court themselves while the troublemakers get away scot-free.Robert de Niro is the new face of Warburtons bread.It’s hard to choose my favourite movies starring this acting titan, but Midnight Bun would be top, followed by The Kingsmill Of Comedy and Jackie Brown Bread.Posh store Anthropologie has been ridiculed for selling a bunch of twigs for £.But is the laugh on them or the idiots who buy them In the words of the marvellous Harry Enfield, it must include “we saw you coming” tax.Following on from the debate on whether or not they should have built a ramp to rescue stranded penguins, the crew of BBC’s wildle series Dynasties are in the news again for helping a stricken lion cub.As a rule, those who film such programmes are discouraged from intervening in the events they are trying to capture on the basis that nature should be allowed to take its course.But the cub was shown collapsing and spasming after eating bait laced with poison by tribesmen who had lost their cattle to a lion a few days earlier.So perhaps the new “rule” could be that human intervention is allowed when it’s human intervention that caused the crisis in the first place So how come a -year-old Iranian man – pretending to be  – was blithely placed in a class full of GCSE pupils in Ipswich without so much as a routine dental check Education Secretary Damian Hinds has added to the curriculum certain feats he wants primary school children to achieve before they move up to secondary.He says pupils will be urged to climb trees, explore caves and watch the sun rise to help build character.A good idea, but how depressing that all the things most of us did as a matter of routine in our youth now have to be actively prescribed.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Heres the latest.While a number of politicians and celebrities have added their voice to growing calls for a second referendum, this has always been rejected by Downing Street.In November , Jo Johnson resigned as rail minister and said the deal was substantially worse than staying in the EU, and it was imperative we go back to the people and check they still want to leave.Upon resigning, Johnson demanded a second referendum.His decision to resign came after the failure of Brexit negotiations to achieve what had been promised.Theresa Mays official spokesman has said: The British people have voted to leave the EU and there is not going to be a second referendum under any circumstances.It could depend on how Brits perceive Parliamentary squabbles over Mrs Mays Chequers deal.Labour has been in a muddle over the issue too — with the leadership refusing to commit to a call for a second vote despite cries from centrist MPs and members.A sizeable section in the party want a second referendum and pressure is mounting on the left-wing leader.The GMB, one of the UKs biggest trade unions, called for a vote on the final Brexit deal.In September , Mayor of London Sadiq Khan dramatically called for another EU referendum — saying that people must be given the opportunity to reject Brexit.The Mayor of London, who is an avowed remainer, argued Britain is facing either a bad deal or “no deal” which he says will hit jobs and living standards.Referring to the worst case scenerios, Mr Khan said: “They are both incredibly risky and I don’t believe Theresa May has the mandate to gamble so flagrantly with the British economy and people’s livelihoods.”Shortly after Jo Johnsons resignation, Spanish prime minister Pedro Sanchez called for a second Brexit referendum accusing the UK government of “self absorption.”He told Politico: “If I was Theresa May, I would call a second referendum — no doubt.”Sanchez said that Britain leaving the European Union was “a great loss for both.”He added: “I hope it can be reconsidered in the future”.A number of EU leaders parroted their support for a second referendum at the end of September.Another big bump for the support for a Brexit referendum came after May brought her draft withdrawal agreement to Cabinet.It passed, but prompted multiple resignations, including Dominic Raab, Suella Braverman, Shailesh Vara and Esther McVey.It is unlikely the orce deal will make it through parliament, so supporters of a second vote may seek to capitalise on this.Labours official position is that it would vote against any deal struck by Theresa May with the aim of pushing for a General Election.Shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer said that a motion on the highly isive question that has dominated the event in Liverpool doesnt rule out Remain.He told Labours party conference: We want a General Election to sweep away this failed government.After the Peoples Vote rally in central London Starmer reaffirmed the party have also not ruled out calling for a second Brexit referendumthey couldnt force an election.Speaking on BBCs Andrew Marr Show, he said: “If there’s no deal brought back or the deal is voted down, then other options are on the table, one of which is a public vote.“And in that public vote no options are ruled out, including the option of remain.On November  former PM Tony Blair insisted Jeremy Corbyn is likely to start backing a second EU referendumin the near future.Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said it would be inevitable another EU referendum would be calledLabour are not able to force a general election.He told the BBC forcing an election would be very dficult andthat was not possible, Labour would push for another referendum.Odds were   that there would be one.Odds were shortening at BedFair with   that there would be a second vote.A poll carried out by NatCen and The UK in Changing Europe revealed  per cent of voters would now vote to remain in the EU, while  per cent would opt to leave.The author of the poll John Curtice urged caution over the finding.He said the interview  was skewed towards remain, and that some of the sht was among those who did not take part in the original Brexit referendum.On November  , it was reported that the majority of voters in all seats held by Labour support a second referendum on Brexit.The findings were according to an analysis released by the People’s Vote campaign from a YouGov poll of , people.The Prime Minister will now begin persuading MPs to back the deal in a Parliamentary vote in the second week of December.She has also written a rare open letter to the nation in a bit to win over public opinion.Butshe fails to secure the votes required then a second Brexit referendum could be on the table.The SNP have said they would back a so-called Peoples Vote and a number of Conservative MPs have also backed one.So there could be a majority in Parliament for it but a second referendum will not happen quickly and the first stage is for there to be an Act of Parliament.That will require the backing of a majority of MPs and it took seven months before Parliament signed off the previous referendum legislation in .Last time around there was a four-month period between the then Prime Minister David Cameron announcing the referendum in February , and the vote taking place on  June.But the Electoral Commission has said in future there should be at least a six-month gap to allow enough time to register campaigns and put counting officers in place.There is also the question of what to do about Article .Britain could vote to remain in the EU, but have already left by the time the vote was held.This could be avoidedthe EU agreed to extend the Article  deadline - but that would need to be unanimously agreed by all EU member states.Then there is the question of what to put on the ballot paper.If there are three questions - for example accept a negotiated Brexit deal stay in the EU or leave with no deal - then just  per cent could decide the winning option. The first referendum on EU membership took place in .Two-thirds of votersbacked the continued membership of the European Economic Community, which the UK had joined only two years before.Under Harold Wilsons leadership, the Labour Party was trying to present to the public a dferent version of EEC membership to get a

We have a very good draft.A number of ministries are looking at it. I know, certainly, that it will be published by the end of the year.”One senior Eurosceptic Tory stormed: “The lack of preparedness and incoherence is shown by the fact that at the th hour they are having to admit to the utter disarray they are in on immigration.“They are not going to be taking back control of our borders.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But No  has warned that the PM will not ditch the deal — and will keep pushing it through Parliament until it passes.One Cabinet minister branded No’s refusal to change course in the face of overwhelming odds as “extraordinary”, adding: “There is zero chance the deal will pass now”.And a former minister – who is remaining loyal to Mrs May - has calculated that the Government will lose by a devastating  votes.The senior Tory warned of “a bandwagon effect” that is pushing an ever larger coalition of Brexiteer and Remainer MPs to side against Mrs May for a myriad dferent reasons, dubbing it “madness”.Another Cabinet minister told The Sun: “Theresa is still being told she can win this by the people around her in No.“It’s terrible advice and she deserves better, because they are going to bring her down.”By Tuesday night, a total of  Tory MPs had publicly declared their opposition to the deal - struck in Brussels on Sunday after  months of torturous negotiation - with more known to also oppose it.Mrs May was dealt a fresh hammer blow when loyal former Cabinet minister Sir Michael Fallon branded it “doomed”.Given that her deal is most likely dead, our politicians must start properly planning for a clean break from the EU to ensure minimal disruption.Evidently, the bloc is unwilling to compromise.Spain have already threatened us over Gibraltar and the French with fishing.The Government should prepare to call a national emergency to ensure we are ready in four months,necessary, to leave on our own terms.It is not good enough for the PM to plough on with her bad deal, blindly believing that she will get it through Parliament. The odds are stacked against her.The Government must pull its finger out and prepare for a No Deal scenario.The ex-Defence Secretary - forced to resign a year ago for sexual inappropriateness - stunned No by dubbing the agreement “the worst of all worlds”.Sir Michael also became the first senior Tory to call for a delay to Brexit on March  next year so negotiations for a better deal can be extended.Ministers have begun privately working on options for a Plan B within their own factions, but there is no agreement among them on what it should be yet.Tory whips are instead warning backbench MPs that the PM will refuse to abandon her deal evenMPs do vote it down on December .No will instead plan to put it to Parliament a second and even a THIRD time until it passes.One MP said: “They’re trying to bring it back at least twice - possibly a third time – after renegotiations.“I think she needs to be gone after the first time it falls, but they’re trying to keep her in position.”On another tense day in British politics:Mrs May began her frantic nationwide tour of the UK on Tuesday with visits to Wales and Northern Ireland to try to sell her Brexit deal to the country ahead of the showdown vote.She will also go to Scotland on Wednesday to insist the agreement delivers for fishermen by taking back control of the UK’s waters.But ahead of the PM’s arrival in Belfast, DUP chief Ms Foster said her visit would be “a waste of time” as she won’t reopen the agreement for an Irish backstop that sees dferent regulations for Ulster and the rest of the UK.Hitting back, Mrs May insisted the deal “protects” the UK, adding: “A very clear message that we have got here in Northern Ireland but where as well is that people do not want toto uncertainty and ision”.Cabinet ministers remained loyal in public today.Health Secretary Matt Hancock insisted MPs “should vote for the deal” saying it wasn’t “just the Government’s position - it’s the right thing to do”.Askedhe could guarantee that no-one would diethere was a no-deal Brexit, Mr Hancock told the Commons Health Committee: “As my permanent secretary tells me, we shouldn’t use words like guarantee.“What we can say is that we are confident thateverybody does what they need to do then there will be the continuity of supply.”Brexiteers last night warned that the Treasury’s analysis of the deal should be discarded as “yet more Project Fear”.The Sun can reveal that four dferent scenarios will be modelled against a baseline of staying in the EU, and all four are expected to show growth will be lost because of the decision to leave.They are the PM’s Chequers plan to align regulations on goods with the EU, membership of the EEA, a looser Canada-style free trade deal and no deal at all.Leading Tory Brexiteer Steve Baker said: “The reputation of government economics is in the gutter. That must change.“It’s time for the Chancellor to publish all his assumptions and full model documentation so we can begin the process of recovery.”Meanwhile Home Secretary Sajid Javid on Tuesday night admitted there was “no guarantee” the UK would be given access to two critical EU-wide crime databases.He admitted the Political Declaration only laid out plans to cooperate on finding “approximate measures” to cooperate on crime fighting.Currently police chiefs can access the Schengen Information Systemand ECRIS, the European Criminal Records Information System to check suspects against a list of third country nationals.Police accesses SISII more than  million times last year.Mr Javid told MPs: “Within this document [the Political Declaration] it’s within scope but it’s not guaranteed.”The Home Secretary insisted “almost of all my counterparts” in the EU want to cooperate on security in “much the same way”.But Labour’s Stephen Doughty revealed the PM’s chief of staff admitted  to opposition MPs at a private briefing on Monday night it would be “very dficult” to maintain access to SISII.Mr Doughty said: “Gavin Barwell told us it’s going to be an even bigger challenge to stay connected to SISII than it was to join it in the first place.”Ministers are also on course for a fresh showdown with the House of Commons when it emerged Downing Street will not publish the full Brexit legal advice – giving MPs “full, reasoned position statement” instead.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

sweeping generalisations and is often criticised for inaccuracies, even outright hoods.How then should we react to the leader of the free world claiming the UK’s withdrawal agreement with the EU could mean that we would be “unable to trade” with the US This is a classic example of the need to take Donald Trump seriously, but not literally.There are no imaginable circumstances in which Britain will be blocked from trading with America.We can do so at present, even as full members of the EU.If we couldn’t, I must have imagined visiting the States and buying their products.Trade happens and will continue to do so, whatever arrangements the UK finally finds itself in.But President Trump’s intervention speaks to a deeper, more subtle truth.If the UK effectively remains in an EU customs union and without control over our regulatory system then it’s dficult to see how trade with the US will accelerate and flourish.The same goes with the rest of the non-EU world.The dficulty with Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement is that it substantially limits the capacity for the UK to strike its own trade deals.Indeed, it would make such deals almost impossible.Downing Street has hit back at this by pointing to wording in the agreement that states the UK will be entitled to reach arrangements with other countries.But this amounts to little more than a theoretical possibility given it is not made clear when,ever, we will finally be out of this “customs territory”.To grasp this problem, it is important to understand how trade negotiations work.Let’s say you and I sit round a table and go through all the things hindering trade between our two nations.Perhaps I am applying high tarfs on your wine and you are applying exorbitant tarfs on my cars.We negotiate, so more of my countrymen can drink your wine, and more of your citizens can drive my cars.To reach such accords, you need to be in full control of your own customs arrangements.If my starting point is that I can’t reduce the tarf on your wine because I’m locked into an agreement with the EU that fixes the tarf, my negotiations with you are unlikely to get off the ground.American wine, for instance, is subject to a tarf of either .p or p per ­bottle, depending on strength.A bottle of Jack Daniel’s is hit by a  per cent import tarf to the EU, while American cars are subject to a ten per cent import tarf.Meanwhile, the EU recently announced a plan to hit American motorcycles, such as Harley-Davidsons with a  per cent tarf — hugely pushing up the price.A larger part of the negotiation tends to focus on regulatory barriers to trade.Although tarfs on products mean higher prices in the shops, they do not necessarily prevent foreign prod­­ucts getting to the market.But dferences in regulation can have just this effect.If, to oversimply, all of your nails need, by law, to be in long and all of the nails in my country need to be in long, we won’t see much trade in nails between us — evenno tarfs are imposed.To improve our trading relations we need to look at whether we can agree to align some of our regulations, repeal some or respect each other’s regulatory standards.If we do not control our rules and cannot alter or abolish them, negotiations are pretty pointless.And not just with the US, but with other major economies, such as Australia and Japan.The UK faces a classic trade- off here.If what you prioritise above all  is to minimise any friction in trade between the UK and the EU, you will want to stay highly aligned with the EU’s regulations — and you may well conclude that it is easier to simply stay in the EU itself.In that case, you will also probably want the UK to join the euro, because having a dferent currency to France and Germany adds costs to our trade with them.Butyou are looking to the rest of the world, you may feel we should be able to strike a simple but comprehensive free trade deal with the EU.Trade across the Channel might not be as seamless as at present, but we would be free to strike deals to improve trade across the Atlantic and the Pacic.If Mrs May’s is the deal we are left with, those hoping for a global Britain post-Brexit will be deeply disappointed.Even a no-deal scenario would at least unshackle the UK from EU rules and provide more autonomy over our future trading relationships with the rest of the world.Trade with the EU is important to the UK, but it is declining.Over the next decade,  per cent of all global economic growth is predicted to come from outside the European Union.If you see Brexit as a historic opportunity to make Britain a global trading nation, you will have a lot of sympathy with President Trump’s sentiments.This might explain why so many see Mrs May’s proposals as the worst of both worlds.They surrender our seat at the EU table, without giving us the freedom to properly reach out across the seas.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

 years - compared towe stayed in the EU.But Brexiteers reacted immediately with fury, insisting that such economic forecasts are never to be trusted.Dominic Raab said it was a rehash of Project fear, and ex-Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith warned: At the end of the day, almost all financial forecasts are wrong.Ministers released a slew of documents today looking at dferent Brexit scenarios and what they mean for our economy.In hundreds of pages of economic analysis on our future, it showed:Today The Sun revealed that Mrs May could lose the vote by up to  votes.But Mrs May told MPs this lunchtime that her deal would NOT leave Britain worse off.She said during PMQs: Our deal is the best deal available for jobs and our economy, that allows us to honour the referendum and realise the opportunities of Brexit.This analysis does not show that we will be poorer in the future than we are today, no it doesnt, it shows we will be better off with this deal.Labour boss Jeremy Corbyn said because it was the only deal on the cards by definition its also the worst deal.He said the analysis was meaningless because there isnt a proper deal on our future yet - it was just a wishlist.The Bank of England will be publishing its own analysis of the deal in future.But theres no modelling of how ambitious free trade deals would affect these stats.BRITAIN wont be able to strike ambitious trade deals under Theresa Mays Brexit plans, the Governments own analysis has admited.According to documents released earlier on the economics of possible Brexit deals, it says its not able to see what happens when tarrfs would be reduced in the event of signing a deep trade relationship with a country like the US or china.The analysis looks at four main scenarios - Mrs Mays plan, no deal, a free trade agreement with the EU, a Norway-style scenario.This morning a gloomy Philip Hammond claimed that Brexit would make Britain poorer as a country - and that staying in the EU would give us the best economic advantage.If you look at this purely from the economic point of view, there will be a cost to leaving the EU because there will be impediments to trade,” he told Radio .He warned that Mrs Mays deal was better than a No Deal Brexit and the PMs deal would deliver a Leave outcome with close to the economic benefits of Remain.Speaking to the BBC he said: Im not trying to scare anybody, I reject the term scare mongering.We know there would be signicant delays at channel ports, checks would have to be introduced.The dreary Chancellor said it was the only way to deliver Brexit while protecting our economy.Butthe deal doesnt get through Parliament, he refused to confirm what would happen - only saying the Cabinet would decide how best to proceed.He refused to rule out membership of the European Free Trade Associationafter The Sun reported Michael Gove and Amber Rudd were teaming up for the UK to join itthe PMs deal was thrown out.This morning Norways Prime Minister said they could be willing to lend support for the bid, saying:that is what they really want, we will find solutions in the future.Today a damning report from the Commons Public Accounts Committee said there was a real risk of major disruption at UK portsthere was no deal signed.MPs are set to vote on the deal on December , after an expected head-to-head debate with Jeremy Corbyn.A fresh poll for the Daily Mail showed most voters backed her plan as the best offer for the UK.Although a whopping  per cent of people opposed the deal, in a boost for the PM,  per cent said the EU wouldnt make further concessions to us, and only a quarter said booting her out would help the deal.But when asked whether the deal is better than Remaining in the bloc, most voters say Remaining would be the better option.The Prime Minister continues her tour of the UK today with a trip to Scotland to try and sell her deal.She will insist she was robust in defending UK fishing in Brexit talks, and will speak to factory workers in Glasgow.And ministers also face a fresh battle on their hands over the legal advice given to the Cabinet about Mrs Mays deal.A vote in Parliament forced them to publish the advice, but ministers are refusing to put out all of it.Mr Hammond said today it would be impossible for the government to all such material went public - and hinted that only some of it will go out.Furious MPs are set to raise the issue in the Commons later.She will add: So we will be out of the Common Agricultural Policy, which has failed our farmers, and out of the Common Fisheries Policy, which has so tragically failed Scotlands coastal communities.But Tory MPs say access to UK waters will be used as a bargaining chip to seal a good post-Brexit trade deal."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000431859778.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"brits rush eu passports brexit day","story":"Applications for EU passports are soaring as Brits try to get alternative ones ahead of  Britain leaving the EU on March  .Some countries had a spike immediately after the referendum in , but since then applications have continued to rise as Brits try to secure freedom to travel and work in countries across the bloc after weve left.Theresa May has confirmed that freedom of movement will end when we leave, but Ireland, Sweden and Spain have all reported huge hikes in the Brits seeking to get their hands on their own passports so they can continue to do so.Sweden has a record , applications last year, and , this year so far.Ireland have had , a MONTH from Brits up to the end of December.Thats around , more a month than last year.Theres also been a sharp rise in Northern Irish citizens applying for Irish passports too -

so as long as you have Italian blood you could be elligible to get a passport.Germany: If your family were stripped of German passports during the Nazi era you may have a right to re-claim German citizenship. But there are strict rules about dual nationality. This was popular for Brits last year, with a huge jump in applications.France: Anyone who has lived in France continunually for five years ofr more to apply.Malta and Cyprus: If you have a grandparent from there you could be elligible.

I was really shell-shocked.”It seems like such a simple admission. But the reality is that with most celebrities, from the Kardashians to the Beckhams, projecting an unfeasibly perfect image of parenthood as part of their brand, many expectant mums think a new baby is going to be a walk in the park.The reality for most of us really couldn’t be further from the truth.Paloma also talked about the dficulty of balancing being a new mother with having a career.“I found it very dficult, the pull between wanting to be the greatest mother ever but also trying to sustain an inherently selfish career,” she said.The transition from being a woman with a career and all the time in the world to a mother wanting to continue working is no easy feat.There’s a period of adjustment and, often, the road is rocky. So here’s the reality, for what it’s worth.In my experience, EVERY woman who is a parent finds motherhood hard at some point or ­another, but especially at the beginning. And the women who seem to be sailing through it are often putting on a brave face, partly because they feel under pressure to do so.Often, people’s public portrayal of their le, including motherhood, is heavily edited, airbrushed and ­censored.The pressure on women for everything, including motherhood, to be “perfect” is clear.And,that isn’t your experience, with everyone  seemingly acing it, the pressure is on to pretend that it is.The vicious cycle is born. So it’s brave of Paloma to talk about her experience out loud.Given that every mum in the history of the universe has felt this way about motherhood at one time or another, we should be more honest about admitting it to be true.Modern pressures are making it so dficult I have to say I’m so glad I’m not raising a child today.The internet had still not been invented. The Twitter and Instagram inventors had probably not even been born.When I was growing up the only “influencers” in my le were my mum and dad.We ate as a family every night and there were three channels on the TV that all stopped airing by midnight. You had to make your own entertainment.Nowadays you can’t move for influencers on YouTube, Instagram and Twitter telling your kids how they should look or feel — and ­promoting lestyles that are simply unattainable.No wonder there has been such a dramatic rise in young people self-harming and taking anti- depressants. Too many influencers, who are hashtag “blessed”, don’t talk about the dficult stuff.Paloma, by the way, is raising her child as “gender neutral” — a ­decision that seems to be another indication of the pressures that ­people are under to do the right thing by their children.Too much choice and too much pressure to do the right thing and be the perfect parent can lead to paranoia.The best advice I could give a parent now that my own two are  and  is to find your own path.Don’t look too hard at what everyone  is doing.Don’t compare yourself to any other mothers, especially not celebrities with a team of personal trainers and chefs, and who snap back into shape two weeks after giving birth.Instead of aiming for perfect, just try to do your best.Listen, understand and give your child the one thing that really does matter: Self-esteem.Talk to other women, and be honest, evenyou are finding it hard. Because it IS bloody hard.So good for Paloma for being honest and fighting the tide of propaganda about motherhood.Because being honest makes it easier for other women who might be struggling.ISN’T it incredible to think that a hundred years ago, on November , , women were allowed to stand for parliament in the UK for the very first time Fast forward to the  General Election when  female MPs were elected.Yes, that’s in relation to  male MPs, so we still have a way to go – but look how far we have come.I know I am biased, but women are such a brilliant parliamentary asset.Look at all the things they bring to the table and to the conversation.Women are great listeners, good mediators, brilliant diplomats and inspiring promoters of family and equal rights. Oh, and we are resilient.Just look at Theresa May who, at a time when most men would be hiding under the duvet and emitting a high-pitched wailing noise, is rising to the unbelievable challenges being thrown at her by the Brexit process – and enjoying beans on toast with her husband Philip in the evening.Compare her to a politician such as Jacob Rees-Mogg who is doing everything he possibly can to promote himself and his political ambitions – rather than focusing on what the country needs.The PM is the living embodiment of resilience – a tough old bird indeed.ANYONE in a long-term marriage should take note of Dolly Parton’s insights on what makes her -year union work.“When people ask me what’s the key to my long marriage and lasting love, I always say, ‘Stay gone’,” the singer, reveals. “I travel a lot, but we really enjoy each other when we’re together and the little things we do.”Her husband Carl doesn’t like to appear in public or walk the red carpet – so she leaves him at home.Instead of glamorous date nights, they take trips in a “little camper”, go on picnics and eat at local restaurants, including a drive-thru McDonald’s.But eventhey are having a quiet night in, she says she always makes sure she is “fixed up for him because I don’t believe in going home and being a slouch”.You’ve got to love Dolly.NOT many people can ooze class, charm and elegance with their leg raised higher than their head – at the age of .Butthere’s one woman who can, it’s the glorious Darcey Bussell, who must be one of the nicest, and classiest, women in showbiz today.Goldman was one of the first corporate firms to introduce “lactation rooms” for women to express milk and it also runs free prenatal fitness classes at its office gym.It also has on-site day care where employees’ children are cared for  days per year for free.All of which is great – and let’s hope more companies follow suit for new parents.Mind you, it’s not like the need for childcare ever really stops – I still need an emergency nanny occasionally when my -year-old daughter loses her keys or my -year-old son locks himself out.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Were waiting to seethe new deal goes through or not.She continued: If that doesnt go through, it will be No Deal because there wont be enough time to sort another one out.We started buying extra of things we would usually buy. When we are shopping we buy beans for now and beans for later, rice for now and rice for later. There are a few things we wouldnt usually buy, like sources of vegetarian protein and powdered milk.Nevine, who home schools the couples children, added: Weve got baked beans, chickpeas, couscous, pasta - weve got things like tea, coffee, Ovaltine... We also bought Marmite so we can have some flavour.While the stockpiling measures may seem extreme to some, Nevine insists the family are not going over the top, adding: Weve got enough to get us through the first couple of monthsthere is No Deal.The Mann familys cupboards are already stocked with  tins of beans,  cans of tuna, large tubs of mayonnaise, eight cans of chopped tomatoes and four packets of passata.Nevine added: Its not about being able to live comfortably, its about being able to survive.The familys stockpiling comes after industry leaders revealed food warehouses are now fully stocked for the next six months after an unprecedented rush in the days following the publication of Theresa May’s draft Brexit deal.The Food Storage and Distribution Federation warned that Britain isn’t set up for stockpiling food but storage space is now fully reserved from January to April - usually the quietest time of the year.FSDF boss Shane Brennan told the : “It’s a problem, because food is manufactured or stored on a just-in-time basis, and the system isn’t built for stockpiling.“But because of Brexit, every business that wants to guarantee its supply into UK shelves is looking for additional warehouse space right now.”On December , MPs will vote on the withdrawal agreement that was approved by EU leaders on November , .Parliament has demanded that the Brexit treaty can only be ratied by the Government after it has been “approved by a resolution of the House of Commons on a motion moved by a minister of the crown”.The vote will be a straight yes no format in a bid to make a decisive and unequivocal decision on the PMs deal.But the outlook for the vote isnt positive as Theresa May has already had two ministers resign over the deal and her own Brexit Secretary, Dominic Raab, also quit as the draft deal was presented to Parliament.Labour and factions within her own party have declared their intention to vote against it."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT0004523959291.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"uk weather forecast today maps storm diana latest","story":"The ferocious storm has left hundreds of homes without power after hitting Ireland and the west coast of England and Wales this morning.The mph winds cut off electricity to  homes in Truro, Cornwall and led to scores of flights from Dublin and Cork airports to be cancelled.A Yellow wind warning is in place for Wales and all parts of England barring the South East, with danger to le threats from tomorrow.The Met Office warns of flying debris, falling trees, large waves and debris being thrown onto seafronts and coastal roads.Warnings are in place from am on Wednesday until pm on Thursday with as much as two inches of rain brought in on the winds.The Met Office has issued Yellow Weather warnings across Devon and Cornwall, Somerset and West Wales for today.Cork airport has urged passengers to check with their airlines as several flights are expected to be cancelled today.Kerry and Waterford could also be affected as the south coast is pummelled with the winds.An emergency operation was launched after a man was spotted swimming in the towering seas in Penzance.Team members from National Coastwatch hauled him into a leboat after someone had spotted him in the choppy waters.It will be a very windy day for all with gales or severe gales, especially in the north and west, according to forecasters.The Met Office say rain is likely for most places, with the heaviest showers over Scotland and Northern Ireland.Diana is expected to make landfall in just hours along the west coast of Britain from Cornwall to the Shetland Islands.Switchcraft finds the best deal for you - and continues to switch you on to cheaper deals, so you never have to do it yourself.£ cashback is paid into your bank account within  months of completing the switch.

The Labour leader demanded the Prime Minister practice what she preached as he slammed her plan to leave the EU. Mr Corbyn highlighted Mrs Mays decision to keep legal advice on her deal secret - defying the orders of Parliament. The Prime Minister will publish a summary, but says it is vital not to reveal full advice from the attorney general. Speaking at Prime Ministers Questions, however, Mr Corbyn revealed Mrs May had herself demanded almost precisely what Labour wants now.  Labours leader said Theresa May wrote to then-PM Gordon Brown in , while shadow Leader of the Commons, to demand legal advice on the Iraq War. Mr Corbyn told MPs: The government today says it will ignore the sovereign will of Parliament. In  the Prime Minister wrote to the the-Prime Minister saying the legal advice in the Iraq War should have been published in full to Cabinet and MPs. So why doesnt the Prime Minister practice what she preached  It came as the government revealed economic analysis confirming Britain will be worse off under all forms of Brexit compared to staying in the EU. And the two party leaders exchanged a stream of sharp zingers ahead of a potential TV debate.  Jeremy Corbyn mocked her claims about her deal - which faces a crushing defeat in Parliament on December . Its not hard to be the best dealits the only deal, he said. By definition, its also the worst deal! He added: MPs are queuing up not to back her plan. Shes gone from guaranteeing frictionless trade to offering friction, and less trade! The Prime Minister insisted her deal was an ambitious, broad, deep and flexible partnership. She snapped: What does Labour have to offer  Six bullet points. My weekend shopping list is longer than that!  But her plea backfired when she said: Let me tell him whos backing my plan - farmers in Wales, fishermen in Scotland.. The comment about Scottish fishermen prompted a loud backlash in the Commons chamber. And Farmers’ Union of Wales President Glyn Roberts warned yesterday that Mrs Mays plan was ambiguous, adding: We really need assurances from the UK Government. The Prime Minister said attorney general Geoffrey Cox will brief Parliament, but the advice any client received from their lawyer is privileged. Thats the same for government.  Yet Labours leader said MPs need to see that advice warts and all. EU leaders agreed Mrs Mays deal in  minutes at a Brussels summit on Sunday. But more than  Tory or DUP MPs have indicated they are prepared to vote against it on December  - enough to inflict a crushing defeat. They are angry at plans for a backstopthat would keep the UK under EU customs rules and introduce checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Mr Corbyn said: This is the most shambolic government in living memory. Asking parliament to vote on the basis of a -page wish list without even seeing the full legal advice. The Brexit deal agreed by Theresa May and the EU covers two areas: the Withdrawal Agreement, covering the UKs exit from the EU, and the Political Declaration on a Future Framework, which sets out the relationship with the EU after Britain leaves. Key details on the Brexit deal include: . The Withdrawal AgreementThe transition period can be extended until  - after the next election Goods face being checked between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK A backstop could extend EU customs rules UK-wide - and wed need Brussels permission to quit European courts will still have a big hold on the UK. The Future FrameworkComprehensive arrangements that will create a free trade area - not exactly the frictionless trade hoped for Possible EU access to British fishing waters We would remain tied to European courts Wed respect human rights laws Visas needed for long term trips to the EU It has built in vagueness - kicking the can down the road for further negotiationsRead about the deal in more depth here. Its now clear Parliament will not back this plan. Isnt it time for her to accept that reality and make way for an alternative plan that will work for the whole country. The letter Mrs May sent in  was a dossier of  cases that claimed to show Labours government had breached the Ministerial Code. One item in the dossier by Mrs May said: It emerged in April  that Mr Blair did not tell his Cabinet about crucial legal advice on Iraq... It was never shown to Cabinet or MPs, as Mr Blair should have under the Ministerial Code. Mrs May hit back today by highlighting John McDonnells claim that a second Brexit referendum might be an option we seize upon. She said of Labour: They want to cause chaos, frustrate Brexit, overturn the will of the British people. And that would be a betrayal of the many by the few.

Worryingly, one in ten felt their parents preferred going on their phones than talking to them and many admitted to hiding their handsets in a bid to get attention. Parenting expert Susan Atkins said: I am delighted to see Frankie  Bennys are leading the way by banning screens at the table.

The sporting legend lived in the Art Deco property for many years with his we Anne before he died aged  in December . It stands proudly on Penarths clftop in the vale of Glamorgan, Wales and the four-bed detatched house is described as unique and characterful but needs considerable upgrading. The Rhondda-born winger was a member of the celebrated team which beat the All Blacks in  as well as making  appearances for Cardf RFC. Gareth also toured South Africa as part of the  British Lions team, making three appearances, reports Wales Online.  Built in the s, this period property called Winton bares all the hallmarks of the distinct and yet scarce Art Deco style. It has four reception rooms, four bedrooms, two ensuites and a family bathroom. The white washed walls, the soft curves, the large bay windows, and the flat roof are all trademarks of this popular architecture and design. According to the Architectural Digest, Art Deco was most popular during the s to the s and a style that brought glamour, luxury, order and symmetry to the design of a property inside and out, epitomised by rich colours, strong shapes, bold geometry and decadent detailing.   Estate agent David Baker is now selling the property again, after having sold it to Gareth and Anne in . He says: It is a unique and genuinely magical property, it has a very comfortable and relaxed atmosphere inside and will make a magnicent home. Approaching the grand old lady through double gates, the location next to Penarths clf walk path could not be more ideal for stunning sea views across the Bristol Channel to England in the distance. The private and secluded home is set within a large garden that includes answimming pool, which has gently curved ends that echo the distinctive curved bays of the house. And the circular contours dont stop there.   Entering the home via a hallway with a curved frontage, you are greeted by a sweeping staircase.Even the distinctive fireplace in the main reception room is a cool collection of curves, mirroring the vast bay window that is the standout Art Deco interior designfeature of this room. The main lounge is virtually open-plan to a formal dining room, which makes this space potentially the hub of the party in this house that is perfect for entertaining.  Butyou think this room is substantial, its likely you will be impressed by the vast kitchen diner. Featuring the larger of the two lower bay windows this room is flooded with light and still enjoys the retro red kitchen that was the height of luxury and sophistication back in the s. The potential to make this room the heart-of-the-home again is obvious as its spacious enough to accommodate cooking, eating and lounging, looking out at the sea views beyond. This ground floor also has a separate sitting room with sea viewsand the perfect spot to get away from any noise and rumpus in the other rooms.   Theres also a study, a cloakroom and a utility room that completes the rooms on offer downstairs. Up the curved staircase reveals surely one of the best master bedrooms and ensuites in the area. From this elevated position, it is easy to watch the sea world go by on the Bristol Channel directly from your pillow via a set of double doors and a substantial balcony. Large enough to host a small dinner party, the balcony makes the most of this sunny spot as well as the waterside views.

Machines at a number of UK branches were swabbed and it was reportedly found they all had colorms - bacteria present in animal and human excrement. McDonalds customers often place their orders using touchscreens at the fast food restaurants, before heading over to the counter to collect their food. But a probe claims a number of bacteria were found on all the screens tested, used by thousands of customers every day.  London politan Universitys school of human sciences and s study says they took swabs from eight McDonalds restaurants, including six in London and two in Birmingham. Listeria bacteria was allegedly discovered in Oxford Street and Holloway Road restaurants - causing listeriosis which can lead to miscarriages and stillbirths in pregnant women. Meanwhile three quarters of the screens tested showed up traces of proteus bacteria which can be found in human and animal faeces, the study claims And a touchscreen at one venue was said to be found to have staphylococcus, a bacteria which can cause blood poisoning and toxic shock syndrome. McDonalds - which has , McDonalds restaurants across the UK - says its screens are cleaned regularly throughout the day.  It starts around people’s noses, which they can touch then transfer it to the touchscreen. Klebsiella bacteria was also allegedly detected, which an cause painful urinary tract infections, septicaemia, diarrhoea and even pneumonia. London politan Universitys Senior lecturer in microbiology, Dr Paul Matawele, told : We were all surprised how much gut and faecal bacteria there was on the touchscreen machines. Touchscreen technology is being used more and more in our daily lives but these results show people should not eat food straight after touching them, they are unhygienic and can spread disease. These bacteria can be on touchscreen machines for days on end.  The restaurants tested were Oxford Circus, Holloway Road, Oxford Street, Kensington High Street, Seven Sisters Road and Bethnal Green in London, and Ramp and Pigeon Park in Birmingham. However as only eight restaurants were tested and, the results do not necessarily represent all branches. McDonalds also insist that staff regularly clean the screens with disinfectant however Dr Matawele says it is not enough as the germs remain their for days at a time. A McDonald’s spokesman said: “Our self-order screens are cleaned frequently throughout the day with a sanitiser solution. All of our restaurants also provide facilities for customers to wash their hands before eating.” "},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle best princess weve","story":"NewsopinionMeghan Markle is the best princess weve ever had - dont criticise, applaud herWhat use is another mindless clothes horse ShareCommentsByFleet Street FoxColumnist:,  NOV Newsopinion\"Get Royal Family updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe Brothers Grimm told us that to be a princess you must be virginal, pretty, and have a bottom sensitive enough to feel a pea through  feather mattresses.None of the fairytales mention a orced black American.

If you believe the courtiers, Meghan is every negative clicheacute you can think of - the pushy American, the dficult orceacutee, the angry black woman, the uppity pleb, the Hollywood a. She doesnt understand the Royal rules, is a common refrain from anonymous sources, who go on to criticise the fact she wears trousers, black tuxedos, and has a distressing habit of not wearing a hat when the Queen is wearing a hat.Its almost like she didnt grow up PLANNING to be a princess, isnt it  If we take a cue from Wallis Simpson as the only previous American orceacutee to marry a Royal, it wont be long before someone suggests the new bride isnt even a female. There were long-whispered claims Wallis was a he, that she engaged in sado-masochistic sexual practices, that she had used her wiles to entice Edward VIII from his duty. So it cant be long before somebody - probably another Markle, considering their back catalogue - claims that Meghan once owned a pair of furry handcuffs and has Harry under her thumb. It all feeds into the narrative of there being a right sort of woman, and a wrong sort. The same happened with Princess Diana and Sarah Ferguson, with reams of coverage about their friendship, hen nights, falling-outs and, now, the eyebrow-raising living arrangements Sarah has with her ex-husband the Duke of York. But Sarah is seen as a harmless clown whos a bit of an embarrassment. Meghan is regarded more like Diana in her final years - so unprincess-like that shes a threat to the monarchy itself.   The best advice ever given to me was to judge people by what theyve done, not what is said. So lets look at Meghans achievements: . Years of hard work to achieve success in dficult industry . Financial independence . Survived a mostly-appalling family . Mostnot all of the in-laws seem to like her . Impressed someone who had his pick of the entire worlds female population . A clap less mental than Kates  On top of that shes privately visited the Grenfell Tower survivors, helped them raise more than pound, with sales of a charity cookbook, and just five months after marrying conducted herself on a two-week Royal tour of the South Pacic with grace and aplomb.

Katrina Farnell rushed her son Sheldon Gary Farnell to Sunderland Royal Hospital on Friday, November , where he spent the next two days being treated for what she believed was a serious viral infection. The -year-old and her grieving family said Sheldon was discharged on Sunday morning - hours before blood results came back showing something wasnt right. Sheldons family said that doctors failed to get in touch with them, after receiving the blood tests, to get him re-admitted to hospital. They said they were told by the hospital that a registrar had tried to contact them at pm on Sunday night with the blood tests results but they only had Rachels old mobile number. The family said they were told that the registrar suggested calling the police, in order to get Sheldon re-admitted to hospital, but the doctor said no as he didnt want to scare them.But by the early hours of Monday morning Sheldons condition had rapidly deteriorated. Sheldon was unable to stand, he was dizzy, he was suffering from sickness and diarrhoea and had pain all over his body. Katrina rushed him back to hospital, where he was put on le support, but tragically Sheldon died in the arms of his family on Monday morning. The family said that they were told Sheldon died due to suspected sepsis from a viral infection. Sheldons mother Katrina said she blames Sunderland Royal Hospital for his death. She said: They should have saved him. If they had given us his blood test results in an hour like they said he would still be here.My little boy died. They couldnt care less. They gave us  hope that he was okay.  Doctors and nurses are meant to help people not fob them off. He was in so much pain.They didnt do enough. They came in on Sunday morning to say he had a viral infection, gave him an iron infusion and said we could take him home, and to give him CalpolI thought he needed it. I asked them to check his back again. A doctor came in touched his back and said it was okay. I was constantly questioning them about everything I thought was wrong. He was talking rubbish, he was shaking and his arms and face were swollen.I asked them to check the needle in his foot because he said it hurt and the nurse said it doesnt hurt once its in but Sheldon was crying. I knew he wasnt well. I didnt want to go. They shouldnt have let him go.I feel failed by the hospital. They practically let my baby boy die.  Katrina said she will fight to get justice for her son.She said: Sheldon was my le, he was my world. I should have been spending money to give him a good Christmas but now I will be spending on a funeral. It is just neglect. All I can do is to get justice for him now. He could still be herethey had done their jobs properly. I feel like they didnt take me seriously. I am a young mum and I felt fobbed off.Whenever my mum was in the room they would address her, not me, asshe was his mum. The only people who I have respect for were the people who looked after us after Sheldon was gone. They let us sit with him, hold him, gave us tea. They were really good. Sheldons grandfather Gary Farnell, , a carer for his we Nicola, added: I turned to the doctor and said I blame you for my grandsons death. It is just sheer negligence. Sunderland Royal Hospital have a lot to answer for. His grandmother Nicola Farnell, , who Sheldon would lovingly call Mommor, said: Sheldon was a very fun, loving, caring, joyful little boy. He went on le support and his heart just stopped and they tried to get him back. They were doing heart massages and his pulse was so slow and then it stopped again. Katrina just said mam he’s gone - and he died in our arms.  The close-knit family have gathered at Gary and Nicola’s home in Houghton-le-Spring, Sunderland, where Katrina lived with Sheldon, to support each other and grieve. Sheldon will be missed by all who knew him including his best friends Jack, nine, and Olly, four, who are the children of Katrina’s partner Holly Keegan. Concerning blood results came back after Sheldon, who attended Nesham Nursery in Houghton, was discharged. Gary said the family are now demanding answers from hospital bosses over what happened. He said: He should never have been sent home at least until they got them blood tests. We’ve lost our beautul grandson. He was the star of our lives.  We’re just broken hearted all of us - he just made everyone laugh. An inquest to determine the cause of Sheldon’s death will be opened in due course. Ian Martin, Medical Director at City Hospitals Sunderland NHS Foundation Trust said: We offer our heartfelt condolences to Sheldon’s family for their tragic loss and are offering all the support we can to his loved ones at this very sad and dficult time. Due to patient confidentiality, we are unable to discuss details of Sheldon’s treatment, however we can confirm that we have already started our robust internal review process so that we can fully understand the circumstances around his care. As with any unexpected death, the coroner will also be undertaking a full and thorough investigation and we are offering our full co-operation and support of this process.

Shanita, from Ipswich, Suffolk, says Sonia was always jealous of her relationship with Pete but she couldnt figure out what the issue was. She was also really touchy-feely with Pete.

Jackie Wilding, , suffers from a number of conditions, including fibromyalgia, and says shes been left suicidal over money worries due to the new benefit system. The grandmother says shes forced to rely on the system after her husband of  years developed Alzheimers disease and had to go into a care home.Jackie has little left to live on after paying her rent and transport to visit her husband Mick, , reports Grimsby Live. Jackie, from Laceby, North East Lincolnshire, is struggling financially as she is no longer able to include her husband in her claim and lost another source of income from his pension. She now also has to contribute to costs of his care. Because of her chronic pain, Jackie normally has to take a taxi to the care home because there is no bus service that travels along that route from her home in Grimsby. This means that her biggest weekly expenditure is simply going to see and care for him. She has described Universal Credit as pure frustration and says that the system has completely broken her mentally and has started counselling to help her cope with the pressures she faces. Jackie said: My problems with Universal Credit all began in February after my husband Mick had to go into a care home due to his dementia.He had begun to get quite manic because of his condition, and he has deteriorated so much over the past few months, that six weeks ago he stopped walking altogether.  Because of this I had to go onto Universal Credit as my circumstances changed, after being on the old employment and support allowance due to my disabilities. At first there was a y wait to get my first claim, and then my initial payment was late and it was a major struggle to have my payments back-dated. I know that I have lost out on at least two weeks of my claim. Since then it has been a struggle just to get back to square one. I have put in appeals about my claim, but the process is so drawn out it has just drained the le out of me, I get so worked up sometimes that I just sit in the living room and cry. Having to take  dferent pills to combat the pain she suffers with on a daily basis, the grandmother says that she suffered a big hit after attending a fit for work assessment, where she claims the administrator of the assessment failed to note the many ailments that she has.  Jackie says that she has spent days in tears as result of the money troubles that she now faces, claiming to have even contemplated taking her own le, but the thought of what it would do to her family has always stopped her from going that far. She has also now been forced to sell items from her home in order to just get by. Jackie said: If Mick was able to see the state that I am in he would be absolutely livid. He would never stand for me being brought to the brink by this benefit system, but thenhe was here with me then the problem wouldnt exist. My daughter has been helping me to sell some of the Disney ornaments that I have at home in order to just get by and help to cover some of Micks care costs, because as his condition gets worse, I have to contribute more and more. If I could work then I would, but due to my disabilities I can often find it a big effort just to move around my house, and I regularly have muscle spasms that are so painful that Id rather give birth again than go through them.  I have tried to put on a brave face for my friends, and some of them have been so lovely in offering to give me some money, but to be honest that just makes me feel even worse, because it is like I am some charity case or a burden. All I need is enough money to live and care for my husband, but I am just not getting it. What pains me as well is the thought that I am not the only person who is going through this, I imagine there are thousands of others in the area who are feeling the way that I do, but they dont have the support that I have. Something needs to be done to recty this cruel system, because it is hurting people and will continue to hurt people unless we speak out and call for change. A Department of Work and Pensions spokesperson: “While most claimants are comfortable managing their money, we understand that situations arise which can cause financial dficulties. “That’s why we have a system of advance payments and budgeting support in place for anyone who needs extra help”.

The US Drug Enforcement Administration and local marines finally recaptured the -year-old crime lord, who twice escaped from prison, in his native Mexico in . But now – while El Chapo is standing trial in New York and allegations surface that he bribed Mexico City’s chief of police – authorities have discovered that another, even more powerful, kingpin was the true mastermind behind the Sinaloa cartel. It now appears that El Chapo was something of a public face, the poster boy for the world’s most feared drugs cartel. The real leader of the trafficking operation is El Chapo’s former partner, -year-old Ismael Zambada, known as El Mayo. For, despite El Chapo’s incarceration, analysts have seen an increase in the cartel’s shipments to the States, including the highly addictive, often fatal, drug fentanyl.  The bloodshed has also escalated under El Mayo’s command. Murders in Mexico rose % in the first half of this year, to ,, up from , in the same period in . Authorities have attributed the rise in deaths to battles between the rival Jalisco New Generation drugs cartel and El Mayo’s organisation, for control of trafficking routes from Mexico’s west coast to America. But while Sinaloa’s activity has escalated under El Mayo’s reign, he remains a ghost. Whereas El Chapo’s love of the limelight and lavish lestyle eventually led to his demise, El Mayo, a former poppy field worker, has stayed below the radar. He tops the DEA’s list of the world’s most wanted criminals, with a poundmillion bounty on his head, but the multibillionaire has never been in prison, despite more than  years of trafficking. Former chief of operations at the DEA, Jack Riley, who captured El Chapo, says he has no doubt who Sinaloa’s real boss is. He says: “Mayo is the most powerful drug trafficker. I even think we have underestimated his influence and power in controlling the US drug market.”  Thousands of Mexican marines, police and DEA agents – all supported by drones and high-tech surveillance – have searched for El Mayo for more than  decades. But he is still the most elusive fugitive on the planet. To evade capture, he has had plastic surgery, wears a range of disguises, and never sleeps in the same place twice. He remains in constant movement, especially in the mountainous region shared by the states of Durango, Sinaloa and Chihuahua, in northwest Mexico. The area is known as the Golden Triangle, thanks to its abundance of poppies and marijuana.   But the biggest weapons in El Mayo’s evasion arsenal are the hundreds of officials he pays off. They, according to El Chapo’s defence team, stretch to the very highest office in Mexico, with El Mayo allegedly paying pound.million to President Enrique Pena Nieto, who has denied the allegation. El Chapo’s defence lawyer, Jeffrey Lichtman, told jurors: “He’s [Guzman] blamed for being the leader, while the real leaders are living freely and openly in Mexico.”In truth, he controlled nothing. Mayo Zambada did. Mayo Zambada kept paying the Mexican government, president after president, two in a row – and somehow he remains free. And who is the one that’s constantly being hunted down  It’s Guzman.   “[Government officials] were paid off to leave Zambada alone.” Former Mexican president Felipe Calderon, who preceded Neito, has always denied taking cartel money. El Mayo started working with a cartel based in Juarez, on the Mexico-US border, in the s and s. When Juarez’s leader, Amado Carrillo Fuentes, died in  after botched plastic surgery to change his face, the cartel eventually split into two factions. One gang was based in Tijuana, on the US border, and the other, set up largely by El Mayo and El Chapo, was in Sinaloa, further south. When the Tijuana cartel began to decline, and the pair took advantage. They set out to expand their trafficking routes to the US and Europe, as they controlled much of the heroin production and shipment in Mexico. The Sinaloa cartel went on to build a poundbillion-a-year international cocaine, heroin and human-trafficking empire. El Mayo’s strength was his ability to quickly adapt to customers’ demands.   And, as the cash poured in, his army of highly educated money men laundered their ill-gotten gains through some of the world’s biggest banks and offshore accounts, while also investing in legitimate companies. Mike Vigil, former head of international operations at the DEA, explained: “He has a very ersied portfolio. Even though he’s only had maybe an elementary school education, he’s received a Hard-level education from some of the most prolic, knowledgeable and astute drug lords that Mexico has ever had.” Now, despite his advancing years, growing frailty, and battle with diabetes, EL Mayo is as sharp as ever. Since El Chapo’s arrest in January , he has successfully ersied the cartel’s business, from cannabis and coke to deadly fentanyl, an opioid-based synthetic drug. The average revenue from one kilo of fentanyl purchased in China can yield as much as  times the income of one kilo of heroin bought in Colombia, according to the DEA. And now, with America in the grip of an opioid crisis, the Sinaloa cartel’s supply shows no sign of slowing.   According to US agencies, El Mayo tends to act more as an entrepreneur than as a drug lord. The Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United States says he has been in charge of many financial operations within the Sinaloa cartel. And he uses his considerable resources to pay for protection from the authorities, and within the mountain communities where he hides out. Indeed, El Mayo has often become a patron and protector of locals in the area. Unlike other drug barons, he is not known for targeting civilians. This – and the fact that his businesses offer them employment, security and health care services not covered by local authorities – has allowed him to build an impenetrable protection network. Francisco Jimenez Reynoso, a researcher at the University of Guadalajara, says: “They buy wills, they buy loyalties and, in many cases, they are willing to give up their lives for a character of this nature, eventhey engage in illicit activities.”  Despite his low-key, almost gentle, persona, El Mayo is not a man to be crossed. Protected by dozens of henchmen, he has stayed at the top despite huge blows to his inner circle. In recent years, two of his sons and a nephew have been captured. But his most signicant loss was his bother, Jesus Zambada, who was arrested in  and is now helping the US’s case against El Chapo. After seeking a deal with US prosecutors, Jesus – the cartel’s chief accountant for more than  years – said his brother and El Chapo were considered Sinaloa’s leaders. El Mayo also lost his right-hand man, Manuel Torres Felix, in a shootout with the military in . Five years later, El Mayo survived an attack, reportedly by Damaso Lopez Nunez, another Sinaloa leader. A slew of deaths followed the assassination attempt. The ambush also targeted two of El Chapo’s sons, suggesting an internal power struggle after his capture in Mexico in , and his extradition to the US a year later. Some analysts had believed El Mayo might be slipping into the shadows, or even retiring, but instead, since El Chapo’s capture, he seems to be relishing his sole command.

Trilok Nath Pandit spent more than two decades interacting with the Sentinelese tribe, who he said are not a hostile people. The -year-old first visited the island back in , and by  had built up enough trust that tribe members accepted food from him. But he said he heeded warnings that he was not welcome on the island, and said Mr Chau should have done the same. The Christian missionary was visiting the island, in the Bay of Bengal, hoping to convert members of the endangered tribe. Writing in The Economic Times , Mr Pandit - who has written a book about the tribe - said: They give enough warnings the outsiders must respect that and .But this gentleman took too much of a risk and possibly ignored their warnings and ventured into the island. When he first set foot on the island, he said, he and his team landed and walked into the jungle, but did not encounter the tribe - although he is certain they were watching.  They discovered a settlement of around  huts where items including bows, arrows and spears were found. But on subsequent visits in the s and s, he wrote, the Sentinelese would confront his team when they approached the island. Except our first visit, we never walked around on the island, Mr Pandit stated. We understood their warnings. He visited again in , when tribe members took coconuts from the groups hands, but still did not allow them onto the island. Speaking to the BBC, he added that the Sentinelese threatened visitors, but it never escalated to the point where anyone was killed or injured.  He said: I feel very sad for the death of this young man who came all the way from America.But he made a mistake. He had enough chance to save himself. On one occasion, he said, a boy armed with a kne made a gesture suggesting he would cut off his head - at which point he made a quick retreat. Since these encounters, Indian laws have made it illegal to enter the island.  A police boat trying to reach Mr Chaus body has had a tense face-off with the Sentinelese tribesmen off the coast of their remote atoll in the Andaman and Nicobar archipelago in the Bay of Bengal. The boat withdrew to avoid confrontation having stationed themselves m offshore - seeing the tribesmen through binoculars on the beach armed with bows and arrows. Fishermen who ferried -year-old Chau to North Sentinel on  November said they saw the tribesmen drag a body along a beach and bury it. The same fishermen later accompanied police back to the point on the island where they believed the body was buried before the stand-off. Regional police chief Dependra Pathak told AFP: They stared at us and we were looking at them. We have mapped the area with the help of these fishermen. We have not spotted the body yet but we roughly know the area where he is believed to be buried.

He is two or three seconds ahead of people upstairs but he has to do things nice and sharp when he gets into these areas. His finish was brilliant.“And Kenny did brilliant.

It’s a tight league and everybody keeps beating everybody .“We need to keep going and get three points wherever we can, others can worry about thatthey want.”Even so, the summer arrival from Dunfermline admits to draw level with a team who looked almost out of sight just under two months ago would be a boost.“We knowwe go and win against Ayr we will be level with the team who are top of the league right now, so that’s a massive incentive for us.“We were eight points behind when the manager came in andwe have wiped that out by next Friday it would be a big achievement.“It shows the dference in the team now but what is most important is we keep working hard in training every day and get the points at the weekends.”That dference he refers to meant his recall to the starting XI took him by surprise, though it was one he was ready for.“It was brilliant to be back on from the start but to be honest I wasn’t expecting it because the boys have been doing brilliant.“When you get your chance it’s important you take it and I was delighted to get  minutes and help out with a goal.“My last start was Queen of the South away in the second league game of the season, so the next one has been a long time in coming.“I picked up an injury and that set me back for a while but I’ve been working hard in training to get my fitness back up.“When you’ve been out you need to get yourself prepared for when you do come back but, obviously, the boys have been great and I did think I might have had to wait a bit longer than this.“It’s a massive squad here and a great squad as well. You see that with the boys who’ve come into the team and done well.“On Tuesday you had Craig Curran coming on and scoring the fourth goal for us late on to make sure of the points.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/11/5bfd1a57df2be.jpg ","title":"forgotten men mcmullan and edjenguele are making their mark under new dundee united boss","story":"It was ever thus in football, a new manager arrives at a club that’s been struggling and there’s an immediate revival.Often the turnaround in fortunes is, in part, down to the performances of players who were not involved under the previous boss.That’s certainly been the case at Dundee United, where a run of five wins and a draw under new gaffer Robbie Neilson has propelled them right back into the thick of the Championship promotion race.And that success has seen major roles for two men who, as recently as three months ago, who were not so much out of the first-team picture as the door at Tannadice.They are winger Paul McMullan and centre-half William Edjenguele and it’s fair to say, had conditions been right at the end of the summer transfer window, neither would even have been at the club when Neilson arrived last month.Former Scotland U  McMullan was particularly close to moving on at the end of August.Told he could move onhe could find another club, the final week of August did see talks held with interested parties and Partick Thistle were believed to be among those.Without revealing exactly who the clubs he spoke to were, McMullan has confirmed those offers from where and that he was close to going.In the end he decided, despite a lack of game time in the league, United remained a more attractive option.It’s a decision his new boss must be happy he made because under Neilson, he’s started every game and made a major contribution.He was Man of the Match in the win at Partick Thistle and his other starts have seen him heavily involved in the action as well.At Dunfermline he scored one, set up the other and found time to miss a penalty he’d won himself.The win over Queen of the South earlier this month saw him play a leading role again and have a hand in the move that led to Michael Doyle’s own goal that put United two up.At County he played his part in the rearguard action that secured three points, though the one black mark under the new boss came when he was booked for ing.There was no question of a e as he was brought down in last week’s win over Alloa for another penalty – having missed at Dunfermline – Fraser Aird took over the kicking duties from him.And such has been the -year-old’s contribution, it can be taken as read come the next transfer window in just over a month’s time, the only talks he’s likely to be having over his future are with the Tangerines. He’s out of contract in the summer but it looks a safe bet a new one will be on the table for him.Edjenguele is also a free agent next year and, at , it’s dficult to say where he will be playing his football come the   campaign.However,it’s where, it looks likely he will have moved on after playing a part in any success that’s about to come United’s way.Out of the league team since the opening-day defeat against the Pars, he’s had to wait for his chance.It came when Frederic Frans got injured in the warm-up prior to the Queen of the South win. A clean sheet in that one and another, part in thanks to a huge performance at the heart of the defence from the Frenchman, up at Ross County saw him retain his place for Alloa even when Frans was back fit.It could still be that over the course of the season he reverts to squad player status.Several times since his arrival the manager has stressed the contribution of those coming in when others are out through injury and suspension will be vital. Evenit’s just on that level, Edjenguele has shown he can have a part to play."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/11/5bfd19a75e711.jpg ","title":"free travel santas wearing red suits can get buses at no cost to dundee dash","story":"It’s the festive fundraiser spectacle of the year – and what better way to travel to it than by bus This year’s Santa Dash – in which hundreds of people dressed as Father Christmas will take to the streets to raise money for the Archie Foundation – takes place on Sunday.And transport firm Xplore is lending the event its support – offering free bus travel to anyone dressed up.Christine McGlasson, managing director of Xplore Dundee, said: “This is a great event for a fantastic cause and we’re very happy to support it once again.“Anyone wearing the red suit will be able to get on board a bus to the city centre for free to join in the festive fun.”The Santa Dash will kick off at .am in City Square.Hundreds of participants will follow a km km route through the city centre.The second annual event is being sponsored by furniture and carpet store Gillies, with the Eveningand Wave FM also backing the dash.Funds will go towards the charity’s Tayside appeal, which has a target of raising £ million for a new children’s operating theatre suite at Tayside Children’s Hospital.Garry Smith, events and promotions officer for Leisure and Culture Dundee, said: “It’s going to be a busy weekend with people doing their Christmas shopping, so we recommend the Santas get the bus for free.“It’s just so much easier than travelling by car and having to find a parking space.”Ward Road and Commercial Street will be closed from am until pm and Xplore Dundee customers are encouraged to check the full ersion details online before travelling because some bus routes will be affected.The price of entering the dash £ for adults, £. for under-s, £. for under fives and free for kids under three.Bookings close today and can be made at Central Library, Olympia or Dundee Ice Arena before the centres close.To book online, visit leisureand culturedundee santadash before midnight tomorrow.Dashers can start fundraising with Virgin Money Giving at bit.ly qltwDY.

The opportunity concerns how you work with customers and clients to connect into the latest technology to create the best experiences.”Royal Bank of Scotland has long been at the forefront of innovation, from printing the first multi-coloured banknotes in  to installing some of the country’s first ATMs in the s, and it remains at the cutting edge of new financial technology.On its mission to continually develop and update products and features to make banking more convenient and secure for customers, it has invested in new apps to help business customers manage expenses digitally and to give commercial card customers complete control of their account in real time.In , Royal Bank was the first bank to launch a comprehensive internet banking service. Last year it introduced a new ground breaking safety and security feature, face ID. Other recent major steps forward include the launch of Esme Loans, a digital lending  that allows UK-based SMEs to quickly obtain unsecured loans of up to £,, and for personal customers the bank is still the only one to offer completely paperless mortgage applications.Dan Salmons, director of innovation at Royal Bank, added: “I’m tremendously positive about technology. Ultimately, we control it and it’s there to solve problems and to serve us.“Daleks can’t climb stairs, so it will be quite a long time before they take over the world.”Recognising how people live and work in the modern age and finding technology-led solutions to make the customer journey better is at the heart of Royal Bank of Scotland.That ethos has led its development team to design an articial intelligence-powered ‘digital human’ called Cora. Through Cora, Royal Bank of Scotland is the first UK bank to use articial intelligence as a chatbot. Cora converses with customers in branches and can answer more than  queries, including how to log in to online banking, how to apply for a mortgage and what to doyou lose your card, as well as providing advice on card payments and fraud prevention.The last point is particularly relevant: the survey shows  per cent of Scots fear their personal information falling into the wrong hands. It’s more of a concern for women almost two-thirdsof women listed data and personal information as a concern, compared to  per cent of men.Growing up as digital natives,  to -year-olds were the least concerned about protecting their datawhile over-s felt this most strongly . Evidence from this year’s Royal Bank Mobile Microleisure Report also revealed that young people are the least likely of all age groups to take measures such as installing security software on their mobile phones.Royal Bank is focused on designing new measures to help customers stay safe and secure in the virtual world and in real le. That’s why you’ll find a TechXpert in each of Royal Bank of Scotland’s branches, who can demonstrate and teach customers how to use every feature of mobile banking, from staying safe online to registering for digital banking.Community bankers also host training sessions in digital and mobile banking in towns and villages across the country to help customers and technology to move forward together. vw, px\"  "},{"url":null,"title":"wetherspoons-bans-dogs-from-all-pubs","story":"POPULAR pub chain Wetherspoons has banned dogs from all of its branches."},{"url":null,"title":"mobile-providers-charging-customers-for-phones-already-paid-off","story":"AN estimated four million UK mobile phone users have been charged pound million for handsets they already own, a charity has warned."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-takeaway-launches-deep-fried-mars-bar-calzone","story":"A GLASGOW takeaway has launched one of the worlds unhealthiest pizzas - a deep fried MARS BAR calzone containing around , calories."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-and-meghan-expecting-first-baby","story":"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are expecting a baby in spring , Kensington Palace has announced."},{"url":null,"title":"teen-bakes-grandads-ashes-into-biscuits-and-shares-with-classmates","story":"A high school student mixed her cremated grandfatherrsquos ashes into homemade sugar biscuits and shared them with several classmates, police in Calornia said on Wednesday."},{"url":null,"title":"edinburgh-council-could-ban-silent-discos-because-theyre-too-noisy","story":"A council could become the first in Britain to ban silent discos - after complaints they are too noisy."},{"url":null,"title":"brendan-rodgers-dont-blame-my-players-if-others-cant-behave","story":"Brendan Rodgers, the Celtic manager, has exonerated his players of any wrongdoing in the aftermath of a Police Scotland report that suggested a lap of honour from the Parkhead side in the wake of their - win over Rangers in September was the catalyst for unrest within the Rangers support."},{"url":null,"title":"craig-gordon-could-make-celtic-history-on-sunday-at-hampden-without-muddying-his-gloves","story":"Celtic goalkeeper Craig Gordon will make a little bit of history at Hampdenthe Parkhead side win the Betfred League Cup final against Aberdeen on Sunday afternoon."},{"url":null,"title":"hundreds-of-jobs-to-be-created-in-30m-ayrshire-port-redevelopment","story":"Hundreds of jobs are to be created with the multi-million redevelopment of a Scots port and marine yard into a decommissioning and renewables hub."},{"url":null,"title":"huge-majority-of-glaswegians-want-to-see-more-cycle-lanes","story":"THE MAJORITY of people in Glasgow want to see more protected roadside cycle lanes built - evenit means less space for other road traffic."},{"url":null,"title":"hundreds-to-join-annual-st-andrews-day-torchlight-parade","story":"GLASGOW has been urged to ring in St Andrews Day with an annual torchlight parade featuring fire dancers and pipe bands."},{"url":null,"title":"singing-sensation-gerry-cinnamon-reveals-all-about-life-in-the-spotlight","story":"MUSIC star Gerry Cinamon has spoken out about skyrocketing to fame with hit tune Belter."},{"url":null,"title":"james-forrest-out-to-turn-up-the-heat-on-rosenborg-as-celtic-look-for-first-away-europa-league-win","story":"Freezing temperatures await Celtic when they land in Trondheim this afternoon but that will not stop James Forrest from trying to turn the heat up on the Norwegian champions."},{"url":null,"title":"frank-mcavennie-celtic-not-signing-john-mcginn-was-a-blessing-in-disguise","story":"Former Celt Frank McAvennie believes that Parkheads failure to land John McGinn from Hibs this summer has enabled Ryan Christie to emerge at the club.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Star lost possession in midfield and Connor Crawford’s clearance was closed down by the Kings Park forward whose shot beat Kalache from the edge of the box and the hosts took a - lead on the hour mark.This visibly knocked the confidence of the Star team and Kings added a second goal when poor play again from Star trying to break gted possession to the hosts and once again their striker was on hand to make it - and give Star a mountain to climb in the last twenty minutes.Star didn’t give up however and could have been back in the game when the ball fell to Gregor Peacock in the box, the ing striker hit the shot and the ball was saved by the Kings Park goalkeeper.Kyle Selfridge went close to claiming a late leline but his free kick from twenty yards cannoned off the bar and the game finished - to the home side.The Star management team were disappointed as that’s the first time the Lochgilphead side have failed to score in the league in more than two years.On Saturday November  Red Star play host to Campbeltown pupils in what looks like another tough league match.

Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.

Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"ayrshire woman bids land solicitor","story":"NewsAyrshire woman bids to land Solicitor of the Year at the Law Award at Glasgow HiltonMargo McGill is bidding to be crowned at the prestigious awards ceremony for the legal trade.ShareByStephen Houston:,  NOV NewsMargo McGill, partner in Lockharts Ayr\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBeing Ayrshire’s only accredited specialist in Agricultural Law, a farmer’s daughter, a farmer’s we and a mother of two farming-mad sons, you would think that Margo McGill loved farming… well you would be right.

to campaign for a new high school in Hawick - ahead of both Galashiels and Selkirk.Westminster MP John Lamont and Holyrood MSP Rachael Hamilton have launched the campaign, which aims to bring about a new high school as soon as possible and unite the townrsquos politicians behind a united front.Scottish Borders Council launched a review of all educational facilities in the Borders in September , with a view to building new schools, assessing which schools may need to be merged or closed, and considering how appropriate current catchment areas are.Education bosses at the council are known to prefer an intergenerational model of education, such as the poundm campus at Jedburgh which will cater for - year olds and contain community spaces and a library.In April , Scottish Borders Council agreed to create inidualised plans for schools in Galashiels, Hawick, Peebles and Selkirk, and agreed to bring an update to the council in October.However, the update has so far failed to materialise leaving parents and students in the dark about the future of their school.John Lamont, who represents Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk in Westminster, said: ldquoHawick High School has had its fair share of publicity recently, but it is clear that hard working pupils and staff are being let down by a site which is simply not fit for purpose.ldquoThat is why I have joined with my colleague Rachael, to call on the townrsquos representatives to come together for the good of the town.ldquoGalashiels is already the front runner to get a new school, because the town and the community is united and has a clear plan.ldquoHawick is lucky to have very active local representatives who have already put in a lot of work in to securing a new school for the town.ldquoNow is the time for the community and for its representatives to come together to focus on delivering for Hawickrsquos pupils, teachers and parents.ldquoIf we argue amongst ourselves about details, the effect will be that Hawick is put to the back of the queue.Rachael Hamilton, who represents Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire in Holyrood, added: ldquoMaking a decision on a site would give pupils, teachers and parents a real boost.ldquoOther towns in the Borders have been fortunate to benefit from a new modern teaching and learning environment and Hawick is clearly in need of some investment.ldquoPolitical infighting wonrsquot help, clarity should be provided over such an important issue, this is about giving young people and future generations a place to be proud of.The townrsquos councillors have welcomed the intervention of the two politicians, and threw their weight behind the campaign.Councillor Stuart Marshall commented: ldquoI think itrsquos very important that all politicians, councillors and community leaders join forces to continue the campaign for a new high school.ldquoOf course funding such a project will be a major factor in whether we can deliver such a project, and itrsquos great that both our Westminster and Holyrood representatives in the area are throwing their weight behind such an initiative.ldquoLet us hope that between them they can come up with much of the finances required.Councillor Watson McAteer said: ldquoI am delighted that our local elected UK and Scottish Conservative politicians are throwing their weight and influence behind a new high school for Hawick.ldquoI am in complete agreement that politics should have no role in deciding the future of our children and by definition our town and the quicker this project is agreed by all the better.ldquoHawick High School has seen its fair share of problems and a new learning campus would go a long way to resolving existing and future problemsCouncillor David Paterson added: ldquoAll of the Hawick councillors are campaigning furiously to get a new high school for Hawick, and the councillors in other wards are shouting for their areas as well.ldquoIrsquod like John Lamont MP to encourage the Tory government to make more money available to the Scottish Government to make this into a reality.The proposals to create inidual plans for Galashiels, Hawick, Selkirk and Peebles came on the back of assessments of the four schools that found they all have what are described as major defects.The facilities at each school were graded from A to D, with A signying that the buildings are performing well and operating effectively and D indicating that the economic le of the facilities has expired and they are at risk of failure.The overall conditions of Galashiels Academy, Hawick

Council has published a belated update on its much-anticipated school estates review, and it reveals that Galashiels is the top priority to receive new investment, with Hawick second, Selkirk third and Peebles fourth.Education chiefs are recommending that councillors approve plans for a pound.m cross-generational campus in Galashiels, which would be due to open in .The plans would see , secondary school pupils,  additional support needs students,  primary school pupils and  nursery children educated across the campus, to be split between the new Langlee Primary School and a new building at either Scott Park or Netherdale.Although the cross-generational campus is the preferred model outlined by council officers, there would be a public consultation which would explore alternative options, which includes a new standalone secondary school building which would cost pound.m.The costs outlined in the report are currently indicative but would be confirmed once a detailed delivery strategy is drawn up.The report states: ldquoWhile both Galashiels and Hawick high schools are both classed as grade C in relation to their condition, Galashiels will require signicantly more financial investment on an element-by-element fabric basis in order to remain a fully ing asset with no impact on the delivery of the curriculum.ldquoIt is recommended therefore that Galashiels is the first priority for investment given the current condition and suitability of the existing school in relation to the rest of the estate.If the report is approved by councillors, Hawick would be the second town to receive investment in its school estates.As in Galashiels, council officers are recommending the construction of a cross-generational campus, due to open in , at a cost of pound.m.The campus would cater for  secondary school pupils,  additional support needs students, , primary school pupils and  nursery children.Again, the option to create either a cross-generational campus or just a stand-alone secondary school at a cost of pound.m would be discussed with Hawick residents.However, issues relating to flooding risk and available space have led to Hawick missing out on first priority place as council officers do not currently have a concrete plan for where any new campus would be sited.The report continues: ldquoThere are other complex issues within Hawick aside from questions of scale and accessibility, in particular with relation to flood risk.ldquoWhile the existing high school site in Hawick has been included within the options appraisal, it is noted that further detailed investigations are required regarding the currently proposed flood prevention works at this site and the nature of permissible development works which could render this and other adjacent town centre sites undevelopable for an education project of this scale.ldquoThe Hawick flood protection scheme will deliver protection to the town generally at a level commensurate with one in -year flood events.ldquoEarly advice is that any new school provision on the same site or at the same level would require to achieve, a higher level of protection commensurate with its classication as a strategic asset.ldquoIn addition, other sites are already identied within the local development plan in terms of business, mixed use or industrial zoning, and this could have a detrimental impact on the wider economic health of the townutilised for educational purposes and an analysis would therefore be required.Selkirk would be the third priority for new investment, with council officers recommending a pound.m cross-generational campus, potentially due to open in .As with the campus recommendations at Hawick and Galashiels, there would be a public consultation that would consider just building a replacement secondary school, at a cost of pound.mThe report states: ldquoFrom experience with the Jedburgh intergenerational campus model, it is considered appropriate that a three-to- campus option could be considered for the Selkirk cluster.ldquoThis could comprise all the schools within the town and potentially a partial inclusion of the rural schools within the cluster, as was suggested during the pre-consultations, with pupils from P and P transitioning to the campus.,params: .pushldquoPrevious consultation with the community has focused on secondary education. It is therefore proposed that further consultation is undertaken with the community, parents, pupils and staff to determine the preferred option in terms of educational model.ldquoThis will help develop a proposal to take forward to the next stage of the process. Discussions will also be progressed with the public, private and third sector regarding the potential for other services to share services and facilities.Peebles has been designated as the lowest priority for a new school but it would receive the largest investment, with council officers recommending a pound.m campus to be opened in .The alternative would be a new secondary school building at a cost of poundm.The report continues: ldquoPrimary and secondary schools within Peebles currently have limited capacity for increased roll numbers, which is the main concern in this location as opposed to issues of condition at Galashiels and Hawick.ldquoBoth Priorsford and Kingsland primary schools are operating at  per cent capacity and Peebles High School at  per cent capacity, and further work on projected roll figures is required.ldquoIt is recommended that any decision to build a new school or campus model must form part of an overall Scottish Borders Council masterplan for the town taking cognisance of projected housing developments, transport links, infrastructure, including flood risk, and the local development plan.The campus model is favoured by council officers and the elected administration as consolidating educational provision in one or two locations would allow the closure of disused school buildings and reduce annual running costs.The report will be presented at the next full council meeting, to be held next Thursday, November , and councillors will be asked to approve the priority and sequence of investments."},{"url":null,"title":"50k-boost-for-museum-from-festival-of-speed","story":"MORE than pound, has been donated to a Borders museum by organisers of the Goodwood Festival of Speed.And a

We had just popped in to get a few simple items, but I ended up with a very upset wee boy. The supermarket had already begun to display toys. My son had noticed them immediately because they had been deliberately placed at his level.I eventually managed to distract him and we made it out without a major meltdown, but it just highlighted to me the pressures we are all put under.I kept on saying to my son: ldquoNo, but maybe for Christmas.It was a tactic to get some immediate peace, but I realised I was building up expectations that Christmas is the time when all the accumulated desires for stuff are met.We are made to feel that the value of Christmas is measured in the amount of stuff we acquire or give. I hate this and reject it but I am by no means immune from its pressure. I am made to feel guilty and every year I give in some way or another.The psychological warfare in our minds has already begun. The new toys laid out in that supermarket was but the opening shot. Soon a lsquoChristmassyrsquo atmosphere will engulf us as we do our shopping, designed to press our internal panic button that we need get on with buying lots of stuff, like a stressed squirrel collecting nuts for the winter.I know Irsquove ranted about this before but in February I spoke to a group of vulnerable parents in a course I was delivering. Many had huge debts yet had spent literally hundreds of pounds on Christmas presents, most of which were by this time broken, forgotten about or discarded.One of the parents encapsulated it perfectly: ldquoThe trouble is itrsquos easy to realise after itrsquos all over that yoursquove gone overboard, but the pressure is so hard to resist before Christmas. Yoursquore made to feel that you are a bad parent or a failureyou donrsquot get all that stuff. Itrsquos everywhere you go and on the screens. Itrsquos impossible to escape from it.In the discussion the parents said they wished there was a course or some guidance on how to resist the pressure while still making Christmas special for their kids.In a sense, this issue is not just a Christmas one, although the consumerist pressure is at its most intense in the run-up to Christmas, and even immediately afterwards with the sales. We have literally been sold the idea that buying stuff is what defines us.It has been a conscious, deliberate and sustained ideological assault on us and our children.In her brilliant film The Story of Stuff, Annie Leonard gives a quote from a retail analyst Victor Lebow: ldquoOur enormously productive economy. . . demands that we make consumption our way of le, that we convert the buying and use of goods into rituals, that we seek spiritual satisfaction, our ego satisfaction, in consumption. We need things, consumed, burned up, worn out, replaced and discarded at an ever-increasing rate.While this was in reference to the USA a number of years ago, it holds true for us here and now.Christmas, as well as other seasonal festivals, have been made a festival of buying stuff.Itrsquos destroying the very planet we live on, it piles our homes with unneeded and soon-to-be discarded consumerist items .Meanwhile, more and more of us are time poor and running about to pay for things we soon forget we even bought and are likely already in the dump or charity shop.I was once told I was being a Scrooge when I spoke of this issue. But the message in Scrooge, when he realises whatrsquos important, is that he gives his employee time off to be with his family, and a pay rise so they can eat he shows kindness and shares a meal and social time with his family. Itrsquos not about tons of stuff.Our time together is the most valuable and valued thing we will ever have. Irsquod never say donrsquot buy presents, as I know a thoughtful present is a wonderful thing. Butitrsquos lost in a sea of other stuff then its signicance is lost too.What I think is important is doing things together and measuring the value of gts by the thought put into them, rather than the price or quantity of them. And there are a host of local Christmas fairs taking place in schools and community halls all over East Lothian where many local craftspeople, artists and others will be selling locally produced and environmentally friendly gts which have real value and are designed to last. It seems to me this is the best place to take our custom.I know this has not been a proper story but, then again, in a sense it is. Itrsquos the story of how our rituals and the meanings of our lives have been turned into market value, and we now often feel powerless or unable to step out of it without feeling guilty, inadequate or ldquoa Scrooge.Thatrsquos how I feel every Christmas but Irsquom going to make a Herculean effort this year to practice what I preach. Irsquom not rejecting that lsquoChristmassyrsquo feeling or refusing to buy presents. But Irsquom defining it on my own terms, or at least Irsquoll try. Itrsquos about my time with people I value. Itrsquos about putting in thought rather than looking at the price tag.Itrsquos also about understanding how terribly dficult Christmas is for so many people and finding ways to connect with them and show them some kindness and inclusion.Maybe itrsquos just me, but I think that is one of the best gts you can give your children and others you love."},{"url":null,"title":"great-grandmother-84-enjoys-microlight-flight","story":"Jenny Lyall, , was the passenger in a microlight, taking off from East Fortune Airfield, earlier this month.The small aircraft, piloted by Kim Ritchie, gave Jenny the chance to look over her home in Haddington.Clients at the townrsquos day centre, managed by Caroline Scott, have been outlining things they would like to do, from having a holiday in the spring to going on the London Eye.For Jenny, though, it was a chance to take to the skies.She said: ldquoIrsquove always watched the microlights going over and would be sitting in the garden saying: lsquoI quite fancy doing that.rsquoldquoWhen Caroline askedthere was anything anybody would like to do I said I would like to go up in a microlight.A few days later Jenny received a phone call telling her there was a surprise for her at the day centre and she said she was thrilled when she found out that was a microlight flight, adding: ldquoI thoroughly enjoyed it ndash I would do it again tomorrow.ldquoNot bad for an -year-old!Caroline was delighted to be able to help.

It did not elaborate on this point. Campaigners believe that SLPs would be harder to abusethere was an accountable person who answered for any illegal conduct overseas.The FT also said proposed legislation was also likely to enable the striking off of SLPs. As things stand nobody can even be entirely sure how many SLPs are active. That is because a dissolved partnership can be re-activated in a way that would be impossible for a limited company.The Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said it did not comment on leaks.The FT linked government moves with a money-laundering scandal at the Estonian branch of Danske Bank. This saw billions of dollars pumped through shell companies - with unnamed British ones ranking second only to those from Russia.SLPs have proved more popular than some equivalent English or Northern Irish entities because they have legal personality.But like other shell firms registered in the UK they essentially act as a respectable EU-based front for untraceable money transfers. Many have had accounts at banks in the Baltic states, such as Estonia.A crackdown in that region has seen hundreds of SLPs lose their accounts, including in Latviarsquos Rietumu banka, an institution part owned by Celtic owner Dermot Desmond.Latvian authorities, argue insiders sceptical about Britainrsquos commitment to transparency, have now done more to stop abuse of SLPs than British ones. More than half of the offshore companies with accounts in its banks were found to be from the UK or its overseas territories.The countryrsquos ambassador to the UK, Baiba Bra#e, told The Herald the time had come for other nations to act. She said: ldquoWe do think the clean up act has to be done not only in Latvia but where. There are a lot of things that the UK can do.She added: ldquoWhen some of the money-laundering channels were looked in to, almost all of the trends went back to the UK.ldquoAlmost none of the money laundering was created or came from Latvian banks. It all came via companies in London or the Virgin Islands, or Scottish limited partnerships.Ms Bra#e acknowledged that Latvia had been on a ldquogradual learning process on offshore companies using its banks.UK authorities have also been slow, say critics. It is three and a half years since The Herald revealed SLPs were being openly marketed as secrecy vehicles - along with Baltic bank accounts.Money-laundering expert Graham Barrow told the FT: ldquoWe should applaud the government for taking this action and it is moving in the right direction but ultimately it will succeed or fail based on the resources given to Companies House. If Companies House does not have the right resources, the rules will be circumvented by criminals - as they have been."},{"url":null,"title":"a-less-formal-news-programme-promised-for-bbc-scotlands-the-nine","story":"The nine orsquoclock news programme for the BBC Scotland digital channel, which it is calling The Nine, will feature anchors Rebecca Curran and Martin Geissler broadcasting from a set in the BBCrsquos headquarters at Pacic Quay in Glasgow.The open-plan studio space, on the rd floor, will feature a purple sofa, a glass-topped desk, and will be introduced with a theme tune penned by a Scottish composer.The opening credits will show a series of portraits of people from across Scotland.The show, the flagship programme of the new channel, which will launch in February, will feature international, UK and Scottish news.: BBC unveils vision for new Scotland channelBBC Scotland has hired  journalists to work on the channel, including new correspondents.However, despite the more relaxed set ndash Mr Geissler and Ms Curran will not be reading the news from behind a desk ndash Hayley Valentine, editor of the programme, said it will still be a serious evening news show.She said: ldquoWe are hoping to bring our audiences something : clearly there is a very busy news market out there, so we are really focussing on original journalism, and we really hope to break stories, and show stories that you donrsquot see where.ldquoOn tone and stylehellipwe aim to be a little more informal, we will have authority, but we aim to be conversational, informal and inclusive, and wherever you are in the country, you can see it reflected back to you.The hour long running time will allow for more in depth interviews and news stories, as well as exclusive stories, she said.: Newer and younger  New BBC channels visionMs Valentine said: ldquoWe are very definitely a news programme ndash it has two presenters and a sofa, and we want that relationship to be part of the programme, but that is as far as it goes.She added: ldquoIt is very much a programme, not a bulletin, and we have an hour which feels like a luxury.ldquoIt will allow to use longer films, allow interviews to breathe, and allow live guests, live correspondents and a iety of dferent packages.ldquoWe will aim to bring the best of the BBC, so you will see some well-kent faces from the  orsquoclock news and  orsquoclock news, alongside the best of what is on BBC Scotland.It will be broadcast from Monday to Friday from pm.Laura Miller and John Beattie will present the news hour each Friday.Weekend coverage comprises a -minute bulletin on Saturday evenings at .pm followed by a -minute review programme presented by Fiona Stalker and Nick Sheridan.

Albaredahope readers will Make Someones Day on St Andrews Day on November  and to then celebrate our art and culture on Fair Saturday on December  to help raise funds for good causes. Well, thanks to a new campaign by the Scottish Government, we don’t have to imagine the outcome.For that dream will become a reality on November , with people across the country being asked to commit to doing something nice for someone  on St Andrew’s Day.The Maake Someone’s Day initiative aims to celebrate our generous nature.On Saturday, December , we’re also being invited to take part in the first Fair Saturday here, a celebraion of art and culture while raising funds and awareness for charities.A helping hand...making someones day need not cost a penny. Why not pop in on an elderly relative or neighbour and make their day Founded in Spain in  to combat Black Friday’s commercialism, it is now a global movement.But Scotland is the first nation to sign up as a whole.Ben Macpherson, Minister for Europe, Migration and International Development, was delighted to launch the initiative.He said: “This St Andrew’s Day presents an inspiring opportunity for people in Scotland, in all our ersity, to celebrate the inclusive, outward-looking and compassionate spirit of our nation – by helping others and showing our generosity.Pause for thought...consider buying a homeless person a hot meal or drink to help make their St Andrews Day.“We can all show the best of what it means to be Scottish by each doing something small to #MakeSomeonesDay. “If each of us does something kind for someone , together we can make a hugely positive impact.“We wanted our national day to act as a focal point to showcase the Scots’ generous spirit and nature.data-src\"https:images.johnstonpress jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.donsidepiper webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Missing teenager Liam Smith\"  Liam Smith: Search widens viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"DONS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"DONS | Article Teaser\"“This is not about how much you can spend it’s about little acts of kindness that mean so much more.“We’re asking people to make time for elderly neighbours, donate goods to charity shops, hold a charity bake sale at work, volunteer time to a good cause or gt a meal or hot drink to a homeless person.“Everyone can get involved – all you have to do is make someone’s day.”The initiative is tied in with Fair Saturday which next year will take place on St Andrew’s Day itself.Ben added: “We’re linking in with the event this year so we can build up to having a major celebration in .“Fair Saturday gives communities across the country a chance, through arts and culture, to celebrate what it means to be Scottish in the st century.“We live in a multiculural and erse society and we want to celebrate that.“Fair Saturday offers the perfect  to do that.”First staged in Bilbao in , the Fair Saturday movement is spearheaded by social entrepreneur Jordi Albareda.It has since been adopted by Malaga, Santander and Huelva in Spain, Milan and Pisa in Italy, Lima in Peru and Bristol in England.However, Scotland is the first nation to sign up.Jordi said: “When we began the Fair Saturday movement, we wanted countries all over the world to embrace its ideals of creating social impact through arts and culture. “It is fitting that Scotland is hosting the first nationwide Fair Saturday festival outside of Spain.“Scotland is a nation that focuses on ersity, multiculturalism, social empathy, kindness and, of course, arts and culture. “So it made complete sense for us to deliver the movement here. It is the most vibrant case of Fair Saturday to date.“In a time of building walls, we want to build bridges to connect people, cities, communities and cultures. “Millions of people working together surely must be stronger than some irresponsible global leaders.“We hope the Scottish people will mobilise behind our aim of creating a better future for all.”Some  events have already been organised in  cities and towns across Scotland on Fair Saturday, December .And the movement will also be celebrated in more than  locations globally.Jordi said: “More than  cultural events with a social impact will be taking place around the world.“Could you imagine the day when millions of people take part  It would send such a powerful message – that’s our aim for the future.”Fair Saturday aims to make people reflect on how arts and culture and social causes contribute to society. So all its events support a social cause of their choice in one of three ways:By recognising the charity’s workBy allowing the charity to spread its message to a wider audienceBy contributing to the charity’s work via ticket sales and donations.November  and December  in Scotland will also serve as a perfect antidote to Black Friday’s commercialism, which initially prompted Fair Saturday’s launch.Jordi added: “We connected with the Scottish Government thanks to our British Council in Bilbao in late  and are delighted to launch our first Fair Saturday here this year.“We believe it is one of the best nations in the world in which to start the journey. “Scotland’s National Day is all about sharing, giving and being kind. That tells you a lot about its people.”Visit www.scotland.org events st-andrews-day makesomeonesday to find out more or share your good deed at #MakeSomeonesDay.Fair fight back against Black FridayFair Saturday aims to mobilise people through social empathy rather than commercialisim – being staged the day after Black Friday to make that point.Jordi Albareda, its founder, convinced  choirs to perform in Bilbao, Spain, on November , , in dferent locations around the city at the same time. The result was incredible more than  people attended, raising more than  Euros for social causes.Since then, the movement has continued to grow, with more cities, cultural and social organisations and supporters joining along the way.Jordi said: “We are living in a material world. It prevails over humanity. “The strong desire of having has taken over from the profound aspiration of being. But living to the fullest is mostly about love. “In the last hours of our lives we won’t remember the things we owned but rather the people we loved.“Black Friday is one of the most irrational days of the year strong proof of a growing materialist system, based on the short term and unsustainable. “We do not pretend to fight against Black Friday but we do offer a positive alternative.“It’s all about culture before materialism. Social empathy before greed. “It’s a day to be better following a day to have more.”As for the future, Jordi hopes to target one of the world’s largest commercial markets – America.He added: “We are already taking the first steps to develop the movement in the USA in  and we’re expecting more European cities to get involved too.“Black Friday may be popular but surely Fair Saturday makes more sense.”To support Fair Saturday and find out about events in your area, visit the website at https:app.fairsaturday.org.

Aileen Campbell, Cabinet Secretary for Communities and Local Government, said: “In helping build a fairer Scotland, we want to protect people from getting into unmanageable debt and falling into the hands of predatory, high cost lenders.“A key part of this is making sure that people are aware of the financial services and fair alternatives available, including credit union membership.“Our new campaign will highlight the benefits of joining a credit union. I would encourage everyone to visit the new website to find out more.”Michael Sheen, actor and social activist, has worked with the Scottish Government to produce a short video explaining what a credit union is. He said: “I’m very pleased to be backing the ‘People, Not Profit’ campaign, and I share the Scottish Government’s ambition to grow and raise awareness of this sector. “I’m a member of a credit union myself, and so I know first-hand the benefits they offer. “What’s important to me is that they are owned by the people who actually use their services, and any profits that they make are invested back into the credit union.”A new website has been set up to support the ‘People, Not Profit’ campaign.

There were good cloth seats there covered with sugar, tea, coffee and anything  they found and threw about.\"Councillor Nicola Sinclair says she is \"very disappointed\" about the current spate of vandalism.\"With the support of my ward colleagues I recently asked officers to tidy up the site, including clearing weeds, fixing hanging lights externally and boarding up those windows which are most visible from the street,\" she said.\"Its my understanding that some of that work has taken place but the windows have not all been boarded up yet.\"The councillor said she will follow up on the issue to ensure that the work is carried out as a matter of urgency.\"I also recently got agreement from the police that they will look at trespassing on the site and I will remind officers at our Caithness Committee meeting.

Jim therefore tried to find historical accuracy as far as possible by researching contemporary documents and manuscripts that held vital evidence.\"There are certain liberties you can take, like for example the drumming used by the armies preparing for battle and that is often for dramatic effect.\"The film is billed as a \"true David versus Goliath story\" of how the great th-century \"outlaw king\" Robert the Bruce used cunning and bravery to defeat the larger and better-equipped occupying English army.At the films debut during the Toronto Film Festival last year there were a few raised eyebrows when American actor Chris Pine, who plays Bruce, appeared full-frontal naked in one scene.Directed by Oscar-nominated film-maker David Mackenzie the epic was shot in ious Scottish locations throughout  and Jim spent six months working on the diegetic soundtrack.Jim said: \"I had a meeting with David Mackenzie just a few weeks before the shoot and none of this particular aspect was planned. David calls himself a jazz film-maker and doesnt really like to spend too much time planning it all out.

We all love it.\"Gill Arrowsmith and Shirley Sinclair both thought the painting was \"fantastic\" while Annemarie Simpson thought that a similar venture in Wick would help tackle the \"towns eyesore\" buildings.While on that subject, one dissenting voice condemned the piece and said there was a \"masterpiece eyesore now in Wilson Street thanks to Caithness Horizons\".Beauty is, of course, in the eye of the beholder.The mural depicts a portrait of Thursos renowned botanist and geologist Robert Dick surrounded by a kaleidoscopic representation of the CHMAG facade and the scientists specimen collection.The bold use of line and colour based on modern urban graffiti cannot fail to be noticed just like the mural on nearby Tollemache House but is sited in a much less conspicuous space ndash the gallerys car park.CHMAGs curator Merran Gunn, who was instrumental in commissioning Delaye to create the work, said the artist had also spray painted a wall within the building as part of a show running called Graffito.His earlier piece has an explosive anime style figure punching out of the wall toward the viewer.\"Marcs work is bold and vibrant, electric colours jostle for dominance, and the new outside mural is no exception with tangerine skies set behind the historic Thurso of Robert Dick,\" said Gunn.Thursos illustrious scientist had his herbarium collection feature in an earlier work by the artist Joanne Carr which in turn is featured within Delayes mural ndash a clear case of one artist paying homage to another.\"Graffiti and street art is more relevant than ever whether it be in the art world ndash with the recent record sale of Banksys girl with a balloon ndash or here in the Highlands where graffiti has made its way onto the syllabus at Farr High School through art teacher Tracy Wilkinson,\" she said.After garnering great positive feedback from the current show Merran decided to \"have a moment of spontaneity\" and raised funds through a crowdfunding website and the Dounreay Communities Fund to commission Marc Delaye to breath some le into a fairly drab corner of the town.Tracy Dodson, commercial manager of CHMAG, said that the gallery was \"breaking boundaries\" with Graffito.\"It questions what actually constitutes art and what gets shown in a gallery. Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Wednesday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"November ,  at : pmConditions at the Churchill Barriers are being monitored today as strong winds and heavy rain sweep over the county.

These concerns were echoed by the group of experts giving evidence to the Committee this morning.Speaking after the committee meeting, Mr McArthur said: “Today’s evidence session left no doubt at all that the Scottish Government is now isolated over its approach to tackle fuel poverty in rural and island areas. It is increasingly clear that Ministers will have to think again and ensure their proposals are properly #island proofed#.“In a desperate move yesterday evening, the Housing Minister issued a briefing to MSPs seeking to justy his decision not to include a rural Minimum Income Standard in the revised definition of rural fuel poverty.  This attempt by the Minister to get his retaliation in first backfired, however, as the Committee heard again today how this approach flies in the face of all the advice.“The Rural Fuel Poverty Task Force, the government’s own Independent Panel of Advisers and every organisation across the Highlands  Islands involved in housing and fuel poverty have made plain that excluding a rural MIS risks support not going to the people and communities who need it. As a result, the government’s own targets for combatting fuel poverty across the country will be undermined.“While fuel poverty is not simply an island issue, all the evidence shows that it affects rural and island communities more than others. Hopefully, today’s committee evidence session will persuade ministers to think again. If not, it will be up to parliament to force the government to do the right thing”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

There are a number of potential routes we could now take with them – some of which offer us the opportunity to generate income, some to make savings # and officers will be exploring these opportunities in due course.”According to OIC, the Stewart Endowment Trust disperses the majority of its funds locally, including to NHS Orkney. The council therefore anticipates that most of the money generated from the sale will stay in and benefit Orkney.Iain Macdonald, chair of the Stewart Endowment Trust said: “The Stewart Endowment Trustees offered these islands for sale in order to generate funds, which are used to support the work of local congregations, the Balfour Hospital and a couple of national charities, as defined by the Endowment’s founding document.#We are delighted that they will be moving into ship of the local authority, where they will remain a precious asset for the whole community for generations to come.”The main island, Faray is around  acres, the Holm of Faray around  acres and the smallest of the three, Red Holm, is just five acres.There are a number of ruinous dwelling houses scattered across Faray together with a bothy which is housed in the former school.

It might be the only time and the only thing she is right about, but in a certain sense I am Bored of Brexit. Apparently this new phenomenon called BoB is neither a virus or congenital defect – I am simply pig-sick of the never-ending drawn-out EU negotiations that have lasted twice as long as Mao’s Long March.What’s more, no sooner have the EU  nations signed the orce settlementand have said we can’t change a single word, when – surprise, surprise – France’s President Macron is saying how he’ll bully and blackmail us so his fishermen get as much access to our fishing waters as they want.Bored of Brexit  You bet I am. I am bored with how we always cough-up our nation’s hard-earned taxes to keep the EU juggernaut hurtling between its two lavish parliaments.I’m bored with how we’re expected to sign up to new rules and regulations ­without a say in them. I’m bored with how EU politicians say there is a problem with the UK-Irish border are the same people who say that under no circumstances will they impose a hard border or any infrastructure – so what’s the problem I’m bored with being told we can have new trade deals – only to read QCs’ opinions that say it won’t be ­possible under May’s orce ­settlement and then hear President Trump agree, saying the US won’t do a deal now.It is this parade of our ­Premier May’s prize porkies that is the most boring aspect of it all. Every time she makes a claim about leaving behind the single market, its customs union, or those European judges, or ending unlimited immigration – I then find when I read the detail in the official documents that it is simply not true. These institutions are replicated and given new names, or there are caveats that keep us locked in –the EU leaders decide by themselves!One can only conclude the Prime Minister is trying to fool us by repeatedly parroting black is white or has talked herself into believing her own publicity without using her critical faculties – what is normally considered self-delusion. Neither of these behaviours are a good look.The prize example is the PM says that because we’re Bored of Brexit we must agree her orce settlement so we can move on to our new lives. This is the biggest lie of all. It is May’s withdrawal agreement that guarantees another two years of further negotiations until the end of  – with the threat of being kept in beyond that. French and Spanish leaders have made that very plain and the rest will be queuing up to give us another doing every other month. What we need is a clean break. To end the boredom we need to simply leave. The referendum question didn’t askwe wanted a new deal, it askedwe wanted to remain or leave – with or without a deal. We don’t actually need a deal – it’s how normal countries work. We can keep our £ billion for our own problems, trade with no ­tarfs to bring prices down and decide our fisheries’ future.

OECD evidence shows that segregated schools present children with two dferent perspectives of the world and affect their le chances.Effects of povertyThere is a strong link between a pupil’s socioeconomic status and how well they do in school. Pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds have a higher chance of failing. Children and young people living in the most deprived communities do signicantly worse at all levels of the education system than those from more affluent backgrounds. This is often referred to as the “attainment gap”.In Scotland, it is estimated that one in four children is living in poverty. European Commission figures suggest this is higher than in many other countries in Europe and the Institute for Fiscal Studiespredicts that more than one-third of children in the UK will be living in poverty by  .• : Scottish schools struggle to fill nearly  teaching postsIn , Scotland’s First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, declared that the Scottish government would “draw on successful ideas from around the world” to help children from disadvantaged backgrounds and close the attainment gap. She introduced a range of initiatives, not only in the education sector, but across health, childcare, social services, welfare and employment. Some of these measures introduced as a matter of urgency have already proved controversial, such as the national testing of P pupilswhich parents and teachers complained had caused some children distress. Schools play a signicant role, but the initiatives adopted need to follow a long arc of slow structural change. Short-term political fixes have been tried for decades, yet people in Scotland and the rest of the UK continue to live in a deeply unequal society ided by class, income and poverty.Following the FinnsFinland is widely recognised as being an educational success story. Like Scotland, it has a population of around five million which shares the same culture, language and a keen sense of social justice. But after the Second World War the Finns recognised that a society ided by class and poverty would weaken their country further, so they embarked on long-term structural reform abolishing private and selective schools in favour of a system in which every child would attend high-quality state schools. The Finns reduced socio-economic inequality by reducing inequality in the education system.Having dferent educational provisions and greater freedom for parents to choose their preferred school may seem democratic, but it leads to a country that separates children and damages the very fabric of democracy it seeks to champion. I think there are three fundamental ways to help bridge the educational ide in Scotland.First, as the Finns have done, the government should look beyond parental choice and introduce the “common school” which provides basic comprehensive education to serve all children equally well, regardless of family background. Not just a form of school organisation, the idea of the common school embodies a philosophy of education as well as a deep set of values about what all children need and deserve.Second, the quality of teachers and teaching is crucial for effective learning and can have a demonstrable impact on a disadvantaged pupil’s prospects. Teachers need to be paid at a level that will attract top graduates, so that the profession becomes more appealing and valued.According to the OECD the UK has one of the least well-paid and youngest teaching workforces in the EU, predominantly populated by women. Because teaching is a highly skilled profession, only teachers who are academically well-qualied, research literate and socially committed should be encouraged to teach Scotland’s children.Freedom and trustA long-term solution for reducing the attainment gap is to restore a culture of responsibility and trust within the education system that values teacher and head teacher professionalism in judging what is best for students. The Scottish Government has pledged £m directly to head teachers, which although considered a sound idea by the OECD, has been met with concern due to a lack of clear guidance on how this money should be spent.Striking a balance between accountability and autonomy, with greater levels of responsibility, flexibility and freedom to be creative in addressing pupils’ needs takes time. Research suggests that encouraging schools to make their own decisions about how best to support their pupils to do well is essential for closing the attainment gap.Third, the standard of literacy has fallen in Scotland over the past four years. Literacy and le chances are closely linked, and evidence suggests that libraries can contribute to improving quality of le for all. Starting with areas that have been designated as deprived, new public libraries should be built or existing community libraries transformed.Raising the level of literacy is not just about the child, it has to involve the literacy of families and communities too. As we see in places such as Finland and Singapore, public libraries can serve as the educational and cultural bedrock of a community, and could help work towards closing the attainment gap.Persistent poverty exacerbated by budget cuts and coupled with entrenched mindsets in government and education are all obstacles in the current climate.There is an urgent need to think out of the box and to re-imagine long-term solutions to reverse the inequalities that face disadvantaged children in Scotland.• Geetha Marcus is lecturer in education at the School of Interdisciplinary Studies, University of GlasgowThis article first appeared at theconversation©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4828909.1543416246!/image/image.jpg","title":"snp accuse theresa may of trying to take uk back to days of thatcher","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Scots will not allow Theresa May to #rob them of their rights as EU citizens#, the SNP has said.The party’s Westminster leader Ian Blackford blasted the Prime Minister’s Brexit deal in the Commons, telling MPs it would “leave people poorer than the status quo”.: Analysis shows deal would shrink economy by .%Mrs May had to battle against cries of “it will” and “just say yes” as she tried to explain how her deal was the “best” for the UK.Mr Blackford, speaking at Prime Minister’s Questions, said: “Quite clearly, under any scenario, leaving the single market and the customs union we’ll be poorer.“The Prime Minister wants to take us back to the days of Thatcher and a belief that unemployment is a price worth paying, that’s the reality.“No government should choose to weaken its economy and make its citizens poorer, that’s what the Prime Minister is doing.: Brexit deal is ‘gamble’, Theresa May told“People in Scotland voted overwhelming to Remain, we voted for our rights to be respected and we are not prepared to give up those rights.“The Prime Minister must explain to the people of Scotland why her deal will rob them of their rights as EU citizens.”Mrs May responded: “What the analysis shows is that this is a strong economy that will continue to grow and that the model which actually delivers best on delivering for the vote of the British people and for our jobs and our economy is the model that the Government has put forward.”She added: “He talks about what the people of Scotland voted for, they voted to stay in the United Kingdom and they voted for  Conservative MPs.”©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4836254.1543424130!/image/image.jpg","title":"storm diana major disruptions on scotland s roads amid high winds","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...As high winds and rain blast the country many of Scotland#s major roads are experiencing y delays.Yellow weather warnings for heavy rain and high winds have been issued for much of Scotland.\u2028Areas affected by the wind warnings are Central, Grampian, Tayside  Fe, Highlands  Eilean Siar, Orkney  Shetland, South-West Scotland, Lothian Borders and Strathclyde.: Storm Diana: Watch sparks fly as train smashed by waves: Storm Diana set to blast Scotland and disrupt travel across nationFor those making the journey home this evening, Traffic Scotland have reported disruptions in a number of regions and on specic road:\u2028\u2028- North Lanarkshire: Drivers in North Lanarkshire are advised to use caution due to surface water affecting driving conditions.- A A North Aviemore -

I like many other parents and carers look forward to the day its complete and our daughters and sons can enjoy the help and encouragement from staff to live their lives to the best of their ability..."},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"Marc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August. It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"views sought on fishing after brexit ","story":"“What will Brexit mean for your fishing community ” – was the question posed by university academics this week.But sadly the public event on Wednesday night at the Thule Bar in Lerwick did not pull in visitors to share their views.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests. Hopefully he can make an eye-catching debut to match his name.: : : : : : : :Family, friends, work colleagues and a good number of former footballers gathered on Friday to say farewell to Alastair Johnston from Cunningsburgh.When I first met him in the early s he was still an excellent player. He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

stand-off.The breakthrough follows \"extremely positive and constructive\" high-level discussions between the hotel group and Highland Council.Local Highland High Leusers have been unable to use the leisure pool since the end of August when access ended because of a funding wrangle.Macdonald Hotels chairman Donald Macdonald and deputy chairman Gordon Fraser met with the councils new chief executive Donna Manson in Aviemore on Tuesday and reached a one-year agreement to resolve the stalemate.HLH users will not have to pay any additional charges which had been one of the options on the table as attempts were made to break the deadlock.There is further good news with confirmation that HLH swimming lessons for children and aquafit will also resume.Details of the funding arrangements have not yet been made public nor when the doors will re-open.Speaking after the meeting, Mr Fraser said: \"Were extremely encouraged by the positive and constructive approach taken by Donna Manson and her team and are very happy that we have reached an agreement which will see the local High Le Highland members enjoying the facilities at Aviemore Resort very soon.\"We understand that local authorities throughout the country are facing financial pressures and that there is a clear responsibility to spend tax-payers money wisely.\"We were also encouraged by the recognition of our own position that we have had to swallow a wide range of very signicant cost increases in rates, energy bills and staffing costs over the past  months.\"Mr Fraser continued: \"Its clear that both we and the council were very keen to welcome back local people and reach a clear and swt resolution to what has been an unfortunate situation for everyone concerned, and particularly for the many local High Le Highland members.\"For our part, we are very keen to have our local guests back through the doors, and I know that members of the local community will be happy that this matter has been resolved.\"The new agreement will allow time for further consultation on public access to the leisure facilities in future years.Highland Council convener Bill Lobban, who lives in Aviemore, said: \"I am delighted that a sensible agreement has been reached.\"This new deal is great news for Highland Council, High Le Highland and Macdonald Aviemore Resort but most importantly its fantastic news for the residents of Badenoch and Strathspey.\"The swimming pool is a well-used, important attraction and I would like to congratulate the staff from both sides who have worked really hard behind the scenes to get this result and more especially members of the local community who made sure that their voice was heard in the process.\"Well done to all.\"A positive community campaign had been launched called Save Our Swimming following the doors closing to HLH users at the end of the summer.SOS co-ordinator Joe Kirby described the agreement as a fantastic result for all the parties.He said: \"It is great that the council and Macdonald Hotels have listened to the concerns of the community and that a pragmaticto talks has delivered this deal.\"I know as a father myself that folk

This motion was agreed. earlier this week, the chair of the EDI committee, Councillor Allan Henderson said that the council was putting pressure on the Scottish Government to have the route classed as a trunk road. However, during Thursday’s meeting Councillor Cockburn was quick to dismiss the likelihood of this happening: “Who in their right mind would take  miles of the worst road in the Highlands” He said. “After six and a half years we still only have two options… and the delays and the consequences for the wider community have been absolutely shocking.”The SNP member for Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh also went on to question the tendering process behind the work at the bypass, saying: “Was it necessary to shut the road during the day  I believe there was a tender on the table that would have allowed the road to open during the day.”He went on to argue that the council needed to release money straight away to enable design work on the replacement options for the current bypass to begin, adding that it was a matter of urgency due to the risks identied in the  annual sloping report which detailed four very high-risk rock slopes at the Stromeferry bypass.In response to Councillor Cockburn, the council’s head of infrastructure Colin Howell said that the council did receive an alternative tender from a contractor who said they could carry out the required works at night, however, Mr Howell said the cost was signicant and due to concerns about these plans it was decided it would be wise for some of the work to be undertaken during the day.Mr Howell said that while there were ongoing issues with rockfalls and managing slopes, he believed that the council had done a good job. He went on to add that the council were prioritising the high-risk slopes and currently working on the cost and details in relation to stabilising those areas which would be delivered at the next EDI committee meeting. He added that there were “three optimum solutions” in respect to replacement options and said that the committee had “decided to leave those three on the table# and seek dialogue with Scottish Government for funding. He said: “The administration is looking for feedback, we are working on slopes with high risks and will come back to the next EDI with the costing.”Councillor Derek MacLeod described the current situation as “one episode in a long, long history of problems with the route#, and in contrast to his fellow ward member, Councillor Cockburn, he argued that the route should be “trunked between Auchtertyre and Garve” as he believed it to be strategic in linking the ferry points of Uig and UllapoolCouncil Leader Margaret Davidson told the committee that she would be meeting with the Transport Secretary Michael Matheson and would report back “what options have been put on the table.” Councillor Davidson said that the council were “acutely aware of what’s needed” and were working towards a long-term sustainable option for Stromeferry.

Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27491  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe writer, newspaper editor and Irish republican Seumas O’Kelly was a native of Loughrea, County Galway.

He welcomed republicans to his home during the annual Wolfe Tone commemorations in nearby Bodenstown. O’Kelly’s first book of stories was published in  and his first play was produced the following year. Several of his plays were produced at the Abbey Theatre. Constantly busy with literary and journalistic work, O’Kelly was subject to poor health. He joined Óglaigh na hÉireann when they were founded in  but was unable to play an active military role. His brother was a Volunteer and was jailed in England after the  Rising. The paper Nationality, edited by Grfith, was established in  and O’Kelly was one of its writers. It was the main organ of Sinn Féin during the  and  by-elections. In May  Grfith was arrested and jailed in England and O’Kelly took over as editor of Nationality. Following the  November  Armistice which ended the First World War, British soldiers and loyalists ran riot through the streets of Dublin, attacking suspected Sinn Féin supporters. On the night of  November a crowd of drunken soldiers invaded the Sinn Féin Ard Oig at  Harcourt Street . Seumas O’Kelly was at his desk in the Nationality office and tried to defend himself with his walking stick. The office was wrecked and O’Kelly collapsed. He was brought to Jervis Street Hospital where he died of a brain haemorrhage. Seumas O’Kelly was honoured with a republican funeral to Glasnevin Cemetery, attended by huge crowds. He died on  November ,  years ago this week.  test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27492  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaAt the start of the th century women began to campaign actively against the denial of their right to vote. In  the Women’s Social and Political Union was founded in England and the militant feminists commenced the battle for the vote. In Ireland there had been groups working for women’s suffrage but the campaign really began here on the instigation of Hanna Sheehy Skeffington and Margaret Cousins. Margaret Cousins came from a unionist family in Dublin but she later wrote: “I belonged in my heart from the beginning to the fighters for freedom.” Her husband James Cousins also rejected the unionism of his background and became involved in the Gaelic revival. Margaret came into contact with the women’s movement in England in . On herto Ireland she co-operated with a remarkable young woman who was to make her mark on Irish history. Hanna Sheehy was the daughter of a Fenian, David Sheehy, who took part in the  Rising and was elected as a Parnellite MP in . Hanna was an exceptional student and excelled academically despite the restrictions on women’s access to education she achieved a first class honours MA in . She became a teacher and married Francis Skeffington. In line with their shared feminist principles they adopted each other’s surnames. Francis resigned his post as registrar of University College because the authorities refused to register women on the same basis as men. In  Hanna and Margaret founded the Irish Women’s Franchise League , with the active support of both Francis Sheehy Skeffington and James Cousins. From the beginning they stressed that the IWFL would address the specic needs of Irish women in “a subject country seeking freedom from England” and would “work on independent Irish lines”. Margaret Cousins described the IWFL’s position: “Its policy was to educate by all forms of propaganda the men, women and children of Ireland to understand and support the members of the League in their demand for votes for women, and to obtain pledges from every Irish Member of Parliament to vote for Women’s Suffrage Bills introduced in the British Houses of Parliament, and to include Women’s Suffrage in any Irish Home Rule Bill.” The IWFL campaigned throughout the country and made an impact beyond their numbers of about  activists. Not all militant women agreed with the IWFL’s tactics the republican group Inghinidhe na hÉireann refused to join in lobbying the British parliament, preferring to “organise a women’s movement on Sinn Féin lines, or on lines even broader still”. Despite this dference, republican women such as Constance Markievicz played an active role in the IWFL’s work and Hanna Sheehy Skeffington herself was strongly republican. Markievicz urged young Irishwomen to prepare to fight: “Arm yourselves with weapons to fight your nation’s cause. Arm your souls with noble and free ideas. Arm your minds with the histories and memories of your country and her martyrs, her language, and a knowledge of her arts and industries. Andin your day the call should come for your body to arm, do not shirk from that either.” Markievicz said Irishwomen were “doubly enslaved with a double battle to fight”. Following the  general election the Irish Party at Westminster was in a position to press the Liberal government to publish a Home Rule Bill. But Redmond and his party still refused to support women’s right to vote. The IWFL became more militant and Hanna and Francis founded the Irish Citizen newspaper to further the cause of women’s rights as well as Irish independence, social justice and pacism. When British politicians visited Ireland they were challenged by the IWFL. Margaret ‘Meg’ Connery confronted British Tory leader Andrew Bonar Law and Unionist leader Edward Carson when they came to Dublin. In Belfast Hanna Sheehy Skeffington challenged Winston Churchill. Margaret Cousins joined protests in England in  and was jailed for a month. In June  eight women from the IWFL smashed windows in Dublin Castle and other prominent buildings. Hanna was arrested at the Castle and she and the seven others were imprisoned in Mountjoy. The following month British Prime Minister Asquith visited Dublin and there were more protests. Three English feminists had followed Asquith to Ireland and they were also jailed for their protests. After a hunger strike in Mountjoy by the English suffragists and the IWFL women, all were released except two of the Englishwomen who were subjected to forced feeding. Many meetings of the IWFL were physically attacked at this time by Redmondites who saw the campaign for women’s suffrage as a threat to their political dominance and their relationship with the British Liberal government. In contrast, republicans such as Pádraig Mac Piarais and Thomas MacDonagh were supporters of the IWFL. The IWFL also won the support of prominent trade unionists James Larkin and James Connolly. They were closely allied with the Irish Women Workers Union in Liberty Hall and in  Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed after a confrontation with the Dublin politan Police during the Great Lockout. She was released after a six-day hunger strike. That year also saw the death in England of feminist Emily Davison who ran on to the course at the Epsom Derby and was trampled by a race horse. Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed again in  for campaigning against recruitment to the British Army. Her influence and that of the IWFL was seen in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic of  which enshrined women’s right to vote. Her friend James Connolly told her: “You will be glad to know that in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic we are including equal citizenship for women.” Hanna replied that she knew who was responsible, meaning Connolly himself. “We were practically unanimous, Only one questioned it,” replied Connolly. Francis Sheehy Skeffington was murdered in Portobello Barracks by a British Army officer during the Easter Rising. Hanna embarked on a tour of the United States to expose the truth about the murder and other British atrocities. She continued to play a leading role in the struggle for Irish freedom, as did many of the pioneering feminists of the IWFL. In  the IWFL saw its central aim achieved when women voted for the first time in the general election which resulted in a massive Sinn Féin victory, although women under  were still excluded. The IWFL actively opposed British rule and supported Dáil Éireann. For example in August  Hanna was badly beaten by the RIC who attacked a Sinn Féin meeting at which she spoke in Kilbeggan, Co. Westmeath. IWFL women went on to champion women’s rights in the decades following the Treaty when they faced the very dferent challenges of a partitioned Ireland with conservative anti-women governments North and South. The Irish Women’s Franchise League was founded  years ago on  November .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27493  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonA wreckers’ agenda is being driven by the DUP and Tory government.

They must not be allowed to destroy the democratic option formaking change in the north.It is these circumstances which bring sharply into focus theIrish governments responsibilities.Those who courageously signed this letter to the Irish government are saying the negative position of the DUP and British governmentmust not be tolerated.These are citizens who want the political institutionsre-established but only on the basis of democracy and equality.They are assertive in their resolve to see a rights basedsociety created, which guarantees rights, respect, and parity of esteem, in ashared, inclusive future.But they are not prepared to be treated as second-classcitizens in this part of Ireland.Those days are over.It is time for the Irish Government to indeed redouble itsefforts to step up to the mark by absolutely opposing the imposition ofBrexit, and guaranteeing equality and rights for all citizens in the north.An Taoiseach and the Irish Government needs to reflect verycarefully about the signicance and timing of this intervention, respondpositively and act decisively, in cooperation with the politicalrepresentatives of Irish citizens, and others in the north, to ensure thattheir democratic rights are delivered upon.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27494  ","story":"• th NOVEMBER  - Newly elected Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams Mícheál Mac DonnchaTHE Ard Fheis of  marked a signicant stage in the political development of Sinn Féin. The historic gathering came in the wake of the campaign in support of the H-Block and Armagh prisoners, the epic Hunger Strikes, the intervention of prisoner candidates, North and South, in  and Sinn Féin’s electoral rise in the Six Counties in  and .The party’s performance in the October  Assembly elections – when five republicans were elected to the body set up by British direct ruler Jim Prior – caused alarm to the SDLP and their supporters in the Establishment parties in the  Counties. Sinn Féin’s lead in boycotting the Assembly was followed by the SDLP for fear of losing further support to republicans. The Fine Gael Labour Government, led by Garret FitzGerald, set up the New Ireland Forum in Dublin mainly as a  for the SDLP. In June , the political establishment in Ireland and Britain was rocked by the election of Sinn Féin Vice-President Gerry Adams as MP for his native west Belfast. For long a leading republican activist, Adams advocated the deeper politicisation and popularisation of the republican struggle and the building of Sinn Féin across the  Counties.The British Tory government of Margaret Thatcher was also concerned at the rise of Sinn Féin. In the week before the Ard Fheis in November , Prior told Tory MPs that Ireland could become a “Cuba off Britain’s west coast”. He said he feared Sinn Féin could overtake the SDLP electorally and “we must do all we can to strengthen constitutional nationalism”. When the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis gathered in the Mansion House in Dublin on  and  November, it was set to elect a new leadership. Ruairí Ó Brádaigh had been president since  and he announced that he would not be seeking re-election. He said the four-province federal Ireland plan, of which he had been a strong advocate, had been rejected at the  Ard Fheis and his approach on other issues, including electoral strategy, had been rejected by the Ard Chomhairle.In his address, the new party president, Gerry Adams, dismissed media claims of a ‘Northern takeover’ and said:“We are not a Northern, nor a Southern party – we are an Irish republican party organised throughout Ireland.”The main theme of his speech was the need for republicans to break out of political isolation and “get among the people in the basic ways which the people accept”. In line with this approach, the Ard Fheis voted to contest European Parliament elections with the intention of taking seatsthey were won. This followed the expansion of party electoral strategy the previous year. The Ard Fheis coincided with a by-election campaign for the Dáil seat of Dublin Central, which was contested by Sinn Féin candidate Christy Burke, turning in a creditable performance. There was further controversy after the Ard Fheis, and discomfort for Fianna Fáil leaders in particular, when Gerry Adams was confirmed as the main speaker at the annual Kilmichael commemoration in west Cork. Gerry Adams was elected president of Sinn Féin at the Ard Fheis of November ,  years ago.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27495  ","story":" Robbie SmythOver the last  years Irishsociety has evolved and transformed in many ways.

Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27500  ","story":"• John James Kelly, Jimmy Joe Reynolds and Charlie #Cathal# McCafferty Staff ReporterThe three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof.On  November , IRA Volunteers blew up six customs posts along the border in Counties Armagh and Fermanagh.

The pair of Sir Knights enjoyed their first mock battle between King William and King James, in their respective roles, during the summer.Craig, from Richhill, admits the Scarva showpiece is a particular personal highlight, having assumed such office.He said: “I enjoy the interaction and opportunity to meet other people. We were fortunate to have been invited by the outgoing Lord Mayor to launch the Thirteenth, and promote our official charity. It is very rewarding to walk in front of the banner at Scarva, after months of planning, seeing all the spectators and Sir Knights enjoying themselves, with preferably nice weather!”The project coordinator, who only recently got married, acknowledges the extra responsibility of preparing for one of the flagship events of the parading season.“There’s a lot of meetings! We liaise with ious stakeholders in order to make the day possible, which means a lot of evenings are taken up, especially the closer we get to July. I must admit, I didnt appreciate the work that goes into organising the event until I was elected into office. “The deputy master and I are only two cogs of the wheel though, as there is a dedicated team who work tirelessly, giving up their time without any hesitation to put on the best parade of the year. “However, when you hit the Demesne, and see the tens of thousands of people enjoying themselves, it makes it all worth it.” Craig maintains he and Andrew have a close bond, having a shared interest in sport, and more importantly both “wanting the best for the preceptory”.As for their partnership demystying the perception that the Royal Black is an “older man’s” organisation, Craig retorts: “Yes, I would say so. I know many of my friends are all active members throughout the organisation. For those that argue it is an old mans organisation, I would say, join, get involved and help change that perception.”Andrew, from Donaghmore, said he enjoyed holding office with the Scarva preceptory.“There are not many preceptories with a young leadership like RBP  but it’s important to have experience from the older members to guide us in our decisions and actions,” he said.Temperatures set to plummet tonight Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"“If the presence of Craig and myself encourages younger people to join the Institution, then that can only be a positive.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"football tops at coca cola plant causing division says local man","story":"A COCA-COLA worker has described working conditions at the multinational’s Lambeg plant as “intimidating and antagonising” for Catholic employees as breaches of the company’s policy on work clothing are on the rise.The man said that though the wearing of football tops is expressly banned, Rangers and Northern Ireland jerseys are routinely worn by members of staff with no action being taken. And he added that despite the fact that Remembrance Sunday was marked almost a fortnight ago, poppies are still being displayed by some staff – with some workers opting for the double-whammy of a banned football and the remembrance symbol.“Employees here are brazenly walking around in Rangers and Northern Ireland tops even though everybody knows the rules,” our source inside the factory said. “It’s not asCoca-Cola is a wee firm that employs two or three people in a shed. It’s a massive global company with strict rules in place to ensure harmony and equality and yet nothing is being done. People see other people wearing football tops and they think, ‘Oh, that’s allowed now.’ And the poppies are still around too as well as other symbols used by one side of the community. Sometimes they’re pinned to the banned jerseys.”The worker said that Catholic members of staff are disappointed by the lack of action by senior members of staff. He added that things would continue to get worse until existing policy is enforced.“Management have yet to do anything about it,” he said. No-one is even being talked to never mind disciplined for their actions.“Personally, I feel antagonised, intimidated and fearful working in a place that is allowing this to continue and I know others do too. This is a place of work and people should be able to come to work without being in fear or intimidated in this manner.”A spokesperson for Coca-Cola denied any knowledge of football shirts being worn in at the plant but pointed out that the wearing of poppies all year round is acceptable.“We are not aware of any recent instances of employees wearing football shirts at work. Doing so would be in contravention of our unorm and dress code policy. This follows the guidance of the NI Equality Commission which states that the wearing of football shirts has the potential to disrupt a good and harmonious working environment.“In line with the Commission’s guidance, we do not prohibit the wearing of a poppy at work.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"four generations during four decades","story":"JOHN Paul II Youth Club in Ardoyne was founded in  amidst violence that would mark the year as one of the bloodiest of the recent conflict.The youth club’s first home was in a disused shop on Herbert Street, just yards from where a number of nationalist were burnt out of their homes just a few years earlier.Jacqui Maguire, a senior youth worker at John Paul II, was just nine years old when she attended the club’s first ever event on Halloween night in its formative year, and has been involved with the club ever since.Reflecting on those early days, Jacqui recalled how, in the hardest of times, local people rallied to provide a safe haven for young people who needed refuge from regular rioting and shootings on the nearby Crumlin Road.“The kids needed social interaction, but they were getting out of school and then going into the house because of the shooting and the rioting,” she explained.“There was an old shop that they cleared out and used for discos and wee parties.“The word went about that there was a youth club opening and everybody came from everywhere. In the beginning it was just used as a place for the kids in the street to play, but it just got bigger and bigger.“It was used as a nursery and mothers would meet there at night-time. It was like a social club rather than a youth club.“At the time Mr McLaughlin in St Gabriel’s said there werelads at the school who needed apprenticeships, so he would have brought them down and they were doing a bit bricklaying and plumbing and cleaned up the building.”Despite its less-than-humble beginnings, Jacqui’s early memories of the youth club are happy ones of a community that did its best in dficult circumstances. She recalls discos in Herbert Street, sports competitions and – despite it being the height of the Troubles – cross-community trips away. It was also those formative years that set Jacqui on the path to youth work. “Every night there was something dferent going on,” she recalled.“We also went on cross community trips, and we went to Cork with Cedar Lodge Youth Club. We used to go to Cork in the week of July. Later on we would have gone to Donegal. It was really a way to keep us off the streets.”She continued: “The club got us to do wee junior committees, got us to volunteer and help the young ones, and it stopped us being out there causing trouble. That’s the way we run this club as well. There are all dferent age groups that help with the younger ones. It’s called peer leading now, but it wouldn’t have been called that in those days.”Moving from an old disused shop to two burnt-out houses in the area that were renovated, the youth club eventually got its own purpose built building, which was opened by Liverpool and Ireland player Steve Heighway in . That came after local people, including Jacqui’s father Owen Maguire, and her late mother Bridie Maguire, lobbied the then Secretary of State, Lord Melchett, to obtain £, in funding for the club’s new home.While kids with few other facilities flocked to John Paul II Youth Club in its early days, the club has only grown since then. Two years ago a new extension was built at the club and plans are already under way to build a new amphitheatre and all-purpose sports pitch in early .John Paul II Youth Club has been an integral part of the lives of many people in Ardoyne. Jacqui represents just one of four generations of her family who are currently involved with the club and said its growth is a real source of pride to her.“It’s hard to believe that a group of women way back in the s even knew about social policy, or knew how to take those steps to build a club,” she said.“I will also say that it has been the members and the community that have been the backbone of the club. We could see what it did for us and we want to make sure pass that on to the next generation and the generations after that.“It’s a safe haven for the kids. Our young people know they can come in and there is enough staff of dferent ages and dferent levels for them to work with them. Young people will have particular staff that they will really gel with. We have a lot of programmes, a lot of personal development, a lot of buddy programmes, but it doesn’t all have to be high-flying – sometimes it can just be sitting down with somebody to talk.”Like all community groups, John Paul II Youth Club has had its challenges, particularly in the area of funding. However, volunteer hours, care and hard work from staff members combine to keep the club open six days a week. For the young people, the outcome is better social lives, learning opportunities, and the instilling of a strong set of values amongst which empathy is to the fore.“Our motto is sharing is caring,” Jacqui said.“They learn acceptance and understanding of others. It doesn’t matter who they are or what they are – you respect them. It doesn’t matter what anybody’s issues are, you always give them a second chance, because we can all mess up first chances.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"newly published childrens book aims to teach important message for a worthy cause","story":"A new children’s book, designed to introduce small children to the world’s big issues and aid vital charity work, is the latest work of West Belfast woman Arlene Gormley.Co-founder of the Feeding Dreams Cambodia charity, Arlene has penned, designed and illustrated ‘ Not A Fairytale’ describing how even from a young age we can work to make the planet better for now and future generations.Feeding Dreams Cambodia was founded in  and offers free education and nutrition for  children in Cambodia’s tourist capital of Siem Reap. The charity receives no government funding and relies solely on donations, most of which comes from support and fundraising drives in Belfast. Arlene explained how the book is based on the  United Nations Sustainable Development Goalsthat recognise ending poverty and other deprivations must go hand-in-hand with strategies that improve health and education.“Our approach at Feeding Dreams is holistic,” explained Arlene. “ Our programmes in education, medical care, community support, vocational training, they are all interlinked, so when the UN announced the  Goals, it helped give us the framework and language for our strategy. Since each of our programmes can be tied to one of the  SDGs and the Cambodian government ratied the SDGs, it gave us legitimacy and credibility.”“I decided to create a handmade book introducing the SDGs to young children through colourful pictures with simplistic explanations. The book was originally intended as a keepsake for my four-year-old niece Zara but the message has struck a chord with parents and teachers. I’m holding a book launch on Saturday in the city centre’s Learning Space store and all sales from the book will go towards the work of the charity. “During the Christmas period people are very generous with their donations but it’s when all the rush calms down and we go into what we call our ‘leaner’ months of January, February that we need that extra push make sure all the children receive a proper, balanced meal.”Arlene became a mother herself in August and is now more determined than ever to ensure her daughter Julia has a keen understanding of the world around her.“Children are born into an uncertain and unequal world and parents worry about the kind of environment their children grow up in. It’s important to me that my daughter understands from a early age about important issues that will affect her future, like climate change, access to health and education, and the importance of equality.” The Queen’s University graduate spoke of how the visually striking picture book was “something a little dferent” for the bedtime hour. “It’s a great way to sit with a child and read each chapter, look at the illustrations, it’s a great tool to show what is going on in the world and at the same time contribute to the work of Feeding Dreams.”Arlene will be signing copies of her book at Fountain Centre’s Learning Space store on Saturday, December  from am until noon.

More than , local children live in homes haunted by poverty.That means families with increasing debts, choices between ‘heat or eat’, teenagers with a limited or non-existent social le and an increased risk of chronic illness.”She continued: “Children living in poverty also consistently underperform at school and find it harder to get a job when they leave.“The highest levels of poverty are to be found in the Colin Glen and Falls areas,” she added.North Belfast follows closely behind the West Belfast statistics with , children living in child poverty. In South Belfast the figures are just over half of this with , children affected. East Belfast stands at ,.Research by Save the Children has shown that around  per cent of parents in poverty say their children have to go without new shoes when they need them and a large number of children in poverty say they are missing out on things that many other children take for granted, such as going on school trips and having a warm coat in winter.“The introduction of Universal Credit, cuts to health and education budgets, pressures on community, voluntary and youth services all compound the problems already affecting thousands of local families – many of them with a least one partner working, it is unforgivable,” said Ms Lowry.“While in Government Sinn Féin and the DUP refused to implement the promised Anti- Poverty Strategy and sent powers relating to Universal Credit to Westminster. As a result thousands of local children and their families continue to suffer a hardship and deprivation that will haunt them for the rest of their lives.“If there is a more important political priority in West Belfast than addressing child poverty, then perhaps some local MLAs would like to tell me about it.”Commenting on the report and its findings West Belfast MP Paul Maskey said that the issue of child poverty needs to #reduce and reduce rapidly#.#In my view one child living in poverty is one too many. This is a very detailed report and lists each area in West Belfast and the worst affected."},{"url":null,"title":"belfast telegraph brexit survey have your say and you could win a 100","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The leading architect revealed he had received more than a dozen unsolicited emails from engineers and geologists inquiring about the project since the speech on Saturday. “It has been bubbling along since January,” said Professor Dunlop. “I thought that was the end of it, and then something  happens.“And then with Boris Johnson, Karen Bradley and the DUP bringing it up again, it just seems like a potential story and narrative which keeps moving on.”Last week the bridge was raised during a discussion in the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee in Westminster. Responding to a question from the DUP’s Ian Paisley, Secretary of State Karen Bradley said she was willing to have a discussion about commissioning a feasibility study on the bridge, but noted there were issues around the sea bed and the current site of the proposed bridge link. Addressing the DUP annual conference on Saturday, former foreign secretary Mr Johnson said proposals for a bridge link were being held back by the “absence of political will”. “I think that there will be a feasibility study, which is all I can ask for. That’s all I’ve ever asked for,” said Professor Dunlop.“I am not suggesting for a moment it is going to be a walk in the park. Instead people providing opinions about whether it can be done or not, it would be good to actually get the facts.”Boris Johnson backs bridge linking Northern Ireland and ScotlandSDLP MLA criticises Paisley for obsessing over Northern Ireland to Scotland bridgeMr Johnson first expressed his support for a bridge back in June, when he called for the proposal to be taken “seriously”. Mr Dunlop first envisioned the idea for the bridge link after being asked to do so by a newspaper in Scotland. He laid out two proposals for the route — one from Larne and Portpatrick, potentially costing around £bn or a shorter crossing between the Mull of Kintyrne and Torr Head, which could cost between £bn and £bn.The proposal received a boost in March after a spokesman for the Scottish Government said it would “initiate discussions to explore improving connectivity” between the island of Ireland and Scotland, adding it was important “that all options are fully considered”."},{"url":null,"title":"tributes paid after pride of ardoyne bandsman passes away","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Sinn Feins OMuilleoir pleased summons for driving charge withdrawn  Alex Kane: Northern Ireland plc took its Brexit case to Downing Street because there was no one at home on the Hill The Taoiseach said he had followed proceedings of the Northern Ireland inquiry into the so-called “cash for ash scheme” which caused the collapse of the Belfast power-sharing government in January .Mr Varadkar said he was surprised to learn that Sinn Fein had a greater role than was earlier realised. He pointed to emails, unearthed in the inquiry, from then Sinn Fein finance minister in Belfast, Mairtin O Muilleoir.The Taoiseach said Mr O Muilleoir had at one point emailed “a senior republican,” Ted Howell, who did not hold any elected office, seeking clearance to sign-off for a business plan related to the heating scheme by Wednesday.“That is documentary evidence that Sinn Fein ministers seek approval and consent from ‘senior republicans’ when it comes to major decisions in government,” Mr Varadkar told the Dail.“I’m just curious to knowDeputy McDonald would want to  comment on that, or expand on that, and maybe inform us of the extent she and her front bench require approval from senior republicans for decisions,” the Taoiseach added.The Sinn Fein leader said the Taoiseach should await publication of the full report on the controversial Northern Ireland heat scheme. She said it would record “the central role of the DUP in the affair.”“At that stage you can make your assessment on an informed basis,” Ms McDonald said.Ms McDonald accused Fine Gael and Fianna Fail of “playing politics” with Northern Irelands current problems and said the Government had an obligation under the Good Friday Agreement to be impartial. She also argued that Sinn Fein continues to represent the people in Northern Ireland, unlike the other two parties which are confined to the Republic.\" title\"Mary Lou McDonald \" width\"\" \"\"  \" title\"Mary Lou McDonald \" width\"\" \"\"  Mary Lou McDonald “There is a split in the executive over Brexit. The DUP are pro-Brexit,” Ms McDonald said. She added that the party is ready to try again to get the North’s power-sharing up and running, and the party was very disappointed when a near-agreement with the DUP last February failed.Mr Martin criticised Sinn Fein for not taking its seven Westminster seats as Ireland faced the biggest economic challenge in  years, while the absence of a Northern Ireland power-sharing government and parliament left Northern Ireland without a voice.

I hope new hotel investment, which would provide the local economy with a signicant boost, can be realised, he added.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman confirmed that the council undertook a study to review hotel provision across the district and identied additional need specically within the Newcastle area.ldquoThe council has carried out an initial feasibility study on the Newcastle Centre site which identied that a hotel could be built on the site. General discussions have subsequently taken place with a number of potential developers about hotel provision in the Newcastle area,rsquorsquo he continued.ldquoThe council is also currently working with a consultant on the feasibility study for leisure provision in the Newcastle area and it is anticipated that a report will be presented to the Active and Healthy Communities Committee in the coming months..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Castlewellan wildlife activist recognised by Prime Minster  ","story":"A CASTLEWELLAN teenager has been recognised by Prime Minister Theresa May for urging young people to protect the environment.Fourteen year-old Dara McAnulty is one of the latest recipients of the the Points of Light award, which recognises outstanding volunteers who are making a change in their community and inspiring others.He was presented with his award at an event held at Kew Gardens in London last week.Mrs May wrote to Dara congratulating him on his achievement.ldquoThrough your award-winning blog, you are encouraging young people to support their local environment and learn about the importance of conservation, she said.ldquoYour writing is raising awareness of how nature can help people cope with autism and you should feel proud of this remarkable achievement.Dara has been a driving force behind the Grassroots Challenge run by Ulster Wildle.In his blog he encourages other people his age to make videos of the out-doors and at the same time participate in conservation.Dara, who is autistic, says he is inspired by the beauty of the Mourne countryside on his doorstep and that developing a connection with nature helps him manage his anxiety.This in turn helped him to open the door for other people his age to become conservation enthusiasts too.Dara said: ldquoI am honoured to receive the Points of Light award. I sincerely hope that it shines a light on how vital nature is to us all, our mental health, our wellbeing and the survival of all le.ldquoWe need more young voices to speak up and take action for nature though. I will continue my work and hope that many more will follow.Dara recently worked with Springwatch presenter Chris Packham on The Peoplersquos Walk for Wildlecampaign.He spoke to , people at Hyde Park about conservation and also completed a -mile walk that raised over pound, to tag and record threatened birds of prey.He is soon to publish a book called lsquoDiary of a Young Naturalistrsquo based on his blog, which won runner-up in the BBC Wildle Magazine Blogger Awards.Charlotte Hill, CEO of Step Up To Serve, which coordinates the #iwill campaign, said: ldquoWe know that young people have the energy, ideas and drive to address issues in their community and to tackle many of societyrsquos tougher challenges.ldquoWe are so pleased to see the Prime Minister recognising the astounding achievements that Dara has made through his volunteering, fundraising and campaigning, and hope this inspires Dara and other young people to continue their fantastic work..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Class act Connolly secures final spot  ","story":"RYAN Connolly was the hero of the hour as Olympic claimed their spot in the Bobby Dalzell Cup final and also claimed the bragging rights in Ballynahinch.Connolly made two saves in the penalty shoot-out and then converted the decisive spot kick at the end of a largely forgettable semi-final at Bignian Park on Friday night.Olympic will face either Killough or Celtic Bhoys, who meet this Friday night in the second semi-final at the same venue, in the Newcastle Leaguersquos Boxing Day showpiece at Drumaness.There was little to cheer the good-sized crowd who braved the Mourne chill well into the night.One hundred and ten minutes of football produced barely a handful of chances, which meant that all the excitement was reserved for the spot kick shoot-out.Connolly had little to do over normal and extra time, but he produced the goods when it mattered and was mobbed by his delighted team-mates after putting his spot kick past Raymond Tate in the YM goal.However, Olympic know they will have up their gamethey are to pose a threat to either Killough or Celtic Bhoys in the final.Neither they nor YM could be faulted for effort. The players ran their socks off and there was plenty of commitment. The tackling was hard, but fair, and it was a credit to the spirit in which the tie was played that not a single player was yellow-carded.The first half chance of the match fell to nippy YM striker Aaron Cheevers, who was almost through on goal, but was thwarted when Connolly came quickly off his line to save.Jack Roddy then headed narrowly over for Olympic and not long afterwards Olympic were awarded a free kick outside the box following Richard Annettrsquos challenge on Shane Rodgers. Unfortunately, Darryl Russell shot tamely against the wall.The best chance of the half fell to Olympic just after the half hour. Following a corner Gary Wilsonrsquos shot was cleared off the line and Roddy blazed over the bar.Cheevers was always a threat up front for the YM. On  minutes he was clean through, but again Connolly came out to thwart the danger. On  minutes he came within inches of putting his head on a cross by the impressive Wilson and just before the break his flicked header were narrowly wide.Ten minutes into the second half Olympicrsquos Simon Marmion found Joshua Fennell with a long pass, only for Fennell to shoot over from outside the penalty area on the right side.Four minutes later Damian Travers found himself with space in the box, but his left-footed shot was easilysaved by Connolly.On  minutes YMrsquos Sam Annett let fly, but his shot took a deflection off an Olympic defender for a corner.Both sides made a number of changes to break the deadlock and with five minutes to go YM substitute James Croskery shot low and hard, but straight at Connolly.The breakthrough nearly came moments later when Wilson delivered a dangerous free kick into the YM box, but Adam McDowell and Lee Maxwell couldnrsquot get a touch.In the first period of extra time, Rhys Patterson thought he had won it for Olympic, but Tate pulled off a great save.Just at the end of the second period Ronnie Johnston shot inches wide for YM after a good cross from the left by Adam McDowell.But the goals didnrsquot come and in the end it was all down to a penalty shoot-out.

The council also hopes to acquire match funding from central government.Among the key issues identied by council officials is either restricting or banning altogether unsorted black bin bag waste. Thousands of people regularly empty a iety waste into the bin bags and take them to the recycling centres. But that could be about to change.Council officials also want to vigorously challenge the perception that the centres are viewed by many as ldquodumps and reinforce the message that they are for recycled waste only.They say the misuse of the centres has potential cost implications for the authority, with the review examining detailed guidelines and systems which are required for what is being described as the ldquoproper operation of the recycling centres.The review examined entrance policies and a potential restriction or complete ban on large vans using the centres with a daily restriction on the amount of waste the facilities can receive.There is also growing concern at senior management level that a signicant amount of the waste being taken to recycling centres ends up in the general waste stream as it cannot be recycled. Council officials say addressing this issue will cut costs and produce savings.Last night, politicians were asked for permission to complete a detailed report on the way forward, based on the evidence gathered during the review process, with a particular focus on centre opening hours and staffing levels that must be achieved at no extra cost.Councillors were told the report will also make a recommendation to harmonise policies and procedures across all current recycling centres in the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area.Over recent months, local politicians have expressed concern at a number of fly-tipping and illegal dumping incidents across the district, with several taking place within a stonersquos throw of the Cloonagh Road facility in Downpatrick.This particular facility has long since passed its sell-by-date with work on a poundm replacement at the nearby Flying Horse Road currently underway.

It has also argued that the current application represents the ldquobest value for money.ldquoThe RNLI applies the highest standards and practices to all its applications for its facilities. The site chosen, from what was available, is the one that represents the best location and value for money for the Institution.That assertion is one that has been challenged by the LEYC who has said in its letter to members: ldquoWe also believe that the cost of the new site will be considerably more expensive overall with higher ongoing maintenance and cost and therefore a waste of donations.The LEYC also claim that the RNLI have changed their mind over the site of its proposed new station: ldquoWhen we originally discussed the proposed site with the RNLI they told us that they preferred to build as part of a bigger development as originally it was submitted as part of a bigger development plan. They later changed this to saying that the newer site would give them more visibility and potential footfall despite it being obvious that the original site was much more public facing.The LEYC also asserts that the original site it refers to would not require as much dredging as what is being proposed by the RNLI. In its letter however the LEYC stated that ldquowe are supporters of the RNLI and any objection we have is only to the proposed siting of the boathouse and should not be interpreted as any fallout with the local volunteers who we respect and support.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But he insisted that the PM’s plan – agreed by EU leaders at a Brussels summit last Sunday – would “minimise” the economic damage.Reacting to the analysis, Sinn Fein’s Northern Ireland leader Michelle O’Neill claimed it “confirms the absurdity of the DUP’s position on Brexit” and called on the party to “accept that, while there is no good Brexit, the withdrawal agreement is the least worst option available”.“Brexit is economic vandalism and it beggars belief that the DUP is still prepared to crash our economy in pursuit of a reckless unionist agenda,” she said.Responding, Mr Paisley said: “Sinn Fein have accepted the chancellor’s analysis and so are knowingly canvassing support for something which would damage our economy. \"  \"  Royal Mail white powder discovery - substance was non-hazardous Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“The choice is not between this deal and no deal. Others may wish to give up, but the DUP wants to see a better way forward and an agreement that can benefit all parts of the United Kingdom.”Arguing that Mr Hammond’s comments “highlight the need to seek a better deal”, the North Antrim MP continued: “Once again the public are being faced with a  choice when the chancellor frames his economic predictions between either the withdrawal agreement as it currently stands or leaving the EU with no deal.“What the chancellor does recognise, however, is that the withdrawal agreement is not good for the United Kingdom. Last week the chancellor admitted the backstop is bad for the economy and bad for the Union. There is no enthusiasm for this deal and it appears destined to be rejected by Parliament.“Now is the time to look beyond the current deal, to bin the backstop and work on finding a better way forward. This process could commence now instead of waiting until after the House of Commons has its say and the government is then directed to think again. It’s time to grasp the nettle and seek a better way forward.”try catch     .               ..

Dogs are wonderful at pretending they understand everything you say especiallyyou are saying it near the cupboard where the treats reside.The whole sorry saga of Brexit is impossible to escape.I was about to roll up a page of newspaper to light the fire only to be drawn to the headline at the top: ‘The EU will turn us into captiveswe sign up to this appalling sell-out.’ It was the latest rant in the Dailyfrom Boris Johnson, who wants the Northern Ireland backstop scrapped with both sidesto simply ‘commit to avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland by the use of new unobtrusive checks and discussions of the future economic partnership’ where, he says ‘the Irish discussion rightly belongs’.suitcases packed.That was the day before Sinn Fein’s president Mary Lou McDonald was shouting at the top of her voice about the DUP being out of step on Brexit and ‘must face reality’. Now, I wonder what that reality might be  Seconds later she was urging Arlene Foster to “wake up and smell the coffee”. This is the very same Mary Lou who claims to have “no regrets” over her handling of the Mairia Cahill case. Mary Lou can shout all she wants. Only her own side will be listening.The Northern Ireland born Labour MP for Vauxhall Kate Hoey had a lot to say this week too. Ms Hoey informs us she has “ploughed through” the  pages of the proposed withdrawal agreement plus the explanation notes – that makes her a hero in my eyes – and declares that “Northern Ireland, to all intents and purposes, becomes separated in many ways from the rest of the United Kingdom”, with the backstop arrangements looking like they were written by the Irish government.All in all it means that the Republic of Ireland would, effectively, be representing Northern Ireland in the EU, she believes. A highly respected politician, one not given to exaggeration, I would say she has got it right. That was one page of newspaper I saved from the flames.Then, of course, there are the Scots whose nationalism is getting a fresh kick from the Brexit chaos.Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s First Minister, accuses Theresa May of asking people to “take a blindfold leap off a clf” with her Brexit deal. Ms Sturgeon, as we all know, has her heart set on independence for Scotland. She may yet be successful second time around. How amazing it is that women are playing such a big role in the whole Brexit saga.Years ago Margaret Thatcher had the political field all to herself. Had she been in charge today she would long ago have hand-bagged Jean-Claude Junker and the elegant Mr Barnier into submission.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was an unusual thing to say.Mr Sargeantrsquos son Jack and his we Bernadette attended the hearing The inquest was told there were text messages between the leader and deputy leader of Flintshire County Council, Aaron Shotton and Bernie Attridge, in which Mr Attridge said Mr Sargeant would be ldquoshitting bricks.Cathryn McGahey QC, representing the First Minister, said in the message, sent on November , Mr Attridge referred to MPs in Westminster being exposed and said AMs would be ldquoon the hitlist.In a message sent two days after Mr Sargeant was sacked, Mr Attridge said he wished to discourage members of the local Labour Party from supporting Mr Sargeant and implied he had done something which could lead to imprisonment, Ms McGahey said.Coroner for North WalesJohn Gittins ruled he would not hear evidence from witnesses relating to the messages.The court heard that in  Mr Jones received an anonymous letter which said Mr Sargeant was ldquonot fit to be around women.The First Minister said he showed the letter to Mr Sargeant and told him to ldquobe careful.ldquoThere is obviously somebody who is watching you and watching your behaviour so be careful and be careful where you go and how much you drink, he said.He added that Mr Sargeant would ldquoquite often drink a fair bit and kept company with a ldquohard-drinking bunch.Mr Jones said that in  another allegation was reported to him but that the woman involved did not want to make a complaint so he did not inform Mr Sargeant.In  he initially heard rumours of inappropriate behaviour towards two women by Mr Sargeant and later learned their names and received written statements.Mr Jones said he felt it was ldquoright to contact the woman who made an allegation in  and ask againshe wanted to make a formal complaint as other circumstances had come to light.He told the court he had not been aware Mr Sargeant suffered from depression.Mr Jones was asked by the coroner whether there had been any changes in terms of the support offered to ministers who lost their roles since Mr Sargeantrsquos death.He said: ldquoThe dficulty is this ndash the answer to the question is no ndash formally there is no employment relationship between the Welsh Government and ministers.The inquest is expected to continue until Friday..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title:  uNot appropriate u to discuss allegations at time, First Minister tells inquest article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  comments        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg --\"Most popularMost commentedLoading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos nowMost popularCommentedLoading...Read more         ,CommentsSorry, an error occurred.Thank YouYour complaint has been sent to the site administrators.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentContact UsPhoto SalesNewsquest PrintingAdvertiseArchiveSite MapAnnouncementsLeapExchange and MartDatingTerms  ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyManage ConsentTerms of AdvertisingContributor TermsDiversity StatementIpsoregulatedThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Since Wednesday evening, several cabinet members have resigned, opposed to what they see is a softening of Theresa May’s position on leaving the EU. Essentially, for Northern Ireland’s business community in particular, it would remain part of the same customs territory as the rest of the UK and the entire area would be subject to \"level playing field\" commitments requiring the UK to follow EU rules in areas like animal welfare, environmental and workplace protections. Northern Ireland would be in a deeper customs relationship with the EU than where in the UK, and more closely tied to EU market rules. But what do Northern Ireland business groups think   Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “While it will take some time to go through the  plus pages of the agreement, on the face of it this document provides some reassurance to our industry and the NI consumer. “It provides solutions to customs, tarfs, an innovative solution on VAT, support for the Peace Process and a possible longer transition period. There certainly is some work to be done by both the Westminster Government and  the EU on the checks and administration for goods coming in to Northern Ireland from GB. “That will need to be light touch and be mitigated in further agreements, hopefully to an absolute bare minimum. However this agreement must pass through Parliament. We have always said the backstop is better than no deal.”   Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director-general “After  months of debate, this agreement by Cabinet is progress. It moves the UK one step away from the nightmare precipice of no deal and the harm it would cause to communities across the country. Securing a transition period has long been firms’ top priority and every day that passes without one means lost investment and jobs, hitting the most vulnerable hardest. “Time is now up. This deal is a compromise, including for business, but it offers that essential transitional period as a step back from the clf-edge. \"More clarity on the final relationship is needed, and uncertainty remains high, but this is an important step forward. “Transition and the backstop are not the intended permanent solutions for either side, but should pave the way for more work on the future deal. This must secure frictionless trade, ambitious access for our world-beating services, and a say over future rules. “The UK has had many months of discussion and ision. A long journey still lies ahead but now is the time for decisions. And the first decision is to avoid no deal.”  Retail NI chief executive, Glyn Roberts and Hospitality Ulster, Colin Neill  “This is a complex and detailed document which needs considerable analysis and further clarication from the UK Government. “We will be consulting our respective memberships on this document and we will set out in greater detail our views when we have completed this process. “Both our organisations have always sought a deal that ensures no delays in the supply chain, which promotes bridges rather than borders and above all , ensures that Northern Ireland businesses have full and free access to the EU and UK single markets. “Retail and Hospitality are two of Northern Ireland’s leading sectors of industry and our voice needs to be heard as this draft deal moves toward a vote in the House of Commons”  Michael Hall, managing partner, EY Northern Ireland “Business will clearly welcome last night’s announcement in that there is now better clarity on the terms of a deal however many will also be reluctant to put contingency plans on hold until there is a stronger signal on whether this will hold politically in the UK and Europe. “The backstop guarantee is a positive development for NI firms operating on an all-island basis, not least the restatement that both sides intend to work towards a free trade agreement longer term, which should not be overlooked. “The scale of political uncertainty and the volatility which this creates can be seen in the signicant currency fluctuations we have witnessed in the past  hours. Firms should not take this lightly and as such, factor these continued unknowns into their scenario planning. “On the positive side, Northern Ireland businesses have continued to expand and employ more people in the period since the Brexit referendum, which we remain hopeful they will continue to do as we look towards a further period of uncertainty. “By focusing on business fundamentals and contingency planning, firms will arm themselves so that they are ready to act when the road ahead becomes clearer.”  FSB NI policy chairman, Tina McKenzie “Businesses have been calling for months for agreement to be reached between the UK and EU negotiators, so it can only be welcome that a text has been agreed and approved by the Cabinet. “We are acutely aware of the political machinations which are ongoing, however it must be remembered that without an agreed withdrawal agreement, the UK will crash out in March , without a transition period, nor agreement on citizens’ rights, nor any plan to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. “While the exact nature of the backstop is being robustly debated, it must be remembered that the backstop will only take effectthe future relationship fails to deliver a frictionless border, after December . “We believe that the Withdrawal Agreement is a signicant step back from the clf edge which would result in a chaotic no deal Brexit that would be deeply damaging and dangerous for our small firms. “We would encourage all political actors to keep this in mind as we move forward.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Christmas1.jpg","title":"thought about the christmas party its just a few weeks away","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by Ulster Business A time for giving, the festive party is an event that puts the spotlight firmly on employer gratitude. Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding.

People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety.

Recruitment firm Hays says among NI-based employers, % said they expect to hire additional staff in the next year, compared to a UK average of %. That’s the highest percentage in the last five years. Meanwhile, % of firms polled said they had experienced some form of skills shortage within the past year, against a UK average of %. The survey also showed that some Northern Ireland employers are finding it harder to recruit staff, due to lower levels of unemployment leading to a rise in wages. John Moore, managing director of Hays in Northern Ireland, said: “Employers in Northern Ireland told us they are pressing ahead with business plans and are generally optimistic about the wider economic climate for the next two to five years. Recruitment expectations are at their highest levels for five years, for both temporary and permanent roles. “Increased competition for talent coupled with skills shortages has helped support above UK-average salary growth in Northern Ireland. While that is positive for those seeking new employment it also has downsides, including negative impacts on productivity, staff morale and the ability to deliver projects. “Given the intense competition and, at times, unrealistic salary requirements from candidates, it’s never been more important for employers to understand the complex factors that influence employee movement. “Salary is still a top consideration, but candidates are now influenced by other benefits, such as le balance and career progression opportunities. However, only % of employers surveyed saw work le balance as a priority, compared with % of employees.” The survey is based on responses from almost , employers and professionals working in a range of industries, including almost  in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/les_1.jpg","title":"a word from the wise les mccracken","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by Ulster Business Name: Les McCracken Position: Managing director, McCue Crafted Fit How did you get to the position you are in today I’m a big believer in work ethic. When I was young,  or so, I had a summer job on a farm. I would have milked  cows, morning and night, in addition to general duties around the farm. I was probably working  hours a week at that time, plus cycling five miles back and forth. It has stood me in good stead throughout my le. If you apply yourself, you can do anything.What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  In short, people. They are the greatest assets to a company but they can also be the biggest challenge. I’ve been fortunate enough to build a fantastic team around me at McCue but that has taken time. I’ve been here over  years and we’ve organically grown over that period from  employees and a turnover of £, to  employees and £m. It is also worth noting that in our sector there is a lack of skilled people, when you train them up some leave, which is disappointing but you have to train them and hope they stay. More must be done to engender the younger generation in to these skilled jobs. Too many are still going aimlessly in to third level education not knowing what they want to do, whereas they can earn as you learn in a trade, and that is much needed across the manufacturing sector.How would you describe your management style  I like to think I have a good management style, most of the time I’m very easy going and I do believe in autonomy. I expect those with responsibility to be capable and willing to do their job to the highest of their ability. I also have an open door policy allowing anyone to come and discuss problems but please bring with you a solution too.This allows my team to complete projects around the world from Vienna to Milan to Stockholm. We’ve been very fortunate to work with great brands, both in retail and hospitality, and on some fantastic projects from Ten Trinity Square in London to Danske Bank in Belfast and around Northern Ireland.What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  Of course, who wouldn’t say things could be done dferently, and better  Nobody is perfect, there’s always room for improvement. If I was to work until I was  years old, I would still learn something new every day.Have you done it all on your own  No, of course not. Who does  After  years I’ve a fantastic team who are very competent and trustworthy. But it has taken hard work and graft to get here. Today is very dferent to  years ago and for me I chose the right path. Today, you can enter this sector via a trade, an apprenticeship or a university background it’s about the right fit and enjoying what you do.How would you like your business to be remembered  McCue Crafted Fit is bigger than I. It’s been going for  years and providing unquestionable quality work. Like Jimmy McCue, who set this company up, when I choose to go, I hope to be remembered as a good leader who left the company in the best possible shape. Thirty years is a long time to be managing director and I have seen many changes in skill base, technology from hand drawn floor plans to full colour D fully explosive plans. It certainly has been an interesting three decades or so. I’d also like to note that McCue weathered the recession very well. I took some strategic decisions in  and , which ensured we not only held our own, but grew as a company.What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you Be patient. Time will come. Don’t think you know everything, as each day you’ll learn something new.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/k11.jpg","title":"kainos sees profits and sales surge","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland IT firm Kainos has seen a sales and profits surge with revenue rising by % to £.m for the first half of the year. And boss Brendan Mooney says it is “disappointing” that a political argument around Brexit is “over-shadowing” the business case, which is largely supportive of the withdrawal deal currently on the table. The company, which has it headquarters in Belfast, saw adjusted pre-tax profit rising % - from £.m to £.m, in the six months to the end of September. It says much of the increase is down to the expansion of its Workday business throughout Europe. It says “to support the continued expansion with our Workday-related business, in Europe we continue to grow from our recently established offices in Frankfurt and Copenhagen, alongside our existing offices in Amsterdam and Gdansk”. “In North America we continue to expand our presence in Boston and Atlanta and we will open an office in Toronto in the next few weeks.” Brendan Mooney, the firm’s chief executive, told Ulster Business “There is no single reason or new reason .” He said the firms government commercial work was still a very strong part of the business, with a move towards digitalisation. “In Workday, as it rolls out across the world, there is great demand for the service as well. “There is underlying geographical expansion and signicant revenue outside the UK – we are seeing growth across Europe.” The company has grown its workforce to , – up again on the previous year, and has continued to grow. Of that,  workers are based at its Belfast and Londonderry offices which Brendan says “are a very important part of our business, and that trend will continue”. On Brexit, from a company perspective, Brendan says the services it provides to government are “not linked to Brexit”. “For us, it doesn’t get impacted by the Brexit direction – we are pragmatic on that. “In terms of Northern Ireland, the reality is… conversations about a political impact, they are over-shadowing what businesses are talking about and that’s disappointing.” He said looking forward at the next five years, the rise in demand for areas such as machine learning could form a much bigger part of the business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
