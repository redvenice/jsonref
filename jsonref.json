We piled onto the coach to take us to London at 5.30am.‘Catherine — who even then was fantastic at building a team and keeping up morale — led everyone in endless rounds of Ten Green Bottles.

The pair were known as Middleton C and Middleton P. James (right) was to start in 1991‘Many parents came. Carole was busy, but I remember her ringing regularly to check progress. When we got home all the parents were there to meet us with mounds of fish and chips and dozens of bottles of champagne.’Both Denise and Kevin are quick to point out that while Carole was an involved parent, she was far from pushy. ‘There were some parents whose voices you dreaded hearing on the phone,’ says Kevin. ‘And Carole was definitely not one of them. When she rang — which she rarely did — she would have a point.‘For example, Catherine had obviously told her she thought it was unfair the boys had a big common room with a pool table and the girls didn’t.‘Carole rang and asked why. We agreed it was unfair and, entirely as a result of her intervention, rules were changed. From then on it was a joint common room.’But while it was Carole who made the tricky phone calls, it was left to her husband Mike to be the school entertainer.‘Like in most marriages, the woman is in charge,’ says Denise. ‘Mike had the most gorgeous sense of humour. You could have a joke with him.‘At the end of every term, we always had a parents’ match — the girls’ netball team would play the parents and Mike would turn up and be the joker. He would be the one challenging the referee’s decisions and pretending to cheat. Everyone adored him.’Small wonder then that St Andrew’s holds such a very special place in the Duchess of Cambridge’s heart.‘We met her at one of the happiest periods of our lives,’ says Denise. ‘It’s lovely to know that Catherine feels the same.’Denise and Kevin have asked the Mail to make a donation to Wales Air Ambulance in return for this interview."},{"url":null,"title":"Democrats unload Bernie Sanders socialist label caustic debate","story":"Share this articleEmerson Polling - New Hampshire 2020 Tracking Poll Night 5: Sanders Holds Lead in New Hampshire, Buttigieg Continues to Gain"},{"url":null,"title":"Caroline Flack pens self help book losing job presenting Love Island","story":"Share this article   A star of Belgravia, ITV’s forthcoming drama by Downton Abbey creator Julian Fellowes, Alice Eve is now an oil painting, too.The Duchess of Cornwall’s former nephew Sam Parker Bowles commissioned award-winning painter Jamie Coreth to immortalise Star Trek actress Alice for a new exhibition at the Fine Art Commissions gallery in Mayfair, where he’s manager.

We got woken up at 4am because there was some rain. Some of it came in so we repositioned things so we could keep all the electrics dry.

It\u0027s a such a brilliant piece of work. It\u0027s epic.\u0027I\u0027d like to take it to Glastonbury. We could turn it into a little pub, get some music going, it would be brilliant.

Her debut story collection, An Elegy for Easterly, won the  first book prize in 2009 and was followed by The Book of Memory in 2015. Her gripping new novel, Out of Darkness, Shining Light, tells the real-life story of how the body of the 19th-century explorer and physician David Livingstone was transported through Africa by his staff so he could be buried in Britain.When did you first become interested in David Livingstone?When I was 16 – at school we did a new curriculum of African history and I became fascinated by the faithful companions who carried Livingstone’s body and I knew I wanted to write about them one day. I started this book in 1998 – I have a floppy disk that I’ve now framed from that year – and finished it in 2018, so it took 20 years, though in between I wrote other things. Initially, it was very much inspired by William Faulkner’s As I Lay Dying, and Livingstone’s voice was in there. But I ended up thinking: let me focus on his companions.What was your research process?Livingstone was an absolute gossip and his journals were valuable – he wrote about other people, but also about nature, ants, leaves. The most interesting snippets, I weaved into the story. I learned Swahili to write this book – it’s an amazing language. I lived in Zanzibar to write some of it. I did research at the David Livingstone Memorial Trust. It was so moving to see the room where he grew up with his family and to understand the poverty of his life. I think he connected with poor people in Africa because he himself came from a poor background.Tell me about the “shining light” of the title…I’m interested in goodness. I will write about dark things – injustice, a collapsed Zimbabwe – but I want goodness to shine through the idea that beautiful things can happen out of horrible situations. The Book of Memory was about different kinds of love – and so is this book. It’s about loyalty, commitment, love – and all of those things are related to goodness. What it takes to be a good servant is something I’m fascinated by – I love The Remains of the Day. I am by nature a servant – a lawyer who advises people. For me it’s important to help someone shine, to use my skills to help them be the best they can.You powerfully create the voices of Livingstone’s servants…I’m a natural ventriloquist, a gift I got from my mother. Our entire family were ventriloquists in one form or another. My son and I used to read parts of Things Fall Apart in different accents. We love playing with voices.Do you see the role of novelist as being akin to being an explorer?It’s funny you should ask that as when I was a child I wanted to be an explorer. I wanted to find the source of the Nile, I didn’t realise it had been found. And I wanted to go the South Pole – I was obsessed with Captain Scott. In my own life now, journeys matter to me, a lot. I travel a lot. My most recent trip, which was mind-blowing, was a container-ship journey across the Atlantic from Dunkirk to Martinique and Guadalupe and back again. A whole month at sea with no wifi and some very good-looking sailors was amazing. It was great for my writing – I wrote a play and read Vikram Seth for the first time. What characterises a lot of the characters in my new book is wanderlust.What kind of reader were you as a child?I discovered books when I moved from the townships to the suburbs when I was aged about nine. I became obsessed. I used to read and walk at the same time, and once almost got run over by a car. I’ve written as long as I’ve read – I just wasn’t published for many years. Books are such an important part of my life – especially books found in libraries. I’m actually writing a memoir called Ten Libraries, about the libraries that have shaped me. My identity is bound up with books.Who have been your greatest influences?Tsitsi Dangarembga opened up the idea that a black woman from Zimbabwe could write a book. There’s a whole generation of Zimbabwean women who are so grateful to Tsitsi for being a forerunner. Other inspirations are the writer Charles Mungoshi and Oliver Mtukudzi, whose music is often influenced by Shona poetry – both narrate beautifully the complexity of the Zimbabwean condition.What books are on your bedside table?I have quite a pile, some of which are related to projects I’m working on. I’ve got a biography of Hannibal the Carthaginian general, and a history of the Punic wars. I have the wonderful The Story of the Jews by Simon Schama. One of my characters in the novel I’m working on is a Jewish man from Vienna, so I’m researching Judaism. I’m reading a lot of plays, including works by Harold Pinter and Wole Soyinka. I’m rereading Middlemarch. I like to reread old and familiar books.Is there a classic novel you’ll take on your next long journey?The Mystery of Edwin Drood – the only Dickens novel I haven’t finished.Any guilty reading pleasures?Re-reading Joan Collins and Judith Krantz, who I used to read a lot when I was a teenager.Which contemporary authors do you most admire?Zadie Smith, Philip Hensher, Teju Cole, Samantha Harvey – for their work ethic and range.What’s next on your reading list?I’m really looking forward to Hilary Mantel’s The Mirror and the Light.What is your writing process?If I have a deadline I’ll suddenly find all sorts of things to do to avoid writing, but when I settle into it I’ll do slots of three to four hours. I’m a planner – I use a whiteboard. For this book I had charts showing where I’m going – if I can’t see where I’m going I find it difficult to get there. I also write to music: mbira music from Zimbabwe, opera and reggae – Bob Marley really fires me up.• Out of Darkness, Shining Light by Petina Gappah is published by Faber (£16.99).

It was not the time to show how he had gone from being the brave man of the 1980s, who had defied the Soviet dictatorship in eastern Europe by delivering lectures to dissidents studying in underground universities in Prague, to the degraded figure of 2019 that accepted “honours” from Viktor Orbán, who is busily turning his corner of eastern Europe into a corrupt, ethno-nationalist dictatorship.Politeness is a curse as well as a courtesy. Scruton’s journey from opponent to courtier of tyranny has been taken across western conservatism. Respect for the friends and relatives of the dead should not stop you showing where they could take the rest of us. Nor should it stop you realising that Hungary is the Venezuela of the new right, the grim terminus of its twisted logic.It wants to intimidate or abolish independent checks on its power – and before I go any further I should add, for the sake of balance, that everything I say about the new right applies to the Corbynite left. Boris Johnson is threatening the future of the BBC. Maybe he won’t begin the process of abolishing it as a universal service free at the point of use, but he knows, as all political thugs know, that a little fear goes a long way in BBC news and will push its managers into playing nice with the ruling party. Johnson has followed up by restricting Whitehall briefings to favoured political correspondents. He is engaging in the language policing he deplores when practised by the intolerant left by ordering civil servants to hide the bitter realities of Brexit in an obfuscatory fog.In his Orwellian Whitehall, diplomats must say a “trading relationship with the EU like Australia’s” rather than “a no-deal Brexit”. They must never let on that Australia does not yet have a free-trade deal with the EU so a “trading relationship with the EU like Australia’s” is a no-deal Brexit. Remainers are often accused of thinking Leavers are stupid. As you can see, Johnson takes them for the greater fools.In Hungary, the train has trundled further down the line. The Hungarian equivalents of the BBC are just propaganda outlets for Orbán’s Fidesz party. In 2018, 476 press and broadcasting outlets were offered free of charge by their Fidesz-friendly proprietors to a pro-government conglomerate, the Central European Press and Media Foundation. The favour is likely to be met with favours in return. Transparency International reports that Hungary is now one of the most corrupt countries in Europe: a land where no back is left unscratched.The threat to freedom of speech and of the press did not stop Scruton saying that Orbán must be congratulated for preserving Hungary’s national identity. Or Tim Montgomerie, a former adviser to Johnson, who can now best be described as a Tory social media influencer, praising Hungary’s “interesting early thinking” on “the limits of liberalism” and suggesting that Orbán and Johnson had much in common. Or the Conservative MP Daniel Kawczynski joining Orbán, Spanish Francoists and assorted French and Italian far rightists at a conference in Rome last week.In his limitless malevolence, Orbán explains, the Jewish financier George Soros has the supernatural power to destroy Christian Europe by flooding it with Muslim migrants. Soros’s “mafia-like networks” are everywhere and are tirelessly plotting to eradicate white Christianity. Such is the man Scruton abased himself before and Montgomerie and Kawczynski admire. Such is the man the European People’s party, an alliance of supposedly moderate conservatives, cannot bring itself to expel. Such is the terminus for the right unless authentic moderate conservatives start defining the borders of conservatism and banishing those who cross them.They do nothing because the dynamism in conservative politics is with their opponents. Johnson, Orbán and Trump feel like the future and old-school Tories and Christian Democrats yesterday’s men and women. Trump’s America, where the fears of white voters that they will become a minority in their own country can be played on by an accomplished rabble-rouser, may be an extreme case. But politicians everywhere are learning that the old morality no longer applies. The cynical wisdom that politicians always lie, for instance, was once a lie itself.Jonathan Portes, who worked as a senior civil servant from 1987 to 2011, told me he and his colleagues would warn ministers that they would be exposed by the media and parliament if they lied and would never recover from the disgrace. Johnson is showing that in an age of extremes there is no disgrace. He can lie about Brexit bringing £350m a week to the NHS or deny he is putting a border in the Irish Sea and his supporters simply don’t care.You could say that in elected dictatorships, the state purges the civil service and judiciary and controls the media and Britain has not reached that point. But instead of looking at the terminus, notice the direction of travel. Johnson has suspended parliament and purged his party of dissenting pro-European voices. Attacks on the independence of the judiciary and civil service are now standard for a right that cannot tolerate constraints.Britain is not Hungary. But if you want to stop your country heading that way, is it not more effective to start fighting back at the first sign of danger rather than waiting until it is too late?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a08ae025b17d2bd3ab3ef5500cab75c62583b82/0_37_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=385419e771679a8fbee9de79da1e9d24","title":"madonna in full meltdown moment to be cherished","story":"The Palladium paid a ripe price for bringing down the curtain on her showMadonna’s Madame X era is the gift that keeps on giving. On Wednesday night, her residency at the London Palladium descended into the kind of chaos that turned it into one of those gigs you can only have dreamed of being at, like Bob Dylan at the Newport Folk Festival or the Sex Pistols at Manchester’s Lesser Free Trade Hall.Madonna ran over the theatre’s curfew by a few minutes, so the venue turned on the lights and closed the curtain. She then uploaded a video of it to Instagram, with a caption that began: “Artists are here to disturb the peace” and ended with: “Power to the people!” You can hear her protesting: “Fuck you motherfuckers! Censorship, censorship, motherfuckers censorship.” If that doesn’t open her next album, I’ll eat my eyepatch.I love it when it all goes wrong. I bet the audience was thrilled that they had that ticket for that night. Some of the most memorable shows I’ve ever seen have had an element of upset. I remember the Gossip, playing upstairs at a tiny pub, many years ago, having the same issue as Madonna: they overran and the sound was cut. Beth Ditto came to the front of the stage and sang, a cappella, in pure defiance, a song called (Take Back) the Revolution. I’ve seen thousands of shows and that remains one of the very best.You can’t contrive it, either. I saw a play a couple of years ago in which the lead actors appeared to corpse, and it was genuinely delightful, until we realised days later that it was not genuine. We thought we were witnessing something fresh, off-script, spontaneous.When I talked to relatives who had seen the same play, the exact same thing had happened and they felt special too. It didn’t matter on the night, but we’d been had. Just like Fleetwood Mac’s arena shows bringing Stevie and Lindsey together for a pointed reunion hug (when Lindsey was still there to be reunited with), it was all part of the script, after all.The Conservative commentator Iain Dale went off-script on Good Morning Britain on Friday, when he decided not to stand his ground as he was being interrupted, but to storm off instead. “OK, I won’t speak,” he said, when being talked over, like me during a domestic about washing up. I can’t begin to process the irony of walking off a show now built entirely on talking over people – for being talked over. I realised then I only ever watch Good Morning Britain when something has gone wrong. In ratings terms, at least, wrong can so often be right.The astronaut Christina Koch – and my new hero – last week came back to Earth a record-breaker, having spent 328 days in space, the longest continuous spaceflight a woman has ever undertaken. Koch landed in Kazakhstan nearly a year after she left the planet and gave the cameras, staff and supporters a huge grin and a double thumbs-up.I’ve been reading and watching interviews with Koch as a kind of balm, a self-prescribed alternative to inspirational Instagram quotes decorated with illustrations of flowers and birds. When her mission was extended, she told ABC News that that was just fine. “One of the things about the astronaut corps is we are taught to be adaptable and ready for anything in any mission that comes our way,” she said. I’ve had it printed on to a mug.When she surpassed the previous record, set by Peggy Whitson, in December, she told CNN that we should all challenge ourselves. “Do what scares you. Everyone should think about what intrigues them and what draws them in. Those things can be scary, but they usually mean you’re interested.” That one’s getting framed and going up in the loo.Koch’s achievements have been truly remarkable. In October she completed the first all-female spacewalk, along with Jessica Meir, though that was famously delayed when only one suit could be found that would fit a woman. Her experiences will prove invaluable to research into how long periods of time in space affect the body, particularly women’s bodies, which may well react differently to the extreme conditions. Also, having been quite literally out of this world since last March, Koch has missed coronavirus, the impeachment fiasco, Brexit, still, Australia being on fire and the USA-Iran crisis, so I’d say it was all worth it.The collected works of Dorothy Parker will need to add a page or two, as four new poems have been linked to the great writer, almost a century after they were published anonymously.The tale of their discovery is a detective story in itself. In the 1990s, a lawyer called Stuart Y Silverstein came across the poems in an old copy of Life magazine, thought they sounded like Parker’s work, made a copy of the page and scribbled a note – “Parker?” – at the top of it. He did not return to the paper until last year, when he managed to link it to the archive of a payment made by Life to Parker, for $50, thus authenticating the work.It is no wonder Silverstein suspected Parker’s acidic wit. The poems are verse portraits that are entirely unforgiving of their subjects. Of the sculptor Clare Sheridan, who had turned to journalism, she wrote: “Then the lady’s interviews Crashed upon the daily news Moan we now another lay – ‘Give, oh, give her back her clay!’”It’s amazing how much more sophisticated put-downs sound in verse. Perhaps Twitter should start insisting that if insults are to be thrown, they should at least be thrown in rhyme."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc4bbb06f665377127401ff6461d3fc521b8786e/0_137_3349_2009/master/3349.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=05d5dbccf785973bf01c07dbdf6906a1","title":"of course women trusted manish shah was he not their gp","story":"It sounds to me that the London GP Manish Shah not only sexually assaulted female patients, but that he despised them too.Shah has been given three life sentences for committing a total of 90 sexual assaults on 24 female patients at Mawney medical centre in Romford, east London, between 2009 and 2013. Claiming he was practising “defensive medicine”, he gave healthy women under 25 smear tests (generally performed by a nurse) and performed unnecessary breast examinations on women under 50. Shah breached NHS guidelines by not offering a chaperone for intimate examinations and didn’t always wear gloves. He left one patient entirely naked on the table. The youngest of his victims was 15, and her experiences left her “anxious, fearful and shaking” and afraid of visiting doctors.In some ways, this case serves as a masterclass in determined and manipulative abuse. Shah would frighten patients about their family medical history. At other times, he’d mention celebrities such as Angelina Jolie (who underwent a preventive double mastectomy after testing positive for the BRCA gene mutation) and Jade Goody (who died in 2009 from cervical cancer). There it is – the contempt. And not just for those patients, for all women – including Jolie and Goody, whose suffering he so cynically exploited.Here, you could make a guess at Shah’s thought processes – dazzle patients with celebrity names and they’ll let you do anything you want. What rot. Those patients would have instinctively trusted Shah, not because he bandied around famous names, but because he was a doctor.Who are these people who put themselves in positions of trust but can’t be trusted? Maybe that’s part of the problem – the automatic deference given to medical professionals leading, in some, to a weaponised sense of entitlement. Characters such as Ian Paterson, the breast surgeon given 20 years in 2017, who subjected more than 1,000 patients to unnecessary and damaging surgery, an inquiry last week citing “a culture of avoidance and denial” in a “dysfunctional” healthcare system.Such cases shatter trust in the medical profession, just as trust has been destroyed in myriad other areas, from the clergy to the care system to education. Now, it seems, women aren’t even able to walk into their GP surgery to normally, routinely, discuss their health. They have to be wary and alert and, if they require an intimate examination by a male GP, should seriously consider the option of a chaperone and fight against that all-powerful female urge not to be “demanding”, not to make a “fuss”.Is this the future – mandatory chaperoned medicine between the sexes? All that extra expense for the NHS, and pressure on patients, just because some men abuse their power? Well, if that’s what it takes… People see medics when they’re at their most vulnerable – they need to feel safe. Now women know that their GP surgery could be just another unsafe space to deal with.It seems that men who suddenly sport beards may be trying to tell us something and it’s not just: “I can’t find the razor.”The US website Vox coined the phrase “crisis beard” for face-fluff that sprouts under extreme pressure. For instance, the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has been getting hairier with each new political crisis.Crisis beards are thought to be about rebellion, inidualism and deep, existential despair. Respect to men. Women also express themselves via hair, but only men can cover two-thirds of their faces with anguished cries for help from their very souls.It’s also interesting to see politicos go this route. The crisis beard could be the chic new way to express political anxiety, sorrow and humility. Which is all very timely, after just reading that the former prime minister David Cameron has made £1.6m (at least!) since his Brexit resignation. Why is this man still clean shaven? Mr Cameron, you owe the UK a beard. Make it a big one.Are women meant to cheer because the violent porn of the future may be computer-generated?An algorithm has been developed to produce deep-fake images that could replace performers in porn. While deepfakes already exist in porn, often that is to humiliate real people, grafting their heads on to bodies. This would be about replacing humans altogether, stopping the exploitation and degradation of real-life porn workers, the rationale being that, whatever happens during porn wouldn’t matter because the women wouldn’t exist.This is being viewed as a Good Thing, but is it really? Women already don’t exist in any valid way in porn. They may be there bodily otherwise, they’re mere ciphers for an increasingly normalised hardcore roster of male sexual demands. Female behaviour, language and reactions are performed to order for the exclusive satisfaction of men. Female sexual autonomy is nowhere to be found: desire is faked, or explicitly unwanted, such as in hugely popular rape porn, where female fear and distress are the chief erotic components.Deepfaked visuals wouldn’t render porn ethical, because the mentality would still be there. While you could fake the imagery, it would be impossible to computer-generate away the violent and misogynistic mindset that drives porn. You would not stop porn warping and damaging male minds in the real world, where all the real women live.If realistic deepfake “men” could be depicted gang-raping a realistic deepfake “woman”, how does this improve anything for real women? If nothing is real, and anything goes, porn imagery could even become worse, further sexualising and trivialising the rape, battery and murder of women. The safety and wellbeing of vulnerable porn-workers is extremely important, but how porn is made is not the end of the story. It’s also about the harmful messages and imagery it sends out into the world, and the damage that wreaks, however it’s produced."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/230991959691554728c46278e8bbd4684402103e/0_0_7952_4771/master/7952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c6729dd661e0866c9b392a9765d49696","title":"committees blind hiring and flexible work how to build a diverse workforce","story":"By limiting yourself in the recruitment process you may miss out on someone who’s right for the job. These simple steps will help to cultivate an inclusive organisationBut ersity isn’t limited to a candidate’s race, gender, or age – it includes their education, socioeconomic background, sexuality, religion, mental and physical health and many more facets. When we create environments that encourage different opinions and contain a multitude of backgrounds and experiences, we broaden our communities, which in turn benefits both the work and the culture of the organisation.Here’s how to get started with building an inclusive and erse business:Look outside of the obvious education channelsThis may come as a surprise, but where someone studied - for their qualifications – doesn’t necessarily correlate to their qualities as a candidate. It’s important to be intentional about recruitment, and if you are only accepting candidates who have a certain level of education, or attended a certain type of university, you may be missing out on someone just right for the job. Go further afield when you attend university job fairs and remember to think digitally. With an increasing number of courses being offered online, make sure you connect with those graduates as well. The Open University has been offering qualifications through distance learning for 50 years. It has an excellent resource – the OU’s OpportunityHub, which connects prospective employers with graduates and alumni around the country for work and internships. The OU also regularly runs OU Online TalentConnect, a digital careers fair where employers can chat and interact with its uniquely erse body of graduates and undergraduates all over the UK and internationally.“The OU provides a unique supply of candidates, as a majority study alongside full-time employment – it shows a true commitment and a willingness to go that extra mile,” says the HMRC’s Memunatu Bangura.Create a ersity, equity, and inclusion committeeHave a specific committee to oversee ersity, equity, and inclusion at your organisation, to ensure that not only the roles you are hiring, but the work that you do appeals to a broad group of people. Of course, ersity isn’t just about hiring – but it’s probably a good idea to ensure that the team responsible for hiring are erse themselves.Could the role be remote? Or part-time?For many candidates, especially those with disabilities, knowing that a job can be done remotely, or part-time, is deeply attractive. You can also sign up to be a part of the Disability Confident programme, which signals to jobseekers with disabilities that your organisation supports and encourages a talent pool that is inclusive. When pulling together your job description, think seriously about whether it would be possible to offer remote work, or a job share – many parents benefit from flexible schedules.Consider mature studentsNot everyone attends university. Many candidates from lower-income backgrounds, or BAME candidates, may not have been given the same access to opportunity as others, and many people choose to attend university later in life, if at all. Mature students are defined as being undergraduates over the age of 21, and they account for almost 300,000 people a year. According to Ucas, the majority of mature students are women who live at home, undertaking degrees in vocational subjects. These are candidates who will have learned to juggle work, or parenting, alongside their studies.“We want to work with OU students and graduates because we know they are highly motivated and talented iniduals who have the potential to make an enormous contribution to Mencap as either staff or volunteers. We work across England, Wales and Northern Ireland and we know that OU students are spread across the whole of the UK too,” says Jen Stoneman, volunteer services coordinator at Mencap.Be realistic about your goalsWhile it would be amazing to cultivate a erse work environment, it won’t happen overnight. Be patient, and set metrics of success that ensure that you are appealing to erse groups, and growing your workforce. Identify one metric to improve upon, set a deadline, and keep track of the progress.Empower your business.

In fact, they could be the crucial ingredients in the wardrobe of the future as growing numbers of designers try to create fashion that doesn’t harm the environment.Examine a garment’s care label and you may find that it was made out of pineapple stalks or cactus leaves, or a tote bag was woven with thread made from banana trees. From mushroom leather to algae T-shirts, the search is on for alternative materials with smaller carbon footprints. And the latest result are carbon-negative clothes made with algae that absorb carbon dioxide from the air.“Fashion is part of the problem but it’s also part of the solution,” said Nina Marenzi, founder and director of the Sustainable Angle, a not-for-profit organisation which promotes green textiles at its annual Future Fabric Expo. “We begin with materials and making them sustainable, and if fashion supply chains can change, then we start to address that.”The New York designer Charlotte McCurdy has made a see-through bioplastic mac using algae – specifically algae powder used in vegan food products. She worked with glass casters to find a way to heat the algae and cool it in a controlled fashion to make it transparent. The material is carbon-negative because the algae draw carbon out of the atmosphere, meaning the coat acts as a carbon sink.“Follow the carbon – where did it come from?” she said. “Has it come from carbon taken out of the atmosphere millions of years ago and put in the ground? We talk a lot about what happens to materials after we use them, but not where they come from in the first place.”Post Carbon Lab is using the same principle with another algae prototype – clothes that photosynthesise. The start-up in London has created photosynthesis coating, a layer of living algae on the fabric of garments that absorb carbon dioxide and emit oxygen, turning the carbon into sugar. One large T-shirt – nearly a square metre of material – generates about as much oxygen as a six-year-old oak tree, according to the co-founder Dian-Jen Lin.The start-up has been working with designers and industry to translate its photosynthesis coating into a marketable product, and Lin said it could be used in shoes, backpacks, curtains, pillow cases, umbrellas and building canopies.The care instructions were rather different to normal clothes, she said. Wearing algae was not without its perils. “You can’t put it into your dark wardrobe. It needs light and carbon dioxide, so you have to put it in a well-ventilated area, like the back of your chair.” Washing machines would harm the algae, so “it’s handwash only – you have to be a bit careful. I wouldn’t recommend this coating for your underwear but maybe for a windbreaker or a jacket.”Lin and her co-founder Hannes Hulstaert are testing the limits of the coating, which she says can be applied to almost any garments, either as a full coating or a print. “But it might change colour if it’s really upset, if it didn’t like the light or temperature,” Lin said. “Most of the organisms are in the green shade. In the healthy state they are dark brownish green, orangeish green. When it’s unhappy it might turn yellow, orange, brown, purple or white or transparent.”However, it seems remarkably resilient. “We’ve had samples for three years which have come back to life,” Lin said.Other textiles include Piñatex, made from pineapple leaves and used by Hugo Boss and H\u0026ampM, and Mycotex, grown from a mushroom species called mycelium which is also used in insulation. Cactus is the next plant-based leather to emerge, the creation of Desserto, a Mexican company that makes leather from leaves.The challenges facing the fashion industry in its quest to become greener are huge. The UK throws about 300,000 tonnes of clothes into landfill each year, and some studies suggest global textile production creates 1.2bn tonnes of carbon dioxide a year – more than airlines and shipping combined."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cd54e39ad0167bba0d2d0868fbf08bba883a63e/0_0_2200_1467/master/2200.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=38b68a4d59936155dcc6c36dc724d4e8","title":"harvey weinstein trial unreliable memories elizabeth loftus","story":"Elizabeth Loftus says ‘post-event information’ can color recollections and ‘emotion is not a guarantee’ memory is authenticLawyers for Harvey Weinstein turned on Friday to an expert known for studying false, repressed and unreliable memories who has worked on behalf of clients including the serial killer Ted Bundy.Weinstein’s fate in his rape trial in New York City largely hinges on what his accusers remember about alleged sexual assaults years ago. Testimony from Elizabeth Loftus, a cognitive psychologist, often helps undermine people who say they are victims.“It doesn’t take a PhD to know that memory fades over time,” Loftus told jurors in the New York supreme court.As memories fade, she said, people become more vulnerable to “post-event information” including media reports that can distort what they remember. They also can distort their own memories with inferences and guesses about past events.False memories “can be experienced with a great deal of detail, a great deal of emotion, even though they’re false”, she said. “The emotion is not a guarantee you’re dealing with an authentic memory.”Loftus, 75, took the witness stand a day after prosecutors rested their case. It featured more than two weeks of testimony, including the accounts of six women who say the once powerful Hollywood producer subjected them to vile sexual behavior.Weinstein’s lawyers are aiming to cement doubts about the women’s allegations after using cross-examination to highlight inconsistencies in some accounts. In some cases, the encounters the women recalled allegedly happened a decade or more ago.Weinstein’s lawyers have not said if he will testify. If he does, he could give prosecutors an opening to bring in more witnesses to rebut anything he says.“That is a question that does not have an answer at this point,” attorney Arthur Aidala said. “We want to see how our defense case goes.”Weinstein is charged with raping a woman in a Manhattan hotel room in March 2013 and forcibly performing oral sex on a different woman in 2006. Weinstein, 67, has maintained any sexual encounters were consensual.Loftus was on the stand for about an hour, her testimony curtailed by a ruling barring her from testifying about memories specific to sexual interactions. She testified that she was not asked to evaluate any of the accusers or their testimony.Loftus is the co-author of the 1994 book The Myth of Repressed Memory: False Memories and Allegation of Sexual Abuse. In another book, Witness for the Defense, Loftus wrote that in her work for Bundy she seized on “leading and suggestive questions” by investigators and “hesitations and uncertainties on the part of the victim” as signs of muddled memories.On the stand on Friday, she sounded a similar note, telling jurors interactions with law enforcement “can lead people to want to produce details”.“Some can be accurate, and some can be false and inaccurate,” she said.When prosecutor Joan Illuzzi-Orbon asked if she was originally asked to be a defense consultant rather than a witness, Loftus said: “I don’t remember what I was asked exactly.”“Is that due to post-event information?” Illuzzi-Orbon quipped.Weinstein’s lawyers skipped plans to call the Hollywood writer and director Warren Leight, to testify about Annabella Sciorra’s drug use during a shoot in the early 1990s.Sciorra, now 59, testified that she was hooked on Valium when The Night We Never Met started shooting in late 1992, but denied defense suggestions she was still using it when she alleges Weinstein raped her in 1993 or 1994."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/987a3cacf49507f0fdc5eb205973788a141638ce/0_654_3598_2158/master/3598.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eac0f474c07da29c1744473cee562fb4","title":"meera sodha vegan recipe rose harissa chickpea stew burnt chard","story":"It’s handy to have a star ingredient such as rose harissa to hand to liven up even the most basic staples: see how it sparkles in this seemingly unassuming chickpea stewRose harissa is the equivalent of a friend who always brings the party, no matter the situation.

Graham Potter’s consistent tinkering eventually paid off, however, when substitute Alireza Jahanbakhsh’s cross was thumped into his own net by Watford’s right back with 10 minutes to go.There was the whiff of conservatism about the opening stages of the game, which was not surprising for two teams hoping to escape the threat of relegation. Brighton, if not controlling proceedings, were at least endeavouring to cajole them along. They had the lion’s share of possession and were attempting to enact two clear tactics: the first involved flighting the ball over Watford’s Adrian Mariappa down the left, hoping to release Leandro Trossard the second was feeding the marauding, pirate-resembling Ezequiel Schelotto on the right. Recalled to the side for this match, he delivered crosses from deep, looking for Glenn Murray who, in turn, was on the hunt for a knockdown.This approach did not quite work but neither was it entirely fruitless. Brighton were happy to keep plugging away hoping the ploys might eventually work while believing nothing much was risked if they did not. Sadly for Potter’s men, their confidence was misplaced.In the 19th minute, a smart exchange of passes worked Brighton out of a tight spot and gave Aaron Mooy the chance to break forward in midfield. However, the Australian held on to the ball for too long and when he tried to thread a pass through the centre, Étienee Capoue cut it out. The rebound fell to Abdoulaye Doucouré and he surged upfield to open the scoring.Doucouré is one of those players where you can struggle to identify a weak spot. Certainly he seemed unstoppable in this moment, bursting from the halfway line past Schelotto and bearing down on Shane Duffy before cutting inside the Irishman and bending a clean strike inside Mat Ryan’s far post. It provided a reminder of the ability that Watford have in their side, despite their parlous position.Brighton then lost what poise they had for a while. Duffy and Davy Pröpper kept surrendering possession while Doucouré and Gerard Deulofeu were increasingly influential for Watford.As well as threatening down the left, Deulofeu had a secondary job in tracking Schelotto’s attacking runs. In case he forgot, Nigel Pearson was very much on hand to remind him. Just before half-time, a Trossard cross created panic in the Watford box and the ball come out to Schelotto, with Deulofeu literally on his heels. The Argentine went over in the area and the howls went up for a penalty but Deulofeu had done the right thing, getting his body in front of Schelotto rather than his leg, and both referee Kevin Friend and VAR saw nothing wrong with it.The second half began with Schelotto seeing even more of the ball and barely 10 minutes in Potter decided to introduce Neal Maupay alongside Murray in the hope of making something happen. Maupay looked sharp and upped the tempo for the Seagulls but chances were not forthcoming. Increasingly the crowd were frustrated, demanding both more urgency and accuracy.Schelotto was withdrawn for Jahanbakhsh with 15 minutes to go but Brighton did not deviate from their strategy and, finally, it worked. Brighton countered, with Trossard spraying the play wide to Jahanbakhsh. The Iranian whipped in a fiery low cross but there was a shortage of Brighton bodies in the box to take advantage. The ball would have rolled harmlessly out of touch, but with no one near him, Mariappa slammed it into the roof of the net."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dbbf22090201322a5a134d831840e8ae0531fb6e/0_19_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=540bd0ae8a5f24956d013bc22a56972c","title":"european football roundup bayer leverkusen borussia dortmund lars bender atalanta getafe","story":"• Two late goals in two minutes turn game as hosts win 4-3• Getafe boost Champions League hopes with win over ValenciaBayer Leverkusen scored twice in two minutes to complete a thrilling comeback as they beat Borussia Dortmund 4-3 on Saturday, denying their visitors the chance to go second in the Bundesliga table.

Undeterred, Leverkusen were back level two minutes before half-time as Dortmund failed to clear a corner and Volland struck his second goal of the game.Dortmund went ahead again in the 65th minute with a superb team goal, the ball worked quickly in from the right before Achraf Hakimi set up Raphaël Guerreiro for a simple side-footed finish. The visitors looked to be cruising to victory until goals from Leon Bailey and Lars Bender on 81 and 82 minutes suddenly put Leverkusen back in the driving seat, and Dortmund failed to recover from the one-two punch.

Quaison, however, netted his third from the spot in the 90th minute to put the win beyond doubt.A Luca Waldschmidt penalty gave Freiburg a narrow 1-0 win at home to Hoffenheim, while Wolfsburg had Marin Pongracic sent off as they drew 1-1 with Fortuna Düsseldorf and Marius Bülter scored twice as Union Berlin beat second-from-bottom Werder Bremen 2-0.In Spain, Levante beat Leganés 2-0 in the early match before Getafe underlined their ambition to qualify for the Champions League by outplaying their direct rivals Valencia in a 3-0 home victory.Getafe’s 37-year-old striker Jorge Molina broke the deadlock by netting on the rebound in the 58th minute and doubled their advantage in the 67th, waltzing past three Valencia defenders before firing home. Molina’s strike partner Jaime Mata added a third goal in the 88th minute after Valencia’s new signing Alessandro Florenzi had been sent off with a straight red card.The victory was Getafe’s fourth consecutive league win without conceding a goal and tightened their hold on third place in the standings, leaving them on 42 points after 23 games. Valencia are five points behind the Madrid side in fifth. Real Valladolid and Villarreal drew 1-1, and Atlético Madrid were hosting Granada in the late game.In Italy, Atalanta’s hopes of requalifying for the Champions League received a boost as they came from behind to record their first away victory at Fiorentina for 27 years. The 2-1 victory in Serie A on Saturday moves the Bergamo club clear in fourth place.A superbly struck half-volley from Federico Chiesa gave the hosts a half-time lead at the Stadio Artemio Franchi. But Gian Piero Gasperini’s side levelled early in the second half through a Duvan Zapata tap-in before the substitute Ruslan Malinovskyi drilled in the winner from outside the box with 18 minutes remaining.The result ended an 18-match winless run for Atalanta in Serie A trips to Florence, stretching back to January 1993, and moves them on to 42 points in fourth, three ahead of fifth-placed Roma, who lost 3-2 at home to Bologna on Friday. Fiorentina have lost three games in a row and are in 14th place with 25 points.Torino lost 3-1 at home to their fellow strugglers Sampdoria.

The same old story played out again. It happened at Athletic, it happened at Marseille and it happened last season. This is just what Marcelo Bielsa sides do. They start brilliantly, they ignite the enthusiasm, and then they fade.Leeds United’s start to the season was so good that they remain in the automatic promotion places, a point above a diligent Nottingham Forest, but it’s hard to avoid the sense that the mirror has crack’d and the curse is upon them.Is it a curse if it’s a perpetual flaw? Perhaps not, and yet to complain of the flaw seems oddly beside the point. Part of the glory of Bielsa is that his sides can play football of great beauty, but it is a doomed beauty.So fundamental has that come to feel that it may even now be self-perpetuating. It may not any more be about him exhausting his players, it may just be that the narrative Leeds fans deny so vociferously is so powerful that it eats away at players and Bielsa anyway.Add to that Leeds’s (justifiable) perception of themselves as a major club, their desperation to return to the top flight after 16 years and the fear that hopes may have been raised in vain and the result is a potent psychological inhibitor.The anxiety about Leeds is clear, among fans, among players, among coaching staff. After last season’s near miss, a run of seven straight wins before Christmas had turned hope into expectation, giving them a cushion that, it turned out, they have desperately needed. At one stage they led Forest by 11 points, but a run of just two wins in their last nine Championship games has changed the picture utterly.Quite what has gone wrong for Leeds is a mystery. They have been unlucky to an extent but fundamentally they have continued to dominate games without taking chances.The centre-forward Patrick Bamford has endured the bulk of the criticism, but it is not just him, and the widespread nature of the problem inevitably recalls the words of Juan Manuel Llop, who played for Bielsa at Newell’s Old Boys. The intensity of the Argentinian’s style, he said, wears players down not only physically but also mentally and emotionally: they may be able to run as hard as ever, but decision-making and confidence can fray.The pressure of this, the fear that once again one of his sides might squander a dominant position in the latter half of the season, seemed to be telling on Bielsa during the week, as he gave a 59-minute press conference in which he answered only five questions.Although he remained courteous, the tension was clear both in his posture and in the painstaking detail with which he explained his reasons for not giving Eddie Nketiah more playing time, precipitating the termination of the forward’s loan spell and his return to Arsenal.There was a fretfulness about both sides early on, with countless passes going astray, but there is a sense in which Forest, with Samba Sow returning from injury to reform his defensive midfield screen alongside Ben Watson, are better able to deal with disjointedness. And at the moment, the truth is that Leeds will give you chances keep it tight and the win will more than likely come.The breakthrough came just after the half hour as Sammy Ameobi cut in from the left and lashed a shot that swerved through the e of Kiko Casilla.Leeds only got going too late. There were flickers, but no more, and Lewis Grabban should have made the game safe long before Brice Samba was called into a remarkable save from Liam Cooper’s header to preserve the lead.Tyler Walker eventually sealed the game on the break deep in injury time. In the end Forest won because they were calm and efficient enough. Leeds, meanwhile, remain frozen on the precipice. The summit is in sight but there is a way to climb yet and they can seemingly do nothing but stare down in terror."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58ae90ce9d7ea217fbfd731b7a07ce7121fd5400/0_143_4282_2570/master/4282.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2465fb586357b8605b1e3b0a1e2ce253","title":"lionel messi money rudderless barcelona afloat","story":"Sacking of Ernesto Valverde and Messi’s fallout with sporting director Eric Abidal are symptoms of long-term stagnation and disjointed structure at the Camp NouL ast Tuesday, as Lionel Messi lashed out at the club’s sporting director, Eric Abidal, the crisis at Barcelona became official. But this is a story about far more than clashing egos and mismanagement at the Camp Nou. It is a parable of modern football, of the problem with genius and the difficulty of identity.Perhaps the strangest aspect of the saga – sparked by the Argentinian reacting with fury to what he saw as Abidal’s attempt to blame the players for the recent sacking of Ernesto Valverde – is that it has taken so long to reach this point, a reminder that in the modern era super-clubs can be run with staggering ineptitude and still win titles.The disjointedness of Barça’s team structure has been evident for several years. Again and again, opponents in the knockout stages of the Champions League have rampaged through vast spaces in what should have been the midfield. That’s how Paris Saint-Germain beat them 4-0 in the first leg of their last-16 tie in 2017, and Juventus thumped them 3-0 in the following round. It’s how Roma and Liverpool have been able to overcome three-goal deficits against them, how even an ordinary Chelsea made them look vulnerable at Stamford Bridge in 2018, albeit the game finished 1-1.A midfield that is variously old, slow and unable to handle the demands of a modern pressing game is the most obvious problem, but it probably isn’t the most troubling. There are two other major issues, both of which cast doubt on core elements of the club’s identity.The first is Messi. A decade ago, he was a willing worker. He might not have been the most voracious presser, but he did his share. In 2009-10, he regained the ball through tackles or interceptions an average of 2.1 times per game in La Liga. That was an exceptional season but in the years that followed 1.2 or 1.3 was standard. Since Pep Guardiola’s departure, those figures have steadily slipped. Last season he was at 0.5 this season 0.8.Messi has always been a minimalist genius – indeed part of his greatness has been his capacity consistently to select the lowest difficulty option – but his work rate has declined with time.That is not necessarily a criticism. It may be that the conservation of energy, his constant low-intensity reconnaissance of the opposition’s defences, is required for him to be so effective at the creative aspects. He is 32 but showing few obvious signs of slowing down in terms of goals or assists. Yet as his genius has papered over the cracks, it is probably also responsible for at least some of those cracks.This is not about casting blame: brilliance can be problematic. When Juventus’s Argentinian forward Paulo Dybala spoke in the run-up to the 2019 Copa América of his struggles to play with Messi, it was widely reported as a rift between the two, but it could equally have been seen as a statement of fact. It can be hard to play with somebody that good because the temptation to just give him the ball is so strong.It is not a coincidence that Barcelona have begun to face similar problems to Argentina. And it is not just on the pitch that Messi’s aura creates imbalances. It is almost impossible for him not to be indulged: which coach would ever drop him, let alone sell him? It’s not just about the political consequences of potentially ostracising him, it is that at any moment in any game, he might suddenly beat four men and lash a shot into the corner and so transform a poor result into a good one. But no player should also be a de facto sporting director.What has exaggerated the problem, with Barcelona and Argentina, is the near total absence of rational leadership. Neither club nor federation, seemingly, has either vision or a plan. That is an issue exacerbated at Barça by the unusual nature of the club and by the difficulty of replacing a coach as extreme and idiosyncratic as Guardiola.Of all Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s many criticisms of Guardiola, the line that remains the most memorable is his description of Barcelona’s players as schoolboys, standing head bowed before the teacher. It was a sneer that contained a deeper truth: what happens when the teacher leaves? What does a class used to obedience to an extremely prescriptive leader, a class that had found it hard to accommodate outsiders, do then?This is the issue for any club that has a clearly defined sense of how it should play once the architect of that style has departed, but it is perhaps particularly acute at Barcelona, where a post-Cruyffian style has become intertwined with Catalan self-identity.Luis Enrique offered a solution of sorts, grafting a celebrity trident on to the side that brought the 2015 Champions League while shifting away from the strictest definition of Guardiola’s philosophy. But Luis Suárez is ageing and injured, while Neymar left to pursue his own ambition, a huge transfer that should have allowed Barça to reconstruct their defence and midfield, but instead led to a pair of vain nine-figure splurges on glamour. The greatest effect of the Neymar deal, as it turned out, was to gift Liverpool the Philippe Coutinho windfall they used to become the best side in the world.So what do Barça do now? Spend more, but this time on the right players? Or try to return to some system of pure guardiolismo?Quique Setién’s possession-driven approach already feels slightly archaic. Devotion to an ideal is never in itself a solution. Brilliant as he is, Guardiola was fortunate at Barça to inherit a squad that included seven high-class players brought up at the club academy who understood his philosophy perfectly and to do so at a time when various changes in the game’s laws and economics had made the world receptive to his revolution.But football has moved on. High pressing and transitions reign. Even Guardiola has evolved. Meanwhile, Barcelona, devoid of leadership, stagnate, sustained only by Messi and their wealth, as the game flows ever further away from them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d99d05dfb95af1fef894cb0615fe6d7fc71e2748/0_108_3369_2022/master/3369.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82601335034e0a02adfebc74e3267418","title":"brighton v watford premier league live","story":"Adrian Mariappa’s own-goal denied Watford three points after Abdoulaye Doucouré’s first-half goal had given them the leadAnd here’s Paul MacInnes’s report from the Amex. Graham Potter speaks, through a crossed line with Jonathan Pearce counting from one to ten. It was great strike but I thought we pushed and pushed and I was really delighted with the spirit we showed. I thought we did really well in the game. We look to our next game, Sheffield United and we have a break now. I will have a little break, spend some time away with the family and recharge. Shane Duffy has been speaking to Brighton’s media team. In the first game of the season I scored an own-goal and I wanted to score. We are a little disappointed and we carry on and we fight until the end. I score more goals and it helps the team. The team is the most important. We were unlucky to concede a goal, it’s happened a lot this season. The lads did a good job and it was unlucky in the end. Ben Foster speaks. Watford’s next matches are Manchester United and Liverpool. The way the goal went in was very disappointing. He isn’t trying to score an own-goal, that’s football sometimes. They threw it all at us, the back eight, if you like, and they stood strong through it. We dropped, and that’s a symptom of where we are in the league. It’s human nature, we have a massive scrap on our hands. We have already beaten Manchester United and we did well at Liverpool we have no fear whatsoever. Brighton should be the happier after their second-half improvement. Watford will think they chucked this one away, but they tired and Adrian Mariappa’s own-goal came as they were put under serious pressure.90+4 min: March gets a yellow card for some petulance after being penalised for fouling a defender holding the ball in the corner. Ben Foster takes his time over the goal kick, plenty of time. 90+2 min: Mooy in the corner, and Trossard, try their best to force a chance but Watford are back in numbers.90+1 min: Five minutes added, with some questions to be asked where they came from. 90 min: There are still three points up for grabs, but only one team looks to be chasing them, and that’s Brighton. Mooy and Trossard try to link up but Watford sit back in numbers. Jahanbakhsh plays in Trossard but the Belgian’s touch is loose and he balloons over.87 min: Watford look tired, and to be hanging on for a draw that is useful but not what they wanted. Capoue’s shot shows off their fatigue. 86 min: Mat Ryan’s long pass finds Trossard and the Belgian almost conjures a chance. It’s last-ditch stuff to get it clear. Welbeck is on, with Deulofeu making way. Welbeck is not yet 30, it might be mentioned. 85 min: Danny Welbeck, a player of genuine quality, is an imminent sub. Watford are far more in need of a winner than Brighton, remember.83 min: More Deeney rage as Deulofeu fails to read his flick-on. Watford a little ragged but still possess some danger.82 min: First Watford change. Nigel Pearson and Craig Shakespeare swap Pereyra for Pussetto, their recent signing.81 min: Watford rested on their laurels, and paid the price. Troy Deeney set to be even more angrier than he was before. 80 min: That Watford margin for error proved far too narrow, and now it’s Brighton who fancy the win.Jahanbakhsh lashes a ball across goal and the Watford defender lashes it into his own net. He feared Glenn Murray behind him and fell into a moment of madness.77 min: Big chance for Brighton! Trossard lays the ball off to Mooy, whose shot is true but Ben Foster makes a fine save with his left leg. 76 min: It’s Watford with the impetus now, with Brighton a little shapeless with all those attacking players on the field. Doucoure takes on a chance to score from distance but lightning will not strike twice for him.74 min: A break in play as Adam Masina has a shoulder problem but he looks as if he might be alright to play on. Watford have taken their time over it.73 min: Off goes Schelotto, and on comes Jahanbakhsh the Iranian winger. Graham Potter is going for broke. 72 min: Brighton’s flurry after all those subs seems to have abated. This a big last 20 minutes for both teams here. 70 min: Watford, rather uncharacteristically, play the ball too much - do an Arsenal walking of the ball into the net - and make a mess of a good chance. Then, the ball fails to get to Deeney, whose anger is audible when Masina does not find him with a pass. The pass looked difficult, and that seemed a little harsh from the captain.69 min: Nice move from Brighton. Flick from Trossard finds Mooy and his cross is a diagonal that Murray fails to get to. They are getting closer. 68 min: Watford have been solid but their margin for error is small. Nigel Pearson is in arm-folding mode, and is prowling the touchline.66 min: Mariappa booked now, and for a late tackle on Solly March by the touchline. Trossard’s free-kick is blasted across rather than placed and then cleared. 64 min: Watford now looking harried and pressured. It’s Brighton who are doing the unsettling. Hughes fouls Maupay and is booked for a tactical foul. A free-kick is launched from the left-hand side, with Trossard chipping forward. Watford are solid under that and the ball is cleared. It keeps, though, coming back at Watford.62 min: Second Brighton sub: Alzate on for the somewhat negligible Gross. 61 min: There is a hint that Brighton have finally found some flow, though the fans in the stand sound restless. Watford are sitting back on this, and with quite a long time to go that’s a risky strategy.60 min: Mooy and Trossard link up play, which hasn’t happened enough, but it’s too far out of goal. Watford are compressing the play at both ends.58 min: Deulofeu is given far too much space, and shoots wide. Pascal Gross had offered him the freedom of Falmer. 57 min: And that sub is made, with Maupay making it two up front. Solly March will now play at left-back. Potter is an adept manager when it comes to in-game alterations. Chelsea were on the end of that on New Year’s Day. 56 min: More Brighton pressure with not much threat involved, and Neal Maupay is coming on, with Dan Burn to be relieved of his touchline-hugging duties. 54 min: Brighton weave some pretty patterns, and struggle to find a space. Graham Potter is in deep discussion with his bench. They agonise as Schelotto fires across goal and Murray cannot reach the ball. 53 min: Burn, in his role as a Brighton’s answer to Roberto Carlos, pings in a cross that Cathcart deals with and with some ease. 51 min: Brighton again pushed back by Watford’s pressing game. Their best hope is that Watford tire later on as they have a manacle on the match at present.49 min: Etienne Capoue goes down, looks in pain and then stages a miraculous recovery. 48 min: JR in Illinois has a pertinent question. “I’m no tactical soccer expert but is the best use of Dan Burn really to have him glued to the left touchline sending in crosses?”To be fair, until his recent injury, he had done well in that position, but he is also the man who headed away 900 Manchester United crosses when a Fulham player in 2014 and David Moyes was melting down. 47 min: Stats corner. Doucoure has become an important player in Nige’s Red Adair act. 46 min: Ok, we are back underway and Brighton have plenty to do. They have never won a Premier League home game when 1-0 down at half-time in the Premier League.Poor from Brighton, far better from Watford, who took their chance well through Doucoure. Their pressing game drove Graham Potter’s team to distraction and stopped their passing game working. Plenty of work to be done at half-time.44 min: More Brighton wobbles as Watford push up on them. This time it’s Dan Burn who look panicked. Up the other end, March makes a mess of pass and when it eventually gets to Trossard he hoofs the ball into the stands to deserved jeers.42 min: Penalty shout? Schelotto goes down from a challenge from Deulofeu that was barely a challenge. VAR gets its job done quickly and there will be no penalty. There is insurrection in the Sussex air but the truth is that the Brighton defender made a meal of it. 40 min: More panic from Brighton as Deeney almost whips the ball off the feet of Duffy. And the fans getting restless when a ball hit forward doesn’t have a single home player chasing it. Glenn Murray’s lack of speed and numbers around him mean Brighton are not presenting much of a threat. 38 min: A rare touch for Trossard on the left flank, and he almost makes a chance for Murray but Cathcart is excellent again in clearing the danger. 37 min: Shane Duffy dithers and Deeney is all over him, the Watford press causing real problems. Brighton get the ball clear, but they have been unnerved.36 min: First booking of the match goes to Schelotto, for a foul on Deulofeu. It’s a soft one, and puts pressure on the full-back. 35 min: Peter Oh writes in: “Strong suckerpunch quality to Docoure’s goal. Brighton had strung together a sequence of combinations under pressure to neatly play out of their defensive third, but Mooy’s attempt to split two opponents and get the ball into the final third was blocked and Watford stormed the other way.” Exactly right.33 min: Solly March is the man most likely to make something happen for Brighton but this time the move comes from the other side of the field. It requires Cathcart, a free transfer who has provided great service to Watford, to nod calmly back to his keeper to avert the danger.31 min: March scampers to the byline, and Schelotto swings his leg at the ball. That’s better from Brighton. 30 min: Close again from Watford. Deulofeu gets down the left, and sets up Hughes, whose shot is deflected behind the goal. Dunk heads away the corner but he has to deal with another. Deeney gets a snap-shot of a chance but can’t trouble Ryan with his shot.29 min: A waste from Schelotto, as he wellies a cross straight into the hands of Ben Foster.

But it’s his own tale of escape and childhood love that would make for a winning dramaWaleed Zuaiter has the look of a Hollywood icon: salt-and-pepper hair, five o’clock shadow, beaded wooden bracelets worn in a way that projects affluence rather than crustiness, and those intense leading-man eyes. In reality, his acting career has always dangled just out of reach of superstar status. Born in California, but raised in Kuwait, he’s been acting since taking theatre at college. Now 49, he’s had chunky supporting roles in Homeland and The Spy, the Netflix mini-series about the life of Mossad agent Eli Cohen. His biggest break came in 2013, when he produced Omar, a film about love on the Palestinian border, which was nominated for an Oscar and in which Waleed also played a coercive Israeli agent. He’s shared the stage with Meryl Streep, in a New York production of Mother Courage, and the screen with George Clooney, in the film adaptation of Jon Ronson’s book The Men Who Stare at Goats. But, until now, he’s never seen his own name given top billing.We meet at the west London home of a very rich stranger, the kind of place where every fixture looks like it should be in a design museum: Vitsoe kitchen shelves, art deco chaises longues, a 6ft sculpture of the word “poo” on the toilet wall. The house has been loaned for a photoshoot, so while Waleed is spread out on the sofa looking every inch the celebrity, shoes kicked off, posing, I wait in the kitchen with his wife Joana.Joana is a producing partner in a film fund they are setting up and “unofficially his unpaid assistant”. I’d been told she would be at the interview. But I’m surprised how open she is. Within the time it takes to make a pot of coffee, she’s given me the outline of their high-school romance (“Waleed was very short in third grade, he only got tall by the ninth”) and told me a scandalous anecdote about a night they dined with a Hollywood A-lister and husband at a fancy hotel. It’s a story that ends with some consensual groping in the ladies’ toilet.When we begin talking, in a café around the corner, Zuaiter is just as open as his partner, but more serious in tone, maintaining eye contact, making sure every word is heard. He begins by explaining how, in the years since Omar, his career reached a ceiling. Zuaiter, who is Palestinian, was always getting the same offers: small parts in TV shows, a Middle Eastern character that disappears after a few episodes. All too often, those roles involved playing a terrorist. On Law \u0026amp Order Criminal Intent he was part of a terrorist sleeper cell planning an attack on New York. In the first season of Homeland he played a torturer. In the cartoonish thriller London has Fallen he played Kamran, a terrorist mastermind who launches a series of major attacks on the capital.Zuaiter has a complicated relationship with these roles. He likes that he’s able to offer a realistic depiction of a person driven to violence in the name of ideology, and often insists on script changes when he finds sections offensive. On one project he refused to put on a hammy Arab accent, pointing out that many terrorists who have carried out attacks in recent years were born in America.But he still worries that he has helped, in some way, to propagate an unsophisticated narrative about the Middle East, perhaps even to glorify terrorism. At one point he was asked by a network television show to play the head of Isis. He said no. “I just thought, look at my résumé! Look at what I’ve done! I was actually so emotional because I was watching Trump on TV at the time, saying all these things against my people. I thought I might regret the decision in a couple of months, when I had to pay the rent. But it was so offensive, it was the right thing to do.” Joana shares his unease, but she puts on a glam spin. Once, when she read that Homeland was the then US President’s favourite show, she began telling everyone: “Obama’s seen Waleed in his underwear!”Two years ago, the lack of opportunities was getting Zuaiter down. His father, a Palestinian businessman who’d always been unsure of Waleed’s decision to become an actor, had warned that he “would never talk to him” if he played a terrorist. He didn’t follow through on the threat, but relations were sometimes strained. “His background was in business and finance,” Zuaiter says. “My two older brothers went into that world. He resisted my career as an actor, it was just so foreign to him, and he felt so impotent because he couldn’t help.”Zuaiter went to visit his father that December, and the trip was full of tension and fighting. A few months later, his father died suddenly. “That haunted me – that somehow I may have caused this. All these things go through your head. I’d pretty much hit rock bottom.”So when the script for a British TV show about Iraq came in, Zuaiter didn’t even want to audition for it. Another accented role, he thought. “It took my manager, my agent and my wife to collaborate behind the scenes to get me to do it,” he says. But once Zuaiter had been convinced to look at the script, he realised that the role was more than just another Middle Eastern bit-part. Based on the novel by Elliott Colla, Baghdad Central is a big budget new drama for Channel 4 and Hulu. It tells the story of corruption and power struggles in post-invasion Iraq from the perspective of Iraqi citizens. Zuaiter plays the lead, Muhsin al-Khafaji, a liberal patriotic ex-policeman who is offered medical treatment for his daughter in return for collaboration with British and American forces in their apparent bid to rebuild law and order in Iraq. Al-Khafaji is constantly conflicted, a noirish antihero who drinks and hustles to get through his situation. It’s a role Zuaiter felt powerfully connected to. Often it’s al-Khafaji’s sick daughter who ends up caring for him – a co-dependent relationship Zuaiter connected with.The script is rich with complex political dialogue in both English and Iraqi, which Zuaiter found incredibly challenging. Twice he missed filming because learning the lines had induced a panic attack. But getting into the role had been made easier because he had first-hand experience of life under Saddam Hussein.He was born in Sacramento, where he lived until the age of five. But his family then moved to Kuwait, where his father had grown up, and where he had many business interests. Kuwait in the 80s was a land of opportunity, particularly for Palestinians who’d fled their homeland and helped build the infrastructure: water, electricity, the oil rigs that allowed prosperity to flow.Zuaiter would return to America for summer camps, and he loved his upbringing in two worlds and with two languages, English and Arabic. He met Joana, who also travelled between the US and the Middle East, in elementary school, and once they were teenagers they began an on-and-off romance that would last a lifetime. “She was my real high-school sweetheart,” he says. “I took her to prom.”His family weren’t especially political, but they largely considered Saddam a good thing. “He was saying a lot of things that supported the Palestinian cause,” Zuaiter says. “He said he was going to get Israel out of Palestine. The sentiment was: ‘Let’s get behind him. He’s got the fourth largest army in the world, he could make a difference.’ Unfortunately, when anyone wants to gain support in the Middle East, they’ll use the Palestinian cause as a way. At the time we were blinded by that. We thought he could affect some change.”In 1990, things changed rapidly. Saddam invaded Kuwait, and Zuaiter, who had both an American and a Jordanian passport, had to flee. He hid his US documentation under his bed, concerned that Saddam’s forces – who were sympathetic to Jordanians – would discover his American background.“I was trying to be as Jordanian as possible when they would stop us at checkpoints,” he says, “because American citizens were most at risk. You switch into survival instinct. Everything becomes heightened you’re very aware. You see things that you haven’t really seen before – Iraqi tanks towing extravagant Kuwaiti yachts through the street. People were in such panic that they didn’t have time to bury their dead. They just had to keep going. You saw death, you saw endless lines at the gas station, but you had to get gas because if you ran out of fuel on the road, nobody’s going to stop for you.”After he left, his focus then became on getting Joana out of the country. He continually pestered the British embassy, calling every day to tell them they needed to help get Joana out (Joana had a Fijian passport Fiji had only recently become independent of the UK).But Saddam was keen to hold Britons in the country as human hostages, as a way of preventing foreign strikes. In the end he agreed to the release of a small number, including Joana and her mother, but not before they posed in a bizarre press opportunity with him in front of members of the foreign press.“There’s this famous news footage of the British citizens,” Zuaiter says. “Saddam Hussein with this little British kid sitting on his lap. Saddam was trying to show the world how friendly he was, but the kid was terrified.” Joana was in that group you can see her in the footage. They were the last people who left Iraq and got into the UK before Operation Desert Shield began in August 1990.“I consider my childhood up until that point very innocent,” Zuaiter says. “That was a loss of innocence. I had all this stuff in my room and then when we left my dad gave me a small bag and said, ‘This is all you can take.’ All that made it easier for me as an entry point to getting into the character – to understand what loss meant.”Although there’s already hope of a second season of Baghdad Central, Zuaiter says he has felt “liberated” by opportunities he’s recently been given to play characters that are clean-shaven and speak in an American accent. He hopes that if he’s to play another leading role, it’s a character who is a bit more like him.I wonder if he ever feels the limited roles that he has offered are more than just an issue of typecasting? There’s a stereotype that everyone in Hollywood shares similar liberal views, but one area in which there is serious ergence is the Israel-Palestine conflict. In 2014, when Penélope Cruz and Javier Bardem criticised the Israeli state for strikes on Palestine that killed thousands of civilians, Jon Voight published an open letter in the Hollywood Reporter chastising the pair, saying they could “incite antisemitism all over the world” and were “oblivious to the damage they have caused.”In 2018, the Jewish film producer Jason Blum was booed off stage at the Israeli Film Festival in Beverly Hills for saying that he didn’t like Trump – shortly after the president had moved the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.I ask Zuaiter whether he’s ever found that the film industry is actively hostile to a Palestinian actor playing American roles, and he says that while he’s never knowingly been discriminated against, throughout his career people have said to him he should say that he’s Jordanian or Lebanese rather than Palestinian.“Perhaps Americans are not as educated as people in Europe – about the conflict, its history and complexity,” he says. “I had one manager who I met with early in my career. I said I was Palestinian and she said, ‘Oh,’ and gave me a look. So I said to her, ‘With all due respect, I’ve seen that reaction before, when I say I’m Palestinian – can you tell me what that is?’ She said: ‘Do you want me to be honest with you? Everything I know about Palestine is from what I hear on the news. It’s all about terrorism. When you say you’re Palestinian, it’s like you’re trying to claim something that’s not yours.’ I was grateful for her honesty. It gave me an insight into what the general public thinks.”That loyalty to his identity and his family has been repaid, although he never fully got to make amends with his father. Shortly before he passed away, he told Zuaiter: “You know, you’re a fighter.” “That meant the world to me. It was the most validation I ever really had from him. It gave me strength when we were filming, because I carried my father’s spirit throughout. So many of the characteristics of Khafaji I could directly relate to my father.”Baghdad Central is gripping and complex, with an impressive supporting cast including Bertie Carvel and Corey Stoll. It may well be Zuaiter’s moment to break into TV’s top tier. But the more astonishing story is his own: escaping Kuwait by switching passports and identities, rescuing his childhood love from a dictatorship, attempting to follow his passion amidst family strife. If Waleed wants his next project to be a character a bit more like him, he shouldn’t rule out his own biopic, it would be well worth a watch.Baghad Central is out now on Channel 4"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8a83d87670e998b14823d04e9e20a0a5317d745/0_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ecbc7d36c6afd69c43e6123914189f79","title":"blind date elle ben","story":"What were you hoping for?A great date, a great anecdote, or both.First impressions?Oops, should have dressed up more…What did you talk about?The Blind Date meta-commentary: how was your photoshoot?

This is what it taught meIf you have siblings, the chances are that your relationship with them will be the longest you ever have with anyone. It’s a tie that precedes the one you have with you partner, and that can last long after your parents and friends have gone.So why is so little attention paid to the brother and sister bond? The majority of sibling self-help books are aimed at parents who have young children locked in rivalry. Very little is written for adult siblings on how to maintain a healthy relationship. Michelle Qureshi, a London-based therapist, tells me she has seen a rise in the number of people seeking sibling counselling. “People no longer stay in the same area or live close to their extended families,” she says. “Busy schedules mean we don’t see each other as often as we used to. Sibling relationships can be intense and we set high expectations on them – so when they break, they can be difficult to resolve.”I have some experience in this area. I’m the eldest of six, ning a decade and then some. My siblings have added to the texture of my life, brought me joy and irritation, as well as the kind of worry that can only emerge from unconditional love. These are some of the things I’ve learned about the key stages of what I call sibship, after 40 years sharing my life with my brothers and sisters.My memories of early childhood are a blur of laughter, fights and chases around the house with my younger brother and sister, Zafar and Fozia. Now my own boys are the same: a whirlwind of energy, they wake each other at 6am, usually violently and noisily. The elder two are equal parts best friends and nemeses. The baby occasionally crawls into the ring to be met with an accidental flying foot and a cuddle.Sibship at this age is a CBeebies version of Mission Impossible: the world is full of intrigue and excitement this is the age of hatching plans and whispering secrets. Your relationships are linear. Your place within the hierarchy is clear, and decided by age, like it or not.Dr Sheila Redfern, a consultant child and adolescent clinical psychologist at the Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families in London, says these early relationships contribute hugely to our sense of self. “Children who are placed into foster homes together do better, even in difficult circumstances. You recover from trauma more easily if you have shared experiences. Even if they don’t get on, the effect is not any less positive.”For me, my siblings were allies with whom I could take on the world (AKA our parents). I am still scarred by memories of my primary school’s annual May Day parade, when my mother, ignoring my protests, sent me to school as The Asian Girl. Things got worse when my brother, Zafar, started school, and joined me as The Asian Boy. There we were in our shalwar kameez, surrounded by superheroes, animals, and Roald Dahl characters. But then our younger sister, Fozia, came along, and things changed: she was stubborn, and this time Mum and Dad were outnumbered. Our demands were finally heard – we wanted actual costumes, not cultural garments. They worked feverishly through the night to provide us with outfits, which I now consider ingenious, but at the time left me mortified. I wore a vegetable sack with a sash of plastic veg and was “Miss Vegetable Of The Year”. My brother was “Sandwich Board Man”, and poor Fozia, the instigator of the revolution, was a “Modern Humpty Dumpty”, her costume a cardboard box. The bonds forged that day will last a lifetime.My sister Fozia is three years younger than me, and we wound each other up incessantly - me with my books and oversize glasses, she with her need to annoy me in every possible way. I pretty much hated her back then I definitely did not understand her.Recently, though, we were looking at a photograph of my sons. “Aww, look at him in the back with the death stare,” she said. “He wants to be just like his brother. I used to be like that. I wanted to be you. I’m sorry.”I was taken aback. It’s taken us until middle age to find common ground. But then I realised it had been there all the time, on the evenings when my parents went out, and Dad would give us £20, saying it was for emergencies. We knew that was code for “pizza” and would bring all the duvets into the living room to watch The Goonies, Indiana Jones or Mr India. The warmth of those times is still with us all.There comes a point in your 20s when life is filled with the kind of busyness that takes you away from family. New relationships, careers, exciting friends, travel: it almost feels like a rejection of the people you grew up with – and perhaps that’s the way it’s meant to be.When you’re no longer living under the same roof, it takes an effort to stay connected. Partners join the fold, and family dynamics inevitably change. If your siblings don’t get on with your partner, the distance widens.Fozia’s ex-husband created a space between us. For the 10 years she was married, I rarely called her, and visited her twice. My own early 20s were spent trying to navigate a bad marriage. I withdrew, and drifted away from my brothers and sisters. But when that marriage ended and I returned home, the old alliances were still there we didn’t need preamble and context. My siblings had grown up, too. Suddenly the age gap that had seemed so huge in childhood had narrowed, and I wanted to spend time with them.Now that we are adults, we have become a sort of cheerleading squad for each other. For the younger ones, there is someone who has already navigated the world and can brief them on it. For the older ones, we realise it isn’t all on our shoulders any more.“Don’t say that!” I’m videocalling my mum, and talking about my son’s handwriting. My brother Khizer sits on my mum’s sofa, defending my five‑year-old’s poor penmanship. My sister Khola joins him. I’m in trouble. I’ve forgotten that we are pack animals, and, while the pack looks after its own, the hierarchy shifts with the introduction of new blood. In the hierarchy of sibship, I have been downgraded: my siblings’ loyalties now lie with my children. And of course, I’m OK with this. My offspring are being watched over by the people I trust most in the world.The exhausted haze of parenthood revealed more reasons to love my siblings. Their company is the one place I can lay down my hypervigilance. They have held their breath with me as my children started school, fell sick or expressed their fears my siblings cheer on their successes. Half-term at my sister Javaria’s house means arriving to find a kitchen stocked with all my picky-eater child’s favourite foods.My boys and I spent a summer in Yorkshire, flitting between my parents’ home and my siblings’ houses, and the strength of kinship was never more evident. My children ran amok, destroyed things, and then fell asleep in the glow of family, amid conversations that have been going on for decades. From the moment they were born, it is as if they sensed that my siblings were their staunchest allies.“Well, Mum always said we’d be upset when she got cancer, and here we are,” I said. Everyone laughed – only siblings could. And when she lost her hair, thanks to chemo, my little brother, Khizer, and sister, Khola, photographed themselves in her wig and shared the images.At no time is the sibling support system more essential than when a parent gets sick. My mum was in hospital with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. All six of us came together, descending from various parts of the country. “You know it is going to be OK when your big sister arrives,” my youngest sister, Khola, said as I stepped off the train at Leeds station.I was only there for a couple of weeks. Khola did all the heavy lifting: taking mum to her appointments, looking after her and making her meals. But we all knew we had to pull together. Only we knew mum’s idiosyncrasies, her need for Egyptian cotton bedsheets, a clean house, and cappuccinos that she always pronounces “car-pacino”.Mum has been cancer-free for almost seven years now, but in that moment the roles of parent and children were reversed – a reversal that gets more pronounced as we siblings progress to middle age. I remember my father running up and down the stairs of our family home when I was a child. Now, watching him take each step one at a time, I know how acutely he feels the loss of his youth. So do I.“He sends me WhatsApp messages telling me he loves me,” says my dad’s sister.My aunt is visiting, and hasn’t seen my dad in a while, but it is as if their conversation was a recording on pause, and someone has just hit play. My father was a joker in his youth, and time has subdued him. But watching him with his sister is like watching time rewind: they are young again.My mum and her siblings, scattered around the world, have a WhatsApp group where they share news of their children and grandchildren. Her phone regularly runs out of charge thanks to the continuous messaging. Thankfully, three of her sisters live close by. “Old age can be lonely,” my mum tells me, “and that’s when you realise how much you need each other. Emotional support, financial help – we offer it without being asked. I can call my sisters at any time and talk about anything. Whatever I tell them stays within the family.” Nothing, she says, compares to that feeling of being understood without explanation.One day, I hope to be old myself. And at such a time I will have five houses to go where the meals will taste like my mother’s cooking, where the generosity of spirit is the same as my father’s, and where the stories told around the kitchen table will have at their heart the values I was raised with. It turns out that sibship is the best thing my parents did for me.Let go of the baggage Get to know your sibling as the adult they are, not the child they were. Be the first to let go of a grudge – your mental health will thank you.Handle conflict kindly Language and tone matters. It’s easy to become disrespectful during an argument, or to want to blame don’t be careless.Celebrate each other’s success, but accept your own envy Sometimes you will feel jealous. Be nonjudgmental and supportive whatever happens you’re on each other’s side.Cultivate a friendship: spend quality time together away from family stress Take a class or walk together, away from children and spouses. This gives you something to talk about outside family politics.Have trusted friends outside the family circle who understand your family This helps keep things in perspective and takes the pressure off sibling relationships.Take responsibility There’s something about family that makes it harder to say sorry to a sibling than to anyone else. But it is important to apologise, as way of resolving the past and moving forward.Communicate, in real life WhatsApp groups, texting and social media make it easy to feel connected without talking. But they’re flawed means of communication it’s important to have proper conversations.• Advice by Michelle Qureshi, a registered psychotherapist practising in London.If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine’s letters page, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca392e19a602f66a51a98231d8207e011f30fcc0/0_474_8688_5213/master/8688.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bdc6bc67ab795e4067b59c75ef900f94","title":"the bright stuff guide to the best interior lighting lamps pendants","story":"Ceiling pendants and floor lamps, dimmable LEDs and coloured bulbs… Nothing changes the mood of a room quicker than a new lighting makeoverLighting can be used in many ways to transform and illuminate a home. It’s mood-altering and life-enhancing, and whether you’re looking to cast a cosy glow or light up your living space, it’s often the quickest way to refresh a room without lifting a paint brush. Even a stand-alone floor or table lamp can provide direct pools of light and a welcome glow where it’s needed.The spherical design of Cult Furniture’s Abel 3 Globe floor lamp not only looks good, but will warmly illuminate the space. If you are balancing out grander fixtures, try more subtle and cosy lighting with directional elements, such as H\u0026ampM’s gold cylindrical metal table lamp, or opt for the nifty design of the Bover Beddy LED wall lamp with its moulded shelf. It’s great for bedtime reading as you can angle the light wherever it’s needed.Adding a playful and decorative flourish will also help set the tone. Channel a surrealist feel with unusual bases with Next’s Peacock floor lamp. Glare-free is usually the way to go, especially in a bathroom – nobody wants to highlight the top of their head in a mirror. Place lights evenly on either side instead. The Artemide Dioscuri can be used on the wall or ceiling. In the bedroom choose a warm and relaxing directional LED, or switch on to the current trend for portable USB chargeable lamps, such as the Marset Bicoca, which works well as a bedside light with three dimming settings and an adjustable shade. It’s perfect for picking up and plonking down wherever you are.If you don’t want your dinner lit up like a crime scene, you can shun LED ceiling spotlights above dining tables and turn on to designs such as the Secto Octo pendant. Handmade in Finland from sustainably sourced birch, it hangs as a trio over your table and will transform a flat, lifeless space into a calming dining den. Or choose a metallic finish, such as brass and copper. The long shimmering Bolha pendants from Heal’s will add some glam and help differentiate the dining space from the work zones.Practical considerations often dictate feature lighting – oversize pendants and sculptural chandeliers demand high ceilings to avoid bumping your head. Jonathan Adler’s extraterrestrial Electrum Kinetic chandelier is guaranteed to turn heads wherever it hangs. But just because your ceiling is low doesn’t mean you can’t go for illuminations with impact. The Kolding Ball Cluster from BHS or Le Klint’s 161 pendant will cast a light through the geometric folds of the shade.With advances in materials and technology, designers are now exploring more possibilities in lighting as art, with the bonus that the pendant looks as good when the lights are turned off. Ethereal glowing orbs, tubes and rings, often linked together like giant minimalist jewellery, softly diffuse light, with no obvious source, adapting to all rooms and styles of interior. Lee Broom’s Orion is a beautiful example. Each piece can be personalised to create bespoke constellations of light with infinite adaptations.A less expensive but still luxe-looking option is Made’s Remi Pendant with its clouded opal white glass in a brushed brass ring.1. There are three main categories of regular light bulb available: CFLs (compact fluorescent lamp – the energy-efficient alternative to the defunct incandescent bulbs), halogens and LEDs.4. LEDs really are the lights of the future: Philips’ Hue White and Colour Ambience bulbs are smart LEDs that will radiate different colours and change in hue as they respond to the sound of your voice.5. Get the right bulb brightness by comparing lumens instead of watts. The higher the lumens, the brighter the bulb. If you need help with conversion: 450 lumens  40 watts 1,000 lumens  75 watts 2,600 lumens  150 watts.6. Choose the right shape of bulb, as each one provides a different spread and angle of light. Also consider how the bulbs will look when they are switched off.Gone are the days where the cold white light of LEDs meant your room was lit up like a surgery. Thanks to the new breed of coloured and dimmable energy-saving bulbs, you can now achieve a warm, welcoming glow at home.“Lots of LEDs are now mimicking the filament style of the incandescent bulb,” says Clare Griffin, the lighting buyer at Habitat. “Manufacturers are also making decorative and coloured bulbs to help create that soft glow.”If you’re not already up on your Kelvins (K), it’s the scale with which we now measure light colour or “colour temperature” – the lower the number, the more warmth and yellowness there is to the light.To recreate the cosy glow of an old-fashioned bulb, choose an LED light with around 2,700K, such as the Celestia Opal LED (£39.99, Dowsing \u0026amp Reynolds). LEDs around 3,000K are good for task lighting in kitchens and bathrooms, but avoid anything over 4,000K, which is a dazzling white.Dimmable LED-filament bulbs produce a warm white light – try the Porcelain II (£25, Tala). Also see the Calex LED Globe (£20, John Lewis) with its curly filament and gold finish.For a retro look, opt for the dimmable LED Teardrop (£20, Buster \u0026amp Punch), which has an amber glow. Davey Lighting’s classic squirrel cage LED bulb, is also dimmable (£15, Hoxton Lights).

Used by women to dab dry after urination, they are approximately 10cm (4in) in diameter, about the size of an old-fashioned washcloth.The blotters are then collected in a receptacle before being laundered and sun-dried for re-use. Toilet paper, or a bidet, is still used for defecation.According to IBISWorld’s Industry Reports on Sanitary Paper Product Manufacturing in the US, total US expenditure in 2019 on toilet paper alone was about $US1.61bn. In the Australian market, IBISWorld reported 2018-2019 industry revenue from the “sanitary tissues” segment including facial tissues, toilet paper, napkins and serviettes, paper towels and antibacterial wipes of approximately $AUD990m.However, the IBISWorld report also forecast that during the five-year period to 2024, “competition from reusable, eco-friendly substitutes will increase as consumers become more environmentally conscious”.Porter is not surprised at this, given growing awareness that paper production and distribution require significant amounts of land, water, raw materials, energy, chemicals and fossil fuels. Following one year of use, the non-disposable wipes have reduced Porter’s toilet paper consumption dramatically, “and the bonuses are they don’t disintegrate when damp and they feel so much better on my body,” she said.“The blotters make sense on multiple levels including environmental, economic and comfort,” says gynecologist Alyssa Dweck co-author of the book The Complete A to Z for your V. “Sensitivity to toilet paper is a thing, especially if dyed, fragrant, rough or made from recycled paper that might have had ink exposure.”Penny Kothe, another blotting convert, lives with her husband in an old 6WD army ambulance, travelling Australia as regenerative farming volunteers. A former certified organic farmer with a bachelor of business degree, she estimates the toilet paper alternative saves one to two rolls of toilet paper per week. “Space is really tight when on the road and camping, so it means I don’t need to store so much. It’s so convenient too, I can easily keep a few cloths in my handbag and am never without something to use.”And what of people’s negative reactions? “My son actually helped me hem them, but some people say the use of energy and water to wash them negates the environmental impact,” says Kothe, “but I disagree as I just put them in with normal laundry loads. Hygienically, I don’t think it’s any different to when your son’s or partner’s jocks go in the same wash as other clothes, because, let’s face it, most males don’t use toilet paper for wees and can’t always avoid drips either.”Lauren F Streicher, MD, clinical professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at the Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University says there are no health risks from the practice. “People urinated long before toilet paper became available. There are zero health concerns with this … people have urine on their underwear all the time.”Dweck concurs. “Other than the general ‘yuck’ factor of having to store used blotters until laundry day, I don’t see any high risk for infection, especially if washed in hot, hot water and if you wash your hands after toileting. It’d be so convenient too if you are camping, hiking or land in the one stall that has an empty roll. I actually love the innovative spirit of this.”“I think everyone should try it out,” says Kothe, “and if it doesn’t suit, work out why and then work out how to adapt. One day, like some people experienced in the recent bushfires, you might run out or the supermarkets might be closed. We need to start being more resilient now.”Helping with that resilience are upskilling enterprises such as The Rhi Rebellion who have begun running workshops to spread the word and teach people how to make the cloths, as well as selling them to those who choose not to DIY.Back in Canberra, Porter’s experience has revealed that people are either interested or repulsed by the idea, “but I just say, ‘cut up an old towel and give it a go’.” Her tips for getting started include “an open wastepaper basket for used ones so you can let them air dry with zero smell before washing”. However, she warns “mark your clean and used baskets or keep them on different sides of the toilet so you don’t get confused”. Porter even encourages house guests to try. “It’s up to you if you leave fresh ones out for visitors to use, if you do, just hang some instructions on the wall - it’s a great way for others to learn.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff1012b50cd5f5888fbeaa66e9ab3adc4b91e0ae/26_47_2062_1237/master/2062.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bac26a72fc93dd560c3c5dcd072e1a7f","title":"my life in oscars parties colin firth hadley freeman","story":"The 2020 Academy Awards will be my seventh. I’ve yet to win one but I’ve brought home some great storiesWhen you read this, I will be in Los Angeles, which is nice. I love LA, which is not a sentence you hear often, especially in Britain, where the city is often derided as too shallow, too full of celebrities and too hot, none of which are negatives in my book. The British antipathy to LA is rooted in a suspicion that anything that pleasant can’t be good for you, and an experience only counts if it involves endurance. I’ve spent the past 20 summers hacking it out at British festivals, trudging through mud with a rucksack the size of a car on my back, all in the name of Fun. So the first time I went to Coachella in California’s Palm Springs I thought I was hallucinating, like when Tintin gets so dehydrated he fantasises a sparkling oasis surrounded by palm trees, because that is what Coachella looks like. As I sat on the perfect green grass, eating my acai bowl, I remembered when Brits grumped that Glastonbury was getting gentrified because there were flushable toilets. Britain’s self-image is rooted in 1970s sitcoms, whereas California believes life should be like a Hollywood movie.And sometimes it actually is. I’m out here to cover the Oscars for, I think, the seventh time. I know this is deeply uncool to admit but, hot damn, I love the Oscars. Even as a kid one of my most beloved video cassettes was called Oscars Greatest Moments, but attending them has taken matters to a new level. I’ve yet to win an Oscar, but it is at the awards where I’ve lived out some of the great movie storylines. Behold, my Oscars Greatest Moments.What I hesitate to call my relationship with Harvey Weinstein can be charted by the Oscars we attended. In 2011, I was told by one of Weinstein’s 10 million assistants that I was banned from all Oscars parties and every restaurant in Beverly Hills, due to disparaging coverage of the The Weinstein Corporation in the ’s business pages. Once I’d stopped laughing, I courageously – like a marine, really – went to an Oscars party at Soho House, where Weinstein did, indeed, try to throw me out and I, marine-style, hid in the bathroom. As we now know, I was not the first woman to have to hide from Harvey in a bathroom. A few years later, Weinstein marked Oscars day by writing an article about me for this paper, complaining that I didn’t appreciate his Baftas party enough: “Next time Hadley Freeman comes to one of our parties she should relax, loosen up, have a glass of champagne and be sure to stay the whole night and really, truly… enjoy herself.” Not creepy at all, Harv! And here we are this year – or rather, here I am, because Weinstein is otherwise engaged. Such a shock this guy turned out to have a problem with women.The year: 2015. The person: Eddie Murphy. I spot Murphy on his own at an Oscars party and start hyperventilating over him with hero worship. He, alas, is less excited to meet me and walks away. Someone then taps me on the shoulder. “Hey, don’t worry I’ll take a selfie with you,” says the man, who I vaguely remember was hanging round with Murphy earlier. I graciously allow him to take a photo with me, and fly home the next day. “Some random member of Eddie Murphy’s entourage took a selfie with me,” I tell my boyfriend, showing him the photo.Turns out it was not a random member of Murphy’s entourage – it was Kevin Hart, AKA the biggest comedian on the planet. For the proper movie ending, Kevin and I should meet again at this Oscars and get married. You know where to find me, Kevin! (Lurking creepily around Eddie Murphy.)I went to the Vanity Fair party, where I spotted someone we’ll call dorky director (DD) with Weinstein (him again) and Matt Damon. As I knew DD a bit socially, I said hi, reminding him of my name. But DD decided I was not beneficial to his Hollywood cred, so he stuck his hand in my face and said, “No press.” Weinstein and Damon were now looking at me as Eddie Murphy would a few years later, and I was speechless with shock. But Colin Firth was nearby, overheard what happened and – despite clearly having never heard my name before – said, “Hadley Freeman? I’m such a fan! Can I talk to you?” Yes, this actually happened. DD looked like someone had punched him in the face. I was Lizzie Bennet at the end of Pride And Prejudice, Bridget Jones at the end of Bridget Jones’s Diary. Roll end credits!Exciting epilogue: in revenge for my Firth triumph, DD told friends of mine that he and I had had an affair in LA but I “couldn’t handle his freakiness”. Conclusion: men are dicks. Except for Colin Firth.So I’m excited about what movie plot will unfold around me tomorrow. Time travel, perhaps? Period drama? (Nah, sounds messy.) Fingers crossed for a body-swap storyline – maybe with Colin Firth. I know he’d be an excellent sport about it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/563eb80ac7c17a9595440176b1cdc6df06eb00af/0_77_5100_3059/master/5100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0820f44656803eb0be91aba7f65e93a","title":"bank couple lose 43000 but cant get a refund","story":"Two retirees were conned out of their savings, but the banks say they were negligentIt started with a phone call to their home landline – and ended with a police stakeout and panic alarm being fitted in their Cambridgeshire home. A retired couple who lost £43,000 to persistent and expert fraudsters have become the latest victims to complain that banks’ voluntary fraud code promising refunds to victims is worthless.In May last year, the UK’s biggest banks all agreed to abide by a new code that would see the victims of what is known as “authorised push payment fraud” refunded in full. Victims duped into sending money to an account operated by criminals were to be refunded, where they had been the victim of a complex fraud – a so-called no-blame scenario.At the time the code was hailed as a breakthrough as before then the banks were routinely blaming fraud victims, and turning down claims for refunds on the basis that people had been grossly negligent.However, a growing number of fraud victims have contacted  Money in recent months to say that nothing has changed, and that the banks are ignoring the code.The most recent are George and Pamela Ross (not their real names), who live near Cambridge. Back in November, the Rosses took a call on their home landline from someone claiming to be a bank fraud investigator, who told them that their life savings were at risk of being stolen.The couple were told staff could only discuss the details with them if they called their bank’s fraud team by phoning the number on the back of their bank cards.But the scammers were able to keep the line open during this process, using fake dialling tones, phones ringing in series, and even phone transfers, so that the elderly couple believed they had reached call centres at Halifax and Santander.They were told that the banks’ own employees were under investigation, and bosses needed their help to catch them.During the following 24 hours, the couple were “groomed” to help take down a supposed network of corrupt employees working within Halifax and Santander banks, says their daughter Sam.They were instructed not to discuss the matter with family or anyone else, and in particular the staff in the banks in question. The fraudsters kept in close contact with them over the phone – even while they attended a hospital appointment, she says.“The fraudsters were able to coerce my 75-year-old mother to visit the Cambridge branch of Halifax where she was instructed to make two transfers of £19,000 to what later turned out to be accounts at Lloyds and Barclays,” Sam says.“She believed these accounts were safe accounts set up by the investigators. My father was similarly coerced to withdraw £5,000 cash from a local Santander branch, and to hand it over to a courier for ‘fingerprint analysis’. They were both warned on approaching each bank that staff would question them in detail about scams. They were instructed to ignore this, although ironically they were not questioned in any sort of detail at all. This was in spite of the fact that these payments were completely out of keeping with their normal payments history.”Only when she happened to call her parents, who were in a highly distressed state, did the scam emerge. When Sam realised what was happening, the police were called, and to their credit, she says, they took the matter seriously.“The fraudsters had sent a courier to pick up the £5,000 in cash, and were trying to persuade my father to make a second withdrawal. The police hoped to catch them at it, and my father was instructed to play along. A second withdrawal was set to be picked up at their house. A parcel of marked bank notes was handed over and the village was flooded with plain clothes officers.“However, no arrest was made. My brother turned up at my parents’ house by chance and was grabbed by the police. They then swooped on another innocent person, at which point the fraudsters must have realised the game was up. Their phone calls stopped abruptly, and they got away. My parents were left fearing there could be reprisals, meaning a panic alarm had to be installed in their home,” says Sam.She says the police have confirmed this was a particularly sophisticated scam. She has asked Halifax and Santander to refund the money, but both have refused.However, this case raises difficult questions. To what extent can the banks be liable in situations such as this? Despite the police’s rare involvement in a bank fraud case, both Halifax and Santander argued that the couple were to blame.This week Commander Karen Baxter, who leads the City of London police’s economic crime unit, told Radio 4 that this “despicable” crime, which sees victims skilfully “groomed”, has jumped recently. In January, police arrested 44 people suspected of this crime recovering a huge quantity of cash, she said.One of the problems that fraud victims have encountered is that the code states that only “no-blame” customers will be refunded. The banks are supposed to be more sympathetic to older victims, but rarely are.The Financial Ombudsman Service has told banks they should refund victims – citing an almost identical scenario to this case.A Halifax spokesman says: “We have a great deal of sympathy, and a decision not to provide a refund is never one which is taken lightly. Sadly our customers did not take sufficient steps to verify the identity of the cold-caller, and also ignored a specific warning from our branch about exactly this type of scam.“Your bank or police will never ask you to move money to a ‘safe account’. We understand our customers have asked the Financial Ombudsman Service to consider their case, and we will of course fully cooperate with any review.”Santander, though, has since decided to refund the couple. “Santander has the utmost sympathy for this couple and all those who fall victim to scams,” it says. “Following a review of the specific circumstances of this case we have agreed to refund the £5,000 that was withdrawn in branch.” It noted that cash withdrawals are not covered by the code.Meanwhile, Sam asks what more could have been done.“My parents were scam aware. If I did not know that scammers could fake dialling tones and bank call centres, how could they be expected to?” she says.• UK Finance, the banks’ representative body, has said long-awaited changes to interbank payments that come into force on 31 March should massively reduce APP fraud. After this date, the account holder’s name will be matched with the person that is being paid – for the first time. Until now, users could put Mickey Mouse into the name box on an online transfer and the payment would go through. From April the name will be shown – exposing the fraudster’s account is not in the victim’s name."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db3646ba391ff6b8b244e3a70aef3a78e3859a36/0_0_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e7123b968311a8ff8d0fbda18204341","title":"should i buy a manual petrol car or automatic hybrid","story":"My children are likely to learn to drive on it – and I’m wondering if the era of geared cars is overEvery week a  Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper.I’d like to buy a hybrid car but they’re nearly all automatics.

Some of Starmer’s supporters were said to be pushing his connection to the radical leftwing publication Socialist Alternatives, which he edited in his early 20s.Support from Corbyn’s north London stronghold cements Starmer as the clear frontrunner before a crucial week of the campaign. He has the support of more than twice the number of constituency Labour parties than Long-Bailey, his nearest rival.Tensions bubbled to the surface on Saturday at a hustings in Nottingham, when Emily Thornberry appeared to take a swipe at Long-Bailey’s disputed claims to have been up all night and fuelled by pizza as a result of the mass frontbench walkout designed to topple Corbyn in 2016. To gasps from the audience, Thornberry said: “I know some people had to be up late eating pizza but I did all these difficult jobs at the same time in support of the leader in the way he needed to be supported.”Long-Bailey responded to the jibe, saying: “Oh, miaow. We love each other really. I was working very, very hard, I’ll have everybody know. We did have to eat pizza.”Responding to the question that prompted the clash, which was whether it was acceptable for a Labour MP to attack a Labour council, she said: “In terms of attacking colleagues, we shouldn’t attack each other publicly under any circumstances.”Starmer pulled out of the hustings because his mother-in-law remains in a critical condition in hospital after an accident last month.The new Labour leader will be announced on 4 April."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/258e2aa2b6dda500e28812acaf85d4f473063b57/85_65_1657_994/master/1657.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e7f9e17cc94308cfeae16b1684c87882","title":"tracy brabin shouldergate dress ebay charity","story":"Proceeds from online auction of House of Commons dress to go to Girlguiding charity Bids on an off-the-shoulder dress worn by Tracy Brabin in the House of Commons have passed £14,000 in a charity auction.The Labour MP was forced to defend her attire after the dress slipped off her shoulder when she leaned on the dispatch box because of a broken ankle on Tuesday.Brabin decided to sell the dress for charity on eBay, where bids reached £14,200 on Saturday afternoon.The auction ends on Thursday and the money raised will go to Girlguiding, a charity for girls and young women in the UK.Brabin’s outfit had been criticised on social media earlier in the week. It was a topic of discussion on the BBC’s Question Time on Thursday – where one audience member described it as “a disco outfit”.The Labour MP responded to criticism with a tweet. She said she felt the reaction had been overblown. “All of that sexualisation about a shoulder, it’s like The Handmaid’s Tale gone mad. Or Victorian England, with an ankle showing,” she told the Times.On Friday Rebecca Long-Bailey defended Brabin and criticised the levels of scrutiny faced by women politicians over their appearance.The Labour leadership contender told BBC Breakfast: “Women tend to get that scrutiny far more than men.

His work on string theory has focused on the forms that extra dimensions may take. His latest book is Until the End of Time: Mind, Matter and Our Search for Meaning in an Evolving Universe.What got you into physics?As a kid I had the same kinds of questions that most kids struggle with at one time or another: why am I here, how did I come to be here, is there a purpose to it all? I remember thinking that if there was an answer I would know it, because everyone would know it. But no one did. So it struck me that seeking an answer to those questions was unlikely to yield anything deeply interesting. Instead, I got interested in the context: not why am I here, but how did I come to be here? Not why is there a universe, but how did it come to be? And those questions take you to the heart of physics.When you were a student, a gas oven exploded in your face when you tried to cook a pizza. Did it have any impact on your life as a scientist?It was the last experiment I ever did, and an unwitting experiment at that. I don’t touch equipment. I’m a theorist through and through: pens, paper, pencils, computers. Even when I was in college, I somehow managed to slip through the requirement that students had to take a laboratory course. I found a way of getting out of it. No doubt, the exploding oven was looming in the background.Expertise has come under attack in the US and the UK in recent years. Should we be worried? There are questions that have right and wrong answers as opposed to opinions, and we’ve unfortunately come to a place where many people don’t make that distinction. It’s a vital one, especially when some of the questions are going to determine the fate of humankind and the fate of the planet. The solution has to be education. We need to impress upon kids at an early age that there are ways of investigating the world that can yield demonstrable truths. That’s an exciting thing for a kid to learn. And it’s essential.Physicists are vying to build a new particle collider to supersede the Large Hadron Collider. Who should host it?China is the likely place for it to be built, but it has to be a group of countries coming together. I’d like to think it doesn’t matter in which country it’s built, because it’ll be a machine for all humanity. Science is this beautiful place, perhaps the sole place, where the world comes together to work shoulder-to-shoulder on questions that transcend national borders, and that’s a powerful thing. Is there a fifth force? Are there other particles? Is there an explanation for why matter particles have the properties they do? In other words, is there an explanation for why reality has the properties that it does? These are the kinds of universal questions the next machine can help us answer.If you had a time machine, where and when would you go?I would go forwards instead of backwards, which is a good thing because I don’t think you can go backwards and I know for a fact that you can go forwards. Hanging out near the edge of a black hole is a popular technique. You spend a year near the edge and if you are close enough, you come back and it will be a billion years later. Or you go out on a rocket ship near the speed of light for six months, and turn around and come back, and depending on how close to the speed of light you travelled, when you return it’ll be thousands or millions or billions of years into the future. So we know how to time travel in theory, we just don’t know how to execute it in practice. I would go as far forward as the device allowed me to, because once I got there, I could always read about what happened beforehand. I would want to be in an era when there are still planets and stars. I would probably not go beyond a trillion years from now. It would be very lonely though. I would only do it if I could take my family.In your book, you talk about the rising disorder – the increasing entropy – of the universe, and how that shapes its future. If the universe is becoming more and more disordered, why do stars, planets and people form? This is absolutely fundamental. The beauty of the second law of thermodynamics is that while it stipulates that the overall amount of disorder has to increase, little pockets of order can form so long as, in the process, they create enough disorder in the surrounding environment to compensate. For stars and planets, we can establish that the formation process discards enough waste and disorder to the surrounding environment that the overall disorder goes up. Indeed, we humans are contraptions that squeeze out the disorder that is locked inside of matter. We eat things, we breathe, and when we metabolise all that we take in, we use it to create our internal order, to grow bigger, stronger and so forth, but in the process we release enough heat and waste so that the overall disorder balance sheet is totally in the direction of disorder.What big problem would you like to see solved in your lifetime? The nature of time. Where did time come from? Is there a realm of reality where there isn’t any notion of time? Is time fundamental or does it only emerge in certain environments? These are the kinds of questions that, were we to gain insight before I move on to whatever realm awaits, which is probably nothing, would be deeply satisfying.As someone who contemplates the origins and ends of the universe, how important is it to see the night sky?These days in Manhattan, on the clearest of nights, you can see about three stars. It may sound naive, but it feels to me that if more people nightly experienced a brilliant sky full of stars, in some small way it would make the world a better place. It would make the world a place where we’d recognise we’re part of a much grander whole. We are heading in a direction where fewer and fewer members of the species will have that experience.In your book, you talk about the “majesty of religion”. What do you mean by that?There’s a tendency, certainly among some scientists I know, to judge religion by whether or not it gives us factual information about an objective reality. That’s not the right yardstick. There are many others who recognise that the value of religion is found in its capacity to provide a sense of community, to allow us to see our lives within a larger context, to connect us through ritual to our forebears, to alleviate anxiety in the face of mortality, among other thoroughly subjective benefits. When I’m looking to understand myself as a human, and how I fit in to the long chain of human culture that reaches back thousands of years, religion is a deeply valuable part of that story.How big a part has music played in your life? My dad was a composer and a singer. He dropped out of school early on to travel around the country as a singer-songwriter and later on as a vocal coach. That was a deep part of my upbringing. Music to me is the most direct route that we humans have to touching something that is powerfully beyond everyday experience. It allows the mind to move into a realm that’s hard to get to, hard to reach, by any other means.You mention in your book that we might be “Boltzmann brains” – fleeting aggregations of particles in space that happen to create the sense of being us. Does it keep you awake at night?I don’t worry in the sense of it giving me some kind of existential angst. I am confident that I am not a Boltzmann brain. However, we want our theories to similarly concur that we are not Boltzmann brains, but so far it has proved surprisingly difficult for them to do so. So, I see Boltzmann brains as a mathematical problem that we need to solve, as opposed to an existential affront. I believe it is a problem that we will one day overcome.On a cosmic timescale, humanity will probably exist for the blink of an eye. If our species will one day die out, why should we strive to achieve?As I discuss in the book, we have emerged from a vast sequence of quantum events stretching back to the big bang, every one of which could have turned out differently, resulting in a universe in which we did not exist. When you realise that, and when you realise too that life and mind are fleeting phenomena on the cosmic timeline, you realise that we should strive not in the service of leaving a lasting legacy, but rather because we have each been given an astoundingly unlikely, profoundly precious opportunity.If people take away one thought from your book, what should it be?That there is great value in understanding how we fit into the largest possible landscape, the longest possible timeline. Seeing how we and our species fit in between the big bang and the closest science can take us to the end of time is something that gives us deeply illuminating context. It allows us to see the human search for meaning and purpose in a different light, and with that to recognise that there is no ultimate answer hovering in the depths of space awaiting discovery. Instead, the context provided by the cosmological narrative frees us fully to develop our own, deeply and thoroughly subjective reasons for being."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a217e5e31429ee82ca175d168be657bc71caaa6/0_0_5416_3251/master/5416.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf9b7b113f378000158833351abc9205","title":"cosmic ray research station mount aragats photo essay","story":"Cut off during winter, a former Soviet weapons research facility high up on Mount Aragats, Armenia is now part of a network of sites around the world studying the mysterious particlesThe cosmic ray research station on Mount Aragats sits at an altitude of 3,200 metres. The site in Armenia was constructed in 1943 to conduct top-secret research into atomic reactions for the development of nuclear weapons. Now the facility provides insight into thunderstorms and cosmic rays. The only way visitors can reach the base in winter is via a nine-mile (15km) climb through snow.Arshak Mkrtchyan, a mountain guide, cuts a trail to the station in snowshoes in temperatures around -22C.Arriving at the station at sunset, the wind is howling across the plateau and the temperature has plummeted to dangerous levels.Technicians at the facility work one month on, one month off during the winter.Inside the station, it is surprisingly cosy. Edik Arshakian and Gurgen Jabaryan, both technicians, are tasked with monitoring the scientific equipment, while Gohar Hovhannisian prepares the meals. She describes being somewhat trapped during the winter.Hovhannisian presides over an enormous kitchen built during the Soviet period, when scores of technicians were required to monitor and maintain rudimentary equipment. In winter she cooks mostly for just two technicians and herself.The confusingly named “rays” are, in fact, high-energy protons and atomic nuclei that zip through space at nearly the speed of light.When they meet the Earth’s atmosphere they strike atoms and scatter them like snooker balls. These particles have the power to cut through material, including humans, and are sometimes blamed for corrupting digital memory and crashing computers.The particles are one of the main obstacles to interplanetary travel, and their effects on astronauts and pilots are the subject of continued study.High-altitude bases such as the one on Aragats are exposed to far higher doses of the cosmic specks than occurs at sea level, since the Earth’s atmosphere serves as a protective blanket.The Aragats facility is part of a network of sites around the world studying cosmic rays and is linked to research stations as far away as Costa Rica and Indonesia.As well as studying cosmic rays, the centre is equipped with sensors that can record lightning strikes from miles around. In 2018, researchers using the sensors on Aragats found a link between thunderclouds and drastic spikes in radiation, which may affect passengers and crew onboard aircraft.Soviet-era electronics abound at the base. Amid the economic turmoil that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Aragats station was kept alive by state funds and donations from the Armenian diaspora community which continue today.Dotted around the centre, “scintillators” record incoming cosmic rays as they strike chunks of clear plastic inside, causing tiny flashes of light.Although Aragats is a thriving research site in summer, when visitors can arrive by car, through the long winter months it is a lonely place almost cut off from the rest of the world.Jabaryan jokes that his favourite part of working at the site is “when the snowmobile comes to pick me up at the end of the month”. But the isolation of this mountain station is a worthy sacrifice for science since, as Hovhannisian says: “We’re above civilisation.

An admirable weekend from the rookie and a solid recovery from Heather Watson were ultimately insufficient, though, as Slovakia triumphed 3-1 defeat against Great Britain in the Fed Cup Qualifier in Bratislava. After Watson pulled one win back against Rebecca Sramkova, Dart lost the decisive rubber 7-5 6-3 to Anna Karolina Schmiedlova.The day started with a surprise as Slovakia’s No 1, Viktoria Kuzmova, was forced to withdraw from her match against Watson just an hour before play began. Although Dart was unable to secure victory in her debut Fed Cup singles rubber against the world No 65, she clearly left her mark. Kuzmova had arrived in the competition slightly under the weather and Dart’s two hours, 55 minutes of grit on Friday pushed the Slovak over the edge.Watson told the BBC she had been leisurely watching Netflix when she learned that her opponent had changed and she scrambled for some last-minute scouting. From being billed as the underdog against a natural clay-court player, Watson was suddenly heavily favoured against an inferior rival.It is the type of pressure she loves and instead of feeling forced outside of her comfort zone as she did against Schmiedlova on Friday, the roles were reversed and Watson had endless time to patiently control the points against a player whose ground strokes struggled to pierce the court.Nine years after making her Fed Cup debut, Watson now proudly boasts a record of 21-10, which places her joint second on the all-time list for Fed Cup singles wins by British women, behind only Virginia Wade. There have been plenty of tough losses against superior opponents, but throughout her Fed Cup career, Watson has expertly torn through the matches she is supposed to win. She is extremely reliable and she will always bring a certain level of quality to each match. In the majority of her contests, it is usually enough.Watson’s victory set the stage for a must-win match for Dart in order to keep the tie alive. Although Dart’s ranking of 140 puts her above the No 199, there was no delusion in the British camp about the quality of the tie’s MVP, Anna Karolina Schmiedlova, who is returning from knee surgery and had previously risen as high as No 26. While Dart was able to rely on her defence and scrappily dig out as many errors as possible from, Schmiedlova is a quick, consistent player who intelligently navigates the clay. Dart would have to be considerably more aggressive.The importance of the encounter was reflected in how proactive both players were as they constantly prodded each other’s defences, desperate to find a way through. Dart sent laser-like beloved backhands down the line and she constantly exposed Schmiedlova’s court positioning with sweet, delicate drop shots The points were grueling and entertaining but in the end the Slovak’s superior savvy on the clay court drove her through as she broke Dart at 6-5 to steal the first set. In the second set, Schmiedlova battled through numerous tight service games, but she constantly kept her head above water and secured the win.In the end, despite Johanna Konta’s absence looming throughout, a different surface may have yielded a great result. The surface proved the defining difference of the tie, with the Slovaks demonstrating their expertise as they outmanoeuvred Great Britain to victory.As Slovakia head to Budapest for the Fed Cup finals alongside Switzerland, Germany, France and Australia, Great Britain will have to defend their spot in the top level of the competition at the Fed Cup play-offs in April. A loss in April and relegation to the Fed Cup zonal groups just one year after finally escaping them would be a considerably more traumatic result.In other Fed Cup qualifiers, Serena Williams made a happy return in her first Fed Cup singles match in five years, extending her unbeaten singles record to 14-0 by soaring under pressure in both tie-breaks as she beat Jelena Ostapenko 7-6 (4) 7-6 (3).

Ireland battered Wales with a sustained ferocity and while most teams would have been blown away, the champions clung to the wreckage of their afternoon so tightly that it was only five minutes from the end that they conceded the bonus point the home side’s dominance had merited.Ireland were unrecognisable from the week before when they had laboured against Scotland. They tore into Wales from the kick-off, regularly achieving width against a narrow defence, and targeted the Wales centre Nick Tompkins, who was making his first Test start after coming off the bench against Italy the week before.Robbie Henshaw twice went through Tompkins in the opening 15 minutes and the Saracens centre was caught out at the end of the third quarter as he drifted across field and was stepped by Jordan Larmour, whose instant acceleration took him through the tackles of Tomos Williams and Josh Adams and over the line for the opening score.Wales opted to play into the wind and it meant they struggled for territory as Ireland built momentum. The tone was sent in the opening minute when Jacob Stockdale was set free on the left wing and kicked to the Wales line. Dan Biggar was engulfed after being forced to pick up the ball just short of his line and conceded a scrum.That came to nothing because Wyn Jones won a penalty off Tadhg Furlong. The Wales players celebrated a battle won, but nothing like the Ireland forward 18 minutes from the end after Wales’s one period of sustained attacking. The visitors, who were looking to equal their record of nine successive victories in the championship, were trailing 19-7 and had just wasted a chance when Hadleigh Parkes narrowly lost control of the ball as he stretched out for the line.Ireland had made the most of Stuart Hogg’s failure to ground the ball the week before and as Wales looked to profit from a five-metre scrum, Dave Kilcoyne put pressure on Dillon Lewis. The Wales tight-head went to ground and the roar from the Irish eight was almost as loud as the crowd when the referee, Romain Poite, raised his arm in the air and pointed it towards the men in green.They were two costly moments Wales will look back on as turning points. A third, and the most calamitous, came after 31 minutes when the Wales captain, Alun Wyn Jones, won a lineout eight metres from his line and sent the ball into the hands of Tomos Williams, for what should have been a routine clearance. The scrum-half seemed to be thinking about his clearance rather than taking possession and knocked on.Ireland used the scrum to set up a forward rumble and two phases later, Furlong powered through his opposite number Lewis. It was a snapshot of the afternoon: Ireland were stronger and more direct, winning the physical contest by some distance, but despite the pressure they were under, Wales generally kept their discipline and that kept them in the game.They were in one sense relieved to get to the interval only 12-7 down. Their try, scored by Tomos Williams four minutes before his knock-on, typified their approach under the head coach, Wayne Pivac – midfield off-loads by Alun Wyn Jones, who led by an example that not enough of his colleagues followed, and Biggar creating a hole in the defence the scrum-half’s pace exploited. But Wales lacked the intensity of their opponents and too many of their moves ended with unforced handling errors.Wales had little chance to use the wind when Ireland extended their lead – Josh van der Flier at the end of a driving maul, although on review there looked to be as much evidence for denying the try as awarding it.Peter O’Mahony personified Ireland’s aggression, CJ Stander haunted Wales at the breakdown, powerful over the ball, and Ireland’s front five were on the front foot in attack and defence, allowing Conor Murray and Jonathan Sexton to dictate from half-back. Henshaw spent the 43 minutes he was on the field, before suffering a head injury, trying to prove why he should have started against Scotland. Ireland’s back three rippled with menace.Andrew Conway scored Ireland’s bonus-point try five minutes from time and while Wales had the last word through Justin Tipuric, they were well beaten and after losing the replacement Owen Williams, who strained a hamstring in the warm-up, Adams lasted 25 minutes before going off with a hip injury. Biggar’s clash with Henshaw resulted in the Wales No 10 failing a head injury assessment for the third time in less than five months. A long lay-off may follow in a position where Pivac is already without two players.Ireland are at Twickenham in the next round while Wales are at home to France. A grand slam is looking less likely in a tournament when the majority of teams are under new management.

It emerged on Wednesday that Archer had suffered a stress fracture of the right elbow, previously undiagnosed by scans, ruling him out for at least three months.A countback across all formats shows Archer bowled more overs than any other England player in 2019, despite the fact he did not make his debut until May. Archer also sent down the third most overs of any seam bowler in international cricket during that period even though he is still a novice at the top level.Speaking before England’s third and final one-day international in Johannesburg, Root maintained Archer was not overworked. This despite the bare facts of number of overs bowled, 274 of which took place on his watch as Test captain, including 42 in a single innings in Archer’s first overseas Test. Instead Root pointed towards the volume of county and franchise cricket Archer played before he burst on to the international scene as the key factor in his injury.“I wouldn’t say he’s been overbowled,” Root said. “You look at the amount of cricket he’s played before he played for England, he’s played a huge amount.“An important part of it now is the amount of cricket there is, it’s pretty full-on if you’re playing all three formats. Chuck an IPL in there as well and the Big Bash and stuff he’s played beforehand, that’s a lot of cricket.Root also echoed England one-day captain Eoin Morgan’s suggestion that time away from the international treadmill may have other benefits. “That’s a lot of mental fatigue as well as physical. I think it will be good for him to have a mental break, to get some time away from the game, to get refreshed.“We’ve just got to make sure now we build him up very well from the start of the summer and make sure when that first opportunity for him to play comes he’s absolutely ready to go and can then look forward and start to really manage him efficiently.”Root’s comments on the handling of Archer address the criticism levelled by some outside the England team. Quite how successfully they do this is open to question.The suggestion that any overwork of England’s quickest bowler comes from his pre-international days is not entirely supported by facts. Archer did play a lot as a year-round franchise favourite but he was largely bowling short T20 spells, or operating in the less intense arena of four-day county cricket.Root’s comments are open to question in other ways. If England believed Archer had carried an unhealthily heavy workload in the year before he made his debut, it seems strange they chose not just to match this but increase it – and to do so in the full glare of Test and ODI cricket. Quite how the mantra of “managing workloads” under central contracts stands up in this context is debatable.Root’s words also reflect relief in the England camp that doctors have been able to diagnose the exact nature of the injury. However, England’s coaches will not want to dwell on the eight-over, full-speed bowl-off with Mark Wood that preceded Archer’s omission in Port Elizabeth, something it is now clear he endured with a stress fracture of the elbow.At the time Archer was publicly urged to “bust a gut” in training, the implication being, presumably, that he was not already doing so.Focus will now shift to Johannesburg and the chance for the 50-over team to level the three-match series, rain permitting. There may be some changes to England’s team from Durban, if only to give a run out to those in the squad short of action before the T20 series.England are also expected to finalise their Test squad for the tour to Sri Lanka on Monday. Root confirmed that Jimmy Anderson’s inclusion is “a discussion point”, depending on fitness and workload in the months to come."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9fcd4e8d4789ce97003be6ce7e473f8efc6c9346/0_65_3346_2007/master/3346.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c01194afdda9db6a82809bda4f94376","title":"scotland england six nations match report","story":"There is breathless talk about expanding the Six Nations but some things never change. This was a Calcutta Cup encounter straight out of the old-school catalogue, settled by the only try of the game 10 minutes from the end by the visitors’ replacement prop Ellis Genge. The foul weather, in truth, was the real winner but the relief England will feel after their French disappointment will be substantial.Gone with the wind? Scotland will feel that way, the conditions having led to their captain Stuart Hogg making the crucial misjudgement under his own posts that gave England their match-winning platform.It was a day for close-quarters persistence, though, and Eddie Jones will be grateful to one player in particular. There is on ongoing debate about Tom Curry’s best position but on this occasion the number on his back did not matter on the grounds he was everywhere. Ably backed by Sam Underhill and Lewis Ludlam, the Sale back-rower was outstanding at the breakdown, giving the Scottish breakaway trio frequent spoonfuls of their own medicine, and did more than enough, on this occasion, to justify Jones’s faith in him at No 8.England also had to stand collectively strong at times to avoid another bleak away day. It was hard to remember Flower of Scotland being sung so passionately, its emotional resonance about the only thing not instantly being blown into the Firth of Forth. Even a North Sea trawlerman would have winced at the forecast and pondered the wisdom of leaving his fireside. Pending the day they build a roof over Murrayfield it is all part of the game in northern climes but by any standards this was a test of character and resilience.In this type of weather, nothing can be guaranteed and Owen Farrell, who missed three penalty attempts he would normally slot with his eyes closed, will be in no rush to re-watch those sections of the tape. The captain will, however, be pleased with the way his side found a way to avoid losing their opening two Six Nations games foir the first time since 2005.The conditions were seriously difficult from the outset. George Ford, another to find kicking a devilishly tricky business, tried an up and under that threatened to blow back over his head like a skied drive at North Berwick and even straightforward midfield passes were thrown with more than a touch of trepidation. The big stands kept out the worst of it but Farrell’s first angled kick at goal fell ominously short and wide and even his second attempt from bang in front of the posts needed his full attention.Whenever Scotland did start to exert some territorial pressure, however, it felt a different type of contest. England were indebted to both Maro Itoje and Curry for disrupting the home side just as they were starting to build some momentum and Scottish inaccuracy at lineout time provided some further relief.It was by no means the easiest game to referee, either. Pascal Gaüzère was brutally harsh on the poor lineout throwers and clearly felt the best chance of some half-decent rugby was to police the breakdown strictly but, elsewhere, chasing runners on both sides were given free rein to start from way in front of their kickers. As the game grew scrappier and scrappier and the rain began to intensify, the idea of playing in the Cape Town sunshine in February began to feel slightly less far-fetched.The Six Nations, though, is not about artifice or easy options. The greater the challenge the more it matters and, like The Open Championship, a little bit of wind and rain is a great leveller. Another Farrell penalty attempt, this time from the right-hand side of the posts, failed to find its intended target and a slightly hasty Ford drop-goal attempt towards the end of the half was never in danger of succeeding either.The importance of points, by whatever means available, grew ever more obvious. An excellent solo burst through the middle by prop Rory Sutherland put Scotland in excellent shape deep in the English 22 but when a penalty finally materialised there was no real question of kicking it to the corner. Adam Hastings popped over the close-range three-pointer and there was a rustle in the windswept press box to discover the last time there was a 3-3 draw between the sides in this fixture.It actually happened twice in the 1960s but in the modern game there is normally a twist somewhere. As the third quarter wore on, it seemed England might be the likelier side to crack. Their tactical kicking game suddenly fell apart, with Willi Heinz, Ford and Elliot Daly all guilty of putting the ball out on the full. Suddenly it felt like a game neither side was particularly keen to lose, particularly the men in white.But then came the decisive dagger. There was nothing majorly threatening about Ford’s little grubber straight down the middle but it refused to bounce up for Hogg who, for a second weekend in a row, found trouble suddenly lurking where none should have existed. After a nervy TMO deliberation the unfortunate full-back was ruled to have grounded the ball but also to have carried it over, giving England a five-metre scrum. It was the open invitation the visiting pack needed and the powerful Genge duly barrelled straight through the front door. Scotland have now gone six championship games without a win but English supporters, for the time being, can breathe again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3d5d5b75676ea52c66b5b14f188a19b87465352/423_112_3791_2274/master/3791.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d4984e17b781d80ffbaeeee3e2552d4","title":"gregor townsend scotland england","story":"It was 28C in Cape Town just as Stuart Hogg kicked off proceedings in Edinburgh with the rain all but horizontal. The possibility of South Africa joining the Six Nations is an idea that clearly polarises opinion but it can be said with certainty it presents an altogether different proposition to this.“Classic Scottish weather,” said Hogg on the eve of the match. “We’ll have a few tricks up our sleeve.” For the second week running, he and his coach, Gregor Townsend, will lament an inability to make one of them count.Perhaps that is a little unfair given the foul weather ensured chances were at a considerable premium but that only served to highlight their importance. England were able to take theirs in the second half, Scotland were not and again it is hard not to wonder whether Finn Russell might have been able to produce the necessary moment of magic.Add in the fact that once more Scotland’s lineout went to pieces and these are testing times for Townsend. Their scrum was worse and their handling nowhere near as accurate as England’s.On the whole it was one of Hogg’s better performances but again it was he who made a costly mistake. He was hoping the ball would bounce over his tryline but in doing so almost fluffed his lines completely to allow Owen Farrell a try. As it was, he was adjudged to have just about grounded the ball but soon after the resulting England scrum Ellis Genge was over for the decisive try.It was not as shocking as his failure to ground the ball against Ireland but the full-back was equally as hard on himself. “Devastating … I take it on my shoulders, take it on the chin,” he said. “I’m not going to shy away from it. I did make a mistake.”Townsend was far more philosophical over the incident, suggesting it was almost an excellent decision but for the bounce of the ball and chose to laud his captain’s performance.Two years ago Scotland bossed the battle of the breakdown and Eddie Jones responded by effectively picking three opensides. Tom Curry, Sam Underhill and Lewis Ludlam all made their presence felt in that regard – Jamie Ritchie, Hamish Watson and the returning Magnus Bradbury were far less conspicuous than Townsend will have wanted.That was about the sum total of conclusions to be drawn from a first half utterly devoid of any rhythm and the second was just as shapeless. Scotland kicked off with the wind at their backs and seemed a little too eager to make the most of it.Certainly the hosts were up for it. “Flower Of Scotland” before the Calcutta Cup at Murrayfield will always stir the senses and Sam Johnson was intent on backing his words that no one likes England, thumping into Jonny May following Hogg’s kick-off.If there were any subsequent pattern to the match it was that England were all too happy to kick the ball, often hanging it up in the air, while Scotland seemed a touch unsure whether to run it back or play to the conditions. That was a conflict they struggled to resolve all match.Ali Price was his usual busy self, always looking to snipe, to create half openings for his willing forwards or to chip over the top. He was busy at the start of the second half too, charged down by May but doing well to collect a swirling high kick from George Ford. From there, Adam Hastings launched his own kick into the skies and Ford could not gather. Scotland would have been happy enough with the scrum but Rory Sutherland had other ideas, bullocking up the middle of the pitch. It led to a Scotland penalty, another kick to the corner and 14 phases with the hosts battering away.Eventually it also led to a penalty from Hastings, bringing the scores level at 3-3 but on those 14 phases you could not help but feel the match had swung. Had the England dam burst it would have been hard to see a way back for Jones’s side.The conditions then made sure that after Genge’s try there was no way back for the home side. It may have been classic Scottish weather but for all their endeavour, you still sense they are a team more suited to the South African sun."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0edec939cd1ec3425c125c1e3fd0aea646c86753/0_114_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=764b3cc54318d7291ff7fd7f7707f883","title":"scotland v england six nations 2020 live","story":"Ellis Genge drove over for the only try of the game as England won in apocalyptic weather conditions at Murrayfield Ellis Genge scored the decisive try as England edged a tense encounter played in truly appalling conditions at Murrayfield.Eddie Jones speaks: “I think it gave us the confidence to play the way we knew we’d have to play,” he says of his decision to have six forwards on the bench. “It was a classic Calcutta Cup game, with a swirling wind and a crowd who didn’t have much manners. I thought you were supposed to respect the kicker.” He is clearly unimpressed with those in the crowd who booed Owen Farrell as he was lining up kicks at goal. Ellis Genge speaks: Asked to describe his match-winning try he says: “I don’t know, I can’t remember. It happened about 20 minutes ago.” He then goes on quite the rant about media critics writing the team and Eddie Jones off after England lost last week.Gregor Townsend speaks: “To show what we did for the first 15 or 20 minutes in the second half was excellent,” Scotland’s head coach tells the BBC. “There was just that moment when England got in our 22 and got over. You’re better not having the ball in those conditions and getting points is very difficult.” Scotland’s captain speaks: “We’re gutted with that,” says Stuart Hogg, looking on the verge of death from hypothermia. “The same as last week, I’m proud of the boys’ efforts but these things happen. We’ve done some good things in the past two games, but we’re here to win Test matches and so far we haven’t done that.” Owen Farrell lifts the Calcutta Cup: He and his team-mates look like they can’t wait to escape to the sanctuary of the showers, but he does his duty and then summons the rest of the troops to pose for photos in the middle of the almost empty stadium. Sam Underhill speaks: “It probably wasn’t the prettiest of things but it probably came down to game management and things went our way,” he tells the BBC, as the perspex advertising hoarding behind him wobbles worryingly in the wind. England secure the win! They keep their Six Nations hopes alive, while Scotland’s are all but over. It was an intriguing, error-strewn game played in awful conditions and could have gone either way, but England did just enough to secure the win. 80 min Scotland 6-13 England: We’re in the final minute and Scotland need a converted try to draw this game. England are in possession, however and Ellis Genge tries to bulldoze his way up the field. The clock is in the red zone ... 78 min: Adam Hastings slots over a penalty to give Scotland faint hope, while Brian Moore awards the Man of the Match gong to England’s No7 Sam Underhill. 77 min Scotland 3-13 England: Farrell, assisted by Genge again, makes no mistake. England lead by 10 points. 77 min Scotland 3-10 England: Blair Kinghorn drops a high ball and England win possession on the Scotland 22. Ben Youngs pops up a pass and Ben Earl, on off the bench, crashes into the tackle. England win a penalty straight in front of the posts on the Scotland 22. If this goes over, you’d think the jig is up for Scotland. 74 min Scotland 3-10 England: Scotland are in possession just inside their own half. Ali Price attempts a box-kick which is practically blown back into his arms. Another kick from Price sails out on the full. Scotland line-out on the halfway line. 73 min Scotland 3-10 England: Joe Launchbury comes on for England, replacing George Kruis. 70 min Relentless pressure from England after a solid scrum.Their forwards drive over and Ellis Genge looks to have grounded it one-handed, ably assisted by additional shoving from Tom Curry and Maro Itoje. It’s his second try for England and the extras are duly added. 68 min Scotland 3-3 England: Stuart Hogg tries to pick the ball up under his own posts but it’s like a bar of soap and slips out of his grasp. He drops on the ball with his midriff, before it squirms out from under him and Owen Farrell touches down. The TMO decides Hogg carried the ball over the line before grounding it and the referee awards a five-metre scrum to England. 67 min Scotland 3-3 England: In the BBC commentary box, Brian Moore doesn’t think much of Ellis Genge’s attempt to holkd the ball up on the tee for that most recent kick. The prop took his finger off the ball before Farrell kicked it, but Moore, who used to do the job in his day, says you need to keep your finger on it, but not with so much pressure that you affect the trajectory of the ball. 64 min Scotland 3-3 England: England win a penalty after Scotland are penalised for wheeling the scrum more than 90 degrees. Ordinarily, it would be a piece of cake for Owen Farrell, but this looks tricky in these horrible conditions. Ellis Genge is delegated to lie down on his stomach and hold the ball up on the tee with his finger, in the old school style. Farrell pulls the penalty wide and the scores remain level. 62 min Scotland 3-3 England: Youngs kicks the ball long towasrds the Scotland 22, where Sean Maitland gathers allow it to squirm out of his grasp in the tackle. England have possession in the Scotland 22. Scotland have replaced their props, with Allan Dell and Simon Berghan coming on. 61 min Scotland 3-3 England: Scotland lose their seventh line-out of the game and Ben Youngs, on for Willi Heinz presumably, kicks for touch. He gets a sarcastic round of applause from the crowd as the ball bounces on its way out. 59 min Scotland 3-3 England: Scotland winger Sean Maitland gets behind George Ford to field a high ball, but knocks it on. England scrum halfway between the Scotland 22 and the halfway line. Elliot Daly kicks for touch and the ball sails out on the full again. The conditions are terrible, but the English players don’t seem to be adapting particularly well. 58 min Scotland 3-3 England: England keep kicking the ball out for touch on the full from tight angles, the wind repeatedly getting the better of them. 57 min Scotland 3-3 England: Elliot Daly kicks for touch from inside his own 22 after England win a penalty. Ellis Genge comes off the bench and Mako Vunipola gets to put his feet up. 56 min Scotland 3-3 England: More changes for Scotland: Chris Harris replaces outside centre Huw Jones. Ben Toolis comes on for second-row Scott Cummings. 54 min Scotland 3-3 England: Brilliant play from Hogg, who takes the ball in hand, ducks and dodges his way past two England defenders, turns Jonathan Joseph inside-out and then sends a low grubber kick out over the line.Courtney Lawes is on for England, in place of Lewis Ludlam in the back row. Scotland reserve hooker Stuart Mcinally is on for Fraser Brown. 51 min Scotland 3-3 England: England clear their lines with a long kick and Scotland have a line-out. Fraser Brown’s throw-in looks as crooked as a ram’s horn, but referee Pascal Gauzere let’s it go. England hooker Jamie George has had a few questionable throw-ins go unpenalised too. 49 min Scotland 3-3 England: Confusion and slapstick reigns in the English ranks as they struggle to control and deal with a fly-kick in behind. Jonny May eventually hacks it out of play, as Scotland appear to have the upper hand for the first time in this match. 47 min Scotland 3-3 England: An England line-out on the halfway line. Willi Heinz kicks long, but his kick for touch goes out on the full . He raises a hand by way of apology to his team-mates. Scotland line-out just inside the England half. 46 min Scotland 3-3 England: Adam Hastings bisects the post with a decent kick from a fairly straightforward position, albeit in ludicrously difficult conditions. It’s all square at Murrayfield. 44 min Scotland 0-3 England: Hamish Watson tunnels his way through a thicket of legs to within five or six yards from the English line. Scotland win a penalty just to the right of the posts after Sam Underhill fails to release the ball. They’re going to go for the points. 43 min Scotland 0-3 England: Scotland have the ball under the English posts, about seven yards from the try line. They move through the phases in the face of defiant English tackling. 42 min Scotland 0-3 England: More pressure from Scotland as they try to crash through the English defence. England are punished, Kyle Sinckler the culprit for not rolling away from the tackle and Scotland have a penalty in the English 22. They ought to kick for the corner or ask for a scrum. The opt for the former option and win themselves a line-out. 41 min Scotland 0-3 England: Sutherland the loose head prop breaks through the English defence and charges into the England 22, getting Scotland’s fans on their feet. 41 min: After a first half in which the ball was kicked a total of 36 times – just under once a minute – play resumes. The wind is still blowing a gale and the rain is pelting down from the heavens. I remember, as a kid, playing rugby in those kind of conditions and it was a thoroughly miserable experience. England kick off with the wind at their back. Earlier this afternoon, Ireland beat Wales in Dublin, earning themselves a bonus point in the process. Paul Rees was there for the . England lead by the most slender of margins. In filthy, incredibly difficult conditions, England lead by Owen Farrell’s penalty after 10 minutes. “The playbook has been ripped up and it’s about thinking on your feet,” says BBC pundit Jeremy Guscott. “It’s not had structure, it’s not had shape,” says Martin Johnson, who is sitting alongside him. 40+1 min Scotland 0-3 England: England are penalised for an early push in the scrum and Scotland have a free-kick. In their subsequent surge up the field, Huw Jones is penalised for a knock on. 40 min Scotland 0-3 England: Scottish hooker Fraser Brown is penalised after his line-out throw-in fails to go five metres. Sloppy from Scotland - the wind isn’t that strong. 38 min Scotland 0-3 England: England line-out on the Scotland 22. There’s not a lot in this game, on the field or the scoreboard, but England’s superiority is quite apparent. George Ford tries with a fairly ambitious attempt at a drop goal, but sends his effort wide. It was worth having a go as he didn’t miss by much. 37 min Scotland 0-3 England: Scotland scrum, just outside their own 22. Hastings boots the ball long and Jonny May catches it comfortably. England are in possession on the halfway line. 35 min Scotland 0-3 England: Hogg tries and fails to find touch in the corner and Jonny May boots it back into the Scotland half. 34 min Scotland 0-3 England: The ball’s kicked high, but Stuart Hogg catches reasonably tidily under his own posts. He’s tackled, but feeds the ball to Adam Hastings, who finds touch with a long kick. 33 min Scotland 0-3 England: A handling error from Fraser Brown, who drops the ball, giving England a scrum. 31 min Scotland 0-3 England: Referee Pascal Gauzere gives both sets of forwards another lecture as he resets the scrum. Scotland win their own scrum and Ali Price sends Blair Kinghorn on his way again. 29 min Scotland 0-3 England: Adam Hastings catches an attempt to kick for the touchline from George Ford and finds touch on the halfway line. Jamie George is penalised for not throwing the ball in straight. “That’s my bad, lads,” he says by way of apology to his team-mates. The ball is soaking wet and the wind is high, which is making life difficult for the hookers at line-out time. 29 min Scotland 0-3 England: Not for the first time this evening, Scotland lose their own line-out, gifting possession to England. 27 min Scotland 0-3 England: The wind gets the better of Owen Farrell again. He pushes his penalty attempt wide of the far upright. 24 min Scotland 0-3 England: Elliot Daly gallops down the left flank with ball in hand, before being tackled by Ali Price. England subsequently win a penalty when Sam Underhill wins his side a penalty.24 min Scotland 0-3 England: A long, long kick from Ali Price almost sails over the head of Jonny May in his own 22, but the England winger leaps to catch athletically. 22 min Scotland 0-3 England: A high kick from Ford hangs in the wind, but Adam Hastings catches comfortably when it eventually deigns to drop from the sky. 21 min Scotland 0-3 England: Scotland win a penalty just inside their own half and Zander Ferguson drives forward. Moments later, Kinghorn makes about 20 metres with a powerful run, but England stop him in his tracks turn it over again.

Dirty Records (Andra Långgatan 4) boasts a carefully collated selection of LPs ranging from funk to 1960s psychedelia – take time to mull over your purchase in their inhouse cafe. A few minutes west is Gothenburg’s biggest secondhand music shop, Andra Långgatans Skivhandel (no 33), where it’s worth setting aside some time to dig through endless shelves of records. There are rarities to be found, and patience will be rewarded.When it comes to entertainment, this part of Gothenburg brims with choice, boasting two of the city’s most-esteemed cultural venues. Housed inside an old cinema, Pustervik (Järntorgsgatan 12-14) has been entertaining locals since the early 1900s and is the place to go for live music plus a range of club nights. Folkteatern, on nearby Olof Palmes Plats, hosts high-quality theatre, film screenings, and other spoken-word and music performances.For something less highbrow but still highly satisfying, wander up Järntorgsgatan to Zamenhof (Esperantoplatsen 5), a huge space open from breakfast until late where the jewel in the crown is a vintage games room. Relive your childhood on its arcade and pinball machines, tackle giant Jenga, or take on some locals at table tennis.Eat and drinkFor a reasonably priced meal in a striking venue, visit Kafé Magasinet (Tredje Långgatan 9) in the neighbourhood’s former auction house. Sourdough pizzas are the speciality and a cosy, plant-filled terrace with a glass roof means you can feel as though you’re outdoors without being at the mercy of Gothenburg’s changeable weather.Next door, Tacos \u0026amp Tequila (Tredje Långgatan 9) is a hugely popular lunch and dinner spot, known particularly for its blackened salmon ceviche. Queuing for a table may be necessary but the no-reservations policy is a blessing: Swedes book tables weeks in advance if they’re given the chance.The Gothenburg beer scene has exploded in the past decade, so find out what all the fuss is about by rounding off the day at Soho Beer House (Andra Långgatan 5). This cosy but lively bar has a vast selection from the city’s micro-breweries and knowledgeable staff will be happy to help you pick. Dugges, a brewery at the vanguard of Gothenburg’s craft beer surge, is a must for beer fans.Where to stayYou won’t find a hotel in Långgatorna and that’s good: it keeps the authentic, local feeling alive, but a 20-minute walk or 10-minute tram journey links the neighbourhood with Gothenburg city centre. There, Avalon Hotel (doubles from £86 B\u0026ampB) vaunts its feng shui certification, and has stylish rooms plus a rooftop pool with a great view. Lee RodenThis part of Brussels, on the public transport network but pretty much off the tourist trail, has as many elderly residents as young professionals looking for bars and boutiques. You’re as likely to find yourself talking to a new arrival from Africa, opening his dream restaurant, as to a septuagenarian Belgian bar owner. In recent years, the student population – the city’s main French and Flemish universities are here – has attracted emerging talent and new investment. Until the end of 2020, the red-brick former army barracks immediately north of the Etterbeek train, tram and bus stops is home to the See U project full of sustainable small businesses, including Brussels’ first pushchair-friendly cafe, a cinema, a velodrome and a weekly organic market.See and doThe area is a paradise for entrepreneurs. Wine, spirits and cigar shop Boire et Fumer (Drink and Smoke) has been at 38 Avenue de l’Université for 57 years. Since 2005, it has been run by local Philippe Degand. At 62 rue des Hellènes, surveyor Jean-Baptiste Jonné retrained as a chocolate maker to open his first shop, L’Alchimie du Chocolat, in 2001. Ariane Noël, the manager of independent clothing boutique Cheep (110 Avenue des Saisons), says her clients range from young students to women in their 90s. Another female entrepreneur, Rachida Bouganzir, oversees the Haricot Magique cafe at See U, with a large indoor and outdoor site for parents and small children. After shopping and coffee, head to the Cimitière d’Ixelles to admire art nouveau tombstones at a site calling itself the Père Lachaise of Ixelles.Eat and drinkPlace de la Petite Suisse is the place to go for quality Asian food, with Chinese, Vietnamese and Thai restaurants jostling for space. Bar Le Montmartre on the same square has been an institution for students, academics and couples looking for a quiet pastis or evening of live music since the 1960s, though beer fans also like Tavernier (445 Chaussée de Boondael). The pricey Caves d’Alex restaurant (14 rue Eugène Cattoir) moved last year from near the European Parliament to a spectacular former wine cellar. La Verveine (375 Avenue de la Couronne) serves French-Moroccan fusion food in a relaxed setting. Across the road at no 570 is Café Ricardo’s, serving excellent Portuguese food to a mostly Portuguese clientele.For sinfully good pastries, gluten-free bakery Chambelland opened its first branch outside Paris at 42 Avenue de l’Universite in 2018, while artisanal boulangerie La Fleur du Pain has just opened a new branch at 449 Chaussée de Boondael this year.Where to stayThe lack of tourists means there are no hotels in the quarter, but a short ride away on the number 8 tram is Avenue Louise and the Pantone Hotel (doubles from €59 room-only) where rooms are allocated based on the guest’s “mood and preferred colour”.Emily WaterfieldWhile the rest of Valencia was being treated to a Bilbaoesque makeover in the early 2000s, the rightwing city council of the time had it in for the fishing quarter of El Cabanyal, 5km east of the centre. It wanted to drive a swanky new avenue through the quaint streets, demolishing 1,600 houses, many of them decorated with original art nouveau tiles. It was classified a “listed area of cultural importance”, but the district was nonetheless threatened with compulsory purchase orders and destruction, until protests by local campaigners finally saw the scheme blocked by the courts. Over the past few years, El Cabanyal has been on the up, but this authentic slice of the city remains undiscovered by most tourists. While there’s a newly cosmopolitan vibe, the quarter’s traditional personality is being cherished by incomers, and the new shops and bars springing up everywhere tend to respect and adapt the vernacular architecture, rather than replace it. It’s a doddle to get here on the metro and, because it’s pancake-flat, it’s enjoyable to explore by bike. Hire one at Santamarcelita (Calle de la Reina 11) for €10 a day, or join a guided cycle tour with Poblados de la Mar (€25pp, in English on Mondays and Fridays at 10am), starting at bike shop Todobici on Calle Serrería.See and doFrom Las Arenas beach turn up Calle Mediterraneo, following the tram tracks – but keep an ear open as they move silently. Because of El Cabanyal’s grid layout, it’s difficult to get lost. The area is home to two excellent and under-visited museums: Museo Semana Santa Marinera (Calle del Rosari 1, closed Mon, free Sun), explains the rituals of Easter week and Museo del Arroz (Rosari 3, €2, closed Mon, free Sun), housed in an old rice mill, has the lowdown on the main ingredient of classic paella.Not all the tiled houses are in good repair – and all are private, so admire from the outside only. Examples to seek out are Calle Lluch 219 (the upper storey), Calle Progreso 262 and Calle Mediterraneo 37, which has a tiled mosaic showing oxen hauling a fishing boat out of the water at the top of its facade.El Drac del Cabanyal (Calle de la Reina 191B) sells traditional tiles and other handicrafts and, on the next street, Hilos, Cuerdas y Redes (Calle Lluch 159) is a traditional shop selling nautical rope and other boating accessories. Bookshop-cum-bar La Batisfera (Calle de la Reina 167) is a beautiful place to browse Spanish and English books, and the bar has good vegetarian options.Mercado del Cabanyal (every day except Sunday) is a mini-version of Valencia’s central market, selling local specialities such as horchata (a milk drink made from tiger nuts), while the Thursday Mercadillo street market on Calle Vilar sells mainly clothes and homewares.Eat and drinkThere are plenty of traditional spots in El Cabanyal: Casa Montaña (CJose Benillure 69) is a classic bar that has been going since 1836, where specialities include anchovies and mussels in various ways, but do try the baby broad beans sautéed with Iberian ham. The wine selection covers pretty much all of Spain. For authentic fishy cuisine (such as savoury cake made with squid ink and locally cultivated oysters) head to Taska Lareina (CReina 173) in a basement behind one of the Cabanyal’s best facades.For a straightforward, cheap meal try Bodega Bar Flor (CMarti Grajales 21) next to the market, which has been serving the locals since 1893 (rice dishes predominate: you can’t go wrong with paella but, for something different, try arròs amb fesol i naps – rice with white beans and turnip). Ca Tere (CReina 61), in another modernist building, also specialises in rice, but without so much choice.The best place for breakfast is Horno San Vicente (Progreso 148) which sells fresh ensaïmadas, soft coiled buns made with lard and dusted with sugar. The best horchata is from ice-cream specialist La Jijonenca (CPadre Luis Navarro 307, and Paseo Neptuno 26). For snacks, La Pascuala (CLluch 299) serves prodigiously large bocadillos.The hippest place for a drink is La Fabrica de Hielo, a huge bar in a former ice factory, one road back from the beach (CJose Ballaster Gonzalvo 37). It has a busy programme of live music and arts events and tapas supplied by a food caravan.Where to stayOn a palm-lined street in the middle of the district, Apartamentos Barracart (from €100 a night) has seven bright, large-windowed apartments. Hotel Neptuno (doubles from €75 B\u0026ampB) is a spacious option right on the beach. Further south, near the port, Balcon al Mar (doubles from €55 room-only) is a pleasant, inexpensive place, with bikes for guests to use. Nick Inman With city-centre rents skyrocketing, this once-bourgeois enclave is fast finding favour with a young, creative crowd. It is only a 20-minute walk from downtown and handy for primary exit route s: Porto’s main bus terminal and train station are on the doorstep and there’s a metro line to the airport.See and doThere are no malls in Bonfim, but plenty of cool independent stores, mostly on Rua de Santo Ildefonso. Keep an eye out for bookshop Inc. (no 25), a recent outpost of lifestyle outlet Patch (no 95), and the intimate emporium of cheeses and preserves that is Queijaria Amaral (no 190).Being home to Porto university’s fine arts faculty means Bonfim has always had an active arts scene. For contemporary art, the Senhora Presidenta (Joaquim António de Aguiar 65) and Lehmann + Silva (Duque da Terceira 179) galleries never disappoint. For fans of documentary photography, the recently launched Salut au Monde! (Santos Pousada, 620) is a must.For superb views over the Douro, stroll around the Parque de Nova Sintra (R. do Barão de Nova Sintra). Once private, this small leafy park is now owned by the water authority and has a wonderful collection of old fountains.Eat and drinkOne of the joys of Bonfim’s relative seclusion from Porto’s tourist boom is the plethora of old-school places to eat. For a classic neighbourhood dinner, try Madureira’s (Rodrigues de Freitas 1) for grilled tiger prawns or a francesinha (doorstep meaty sandwich). Local favourite Casa Aleixo (Estação 216) does a mean octopus with rice. Pulled-pork sandwiches at Casa Guedes (Praça dos Poveiros 130) are another local staple.Alongside these is a string of exceptional new eateries. Top of the list is Pedro Limão, on Bonfim’s western side, run by an architect-turned-chef serving fine dining at fair prices (10 courses €49) it recently added studio rooms upstairs. If meat-free is your bag, back towards the centre Árvore do Mundo (Duque de Loulé 228) and Manna (R. da Conceição 60) serve splendid veganveggie fare (Manna also does yoga classes).As for cafés and bars, there’s one on nearly every corner. Hip hangouts include speciality coffeehouse Combi (Morgado de Mateus 29) and brunch-lunch-coffee bar Bird of Passage (Duque de Loulé 185). For great cocktails (and pizza), head to TerraPlana (Av. Rodrigues de Freitas 287).Where to stayBonfim’s charm owes much to its elegant, early-20th-century townhouses. None is classier than myhomeinporto (from €200 for 2 nights), a boutique guesthouse run by former interior designer Juan de Mayoralgo. Similarly stylish is the 10-room, French-inspired Cocorico guesthouse (doubles from €90 room-only).Oliver BalchEven a decade or so ago, Neukölln, in south-east Berlin, was something of a backwater – a no-man’s-land beyond the trendy centre. Then the district’s cheap rents and gritty vibe were discovered by the international creatives and students, who moved in among the Turks, Kurds and Arabs to create today’s multikulti ambiance. Shack-like kebab shops and smart restaurants, shisha cafes and shabby-chic e bars, underground art galleries and commercial casinos sit side by side, and there is always something new to discover.Head to the main drag, Sonnennallee, for tasty, cheap Palestinian and Lebanese food stroll south-west to villagey Rixdorf, passing stone churches, cobbled streets and lovely Comenius botanical garden for late-night drinks, try hip Weserstrasse and for indulgent brunches and vintage browsing it’s hard to beat the area that overlaps with Kreuzberg (Kreuzkölln). The coolest area is probably dynamic, fast-changing Schillerkiez, next to Tempelhof park, site of the former city airport and Berlin airlift, which is now a vast recreation area where it’s possible to land-surf, cycle and rollerblade down the former runway.See and doGiven the creative influx and affordable rents, it’s no surprise to find a wealth of galleries and cultural spaces in the neighbourhood. These tend to be small and experimental like Loophole (Boddinstrasse 60), a club and music venue in a former brothel that also does site-specific works. The larger Kindl Centre for Contemporary Art (€5, under-18s free, Am Sudhaus 3) is in a former brewery and has installations and live performances.The district is well known for its vintage shopping and for stores that double as cafes. Sing Blackbird (Sanderstrasse 11) has shoes, jewellery and secondhand clothes, as well as juices, vegan pancakes and bagels. Rag and Bone Man (Briesestrasse 9) focuses on home decor and flowers, tipping into therapeutic services such as counselling. Shio (Weichselstrasse 59) works with local designers and stocks pretty and ethically minded papercraft, jewellery, clothes and home design objects. For food, the Turkish market by the Landwehr canal on Maybachufer has a great range of fresh produce and textiles every Tuesday and Friday.Eat and drinkFor something cheap, cheerful and filling, hole-in-the-wall Berlin Burger International (Pannierstrasse 5) has specialities such as the Godmother, with mozzarella and serrano ham, plus killer sweet potato wedges. Vietnamese joint Hamy (Hasenheide 10) also offers delicious daily lunch specials for just €5, while vegans will enjoy Two Planets (Hermannstrasse 230), whose offerings include a famous sourdough bread with avocado, delicious cakes and great salads. Swisher options include Lavanderia Vecchia (Flughafenstrasse 46), which serves rustic trattoria food in a former launderette, and chic new dessert restaurant Coda (Friedelstrasse 47), which has won a Michelin star for its innovative menu of savoury, as well as sweet, concoctions. The full set menu costs €138 a head but come after dinner and sit at the bar for a cocktail and à la carte option.For post-dinner drinks, there are a dozen great bars on Weserstrasse alone, from the grungy, arty Ä (no 40), with its flea market furnishings and foamy draft beers, to swankier cocktail bar TiER (no 42) just up the street. In summer, head to Klunkerkranich (Karl-Marx-Strasse 66), hidden away on the rooftop of a shopping mall, with a laid-back DIY aesthetic, decent DJs and views over the city. If you want to take things up a notch, Sameheads and Griessmühle will take you through to the next day, sometimes even longer.Where to stayThere aren’t many hotels here, but the Hüttenpalast (from €70 a night) is quintessential Berlin with its self-builtdecorated caravans and huts inside a former factory. Paul SullivanThe Powiśle district’s main boulevard on the left bank of the Vistula was once the preserve of dodgy bikers and lonely fishermen. Thanks to Poland’s economic boom it now resembles a carnival every summer, when the temperature usually tops 30C. Time to abandon preconceptions that Warsaw is grey and cold because in the best part of the year it really is green and hot. Pubs and riverboats offer craft beers and cocktails, with street food ranging from pierogi dumplings to pho soup (Warsaw has a big Vietnamese community). Powiśle was on the frontline in the Warsaw uprising against Nazi Germany and wears its shrapnel scars with pride. It’s fitting that the district is now all about people having cycling, roller-blading, volleyball, trampolining, picnics, people deckchairs, ice-cream, live music, dancing and playing in the sandfun. See and doIn the summer, the best way to approach Powiśle is by the free, seasonal tramwaje wodne (water trams) that ferry people to and from the wild beaches on the opposite bank of the river, or with a Veturilo city bike (March-November only) – your first 20 minutes is free. The major Powiśle landmark is Warsaw University Library (open to the public as well as students), which has an impressive facade of copper panels with texts in Hebrew, Arabic, Greek, Old Russian and Old Polish. Its roof garden has a spectacular view. The adjacent Copernicus Science Centre is ideal for children, who can spend hours at the interactive displays. For shopping, Femi Stories (Browarna 4) has women’s and girls’ clothing from independent makers. Poland is one of the biggest producers of furniture in the world, and while buying chairs is rarely an option for holidaymakers, Moma Studio (Wybrzeże Kościuszkowskie 45) also has unusual home- and kitchenwares. Down towards the Świętokrzyski bridge, Elektrownia (Zajęcza 2b), a former power station, is gradually filling with high-end shops and restaurants – worth a visit for the early 20th-century industrial architecture.Eat and drinkElektrownia’s fine-dining restaurant is Niewinni Czarodzieje 2.0, where options include beef carpaccio with truffles. Warsaw is one of the world’s top vegan-friendly cities, and Powiśle’s established contribution is Veg Deli (Radna 14), with pumpkin burgers and spinach and “feta” ravioli. Also worth exploring are the seasonal barges and street food stalls by the river, which change every year.Where to stayAt Powiśle’s southern edge, Inbed Hostel (dorm bed from £9, en suite double £26 B\u0026ampB) has bright, modern rooms close to the underground. By the riverside park is the mid-range Logos (doubles £45 room-only). A luxury option is Robert De Niro’s Nobu at the Rialto (prices tba), opening in the city centre this spring.Keith LockramNorth of central Prague, on the Vltava’s left bank beyond Letná park, Holešovice was for a long time seen as a bleak district with little to offer locals, let alone visitors. Its impressive resurgence over the past decade or so has been largely thanks to creative and commercial entrepreneurs taking advantage of low rents and empty spaces – apartment blocks, factories – to create a vibrant infrastructure of galleries, shops, cafes, clubs and bars. Although not as postcard-pretty as Stare Mesto (the old town) or Mala Strana over the river, Holešovice’s blend of industrial buildings, 19th- and early 20th-century tenements (with some lovely art nouveau blocks) and occasional communist behemoths makes for interesting meanders, and there are cultural treats aplenty too.See and doHolešovice is home to big hitters such as the sprawling, plane-train-and-automobile-filled National Technical Museum (Kostelní 42), and the Veletrzni Palace (Dukelských hrdinů 47), part of the city’s National Gallery, but there’s plenty of contemporary art on offer too. The Dox Centre for Contemporary Art (Poupětova 1) helped put the district on the map when it opened in 2008, and runs consistently great exhibitions inside a former factory complex. At the revitalised Prague Market (on Bubenské embankment), a former slaughterhouse now houses international theatre and circus space Jatka 78 and the Trafo Gallery. Other hotspots include the Chemistry Gallery near the Hlávkův bridge, cultural centre La Fabrika (32 Komunardů) for theatre and concerts, and the highly popular Bio Oko independent cinema on Františka Křížka street, which hosts events and festivals. For a splash of green, Letná park’s hilltop location offers fine views across the city as well as beer gardens and, a few minutes’ walk north, Stromovka, the former royal game reserve, is the city’s largest green space.Small but vibrant Veverkova street has become a mini-hub for shoppers, thanks to several retail hotspots in close proximity. Right by Bistro 8 (see below) is Garage Store (no 6), for sneakers and vinyl, and fashion store Jakoby (no 8), for unisex coats, dresses and jumpers, plus vintage outlet Recycle With Love. Right across the road (no 7) is the shop of designer Helena Darbujanova, who sells her own chairs, tables and lamps alongside work of other Czech designers, and Page Five (no 5) which stocks an international array of books, magazines, and posters, and also hosts launches and events. Another great event to look out for is the pop-up Mint Market, which brings together Czech interior, fashion and jewellery designers in Prague Market and other venues.Eat and drinkThe range of dining and drinking options here is healthy and growing all the time. There’s a choice of hip breakfast and brunch hangouts, from Cafe Letka (Letohradská 44) with its rough walls and handsomely large windows, to the spacious industrial chic of Vnitroblock (Tusarova 31), which doubles as a gallery and concept store. For tasty Czech pastries and cakes, head to the simple Erhart patisserie (Milady Horáková 56). The stylish Bistro Jankovcova (Jankovcova 14a) has sweet or savoury breakfasts, soups and salads, and Bistro 8 (Veverkova 14108) serves Sunday brunches, brisket burgers and pulled pork tacos. For dinner, check out swanky SaSaZu in Prague Market, which matches Asian fusion cuisine to regular DJ sets, or Bar Cobra (M Horáková 8), whose menu s mezze plates, wild boar with noodles, and a great selection of wines and cocktails. If you still have energy to hit the dancefloor, grungy Cross Club (Plynární 23) has live shows, DJ nights and themed parties pretty much every night, while the slicker Mecca (U Průhonu 3) is the spot for house music all night long.The Ostiense neighbourhood, right on the Tiber river, was once the site of a power station, a restless river port and a gasometer, whose skeleton still looms. It’s named after Via Ostiensis, an arterial road that ran in ancient times from the city’s cattle market to the port town of Ostia. Today, Ostiense has shaken off its industrial past to become a bastion of new restaurants, street art and bars. A scattering of campuses mean there’s a big student population, but there’s also an international crowd, drawn by reasonable rents and a metro link to the city centre. Come here to eat sumptuously and admire historic sites far from the masses.See and doOne of the city’s four major basilicas, St Paul’s Outside the Walls on Piazzale San Paolo 1 enjoys a quiet stream of visitors, a far cry from its more famous counterpart, St Peter’s. While it suffered a fire in the 19th century and underwent lengthy repairs, its ancient mosaics and 13th-century cloister were spared. The latter serves as a lovely spot to unwind after a day’s sightseeing. Further down Via Ostiense lies Centrale Montemartini, arguably Rome’s most underrated museum. Originally an electricity plant, the space was abandoned until 2005 when it was chosen to house artwork from the overcrowded Capitoline Museums. Seek out its delightfully jarring juxtaposition of delicate classical statues and defunct diesel engines and turbines. Head north towards Trastevere and the city centre (keeping an eye out for vibrant street art) and have a look round the Non-Catholic Cemetery, the final resting place of Romantic poets and former Rome residents John Keats and Percy Bysshe Shelley (Via Caio Cestio 12). The ancient pyramid of Caius Cestius, constructed in about 12BC, keeps a staid watch over the cemetery. Visitors are allowed inside the pyramid on a guided tour the third and fourth Saturday and Sunday of every month (entrance on Via Raffaele Persichetti).Shops aren’t Ostiense’s forte, but cheese, olive oil, pasta, wine and other edible souvenirs can be purchased from gastronomic megastore Eataly, on the south side of Ostiense train station. Beyond the basilica, zero-waste shop Negozio Leggero sells anything from beauty products to chocolate to spices, all packaging-free (Via Chiabrera 80).Food and drinkLocals and expats flock to restaurant and micro-bakery Marigold (Via Giovanni da Empoli 37), run by Sophie, who’s from Denmark, and her Calabrese partner Domenico, for its cosy atmosphere and homely dishes. Instead of the traditional Italian breakfast of caffè and cornetto (croissant), they serve dishes like eggs benedict, pancakes or fluffy cheese omelettes. At lunch and dinner there will be handmade pasta and plenty of vegetable-lush dishes too.Doted on by critics – it even made the Michelin Guide’s coveted Bib Gourmand list this year – Trattoria Pennestri (Via Giovanni da Empoli 5) flirts with both traditional Roman and gourmet cuisine. Tuck into a glossy plate of carbonara, or mains such as roasted octopus with peppers, mint and yogurt and suckling pig with porcini mushrooms and myrtle. There’s no chance you’ll wangle a table without booking.Staunch titans of cucina romana such as tripe, cacio e pepe, and salt cod anchor the kitchen of Osteria Fratelli Mori near the cemetery (Via dei Conciatori 10). It’s also one of the rare Rome restaurants that can easily accommodate a large group. Once the sun goes down, head to Caffè Letterario (Via Ostiense 95), a cafe, bookshop and cultural space that moonlights as a cocktail bar. In hot weather, sip a glass of red on the terrace at T-Bar (Via Ostiense 182) or in the Instagrammable courtyard of Porto Fluviale (Via del Porto Fluviale 22). For late-night munchies, chocolate-chip-studded sweet buns from Il Pangocciolaio (Via dei Magazzini Generali 15) hit the spot.Where to stayGasometer Urban Suites (studio with kitchenette from €86) is a former wool processing plant turned hotel with a gym and roof terrace.Alexandra BruzzeseIn between the touristy Skadarlija quarter, the huge Kalemegdan fortress and banks of the Danube, Dorćol has a comfortable air about it that doesn’t immediately scream cool. But it has always been the pace-setter for the city’s bars and restaurants. The tree-lined streets of its southern part – Gornji (Upper) Dorćol – have the usual Belgrade hotchpotch of early 20th-century villas and Tito-era flats, with the occasional art nouveau beauty. This is classic bar territory, with new openings and old favourites alike squeezed into streets such as Strahinjića Bana, Kneginje Ljubice and Kralja Petra.But head into Dornji (Lower) Dorćol towards the Danube and things get grittier, with funky little cafes, craft breweries, arts centres and street art taking over rundown industrial buildings. It’s not pretty, but it’s where things are moving along briskly.See and doDorćol Platz (Dobračina 59) in Dornji Dorćol is a collection of old industrial buildings that have been transformed into a nicely scruffy cultural centre with a cafe and garden. It hosts everything from gigs and vinyl markets to festivals, including the Mikser Festival of Design, held each May. From here it’s a few minutes’ walk to the Museum of Science and Technology (Skenderbegova 51), whose exhibits trace the story of technology in Serbia in an entertaining way. Fans of vintage gear should check out Jane Doe Vintage Shop (Kapetan Mišina 17) and its larger concept store and bar (Gospodar Jevremova 25). Dorćol isn’t particularly awash with green spaces, but it does have a lovely, wide cycle and footpath along the Danube, and past Novak Djokovic’s Novak Tennis Centre.Eat and drinkThe choice of bars and restaurants in Dorćol is quite dizzying. There are traditional and long-established favourites on leafy Strahinjića Bana but a short walk to the south, Blaznavac (Kneginje Ljubice 18) serves £4 cocktails and £1.50 pints of beer in a fantastically bonkers garden and equally eccentric interior. It’s just a few feet from Iris New Balkan Cuisine (Kneginje Ljubice 11), which does more elegant versions of hefty Serbian dishes, including pork neck (£7).The craze for craft beer hasn’t passed Belgrade by: there are several brewpubs around Dorćol. Gvint Brewery in Dorćol Platz is a genial place to try lagers and ales for about £1.50 a pint. At Beogradski Market (Žorža Klemansoa 19), craft breweries such as Dogma and Tron share the vast hangar-like space with food stalls selling anything from tapas to sushi.In the midst of Dornji Dorćol’s street art and ramshackle former workshops, fine-dining restaurant Homa (Senjanina Ive) stands out with its gleaming white minimalism. Plates of poached trout with trout roe (£14) and steak tartare with bone marrow (£12) are pricey by local standards, but worth it.Where to stayFifties decor meets industrial chic in Smokvica B\u0026ampB (doubles from €65), with six airy rooms in a 1929 villa in Upper Dorćol. Its lively bar and restaurant spills into a courtyard garden. Mary NovakovichThe 20th arrondissement, in eastern Paris, is well-known for the place where Oscar Wilde and Edith Piaf are buried, but a short walk away, hidden from the crowds, is a genuine village, Charonne, little known to tourists. Circular Place de la Réunion, laid out in 1850, is the heart of this friendly, bohemian quartier populaire, a multicultural area of working families, artists and musicians. The square comes alive on Thursday and Sunday mornings, when it teems with people browsing market stalls set up by butchers, cheese- and fishmongers, and fruit and vegetable sellers.But there is another hub here that is open every day, from 7am to 2am. Café Sans Nom, on the corner of rue de la Réunion, does not need a name (or a website) as it is more a community centre for everyone living in or passing by the square, from school-run mums or pensioners sipping a coffee while reading newspapers and books from the cafe’s free library, to the crowd who arrive for drinks after midnight.See and doYou won’t find chic boutiques in this neighbourhood, but rather quirky, ethical shops such as L’Escargot d’Or (53 rue de Bagnolet) where Gilles Coolen roasts fairtrade coffee beans and makes delicious artisan chocolate. On the other side of the street (no 52), Agnès Baracco stocks Au Bon Vingt, her pioneering natural wine cellar, with over 400 varieties, which she loves explaining to visitors. At no 69, La Botica (no 69) is a new shop and gallery showcasing young artists, designers and stylists, with changing themes that cover photography and illustration, jewellery and vintage clothes, prints and ceramics.Eat and drinkEveryone’s favourite Sunday begins at 6pm in the funky Quartier Rouge bistro (52 rue de Bagnolet), which hosts a weekly three-hour jazz jam session. Entry is free and a glass of wine is €3.50, but be sure to contribute when the musicians’ hat is passed round. It also serves tasty no-frills French cuisine, but for a bit more choice, take a five-minute walk to romantic rue des Vignoles, which is lined with laid-back bars and restaurants. La Petite Fabrique (no 15) is a spacious bio-canteen offering a perfect combination of organic cuisine (maybe vegetarian paella, juicy beef tournedos or a vegan sweet potato gratin with seitan sausages) and natural wines, served at long communal tables.Almost next door, Les Mondes Bohèmes (no 31) is a popular hangout whose verdant covered terrace resembles a greenhouse it’s great for salads, burgers and ice-cream.Wander down some of the narrow plant-lined alleyways (impasses) off rue des Vignoles – perhaps the evocative Impasse Satan or bucolic Impasse Poule – and imagine the time when this was all vineyards, la campagne à Paris. For a last drink, finish up at the arty Moki Bar (no 61), enjoying its kitsch 1970s decor and pinball machines, exhibitions, funky music and great mojitos.Where to stayRecently renovated Hôtel Terre Neuve (doubles from €99 room-only) is five minutes’ walk from Place de la Réunion, but the fashion-minded may prefer the Philip Starck-designed Mama Shelter (doubles from €139 room only), the first of this now-global hip hotel chain.John BruntonLooking for a holiday with a difference?

But now I’m no longer a citizen …London in the 1950s and 60s was an ebullient, technicolour time. But it was also an era during which most of monochrome Britain regarded “the Continent” as a place of “rabies and intellectuals” – as New York Times journalist Roger Cohen, raised in north London, put it in a book about his mother.I didn’t care about rabies, and wanted to meet and emulate the intellectuals. When I was in my mid-teens, fuelled by the uprisings of 1968 in Paris and Prague, the world – my life – began when the ferry pulled out of Dover. Clutching my blue SNCF rail ticket, watching the cliffs recede with a sense of liberation, across the choppy Channel to dock in Calais, transferring to the Paris train, traversing the capital to Gare de Lyon and boarding an overnight iron horse to points south. Destinations: Provence, or Italy, or Austria, or the then-turbulent Basque Country and Spain.I was in a dotty band then, and wrote a silly rocker entitled Down to ’Spaña which opened: “Were you ever on that night trainLeaving Paris in the pouring rain?To greet the light of Dordogne dawn-breakC’mon move now, huhDown to ’Spaña.”I relished those journeys, staring out at sulphur-yellow lamps illuminating stations and goods yards. As a (much better) John Cale song puts it: “Looking out from hereAt half past France.” You’d hand your passport to Italian customs at Chiasso on the Swiss border – this no longer happens, of course – then head across the Po valley, through cypress-strewn hills in Tuscany and Lazio and on to Rome, exhausted, happy, blinded by the light.Come the 1970s, most of my generation saw Europe on an Interrail pass, which afforded unlimited travel for a month. But I travelled à la carte, loth to hurry around. I didn’t want to leave a place until I’d come to know it a bit, established myself with the clientele of a bar on some cobbled square, fully explored the museums and backstreets, perhaps even caught a football match.Apart from one summer in Chicago, this was how I spent every Easter and summer holiday, and every penny earned – to change into lire, francs, schillings or pesetas. Then came the moment to cast my first vote in 1975: over whether Britain should remain a member of the then European Economic Community. I had finally come “home” – and a decade or so later, I would have the words “European Community” on my passport.I had worked hard on French at school, and took Italian lessons in the evenings, aware that I needed a toolkit of vocabulary and grammar. It’s one thing to take a taxi from Seville’s Santa Justa station and rely on the driver’s pidgin English it’s quite another – and works out cheaper – to ask whether he is a palangana (supporter of Sevilla FC) or a bético (fan of rivals Real Betis, after the Roman name for the city’s Guadalquivir river) and why.I wore Kickers shoes, even though I disliked them, because they were originally made in France and looked ‘“continental”. In the mid-70s I bought my first car – a Citröen 2CV – in Brussels, so that the steering wheel would be on the “wrong” side in Britain. Two Renault 5s followed in the same vein – it was 20 years before I bought a car with a steering wheel on the British “right” side (a sturdy Volvo, still on the road, from the then editor of this newspaper).I didn’t want to be a tourist I wanted to be a European. A true “cosmopolitan”, as envisaged by Diogenes, who coined the term. For me, to be European is existential. It’s about who and what we are. It defines a way of being, sans frontières, a state of curiosity about the way other people live and a burning need to partake in it, speak their tongues and understand not just their cultures but their quotidian modus vivendi: beliefs, music, football, food, firewater and wine.Of course, I arrived in the Americas and elsewhere, but that belonging was never on offer. Being European was, and I duly took my citizenship not from Britannia, but from the Phoenician princess, mother of King Minos of Crete – Europa – and the words “European Union” on my passport.I’ve travelled the far corners of Europe, and occasionally lived between them: from County Mayo’s wild seaboard, to fishing villages along the Black Sea shore and Danube delta, and the rocks of Ikaria island in the south-east (though I don’t claim to speak Romanian or Greek). From midnight sun and midday darkness in the Nordic north to the passeggiata beneath Mount Etna in Catania, Sicily, and the docks of Tarifa in Andalucia, from which a good outfielder could attempt a throw into Africa.We had wonderful but purposeful, busy and focused family holidays across Italy and France, scouring minor museums in small towns. In between were picnics with wine – my mother sketching people in cafes, my father etching church architecture. I got my first-ever job at the Vienna Staatsoper in January 1973 and enrolled at the University of Florence later that year. When friends hit the hippie trail east, I stayed in Italy, preferring to investigate Bologna and Milan. Except for exploring the Americas, I returned scores of times, mainly to Italy, France and Belgium and the Netherlands. I had a Swedish life for a while, for failed romantic reasons.I travelled not to “holiday”, but to conjoin European life I read newspapers, not guide books. I wanted no part in the fantasies of Brits in Tuscany or Provence I travelled for work, for pleasure, for language, art and football, for the musky scent of old stone, light and landscape, love and love’s wreckage – out of deferential but insatiable curiosity, to listen and learn. If a holiday, or money, ran out halfway along a valley, I’d endeavour to return to the same place, and carry on up or downriver.In 1990, my dream came true, and I was posted to Rome by this newspaper. I didn’t deliberately shun expats and the international press I just preferred to hang out with Italian colleagues, friends, rogues and neighbours, watching AS Roma, Juventus and SSC Napoli, where I had a season ticket.By then something remarkable had happened to Europe. Back in 1981, my work had taken me to Poland, and early cracks in the communist edifice, following the 1980 strike at the Gdansk shipyard. Then, in 1989, I had found myself reporting from Berlin and Bucharest as Stalin’s walls crumbled.The dream that Europe’s reunification could be peaceful twisted into nightmare across former Yugoslavia, but there was this: how would one have replied to a whisper on the wind through the Croatian town of Vukovar, as I reported it being levelled into the dust of its own stone by Serbian artillery in 1991, predicting that within 30 years, this place would be in the EU, and London out?On Mayday 2004, I was in Warsaw with friends from Gdansk days celebrating Poland’s accession to the EU – an affirmation as important to them as being part of the union was to me. Later that night, I was with a “Polish noise” band shattering rusty ironwork in a disused factory – and so began a relationship with that country too.The closest rapport, though, is genetic, and part of my life since I wrote a university thesis on the Irish Troubles in 1974, more interested in Belfast and Derry than any dreaming spires of Oxford. My bond to Ireland was bequeathed by two Irish grandmothers. Ireland is now Europe’s most interestingly changed country – in large part because of the EU – and one of its youngest, demographically. For decades, people like the great writer Edna O’Brien left what they saw as the myopic and inward-looking green-letterbox island off the coast of Britain for the breezy cosmopolitanism of red-letterbox-land. Now the roles are reversed – inward-looking England and Wales off the coast of international Ireland.Where did all this lead “my” Europe? The continent became an entity and identity, not necessarily in people’s self-perception, but in living-breathing reality. Some 400 million people cross 26 countries without having to show their passport, under the Schengen treaty. There are now 2 million “Erasmus babies” born to students from all over Europe, under the inspired 1987 scheme whereby any student in the EU can study and settle in any of 28 countries – now 27. How marvellous is that?Millions of people whizz, work and abide across a continent not without its problems, but without internal seams. And remember: they are the grand- and great-grand children of those who endured slaughter in the first world war. Children and grandchildren of a Europe ravaged by Holocaust and the second world war. Children of the cold war and Berlin Wall. Have the Italians, Dutch, French, Romanians, Latvians and Portuguese lost their identity to this process? No, they’re just part of it. Nor did the British, and we were part of that too but now we’re not. I was all my adult life, and now I’m not. In 2008, I submitted an article to the Observer on the slipstream of England’s failure to qualify for the 2008 Euros (played in Austria and Switzerland), arguing that this was a metaphor for what Europe would look like without Britain – calmer actually, without England’s awful fans.Fair Europa, fare thee well – and thou shalt, without us. I’ll still savour your ways, your beauty and your tribulations – but as a visitor, not a citizen.Looking for a holiday with a difference?

Who’s going to pay for it?” former vice-president Joe Biden asked Sanders while contrasting his own healthcare plan with the Vermont senators’.The Friday night debate was a key test for Biden, who has long been regarded as the undeniable frontrunner in the Democratic primary race. But he appeared to have placed fourth in the Iowa contest, far behind Sanders, Buttigieg and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren.Opening the debate, Biden acknowledged he “took a hit” in Iowa, and he predicted that he would “probably take a hit” in New Hampshire too, casting himself as an underdog in the Granite state considering Sanders’ strong finish there in 2016.But Biden warned that Sanders represented a risk because of his self-description as a “Democratic socialist,” and that Buttigieg has not proved he has the experience to be president.Biden’s longterm prospects appear to increasingly depend on how he performs in the South Carolina primary on 29 February, where he polls very favorably among the state’s large Democratic African American population.The debate discussion moved to race and South Carolina, as billionaire activist Tom Steyer went on the offensive against Biden by highlighting controversial comments from one of his surrogates in an apparent bid to challenge him for that support. Buttigieg, who has struggled to appeal to non-white voters, repeatedly deflected a question about the rate of arrests of African Americans increasing while he was mayor of South Bend, Indiana. Moderator Linsey Davis asked Warren if Buttigieg’s answer was sufficient. “No,” Warren replied, in one of very few standout moments of the night, prompting applause. “We cannot just say that criminal justice is the only time we want to talk about race,” she added.Ahead of the New Hampshire primary vote, there is still no clear frontrunner in the race to become the Democratic presidential nominee who will take on Donald Trump in November’s election, though recent polling has shown both Sanders and Buttigieg leading.Seven of the 11 remaining leading candidates took to the stage on Friday night Sanders, Buttigieg, Warren and Biden, as well as the Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar, Steyer and the entrepreneur Andrew Yang.Klobuchar, a moderate who has been trailing the others but enjoyed several strong moments on the debate stage on Friday, presented herself as the person to challenge Trump and work across the aisle, warning that Sanders’ healthcare proposal isn’t supported by “two-thirds of the Democrats in the Senate” and that it would “kick 149 million Americans off their current health insurance in four years”.When the debate veered toward a discussion on experience, 38-year-old Buttigieg – a former mayor and veteran of the war in Afghanistan – contrasted himself with Biden, Klobuchar and Sanders, saying he represented experience outside of Washington. But Klobuchar, 59, shot back that “we have a newcomer in the White House, look where it got us”.She also called out Buttigieg for saying he had found watching the impeachment trial “exhausting” (as senators, Klobuchar, Warren, Sanders, and longshot candidate Michael Bennet had all been in Washington to attend instead of campaigning in Iowa).At another point during the debate, Buttigieg took a veiled swipe at Biden and his “politics of the past”.Biden responded by touting his work in the Obama administration: “I don’t know what about the past of Barack Obama and Joe Biden was so bad.”Meanwhile, Warren struggled to cut through, speaking far less than in previous debates. Speaking afterwards, she told MSNBC: “I just didn’t say enough, didn’t fight hard enough, didn’t tell you how bad I want this and how good we can make it if we just come together.”It’s unclear how much impact a messy debate on a Friday will have among New Hampshire voters.“There are a lot of New Hampshire voters who are still undecided so the debate gives voters an opportunity for a check on some – not all – of the candidates and an opportunity to help make up their mind,” said the former New Hampshire Democratic party chair Kathy Sullivan. But Sullivan also warned that this close to an election, a mistake during the debate “could be a problem”.Ahead of the debate Sanders strongly signalled that he planned to direct his attacks at Buttigieg. Earlier in the day the Sanders campaign sent out a fundraising email titled “Billionaires ❤️ Pete Buttigieg.”After the New Hampshire primary, the next televised debate will be held in Las Vegas on 19 February, a few days ahead of the Nevada caucuses."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07bd9cfed4c06316e79dfc27fd11b703cc6c634b/0_167_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=766a597ba78f1c20b7eac06ab8ee4c78","title":"grassroots activism tell us about a local campaign that worked","story":"Share your experience of being involved in a successful grassroots community movement Are you involved in a grassroots community project.

One of those in the video, Adrielly Eger, 18, a model, told the Band news network she was “very grateful”.The 34 Brazilians, a mixed group of students, professionals, couples and children, should arrive at Anápolis airbase, 150km from the capital Brasília at 1am local time in an operation labelled Return to Homeland Brazil .They will be isolated in transit hotels on the airbase, which according to local media will have access to video games, internet and the opportunity to watch military bands play live outside.Roberto Naves, the mayor of Anápolis, which is in the mid-western state of Goiás, told local radio that residents of the city of 362,000 had first been apprehensive about hosting the evacuees but had no reason to worry.But in a note, Sandro Mabel, the president of Goiás industry federation, called the quarantine a “disaster for the state”, arguing that they should be hosted somewhere else.“We could suffer segregation of what is produced in Goiás, affecting the export of processed products and meat, for example,” he wrote.Ronaldo Caiado, Goiás’ conservative governor and a staunch Bolsonaro ally, told reporters that Mabel’s comments were “inhumane” and called him a “scoundrel”.Also travelling on the two planes from Wuhan were four Poles and a Chinese national, who disembarked during refuelling in Warsaw, Poland.It is a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city.New and troubling viruses usually originate in animal hosts. Ebola and flu are other examples – severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers) are both caused by coronaviruses that came from animals.\u0026nbspThe virus causes\u0026nbsppneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. If people are admitted to hospital, they may get support for their lungs and other organs as well as fluids. Recovery will depend on the strength of their immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.Two members of one family have been confirmed to have the virus in the UK, and a third person was diagnosed with it in Brighton, after more than 400 were tested and found negative. The Foreign Office has urged UK citizens to leave China if they can. Five new cases in France are British nationals, and British nationals are also among the 64 cases on a cruise liner off Japan.The number of people to have contracted the virus could be far higher, as people with mild symptoms may not have been detected. Modelling by\u0026nbspWorld Health Organization\u0026nbsp(WHO) experts at Imperial College London suggests there could be as many as 100,000 cases, with uncertainty putting the margins between 30,000 and 200,000.Unless you have recently travelled to China or been in contact with someone infected with the virus, then you should treat any cough or cold symptoms as normal. The\u0026nbspNHS advises\u0026nbspthat people should call 111 instead of visiting the GP’s surgery as there is a risk they may infect others.Health experts are starting to say it could become a pandemic, but right now it falls short of what the WHO would consider to be one. A pandemic, in WHO terms, is “the worldwide spread of a disease”. Coronavirus cases have been confirmed in about 25 countries outside China, but by no means in all 195 on the WHO’s list.There is no need to panic. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. The WHO has declared the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern, and says there is a “window of opportunity” to halt the spread of the disease. The key issues are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact.The Folha de S.Paulo newspaper reported that Brazil had refused to evacuate citizens from neighbouring South American nations including Argentina, Bolivia and Colombia.In the article, one Argentinian diplomat speculated the preference for the Poles was “ideological”, with Bolsonaro favouring Poland’s Christian nationalist government.Brazil’s foreign office – led by minister Ernesto Araújo, who believes climate change is a Marxist plot – refuted the claims saying there was not sufficient space and that Poland offered authorisation to refuel first.Brazil declared the coronavirus a public health emergency earlier this week. According to the health ministry, there are eight possible coronavirus cases being monitored, while 24 cases have been dismissed.The ministry has also been issuing regular online warnings about “fake news” relating to the virus, with one of the latest being that it is “similar to HIV” and “was created in a lab”.Meanwhile, a woman in Rio de Janeiro was arrested for faking coronavirus symptoms and saying she had recently returned from Hong Kong in an attempt to jump the queue at a local health clinic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a81cf9aff474df6950382bee221b304e2083da0a/0_153_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2e73f9b3443e567f046978399137669e","title":"coronavirus five new cases in france are british nationals","story":"Child is one of five Britons who tested positive for virus, among group who came into contact with man who had been in SingaporeA nine-year-old British child diagnosed with coronavirus is in hospital in France.The child is one of five Britons who tested positive for the virus. Another six UK nationals are being kept under observation in French hospitals.The group had been staying in two apartments in a ski chalet in the Haute-Savoie region in the eastern French Alps when they were visited by a Briton who had been in Singapore and was found to have the virus when he returned to the UK at the end of last month.The French health minister Agnès Buzyn said none of the patients were in a serious condition. She described the new outbreak as a “cluster, grouping around one original case”.Jean-Yves Grall, the head of the regional health authority, told journalists the child lived in the ski resort with their parents and two siblings. The child’s mother was in the UK taking exams and the children were with their father. The six other Britons were in a second apartment in the same chalet. He did not give details of where the visitor believed to have brought the virus from Singapore had stayed.The local health authority is disinfecting the building and is searching for anyone who might have come into contact with the group.Grall said the infected child had attended school in Les Contamines-Montjoie and had recently spent a day at a second school in the nearby town of Saint-Gervais-les-Bains.He said the schools would be shut next week as the authorities tried to determine with whom the child had come into contact.Édouard Philippe, the French prime minister, called a meeting of health ministers on Saturday and the ministry has opened a UK hotline (0800 100 379) in an attempt to find out who else may have been in contact with the Britons.Buzyn said: “We’re starting an important operation to identify cases of those in contact.“That original case was brought to our attention last night. It is a British national who had returned from Singapore where he had stayed between 20 and 23 January, and he arrived in France on 24 January for four days.”As well as the five who tested positive for the virus, the others were being kept under surveillance in hospitals in Lyon, Saint Etienne and Grenoble.The Briton at the origin of the cluster returned to the UK on 28 January, a French health official said.Grenoble hospital said it was not authorised to give any more information.The local newspaper Le Dauphiné, reported that Marie-Charlotte Pasquier of the Les Contamines-Montjoie tourist office had spent the morning reassuring tourists in the resort. There has been no public announcement but the town hall has been distributing leaflets with advice on how to avoid transmitting coronavirus. Local doctors have sent a consignment of disinfectant and face masks to the town hall.Pasquier said: “We are in permanent contact with the local health authorities and have put in place a number where people can contact and ask questions and a doctor will reply. We are there to inform and reassure people.”The latest outbreak brings the total number of people infected with the virus in France to 11. Health officials said some of the original six cases, who are being treated in hospital in Paris and Bordeaux, were ready to be released.It is a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city.New and troubling viruses usually originate in animal hosts. Ebola and flu are other examples – severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers) are both caused by coronaviruses that came from animals.\u0026nbspThe virus causes\u0026nbsppneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. If people are admitted to hospital, they may get support for their lungs and other organs as well as fluids. Recovery will depend on the strength of their immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.Two members of one family have been confirmed to have the virus in the UK, and a third person was diagnosed with it in Brighton, after more than 400 were tested and found negative. The Foreign Office has urged UK citizens to leave China if they can. Five new cases in France are British nationals, and British nationals are also among the 64 cases on a cruise liner off Japan.The number of people to have contracted the virus could be far higher, as people with mild symptoms may not have been detected. Modelling by\u0026nbspWorld Health Organization\u0026nbsp(WHO) experts at Imperial College London suggests there could be as many as 100,000 cases, with uncertainty putting the margins between 30,000 and 200,000.Unless you have recently travelled to China or been in contact with someone infected with the virus, then you should treat any cough or cold symptoms as normal. The\u0026nbspNHS advises\u0026nbspthat people should call 111 instead of visiting the GP’s surgery as there is a risk they may infect others.Health experts are starting to say it could become a pandemic, but right now it falls short of what the WHO would consider to be one. A pandemic, in WHO terms, is “the worldwide spread of a disease”. Coronavirus cases have been confirmed in about 25 countries outside China, but by no means in all 195 on the WHO’s list.There is no need to panic. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. The WHO has declared the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern, and says there is a “window of opportunity” to halt the spread of the disease. The key issues are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact.This Saturday is one of the busiest days of the year for French ski resorts because it is the start of school holidays in the Paris region. The February holidays in France begin on three consecutive Saturdays and are staggered over five weeks.At a newsagents shop in Les Contamines-Montjoie one resident said local people were worried.“It’s not just the news but the disinformation that’s worrying,” she said.Other shops and hotels referred callers to the local town hall.Les Contamines-Montjoie, 75 minutes from Geneva and sitting between Chamonix and Megève, has a population of about 1,160 people, which increases during the tourist season in winter. It is close to Mont Blanc and popular with mountaineers and skiiers. The word contamines does not mean “contaminated” as some supposed on social media but “ploughable land on the squire’s estate”.Meanwhile, a student in Brighton has been told to self-isolate after a confirmed case of coronavirus, according to Sky News. The middle-aged man was the first British national to contract the virus after he travelled to the UK from Singapore.In a message sent to parents on Friday, Portslade Aldridge community academy (Paca) said: “Today we have been contacted by a parent of a student at Paca who was contacted by Public Health England as part of their investigation concerning the confirmed case that was reported in the press yesterday.“We have been informed by the parent that they have been advised by Public Health England to self-isolate their child at home for 14 days. If at any point the child is found to be symptomatic we will be notified.” Four members of a British family living in Mallorca are being tested for coronavirus after coming into contact with a person who recently tested positive for the virus in France.The Balearic Islands health department said the father of the family had gone to Mallorca’s Son Espases hospital after feeling ill and was placed in isolation. His partner and their two daughters were being evaluated in the same hospital.The health department said it had activated its coronavirus protocol. “In accordance with professional guidelines, the man remains in isolation and all members of the family have been tested and the tests sent to a laboratory. All remain at the hospital,” it said.The department urged people to remain calm while the tests were carried out and said it was working closely with Spain’s health ministry.Spain confirmed its first case of the coronavirus on 31 January after a man was diagnosed on the remote La Gomera island in the Canaries.The patient is part of a group of five people in isolation and under observation on the island after it emerged they had come into contact with a German man diagnosed with the virus. US officials have announced that a 60-year-old citizen had become the first foreign victim of the coronavirus in China. A Japanese man also died in Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak, having had symptoms consistent with the disease.A US embassy spokesman in Beijing told Reuters: “We offer our sincerest condolences to the family on their loss. Out of respect for the family’s privacy, we have no further comment.” A British man with the virus is said to be feeling well and in good spirits after being transferred from the cruise ship Diamond Princess to hospital in Japan.Alan Steele, of Wolverhampton, who was on honeymoon on the ship, was moved to hospital on Friday while his wife, Wendy Marshall Steele, remained onboard. She had been in telephone contact with her husband and said on Saturday that he was still feeling healthy.“Alan is well, Japanese doctors are excellent,” she posted on Facebook. “He is in a little room. Just doctor and nurse visit him.” She said she was also doing well but had “cabin fever” as she continued to be confined to her room on the ship.There are nearly 3,700 other passengers and crew being quarantined on the ship. They have been offered access to mental health counselling and enhanced internet access.In a video posted on Twitter, Rai Caluori, the executive vice-president at Princess Cruises, said: “We recognise that a situation like this can create unprecedented stress, so we’re also offering our guests and crew specialised telephonic mental health counselling if they should be experiencing such stress and mental health issues.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70f7e3aca1338c5b3b687e41f231a32b1e65bc5a/0_252_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7cb343376dcb968df63a65c401f6f4be","title":"syrian forces capture new areas from insurgents","story":"Turkey sends in more troops to back rebels as weeks-long offensive displaces 600,000Syrian government forces have captured new areas from insurgents in their offensive in the north-west, as Turkey sends more reinforcements into the country, state media and opposition activists said.The weeks-long government offensive has created a humanitarian crisis with about 600,000 people having fled their homes in Syria’s last rebel stronghold since the beginning of December, according to the United Nations.Rebels control much of Idlib province and parts of the neighbouring Aleppo region that is home to 3 million people, many of them displaced from other parts of Syria.The offensive appears aimed at securing a strategic highway in rebel-controlled territory, as opposed to an all-out campaign to retake the entire province, including the densely populated provincial capital, Idlib.“Our aim is to clear the highway and evict terrorists from it,” a Syrian commander on the ground told state TV. He was referring to the M5 highway, which links the state capital, Damascus, with the northern city of Aleppo.The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition war monitor, said government forces still had 18 miles (30km) of the highway to clear before it came under full control of the army for the first time since 2012.Syrian state TV reported on Saturday that government forces captured four villages in Aleppo province near the highway. It added that Syrian troops and demining experts had cleared explosives from the recently captured town of Saraqeb which sits on an intersection of the M5 and M4 highways, linking Syria’s coast with the country’s east.Turkey, a main backer of the opposition, sent more reinforcements into Idlib overnight, according to the Observatory and the Idlib-based media activist Taher al-Omar who is embedded with militants.The Observatory said a convoy of 430 vehicles had entered Syria since Friday night, raising the number of vehicles to have entered the country since last weekend to well over 1,000.A rare clash between Turkish troops and Syrian soldiers earlier in the week left seven Turkish soldiers and a Turkish civilian dead as well as 13 Syrian troops.On Friday, Turkey’s defence ministry said the army would respond “even more forcefully” to any attack on Turkish observation posts in the area.The violence has raised tensions between Russia and Turkey, which have been working together to secure ceasefires and political talks despite backing opposite sides of the conflict."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4157559.1580475841!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"new year plant hunt gives young keen diligent botanists adrenaline spike","story":"Twitchers are a more intent species, as it were, than mere birdwatchers, but botanists seem to lack their ultimate compulsion. This may be just as well, since a rare plant, ringed suddenly by too many boots, has no means of flying away.Today’s botanists, however, increasingly young, keen and anoraked, do spike one occasion with adrenaline: the new year plant hunt on January 1st. How many flowering plants could you list in three hours of scouring the local ground? Even more competitively, who is to claim the First Flower of the Hunt? The really keen, it seems, have it photographed by torchlight shortly after midnight. On New Year’s Day 2019, for example, one Ger Collard from Tralee, Co Kerry, submitted pictures of five plants before 12.30 am.Collard is a member of the Botanical Society of Britain and Ireland (BSBI). Its acronym was adjusted in 2013 from its claim to the whole “British Isles,” such had been the historical weight of visiting experts from next door. Some would have laid a colonial claim to the Burren. But Ireland’s sterling fieldwork for a massive new flora secured us our rightful placeIts latest plant hunt, the ninth, involved 1,714 people, from Shetland to Guernsey, Donegal to Norfolk, west Cork to Kent. Often searching in family groups, they recorded more species in bloom – 615 – than ever before.The highest totals, predictably, were from the south and west of both islands. Swanage, on the UK south coast, had the longest list of 115. In fourth place came 85 species at Ballycullane, Co Wexford, from experienced Irish recorder Paul Green.The long-term objective of the hunt is to see how the wildflowers of these islands are responding to changes in weather patterns and climate. In the survey’s brief record, the latest hunt was pretty average. “We can’t yet prove that more species are flowering in mid-winter,” says Dr Kevin Walker, the BSBI’s chief scientist. But the hunt has already shown that, in milder winters, more plants flower because of warmer temperatures and fewer frosts.On January 25th, a Kerry reader sent Eye on Nature a cheering photograph of lesser celandines in flower, a week or two ahead of normal schedule. But only 24 per cent of the BSBI’s new year flowers were springtime specialists such as celandine and primrose, so there was “no indication of an early spring”.Indeed, more than half were wayside autumn stragglers such as yarrow, ragwort and hogweed. And the leading species, topped by daisy, groundsel and dandelion, commonly offer mid-winter blooms.The ready use of common wildflower names, where appropriate, alongside the Latin binomials of Linnaeus, marks the modern informality of botany. It’s true that in papers at Ireland’s spring conference in the National Botanic Gardens, something such as festuca grasses may be salted with Latin names – that’s science. But, more and more, diligent amateurs are joining surveys with professionals, enlivening online websites and blogs, and painlessly absorbing the weighty fistful of Webb’s Irish Flora.Ireland even has a team known at the Rough Crew, led by Dr Rory Hodd, “ecologist, botanist and montivagant, with a passion for liverworts, mosses and mountains”. A montivagant is, indeed, a wanderer over hills and mountains, and Hodd inspires an adventurous troupe of young followers – typically three women and five men – to seek out the plants of rain-soaked ledges on the high, rocky scarps and ravines of the west.Much of this is pursued on the mountains and islands of Co Mayo, where the rocks themselves are of infinite variety and interest. That is, if one could master enough geology to tell them apart and fit their shapes and stories into the landscape.An engaging encouragement has been published by Mayo County Council in Reading the Rocks (€15 in local bookshops). A geological audit produced an impressive choice of more than 100 significant sites in Mayo, some of international note, such as the metamorphic rocks of the Mullet Peninsula, 1.75 billion years old.From these, two geologists at NUI Galway, Dr Ronan Hennessy and Prof Martin Feely selected 21 sites to show the great range of Mayo’s geological story. Many are strikingly photogenic, such as the great sea stack of Dun Briste at the tip of Downpatrick Head. And “there is never the necessity”, the publisher warns, “to hammer, dig or collect samples”.Carrowniskey Strand, south of Louisburgh, is well featured in the book. It was my own early hunting ground for huge and beautiful pebbles, glacially gathered and rounded in the sea, and Reading the Rocks would have helped me with their story before the great storms that swept so much of them away.A stubborn obstacle to enjoying books about geology is their unchippable sediment of science-speak. This one has a generous glossary, usefully unpacking the information condensed into single terms. But arriving at, say, “ophiotic melange”, I think I’d still rather scramble through the awns, bracts, corymbs and corollas of botany."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Winds of 110 kmh expected as Met \u0026Eacuteireann issues new weather warningDay of week, Ireland rugby match and approaching storm may impact final numbersGarda\u0026iacute find equipment including cocaine press during search of Kildangan houseSampling took place across country among 5,000 respondentsWhat do you need to vote?

Photograph: Nick BradshawHigh turnout has been reported in many parts of the country as voting continues to elect the 33rd Dáil.Turnout was as high as 62 per cent in some areas by 5pm as voters cast their ballots on a Saturday for the first time in the history of the State. The day of the week, an Ireland rugby match and an approaching storm may all impact how many people are turning up to cast their ballots.Voting will close at 10pm and counting will begin on Sunday morning at 9am.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar claimed Saturday voting would help families and younger voters living or studying away from home, but others were sceptical as to its intended impact and question how it would upset the traditional rhythms of weekday voting.It was anticipated that the Ireland vs Wales rugby match and GAA fixtures would also have an effect on what time people would go to their local polling station.Add to that the arrival of Storm Ciara – with severe wind warnings in place along with rain - and a number of variables could be behind what appears to be a increase in voter turnout during the day.East of countryIn Co Wicklow, 62 per cent of the electorate had turned out to cast their ballots at one polling station by the coast at Greystones by 5pm, according to the Wicklow returning officer’s office. Arklow was at around 53 per cent.In Manor Kilbride, in the west of the county, turnout was 52 per cent.Overall in west Wicklow, figures generally ranged between 45 and 50 per cent.In the east of the county, turnout was averaging around 54 per cent by the early evening.“Most polling stations are reporting turnout as being up on the last general election for that time of day,” said one official.In parts of Dublin North, turnout by 5pm was almost 51 per cent.More than 46 per cent of the electorate at a polling station at De La Salle school in Dublin Bay North had cast their votes ten hours after voting began.There were stark variances between two polling stations in Dublin Central: At St Paul’s CBS in the north inner city, turnout was just over 28 per cent, compared to more than almost 55 per cent at Glasnevin National School.There was a similar pattern earlier in the day in Dublin Bay South but the gap closed as the day went on.Almost 46 per cent had cast their votes at Ringsend National School, with the same figure at Sandymount’s Scoil Mhuire.‘Busy afternoon’In Mayo, turnout ranged between 32 (Ballinrobe) and 47 per cent (Ballina) by 4pm.In Cork, turnout was up significantly on the last general election by 5pmThe county’s four constituencies recorded more than 45 per cent on average, compared to less than 33 per cent in 2016.Evan O’Brien, of the Cork County Returning Office, said turnout “so far is very high in comparison to previous votes.”“The Saturday election is seeing a different voting pattern with a very busy afternoon after a quiet morning,” he added.“It remains to be seen whether voting this evening will see many more voters turn out. It is reported by polling staff that voters are becoming concerned about the weather and this may explain the strong afternoon turnout.”The election campaign saw all parties claim they could meet a demand for change from the electorate. About 3.5 million people are eligible to vote at 6,500 polling stations in 39 constituencies.PollsThe most recent opinion poll, the Ipsos MRBI poll, put Sinn Féin out in front, followed by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, although the gap between the three larger parties has been relatively small.Voters will elect 159 members of the 33rd Dáil which will have 160 seats, two more than the 32nd Dáil, with Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghaíl automatically returned in Kildare South. The new Dáil is due to meet on Thursday, February 20th.At the dissolution of the last Dáil, Fine Gael had 47 seats Fianna Fáil had 45, excluding Mr Ó Fearghaíl Sinn Féin had 22 Labour, seven Solidarity-People Before Profit, six Green Party, three Social Democrats, two Independents4Change, one Aontú, one and Independents and others, 22.One seat was vacant due to the resignation of former Fine Gael Cork North Central TD, Dara Murphy.There are 516 declared candidates and 160, or 31 per cent, are women.

Photograph: Jade WilsonThe population of the Co Dublin seaside town Balbriggan has grown hugely in recent years - it now has the youngest population in Ireland and is one of the most multicultural towns.Some 31 per cent of the population is made up of non-Irish ethnicities, which means many new citizens are casting their first votes in an Irish General Election today.“This is my first time voting here in Ireland. It’s nice to have a voice and I’m proud to vote because I like to fight for good,” Kalpana O’Brien said. Ms O’Brien moved to Ireland from Mauritius in 2008 and became a citizen last year.Ms O’Brien was excited to receive her voting card and had been checking the post for it every day for the past week. “I was waiting and waiting and when it finally came I felt so happy and proud to be a citizen of Ireland,” she said.Ms O’Brien’s husband, Gerry O’Brien, said he was delighted to accompany his wife to the local polling station for her first vote. “It’s great to see her walk in there today and contribute, she has an interest in politics and wants to change the dynamic here.Nicole Gani (21) was born in Zimbabwe and moved to Ireland with her family in 2008. Today was her first vote in a General Election. “For me, this is about seeing change being brought about because things aren’t great currently in terms of health services, for example. So I’m inclined to vote for people who will do the most on that. But it’s great we can even vote in the first place as women and black women, and that we get to put forward what we want to see to the people representing us.”Ms Gani’s father, Artwell Gani, accompanied his daughter to the polling station at St Molaga’s National School today. He said he was “very happy” that he and his daughter can vote in Ireland. Mr Artwell had his citizenship on time to vote in the 2016 General Election and remarked that this time around, he was looking for a party who would “address issues like housing and homelessness”.Tony Gomina, originally from Nigeria, became a citizen here four years ago and said: “It feels good to be able to help shape policy and decide who will govern the country. It’s quite a good experience.” Mr Gomina said the issue of inclusivity is important to him as an immigrant voter. He described Balbriggan as a “nice and multicultural place to live” but said “politicians here need to start talking about inclusiveness.“I have three masters degrees and yet I don’t seem to have the kind of job that suits my qualifications. We’re not given the opportunity to get that experience. I pray the better candidate wins who will move this country forward.”Abinbola Makinwa, from Nigeria, says he has lived here so long that “people call me Paddy”. Mr Makinwa moved to Ireland 24 years ago, got his citizenship 12 years ago and has voted “many times” in Ireland since then. “It is very important for me. It’s good to have my vote counted as a minority in the community and have my say, to be part of the movement for change and to vote for someone who will do the right thing for the people,” he said.By noon today, the turnout at St Molaga’s National School polling station was 18.5 per cent. The consensus in the election office is that as the election is taking place on a Saturday, polling stations will see a steadier flow of voters throughout the day instead of the rush that is seen on Fridays."},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons february 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178.Mother denied right to appeal sentence of son\u0026#39s killer because she applied \u0026#39outside office hours\u0026#39Coronavirus latest news: Five British people diagnosed in French ski resortGourmand George III fraternised with enemy\u0026#39s cuisineBill Gates becomes first to buy a £500m hydrogen-powered super yacht Farmers fear tree planting ambitions will lead to rural \u0026#39depopulation\u0026#39More non-recyclable household waste is being put in green bins Jane Austen fans delight at \u0026#39gratuitous\u0026#39 Mr Knightley naked scene in new Emma filmCoronavirus: Holidaymakers skiing in France traced amid fears they came into contact with infected BritonsHong Kong residents take it upon themselves to screen Chinese mainlandersOscars members must proved they have watched every film as big stars snubbed by snobbish HollywoodRoyal Academy of Arts uses children\u0026#39s labels for first time in Picasso exhibitionHow to stop a terrorist - at any stageGas boilers could be banned from all homes to ensure the UK meets carbon neutral target by 2050Music plays on Idlib\u0026#39s rebel radio for first time in five years as bombs rain down on last hold-out of Assad\u0026#39s regimeStorm Ciara: Forecasters warn a month of rain in one day, with 80mph winds posing a danger to lifeCan \u0026#39Mayor Pete\u0026#39 Buttigieg go from fixing potholes in South Bend to the White House?Comment: Hearing former slaves perform music showed me the power of the art formComment: Starbucks\u0026#39 new charity associations leave a bitter taste in the mouthHarvey Weinstein\u0026#39s defence lawyer in hot water over \u0026#39celebrity victimhood status\u0026#39 comments to pressAmerica’s anger at Britain’s Huawei decision is real, Nigel Farage warns after talks with Donald TrumpWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"like broadband access cashpoints should bealegal right","story":"There is a large section of the British population that still relies heavily on cashHow bizarre that we should spend so much energy arguing over commas on 50p pieces and who should be on our banknotes – and so little time worrying whether we can actually get hold of cash when we want it. A study by Which? magazine reveals that 8,700 free-to-use cash machines have disappeared in the past two years. In some small towns residents don’t even have access a rip-off, £2-a-go machine. Those in Naseby, Northamptonshire, have to take a 20-minute bus ride to their nearest machine those in Harlech, North Wales, a 25-minute train ride.For a government committed to “levelling up” the regions beyond London, this ought to sound alarms. Quite rightly, access to high-speed broadband is now a legal right, wherever you live in the country, under a universal service obligation on telecoms companies. But cash machines? Forget it. The banking and payments industry has been allowed to chip away at our right to use cash in the name of generating huge profits for itself – and the Government is doing nothing to dissuade it.David Cameron even toyed with the idea of announcing, in his 2015 Conservative conference speech, the total abolition of cash by 2020 – only to be talked out of it by George Osborne who thought it might not be the greatest vote-winner. Too right, it wouldn’t.It might come as a surprise to metropolitan-based policymakers who spend much of their lives swiping at smartphones in urban Wi-Fi zones, but there is a large section of the British population that still relies heavily on cash. The fact that there are plenty of tech-savvy silver surfers shouldn’t blind us to the fact that for a significant number of elderly people the online world remains a deeply confusing place.Only 40 per cent of the over-65s, according to the ONS, have used a smartphone in the past three months. One in 13 Britons have never used the internet. The young graduates who dream up these systems have grown up with technology and find it simple to master some payment app on their phones what they seem unable to do is put themselves in the shoes of somebody who has spent their life withdrawing cash from a teller and was rather happy with that system.True, it is easier to use a contactless card – unless, that is, you are one of the 1.2 million Britons who have no bank account. It might seem odd to most people, but there are some obvious factors behind why people struggle to open accounts: if they have no fixed abode, and are unable to provide such things as utility bills, for example. The contempt shown by some government ministers towards this group of people is astonishing. Pushing the coalition’s Digital by Default strategy in 2014, the then Cabinet office minister Francis Maude referred to people not online as “refuseniks” who might be offered a one-off lesson in using the internet but who would otherwise be frozen out of using public services.One of the arguments frequently advanced for a cashless economy is that it will supposedly cut crime. It doesn’t stack up: the move to online banking and commerce has led to an explosion in fraud, with victims duped into sending large sums to criminals’ bank accounts from which miserably little seems to be recovered, in spite of it being theoretically traceable. Depriving people of the right to use cash is putting them more at risk of crime, not less.Contactless cards, too, present new opportunities for crime. At least if you are mugged for the £20 in your wallet that is as much as you can lose. Not so with a card which, if stolen, can be used over and over again to draw cash direct from your account. The EU – which deserves credit where it is due – has at least introduced rules demanding checks on a customer’s identity whenever their cumulative spend on a contactless card reaches €100 (£85). The move has produced predictable bleating from the payments industry – with one company preposterously claiming that it would cost retailers £50 billion a year as shoppers abandoned purchases because they hadn’t got the time to key in a PIN.Of course, cashless forms of payment are a good thing when consumers are making a free choice to use them. But there is only one reason that lobbyists have been trying to push for a cashless economy: because cash constitutes an inconvenient, free form of competition for the financial technology (fintech) industry. A report by the US Department for Commerce gave the game away. In 2016 alone investors poured $19 billion into fintech in the expectation that going cashless could, by 2023, double the $1 trillion (£800 billion) in fees globally creamed off by the banking and payments industry.That’s why you can’t find a cashpoint, or if you can it wants to sting you £2 a time. Drive cash out of the economy and it will be a feast day for some. It is time the Government spotted what is happening and put out a universal service obligation on the banks to provide us with free access to our cash.The War Against Cash by Ross Clark is published by Harriman HouseThe  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Meaning you might be happy to learn that this week a fresh morsel was added to the counter of inedible products in the company’s stores across the UK. These are “mermaid” cookies. And as the faux-friendly writing on all the identikit chalkboards at all the depressing Starbucks stores inform customers, these are cookies with a purpose.Starbucks have come up with this particular tooth-rotter in the name of something they present sweetly. Purchase a “mermaids cookie” and a full 50p will be given by Starbucks to the charity Mermaids. So sweet. So innocent. Or sickening. Depending what you know.Personally I view Mermaids as one of the most sinister charitable organisations in the UK. Starbucks simply says that the group supports “young transgender and gender erse people and their families”. The undrinkable coffee chain claims that all those 50 pences will pay to support a helpline for such people. In fact everything that Mermaids pushes is deeply controversial and with implications which need to be properly interrogated.Let’s just start with that presumption – put on all those Starbucks boards: what are “gender erse people”? Does anybody know? Can anybody justify or explain the phrase? I would offer a year’s supply of edible croissants from any of Starbucks\u0027 competitors for anyone who can.Then there is the lobbying that Mermaids puts out to persuade society at large that children who believe – or are encouraged to believe – that they are in the “wrong body” should be helped to change sex. Something which is presented by Mermaids as though it is not just a right but a doozy. Think you’d like to become a girl? Why not give it a go? Vice versa? No problem!Whatever societal madness future historians work out encouraged this fiasco, the most striking aspect of it is that on this matter, as on so many others, the adults all appear to have left the room. People do not question the new orthodoxy. If someone says that certain children should be given puberty blockers so that they can transition into approximations of the opposite sex who are we to question it?So it is fitting that this week the news emerged of a 13-year-old girl applying for a judicial review against Oxfordshire County Council. The cause is the council’s ‘Trans Inclusion Toolkit for Schools 2019’ which Oxfordshire County Council has given to more than 300 schools in the area.Its advice says – among other things – that girls like the girl known only as ‘Miss A’ should share changing rooms, lavatories and even residential dormitories on school trips with any boy who identifies as a girl. Campaigners against accommodation of such ‘self-identification’ say that this advice poses a serious risk to children.Read more | Transgender ChildrenIt will be interesting to see in the months and indeed years ahead who wins stand-offs such as this one. The fact that multinationals like Starbucks can so easily jump on board with the agenda that Mermaids is pushing is just the latest demonstration of how fast this new orthodoxy is being accepted.Meanwhile parents and others who object to this agenda are wrongly portrayed as backwards and bigoted: people who are trying either to make people murder trans people or make trans people kill themselves. Thus with the language of catastrophism is an actual catastrophe mainstreamed into society.What studies there are show that around four fifths of children diagnosed with the highly dubious condition ‘gender dysphoria’ will grow up to be perfectly happy straight or gay men or women – happy in their own bodies.For any sane society this would be just one sign that the claims of the trans extremists need far more investigation than they are currently getting. So how encouraging it is that a 13 year old schoolgirl should try to inject some sense into a debate which nearly all the adults in our society have fearfully, disgracefully ducked.Mother denied right to appeal sentence of son\u0026#39s killer because she applied \u0026#39outside office hours\u0026#39Coronavirus latest news: Five British people diagnosed in French ski resortGourmand George III fraternised with enemy\u0026#39s cuisineBill Gates becomes first to buy a £500m hydrogen-powered super yacht Farmers fear tree planting ambitions will lead to rural \u0026#39depopulation\u0026#39More non-recyclable household waste is being put in green bins Jane Austen fans delight at \u0026#39gratuitous\u0026#39 Mr Knightley naked scene in new Emma filmCoronavirus: Holidaymakers skiing in France traced amid fears they came into contact with infected BritonsHong Kong residents take it upon themselves to screen Chinese mainlandersOscars members must proved they have watched every film as big stars snubbed by snobbish HollywoodRoyal Academy of Arts uses children\u0026#39s labels for first time in Picasso exhibitionHow to stop a terrorist - at any stageGas boilers could be banned from all homes to ensure the UK meets carbon neutral target by 2050Music plays on Idlib\u0026#39s rebel radio for first time in five years as bombs rain down on last hold-out of Assad\u0026#39s regimeStorm Ciara: Forecasters warn a month of rain in one day, with 80mph winds posing a danger to lifeCan \u0026#39Mayor Pete\u0026#39 Buttigieg go from fixing potholes in South Bend to the White House?Comment: Hearing former slaves perform music showed me the power of the art formHarvey Weinstein\u0026#39s defence lawyer in hot water over \u0026#39celebrity victimhood status\u0026#39 comments to pressAmerica’s anger at Britain’s Huawei decision is real, Nigel Farage warns after talks with Donald TrumpWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/02/06/14/beetroot-leaf-dhal-cooking-indyeats.jpg","title":"garden sustainable space how to build tips tricks climate 20 pledges","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.This year, Chris Riotta is growing his own fruit and vegetables – in the middle of New York CityWhether you’re working with a few feet of space in a community vegetable patch, or have 65 acres of luscious foliage on a sprawling estate (looking at you, Oprah Winfrey), the first step to building a sustainable garden is mapping out a vision of your intentions.Each year before planting my own vegetable patch, I draw out an image of the garden I hope to build, indicating where each plant should go based on available sunlight and shading.\u0026nbspI’m currently planning to build the largest garden I’ve ever grown, while working to harvest one-third of my annual vegetable consumption directly from my backyard, as part of my mission for The Independent’s 20\u0026nbspPledges\u0026nbspfor 2020 initiative. While mapping out the garden, I put together a few tips and tricks to help get you started on your own sustainable vegetable patch.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesPlan out where to place your\u0026nbspplantsRoot to fruit: How to join the ethical food revolutionI like to plant crops that grow on vines (think: cucumbers and cherry tomatoes) in small groups, as close to a fence as possible so they scale upwards, while giving other plants that will likely grow much larger a separate space off to the side. That way, I can still walk by and tend to the crops growing up the fence, no matter how big the other plants off to the side eventually grow.\u0026nbspThis also works with smaller plots of soil like community garden space: keep clusters of similar plants in the same tight groups, and don’t worry so much about spacing. With some proper TLC, plants usually find their way around each other in the dirt.\u0026nbspSeeds can always begin growing indoors ahead of the season around the time you lay out your soil, which will provide you with plenty of time to start growing your crops in a stable environment. Some farmers will recommend you transport these seeds to your garden based on the location of the moon, but since I don’t have time for all that, I simply give the soil a good rinse of water for a week before transporting or planting anything in my garden.Study your plotBefore stepping into that dirt, it’s important to study your space and gain an understanding of how many hours of sunlight you’re working with and what kind of plants grow well in the region. Most will require about eight hours of sun, but if you’re in a shaded area and can only get six, that should still work, as many plants favour partial shade and only require about four hours of direct sunlight.\u0026nbspGetting a head start on laying out the groundwork for your garden will help it produce sustainable harvests that last throughout the summer months – and then some. You can look up the last frost date in your region here.\u0026nbspI tend to lay out my organic soil exactly where I plant to grow my garden about six weeks before this date.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Back to our roots: Warming winter vegetables recipes Show all 2Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Maximise your spaceIt’s also just as important to consider ways to maximise the space while gardening. Vertical garden walls can be purchased or made easily in DIY projects, allowing plants to grow above each other rather than spread out over a small space.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailLastly, don’t be afraid to plant intensively. Most crops only need a few inches of space for their roots to grow: things like peppers, tomatoes, broccoli and kale can all grow much closer together than most people think. I tend to believe that crops grow better when they’re in close, clustered mixes of similar plants, but that’s just my unprofessional semi-gardening enthusiast opinion.Transplant the seeds to your garden once its warm enough for them to survive in an outdoor climate, but only when the seeds are busting out of their trays or starter pots. The seeds should look vibrant and almost too big for their trays by the time they are brought to the garden for planting.\u0026nbspI tend to believe the first moments catering to a garden and each inidual plant are some of the most important in a life cycle the only way a garden will produce healthy crops is with tender love and care during its birth. These moments of transporting, growing the seeds, placing them into the ground and giving them nutrients and fresh water throughout the process are all vital to the longevity of a harvest.\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The average ratings for the feeling that things done in life are “worthwhile” decreased by 0.5 per cent.The ONS said this was the first time it had recorded a fall in both life satisfaction and feeling that things done in life were worthwhile since it started measuring them in 2011.

Expectations about the economy were reflected in real household spending per person, which grew at its slowest annualised rate since the end of 2016. On average, people spent less on cars in over the period than they did in 2016, with spending on recreation and culture, and utilities growing more slowly over the same time.“This is the first time that ratings of life satisfaction significantly fell,” ONS researchers said. “It is the first significant change since early 2015 in what was a stable picture of life satisfaction in the UK.“After this period, average life satisfaction ratings reached a plateau, with fluctuations quarter on quarter but no significant changes up to their deterioration in the latest quarter.”Prioritise citizens’ wellbeing over GDP in budgets, Iceland PM urgesMeanwhile figures from the organisation for Economic Cooperation and development showed that the UK was the only member of the Group of 7 (G7) rich nations to suffer a fall in people’s average income.The OECD, known as the rich countries’ think tank, said real household income per capita contracted significantly in the third quarter of 2019, by minus 0.7 per cent, unwinding much of the 0.9 per cent growth recorded in the previous three months.Households income per person grew by 1.5 per cent during the two years to September 2019, just half the average of 3.0 per cent for the G7 as whole.A barometer of consumer confidence among British consumers also fell in October. However, the January reading by GfK’s long-running Consumer Confidence Index increased two points to minus nine for January adding to evidence to an upturn in spirits decision the General Election.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The average ratings for the feeling that things done in life are “worthwhile” decreased by 0.5 per cent.The ONS said this was the first time it had recorded a fall in both life satisfaction and feeling that things done in life were worthwhile since it started measuring them in 2011. The measure was launched by former prime minister David Cameron to obtain other measures of happiness besides economic growth.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe ONS also said on Thursday that people\u0027s concerns about the general economic outlook continued to grow up to September 2019, reaching their highest level since late 2011.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Children from Oaklands Secondary School in Bethnal Green and Families Belong Together campaigners in Westminster before handing a petition in to the Home Office, as they call on the government to amend the UK\u0027s refugee family reunion lawsRasputin the polar bear, shakes off water as he is unveiled at the Yorkshire Wildlife Park, DoncasterPolice activity inside a cordon where a man was shot by armed police in a terrorist-related incident in Streatham, LondonMicheal Ward with his Rising Star Award alongside Daniel Kaluuya BaftasActivists attend an anti-Conservative government, pro-Scottish independence, and anti-Brexit demonstration outside Holyrood, the seat of the Scottish Parliament in EdinburghPro EU supporters display a banner \u0027 Here to Stay, Here to Fight, Migrants In, Tories Out\u0027 from Westminster bridge in front of the Houses of Parliament in London.

Expectations about the economy were reflected in real household spending per person, which grew at its slowest annualised rate since the end of 2016. On average, people spent less on cars in over the period than they did in 2016, with spending on recreation and culture, and utilities growing more slowly over the same time.“This is the first time that ratings of life satisfaction significantly fell,” ONS researchers said. “It is the first significant change since early 2015 in what was a stable picture of life satisfaction in the UK.“After this period, average life satisfaction ratings reached a plateau, with fluctuations quarter on quarter but no significant changes up to their deterioration in the latest quarter.”Prioritise citizens’ wellbeing over GDP in budgets, Iceland PM urgesMeanwhile figures from the organisation for Economic Cooperation and development showed that the UK was the only member of the Group of 7 (G7) rich nations to suffer a fall in people’s average income.The OECD, known as the rich countries’ think tank, said real household income per capita contracted significantly in the third quarter of 2019, by minus 0.7 per cent, unwinding much of the 0.9 per cent growth recorded in the previous three months.Households income per person grew by 1.5 per cent during the two years to September 2019, just half the average of 3.0 per cent for the G7 as whole.A barometer of consumer confidence among British consumers also fell in October.

From there, you\u0027ll see the normal list of everyone you follow, but also the new update.There is an option for looking at the Instagram accounts that appear most in your feed. Those are also likely to be the ones you interact with most, given that Instagram prizes things like likes when deciding what to show, but could also be annoying accounts that post too much.The other option shows users who they interact with least. That can include dozens of people that might be worth unfollowing if their feed or stories are becoming overwhelming.The new feature was found in testing late last year, but has finally rolled out to everyone with a new update and announcement from Instagram.It comes after the app also added the option to see the people you follow sorted by how recently you started doing so.

Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 723 s of the Galaxy Vol 217. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke).

It\u0027s the first time a lunar sample has been studied like this. We\u0027re using a technique many geologists haven\u0027t even heard of.Scientists to make air out of lunar dust amid plans to live on MoonAs researchers make use of the new technique, they expect to find a vast set of new information about the lunar surface.We can apply this technique to samples no one has studied, Philipp Heck, a curator at the Field Museum, associate professor at the University of Chicago, and co-author of the paper, adds. You\u0027re almost guaranteed to find something new or unexpected.This technique has such high sensitivity and resolution, you find things you wouldn\u0027t find otherwise and only use up a small bit of the sample.The technique is called atom probe tomography, and involves incredibly precise manipulation of inidual grains. It has previously been used in industrial processes – but the new breakthrough has come in turning it for the first time to lunar samples.It works something like nanocarpentry, said Professor Heck: like a carpenter shapes wood, we do it at the nanoscale to minerals.The sample is placed inside a special probe and then shot with a laser that knocks off inidual atoms, which then fall onto a special plate. Researchers can examine those elements by timing how long they take to hit the detector – since heavier ones take longer – and so the type of atom can be worked out.It has already helped researchers see the weathering and materials that can be found inside the lunar soil. That in turn could help future astronauts as they move to live on the Moon, since they could survive by taking resources out of that dust.The researchers now hope they can get hold of samples from elsewhere on the Moon, and elsewhere in space, to allow them to better understand the makeup of the worlds that surround us. They compare our current understanding to analysing Earth using only one mountain range – to get a fuller grasp, they will need to examine a variety of terrains across the solar system.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I don’t know anything else. I made one mistake in life, and it feels like I tried to kill the Queen’A man who has been in the UK since the age of 11 and has a British baby is set to be deported on a charter flight to Jamaica within days.Reshawn Davis, 30, was detained last Friday and told he would be removed to Jamaica on 11 February – on the second charter flight to travel to the country since the Windrush scandal two years ago.He is being removed from the country on the basis that he was convicted for robbery 10 years ago under the now-unlawful “joint enterprise” rule –\u0026nbspfor which he spent two months in prison.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Jamaican national, who lives with his British wife\u0026nbspand six-month-old daughter in northwest London and has not committed any crime since his conviction, said the thought of being ripped from his family and returning to a country he has not been to for 20 years terrified him.\u0026nbspUp to 50 other Jamaican nationals have been detained in recent weeks and are set to be deported on the same charter flight, which has been the subject of mounting controversy.A draft copy of the Windrush Lessons Learned report, leaked to the media on Thursday, said ministers should consider ending the practice of deporting people who arrived in the UK as children – prompting calls for ministers to halt the removal of iniduals like Mr Davis until it is published.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Activists surround a wooden trojan horse in the courtyard of the British Museum in London.

I can’t even explain how I feel. Yes I was born in Jamaica, but I was brought up here. I don’t know anything else. I made one mistake in life, and it feels like I tried to kill the Queen.\u0026nbsp“I look at my daughter’s pictures now every night before I go to bed. Since she was born I never had never spent a night without her until I was locked in here. I still reach for her when I wake up. I’m not one of those to leave my wife to do it by herself. I want to be there for them both.“I’m terrified to go to Jamaica. My cousin was deported and he has now died. People will be hostile to me because I’ve been deported. I’m going to be targeted.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I won’t be able to. That’s not something I wanted because I don’t want to sit down and rely on benefits. I’ve always worked. I’ve never been on benefits in my life.“I never imagined being a single mum. I don’t want to fall into the statistics of young single parents, especially for something that isn’t my fault and could have been prevented. It’s hard, emotionally and I would need help financially because it is hard having a young baby.“Reshawn is a great dad. He’s been here all the time with her. She loved him. He does a lot – feeds her, changes her, plays with her. A child needs their dad. I don’t know what’s going to happen now.”Mr Davis’s solicitor made representations for him to remain in the UK this week on the basis of family ties\u0026nbspbut it was ruled on Friday that he did not have a “genuine and subsisting” relationship with his wife or child and that it would “not be unduly harsh” for them to be without him.Rachel Meates, a solicitor from Irving Legal who is representing Mr Davis, said she was shocked that despite having provided a birth certificate, a marriage certificate and photographs, his relationship with his family\u0026nbspwas not being believed.“The Home Office has been quite manipulative in shutting down the arguments. There was enough evidence put in to suggest it was a genuine relationship – and I don’t know what more evidence we can submit from a five-month-old,” she said, adding:\u0026nbsp“It highlights the culture of disbelief that comes with the hostile environment.”A Home Office spokesperson said: “The planned charter flight to Jamaica is specifically for removing foreign criminals.

It feels like I’m losing my mind’Ministers have admitted a mobile phone outage at removal centres has prevented people from accessing legal\u0026nbspservices to challenge their deportation, days before a charter flight is set to leave the UK.The Home Office has been forced to admit it has known about the issue affecting detainees’ mobile phone signals in detention centres near Heathrow airport since 13 January, but took 23 days to begin providing detainees with working sim\u0026nbspcards – during which it pressed ahead with charter flights to Ghana, Nigeria and France.Campaigners accused the government of removing people from the country without giving them their lawful right to legal advice and assistance during\u0026nbspthe “crucial window” leading up to the removal flights.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesPeople who are due to be deported on a charter flight to Jamaica on Tuesday told The Independent that as a result of the outage, they had struggled to communicate with their solicitors and send them relevant documents to challenge their removals.Mobile phones provided by the Home Office at the outset of detention are the principal means by which detainees are able to access legal assistance, contact their solicitors and stay in touch with their families.Government told to review deportations days before charter flightEchard Bepart-Woollett, 27, who came to Britain when he was eight\u0026nbspand has two British children, said he had been struggling to communicate with his solicitor since the Home Office issued him with deportation orders last week.“I can’t get hold of my solicitor – the only chance of getting out of here. It’s getting mad. It feels like I’m losing my mind. It’s like all communication has been shut down. Everyone is trying to get hold of their solicitor to see what’s going on,” said the Jamaican national.“If they don’t get the paperwork, I can’t go to court, I can’t fight. It’s black and white. You need everything documented and proven, and if I can’t get that out, then I’m f***ed.”Mr Bepart-Woollett’s solicitor, Marina Khan of Duncan Lewis Solicitors, said her client had a strong case\u0026nbspto remain in Britain but that the mobile outages had meant filing submissions to challenge his deportation has taken much longer than normal.“We were trying to contact him every day since he instructed us on 31 January, and it took us until 6 February\u0026nbspto formally take details instructions from him. It’s been awful. His partner was stressing out,” she said.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I couldn’t send it during office hours because I didn’t receive it in time. The delay was unreasonable.“It’s caused a lot of undue stress and frustration for our client. He’s been totally deprived of contacting his legal representatives and unable to access legal justice and advice from us.”MPs Nadia Whittome and Dawn Butler raise the issue of people on next week’s deportation flight to JamaicaAnother detainee, Reshawn Davis, 30, who came to the UK at the age of 11 and has a British six-month-old baby,\u0026nbspsaid the signal issues were “extremely frustrating”.“People are telling me they’re trying to call me and I don’t see the call. My phone just doesn’t ring. I haven’t spoken to my solicitor directly at all because of the signal. It’s been a huge added stress. I don’t know what’s going on,” he said.“It’s stopping me talking to my family as well. My daughter knows my voice. If I say something over the phone, she’s thinking Daddy’s home. I say her name and she looks up for me. But this signal is preventing me from talking to her.”People facing imminent removal from the UK are entitled to notice periods ranging from three to five days during which it is, by law, vital that they are able to access legal advice and assistance, for example to assess the merits of challenging their removal.Windrush victims given additional two years to apply for compensation‘Home Office is destroying their lives’: Father-of-two to be deportedGovernment told to review deportations days before charter flightBella Sankey, director of Detention Action, which has launched a legal challenge against the Home Office over its alleged failure to provide effective access to legal advice to detainees, said: “An eleventh-hour issuing of sim cards may not be sufficient for those seeking to challenge their removal on Tuesday’s flight. Not to mention the impact on those that have been removed while the signal has been down.\u0026nbsp“This is a partial victory for access to justice but there are many unanswered questions and our legal challenge will proceed.”It comes after a\u0026nbspleaked draft of the\u0026nbspWindrush\u0026nbspLessons Learned\u0026nbspreview stated that ministers should consider ending the practice of deporting people who arrived in the UK as children, prompting calls for the Home Office to put\u0026nbspdeportation flight on hold until the review is published.The Home Office has been approached for comment.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It is unclear if the visit was in a personal or professional capacity, given the duke of York\u0027s commitment to step back from public life over his relationship with billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.\u0026nbspThe Queen also offered New Years greetings to President Xi Jinping and his citizens,Infected woman gives birth to healthy child - Chinese state media\u0026nbspA coronavirus-infected woman has given birth to a health child, according to Chinese state media.\u0026nbspThe infant was born in the east of the country in Zhejiang province, and is being monitored in intensive care ahead of further testing, the communist party\u0027s Xinhua news agency reports.\u0026nbspIt comes days after doctors warned it may be possible to transmit the illness from mother to child in utero after a newborn was observed to have contracted the virus.World Health Organisation team to head to ChinaThe head of a World Health Organization-led international team investigating the\u0026nbspcoronavirus\u0026nbspoutbreak will leave for China on Monday or Tuesday, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.\u0026nbspThe international health official, asked whether the team would include experts from the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), told a press conference on Saturday: We hope so.It comes after the New York Times reported the CDC had offered to help in the region but had been ignored for weeks.Coronavirus: how serious are disease outbreaks onboard cruise ships?With thousands of passengers aboard\u0026nbspDiamond Princess\u0026nbspin\u0026nbspquarantine\u0026nbspin Japan, the cruise industry has brought in a severe and unprecedented measure to try to prevent further outbreaks.\u0026nbspBut the incident has drawn attention to the risks on\u0026nbspcruise ships.Here\u0027s the Independent\u0027s Simon Calder\u0026nbspon the risks and rights when it comes to the coronavirus at sea.\u0026nbspOutbreak \u0027probably not much worse than particularly bad influenza year\u0027, infectious diseases expert saysAt the moment the mortality rate is looking at about two per cent, which is a little bit more than we would see for influenza, but I suspect that mortality rate will drop as we increasingly find less severe cases,\u0026nbspDr Paul Hunter told\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0027s travel correspondent Simon Calder.So in terms of the severity of the disease, it\u0027s probably not that much worse than a particularly bad influenza year.  Dr Hunter explains the chances of catching the coronavirus on a flight are not zero, but extremely low.Here\u0027s more on the wartime measures introduced in Wuhan, amid reports of hazmat suit-clad officials going door-to-door and forcing people suspected of being infected with the virus\u0026nbspinto quarantine.The stricter steps were announced by\u0026nbspSun Chunlan as she visited the virus-stricken city on Thursday, announcing:\u0026nbsp“There must be no deserters, or they will be nailed to the pillar of historical shame forever.”\u0026nbspThe Associated Press\u0026nbsphas this country-by-country update on the outbreak\u0027s spread:China: 722 deaths and 34,546 confirmed cases on the mainland, mainly in Hubei province.Hong Kong: 25 cases, including one death.Macau: 10Japan: 90Singapore: 40Thailand: 32South Korea: 24Taiwan: 16Malaysia: 16Australia: 14Germany: 14Vietnam: 13United States: 12.

A doctor tending to those patients has stopped coming to work, and health workers have been ordered not to speak publicly about the new virus that has killed hundreds around the world.The virus has yet to be confirmed in Africa, but global health authorities are increasingly worried about the threat to the continent where an estimated 1 million Chinese now live, as some health workers on the ground warn they are not ready to handle an outbreak.Countries are racing to take precautions as hundreds of travelers arrive from China every day. Safeguards include stronger surveillance at ports of entry and improved quarantine and testing measures across Africa, home to 1.2 billion people and some of the world\u0027s weakest systems for detecting and treating disease.But the effort has been complicated by a critical shortage of testing kits and numerous illnesses that display symptoms similar to the flu-like virus.The problem is, even if it\u0027s mild, it can paralyse the whole community, said Dr\u0026nbspMichel Yao, emergency operations manager in Africa for the World Health Organisation.We\u0027re definitely not prepared. If we had a couple of cases, it would spread very quickly, physiotherapist Fundi Sinkala said. We\u0027re doing the best we can with what resources we have.Three British children being examined for virus in France attended local schoolsTwo British children, and the nine-year-old known to have contracted the virus, are among 11 people under the watch of authorities after coming into close contact with those found to be suffering from the virus.All three children attended local schools, an official told BFM TV.Two people are believed to become the first foreign nationals to die from the virus in Wuhan.A Japanese man and American man\u0026nbspdied in the city, although it has not been confirmed whether the former had contracted the virus, despite suffering from severe pneumonia.“We offer our sincerest condolences to the family on their loss,” a US embassy spokesperson in Beijing said. “Out of respect for the family’s privacy, we have no further comment.”86 people were reported to have died from the virus in mainland China on Friday\u0026nbsp– the deadliest day of the outbreak so far.Two schools are to temporarily close in the French resort where five Britons were found to be suffering with the coronavirus, a regional health official says.The child among the group, who the official confirmed is nine years old, is believed to have spent time in local schools.​Amid an ongoing investigation, authorities are checking who the British nationals came into contact with.A second evacuation flight bringing back Singaporeans and their family members from virus-hit Wuhan in China is expected to arrive on Sunday morning.The city-state evacuated 92 Singaporeans from Wuhan last Thursday, some of whom have since been confirmed as infected. Authorities said they had to leave some passengers behind who were showing symptoms.A flight carrying medical supplies and diagnostic test kits, departed this afternoon for Wuhan, the country\u0027s foreign ministry said. Appropriate quarantine arrangements have been made for all of the returnees, it added.Two Britons infected with the virus are thought to have contracted it while in Singapore.The country\u0027s authorities are\u0026nbspinvestigating a three-day business meeting held in\u0026nbspa hotel from 20 January\u0026nbspbetween\u0026nbsp94 foreign nationals, France\u0027s\u0026nbspdirector general of health, Jerome Salomon, said.Government tells Brighton pupil\u0027s parents to ‘self-isolate’ child for 14 days\u0026nbspPublic Health England has told the parents of a pupil in Brighton suburb to self-isolate their child, who reportedly came into contact with a man found to be suffering with the virus on Thursday.Parents whose children attend Portslade Academy were emailed yesterday to inform them of the development by head teacher Mark Poston, Brighton and Hove News reported.“We are working in collaboration with and being guided by the local authority and Public Health England to ensure that we at PACA are acting consistently with the right medical advice, Mr Poston wrote.“Today we have been contacted by a parent of a student at PACA who was contacted by Public Health England as part of their investigation concerning the confirmed case that was reported in the press yesterday.“We have been informed by the parent that they have been advised by Public Health England to self-isolate their child at home for 14 days. If at any point the child is found to be symptomatic we will be notified.Fear more harmful than virus, Singapore PM says after raising alert levelPrime minister Lee Hsien Loong appealed for the public to remain calm, after the alert update\u0026nbspprompted\u0026nbspresidents to clear out supermarket shelves of rice, noodles and toilet paper.Singapore raised its response to orange - the same as during the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak, which indicates the virus is severe and passes easily between persons.There is no need to panic. We are not locking down the city or confining everybody to stay at home,the PM\u0026nbspsaid on Saturday. We have ample supplies, so there is no need to stock up with instant noodles, tinned food, or toilet paper, as some people did yesterday.UK to donate £5m to World Health OrganisationThe Department for International Development said the sum would help the WHO prevent the spread of the virus in developing countries,\u0026nbspby supporting them to rapidly identify and care for patients with symptoms.Additional experts funded by UK aid will be deployed to the WHO to help coordinate the international response, the\u0026nbspstatement said.This week, the UN health agency asked the international community for £560m to help their efforts to combat the virus.On Friday, the United States signalled it would donate $100m in foreign aid to help the response in China and other countries.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Punishing non-payers nowadays is absurd.The Beeb will fight all the way.

We need a much slimmer BBC to survive and focus on quality TV and radio.But the licence has had its day.BORIS Johnson can only lead the world on climate change with the public on his side and our economy in the front of his mind.The Government churns out random dates in the not-too-distant future by which it demands we all buy electric cars and replace our gas central heating.Yes, the UK is hosting a climate summit this year and it must be ambitious.But do the Tories have a clue about the cost to consumers and the economy  Michael Gove was suspiciously coy.This country is not governed by Greta Thunberg — nor the Marxist wreckers running Extinction Rebellion.The Tories must level with the public and ensure that our global warming efforts BOOST the economy instead of wrecking it.And they will be near-worthless anyway unless the world’s worst polluters, China in particular, follow the example Britain is already setting in slashing emissions.JIHADIST murderers and their supporters should be judged criminally insane and held indefinitely as long as they are a danger.Most villains recognise our civilisation’s definitions of right and wrong.IS do not. Their extreme version of Islam legitimises slaughtering innocent people.Anyone  randomly stabbing ­passers-by or encouraging it would probably be classed as insane and locked away forever. Why not jihadis  The fact they consider their motives rational and noble proves they have lost their minds.Lesser offenders may be deradicalised, though that is a long shot. Others should be kept without time limit in a secure unit, maybe built specically for them.If we treat these religious madmen like “ordinary” murderers — with a stretch in a normal prison — we will keep making the same disastrous mistakes. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Which is not surprising when they are at least £, more than the petrol equivalent and most have woeful mileage ranges.Yet the Government, desperate to advertise its green credentials, blithely announces a ban on new petrol, diesel and even hybrid cars in just  years.But it’s not a concrete, costed plan . . . just a giant leap in the dark.How does it intend to totally re-equip Britain for roadside charging — or fund it while its multi-billion pound fuel duty income withers away to nothing How will people afford these cars unless prices plummet, which experts say is unlikely in the foreseeable future  And why is the Government poised to axe the subsidies that help us to buy We don’t in principle think taxpayers should fund anyone’s new motor. But why remove buyers’ sole financial incentive now, when the industry badly needs a jump-start The Government is hopping on a bandwagon without considering the consequences, like Labour  years ago when it urged everyone to buy diesels.Meanwhile councils are already brainlessly instigating city centre bans or fines on all but the tiny number of zero-emission vehicles currently on the road.Who can blame motorists for being confused and angry  Many will happily drive more eco-friendly cars once they are viable and affordable.But this is all stick and no carrot.BRITAIN should not be proudly flying our flag for Prince Andrew’s birthday. It is a grotesque gesture in the circumstances.Maybe his long, close friendship with Jeffrey Epstein — a jailed paedophile, pimp and sex trafficker of under-age girls — was entirely innocent.But he has still been sacked from Royal duties and accused of ignoring FBI demands to question him.Epstein’s victims are adamant Andrew mustto the US.What an insult to themTown Halls raise the Union Jack to honour him instead.WHEN it comes to helping the disabled, Boris Johnson can put his money where his mouth is right now.We are delighted to see the PM ask every Cabinet minister to find ways their department can contribute to his new National Disability Strategy.But there’s a £million black hole in funding for social care for families with disabled kids which Sajid Javid’s Budget on March  should fill.

What is the future of the BBC  Should China build our telecoms network Seldom has the political news agenda been so packed. But what is the story gaining traction at Westminster  For the latest, let’s go straight to our correspondent outside  Downing Street - who, oh dear, is stomping away in protest like Dick Emery’s Honky Tonks, having just had a blazing row with Boris Johnson’s media strategist.Yes, the big story, crazily, is the stand-off between political journalists and the PM’s media advisers. The reporters, hardly the most delicate bunch of dahlias, are wailing that the Government is being beastly to them.In the blue corner we have Downing Street’s press officers who, in an unusual interpretation of the Trade Description Act, are refusing to speak to the Press. When newspapers write about themselves, readers are entitled to roll their eyes.Political news, like the mass-production of pork bangers, is a manufacturing process best conducted away from the view of consumers. Not unless you want to turn the whole country vegan.I’ve been in newspapers since the mid-s, much of the time at Westminster, and have met drunkards, liars, gropers, cheats — and that was just the religious-affairs writers. Don’t let’s pretend journalism or politics attracts innocent hayseeds. Which makes the over-reacting on both sides of the ide in recent days so ridiculous.Creative tension between reporters and politicians’ media handlers is a healthy thing, but the system has suddenly snapped. This follows a general election in which it sometimes felt as though the media, particularly broadcasters, niggled Boris Johnson more effectively than Jeremy Corbyn did.When Boris won a thumping majority, his aides may have thought: “Right, now we can exact revenge on our media tormentors.” If so, they are foolish and unprofessional.First, they started mucking about with the daily briefings to the Westminster press lobby, the club of accredited journalists who report on politics.Then, on Monday, they tried to bar some members of that lobby from a briefing by David Frost, Boris’s main adviser on the European trade negotiations. Some scribes were told they could attend, others were told they were barred.Downing Street claimed that the briefing was too specialised for general politics writers to appreciate. The reporters took a dferent view.They reckoned Downing Street strategist Dominic Cummings and his sidekick Lee Cain were trying to ide and rule, and to winnow out the journalistic troublemakers. In a rare moment of solidarity among hacks, the newshounds upped and left. Walkout!This squabble is now headline news. Urgent questions were raised in the Commons and many papers and broadcasters are protesting that the Government is trying to censor the free Press in a “sinister” way.They compare this tactic to Donald Trump’s denunciation of mainstream US media for spreading “fake news” . Sir Keir Starmer, would-be leader of the Labour Party, joined the outcry, siding with the journalists. We could have done without that slippery little bit of opportunism.The same Starmer boasted recently that he would refuse to talk to reporters from The Sun, presumably because this paper is not in his pocket.Attempts to neutralise awkward reporters are not exactly new. During the  election, as a scurvy political sketch writer, I was locked out of a Tony Blair campaign event in The Wrekin.Gordon Brown’s people stopped me attending a media event with the president of South Africa.Tory party cronies barred me from witnessing a leadership debate between David Cameron and David Davis in . In the last election, non-sympathetic journalists were not given access to Jeremy Corbyn’s battle bus. Mind you, we were lucky. As one Leftie reporter told me: “You couldn’t get on Corbyn’s bus but I couldn’t get OFF it!”Despite some of those historic precedents, the current “lobby war” is more problematic because it looks more concerted and because it comes at a time when traditional news sources are under challenge from the internet.Online news sites can be shady and unreliable. Traditional lobby journalists, for all their faults, are at least reasonably accountable.Both sides should cool it. The lobby should admit that its clique is unacceptably clubby for st-century politics. And Boris’s henchmen should drop the macho posturing. Why are they picking this fight at a time when the Government is so popular  Never a better time for it, they might say. They want to show who’s boss.You could compare their aggression to that of an inmate who on arrival in prison butts the first guy he meets in order to show other prisoners he’s a tough guy. In my experience, journalists respond badly to this approach.Look at the damage Tony Blair’s thuggish spokesman Alastair Campbell did to the government he served.It is not beyond the wit of ministers to palm favourable stories to selected journaliststhey so wish. But the central media unit at No should remember — as they have repeatedly told us — that they are “the people’s Government” and not merely the servants of Boris Johnson.Their juicy salaries come from the taxpayer and the taxpayer does not expect them to abuse their privileged position.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Their bosses make mind-boggling salaries.It’s payback time.Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick’s imaginative plan will cut prices for local first-time buyers by a third —  a huge dference.But the Government must ensure hundreds of thousands of affordable homes get built this way.Previous over-hyped initiatives have produced derisory numbers.Long-term we need a bonfire of planning restrictions,  more developers able to compete and far more houses built.Campaigners warned the new homes must not come at the expense of losing new social housing.Polly Neate, boss of Shelter, said: “The country desperately needs more low-cost homes which are genuinely affordable to those people struggling at the sharp end of the housing crisis.“But, instead of offering a route to building additional low cost homes, this policy simply puts at risk the social homes currently being built.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There is often hope where we may first see ­dficulty. You just have to look a bit harder sometimes.In Portpatrick, at Scotland’s bottom left corner, the harbour had fallen into miserable disrepair. A plan was hatched to stop the rot.A local hero organised a share issue for locals to raise the money to buy the harbour and restore the buildings around it. The village now has its pecker up again and the future looks bright.It’s a similar story on Anglesey. At Halen Mon a thriving family business draws water out of the Menai Strait, harvests the salt and sells it all over the world.Near there I met a woman called Sian Sykes who cared about those waters so much she paddle-boarded  miles around Anglesey picking out the plastic.Asthat wasn’t enough, she then paddled the whole coast of Wales doing exactly the same.But my favourite character round there is no longer with us. On the very western tip of Holy Island off Anglesey’s west coast, there is the South Stack lighthouse. It’s been saving sailors from watery deaths since .A hundred years ago, John Jones was its keeper and it was his great granddaughter Denise Shaw who took me up to the top of it.Denise showed me a photograph of her great-grandad sporting a magnicent moustache the seagulls must have coveted for their nests.He was no loner, though. Denise remembers her mum saying old great-gramps was a bit of a ladies’ man.And what a chat-up line he had at his disposal: “Do you want to come back to my place to see how bright my light is ”All four of the areas we’ve looked at for this series of Our Coast are around the Irish Sea. I had a brilliant time at Belfast docks where I joined the harbour pilots, whose work astounded me.It’s their job to bring the giant ships safely into port.I sort of assumed they did this by chugging out to meet them, lighting up a sign saying, “follow me” and gently leading them to their berths.Far from it. Round the clock, all year round, whatever the weather, they race out several miles to pull up alongside these huge vessels.Incredibly, a rope ladder is dropped over the side for the pilots to clamber aboard, make their way to the bridge, take over the controls and steer these monsters into tight spaces on the docks.The ship I boarded with them, somewhat terried, was carrying grain from Romania.As my man took the helm I asked the Polish skipper which country had the best harbour pilots. “You do,” he said, with feeling.Back across the Irish Sea, in Formby, north of Liverpool, I met Mike McComb in the £million place he’s built himself a stone’s throw from the sea.He has more bedrooms, bathrooms and children than I could count .His fortune could have bought him a lavish home anywhere in the world. But it was up here, along the endless beach, that back in the day he and his mates would come on their bikes from their tiny homes in Bootle.So, he tells me as we stand on the beach, lashed by rain and wind, you can keep St Tropez or Malibu. This coast, his coast, is where he’ll stay.The sea seems to be a magnet for the most memorable people, from Grace the crane engineer in Belfast Docks who played rugby for Ireland in three rugby world cups, to Sandy the tattooed pagan near Stranraer who says the sea’s our mother, and the Bulgarian dissident I chanced upon sitting in a hot tub ­surveying Liverpool from the deck of the Queen Mary .My grandad used to tell me that when you put your toe in the sea you’re connected with the whole world.With that in mind, I’ve enjoyed many a paddle this summer reflecting on the power and history of what our island nation is all about.And I urge you to do it, too.

But it saddened us all because it felt like this incredible human being would go on for ever.He headed the Douglas dynasty with a zest for le that put the rest of us to shame and was one of our final links to Hollywood’s golden age.Long before actors ostentatiously wore their hearts on their sleeves and made self-aggrandising speeches about the latest trendy cause, Kirk determinedly set out to do the right thing, regardless of any impact on his career.In the Fties, at the height of the Cold War, he stood up to a paranoid US government that considered anyone to the left of Genghis Khan a Soviet sympathiser.The McCarthy witchhunts ruined careers and wrecked lives, but Kirk dug in his heels and hired blacklisted writer Dalton Trumbo to work on Spartacus, which would become Kirk’s most famous movie.That took balls of steel.Kirk gave millions to charity and was a US Goodwill Ambassador, receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom from Jimmy Carter in .He experienced heartache with the death of his son Eric from an overdose and the jailing of grandson Cameron for drug offences.But even a near-fatal helicopter crash and a stroke couldn’t defeat Kirk.His son Michael — a superstar in his own right, of course — told me last year his dad worked out almost every day with a personal trainer and remained as sharp as a tack, keeping the whole extended family on their toes.I was lucky enough to interview Kirk back in my days with TV-am.The Beeb would fly them over from LA and put them up in a posh hotel.All we could offer was a hearty breakfast, plus the chance to talk about themselves and their new project for as long as they liked.There were no pesky managers and PRs to go through.Bette Davis, Burt Lancaster, Lauren Bacall and Sammy Davis Jnr all popped into our studio at the crack of sparrows, staying for the duration of the show.Kirk was here in , promoting Dance With The Devil, a racy novel that bore a passing resemblance to his extraordinary le story.After his Jewish parents escaped persecution in Russia, Kirk was born and raised in a poor area of New York.It is a real rags-to-riches tale. His dad actually worked as a rag-and-bone man.Kirk never forgot where he came from, which is perhaps why he became a champion for justice and a fairer society.He was a delight that morning and even laughed when the crew declared, “I’m Spartacus”, one after another in his honour — though he must have seen it done hundreds of times before.He was a also a much-loved husband, father, grandfather and great-grandfather.The Douglas clan will be in mourning but they can celebrate a le well lived.This weekend, I am on a Kirk Douglas marathon, starting with Paths Of Glory, before The Bad And The Beautul, Ace In The Hole, The Vikings, Lust For Le and, of course, Spartacus.Tomorrow’s Oscars will rightly honour him. We won’t see his like again.I WAS honoured to host The Millies this week.It is a wonderful event run by The Sun to salute our Armed Forces and give us all a chance to say a huge thank you.As always, there were astonishing stories of bravery, courage and self-sacrice.And as always, our lovely winners told me they were nothing special, just doing their job.I honestly don’t think they realise just how remarkable they are, or how much we owe them.One of my highlights was seeing -year-old Private Fin Doherty collect his award for inspiring others.Fin was just six when his paratrooper big brother JJ was killed in action in Afghanistan.Fin was determined to follow in JJ’s footsteps to honour his brother’s memory, and join the Parachute Regiment.He has been an outstanding addition and, in an emotional ceremony, was presented with JJ’s beret in December.Their mum Joyce admits she struggled with Fin’s decision to sign up, following the death of her eldest son.But she knew it was all Fin wanted – and she is so very proud of him.We honestly don’t deserve such an inspirational young man. But thank the Lord we have him on our side.NOTHING has changed. Phillip Schofield is exactly the same person he was before he felt the time was right to tell the world he’s gay.He’s still a loving father and husband and will still host his TV shows with consummate professionalism and skill.As Phillip said himself, you never know what people are struggling with every day and, for him, it was time to be honest with himself and everyone .I’m really glad that he has made the decision and very proud of him, although obviously it can’t have been easy.There’s been lots of tears, sleepless nights and a great deal of soul-searching. I hope he now finds peace of mind.He is a very lucky man to have a family and friends who love him very much and just want him to be happy.He also has a loyal fan base who love watching him on This Morning and that won’t change. Why would it Of course, he can expect a small number of bigots and homophobes to spew out hateful bile, but they are to be pitied and ignored.Those carping about why he took so long also need to shut up.People should be allowed to come out when it feels the right time for them.Phillip began his career at a time when being openly gay in a TV presenting role was just not an option.Thank goodness things have changed and he can be open now – and know that the overwhelmingly vast majority of us wish him and his family nothing but the very best.I was really touched by what he said about interviewing brave people on This Morning, and realising that he had to be just like them and tell his truth.Love comes in many dferent forms.Phillip and his we Stephanie adore each other and that won’t change. Again, why on earth would it At the end of his statement Phillip urged us all to be kind, especially to his family, and I hope we all take those words on board.Let’s wish them all the best and let them get on with their lives.WHAT a furore over a bare shoulder. Actress-turned-MP Tracy Brabin didn’t deserve the vitriol about her outfit but it WAS distracting.It’s unfortunate because Tracy was making important points about journalists being shut out of No  briefings – a move that makes my blood run cold and threatens Press freedom. Sadly, no one was really listening.Tracy told me she had been at a music event and didn’t expect to be back in the House. She is bemused by all the fuss.How those in public le dress should not detract from their message, be it a female MP in a low-cut top or mini-skirt, or a man wearing a gaudy tie or tight trousers.Our MPs are not known for their style and rarely make headlines for their fashion sense.I am very happy for them to keep it that way.WELL, that was a rather ill-advised memo to send, reminding local councils to fly the Union Flag on February  as a “celebration” of Prince Andrew’s birthday.I had no idea this was a “thing” and that Andrew was on a list of VIPs whose birthdays are marked with a flag waving on the roof of our town halls, instead of just cake and prosecco like the rest of us.Unsurprisingly, this ludicrous edict has caused much disgruntlement.As we know, Andrew has been booted out of The Firm by his own mum after that disastrous TV interview delving into his friendship with the American paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.Then there is the ongoing scandal over whether or not Andrew will be interviewed by the FBI as part of its investigations into child trafficking allegations against Epstein.It is all very sordid and murky. Surely even his nearest and dearest would agree this is not the time for official celebrations.He is no longer a working royal and has no place on that list.Time to lower the flags for good. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She doesn’t know how to use apostrophes.”It turns out, however, that while she can’t write properly, she can at least think straight because she never did speak out. Which means she stopped the story from rearing up again.If only Prince Andrew was as bright. We were all dimly aware that he knew a man in America who’d had lots of sex with young girls.And that one day, this man had been found dead in a police cell. Then we went back to wonderingwe needed more washing-up liquid.Prince Andrew, however, decided that instead of letting the story die down by not saying anything, he’d go on television to set the record straight.It was a disaster. He was suddenly front-page news all over the world and he looked guilty as hell.Of what, we weren’t sure. But whatever it was, we all worked out that as he has a Bentley, he could definitely have got from a Pizza Express restaurant in Woking to the centre of London in less than six hours.A few weeks later, as the story was withering once more, Hank J Dieselburger, an American prosecutor involved in the dead sex-man’s case, announced that the FBI had received “zero co-operation” from Prince Andrew.You’d think Andrew would have learned from his earlier mistake.

The very next day, “friends” of the Prince — which is another way of saying “the Prince” — went on the attack, telling reporters he was angry and bewildered. “They haven’t even approached me — I mean him.”The problem is that ego-fed celebrities read every single thing that is written about them.

But I’m not one of the murderers.When the time comes for my annual clothes shopping trip, I simply head to the Levi’s store on Regent Street in London, point at the label on the back of the jeans I’m wearing and ask for three more pairs just the same.I love Levi’s.

But there was still a lot of “police aware” tape fluttering about in the breeze.So I called the nearest station, which was approximately  miles away, as I needed to contact the driver to talk about insurance. Sadly, however, while the police are “aware” of the incident, they are not prepared to give me any details.Mustn’t grumble, though.

Expected progress is charted according to their results at the end of primary school.The results are amalgamated, and schools are then bracketed into five bands ranging from well above average to well below average.This method is being used for the fourth year running and is a long way from the days of top and bottom school performers based solely on raw results.For school results in your area, visit the Department of Education website."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus spread diarrhoea medics eyes","story":"It comes as medical experts have warned the virus can also spread through the eyes and people - especially doctors - should do more to protect themselves.So far  people have died and nearly , cases discovered after the disease broke out in the Chinese city of Wuhan.The primary path for coronavirus transmission is believed to be virus-laden droplets from an infected person’s cough.But researchers say early studies focused heavily on patients with respiratory symptoms and may have overlooked those linked to the digestive tract.A total of  out of  patients in a Wuhan hospital initially presented with diarrhoea and nausea one or two days prior to development of fever and laboured breathing.The first US patient diagnosed also experienced loose bowel movements for two days and the virus was subsequently detected in his stool, and there have been other documented cases in China.The new research was undertaken by Chinese authors and published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.William Keevil, a professor of environmental healthcare at the University of Southampton, said reports on the virus when it first appeared suggested a “faecal transmission route”.Faecal transmission of SARS was implicated in sickening hundreds in Hong Kong’s Amoy Gardens housing estate in . px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   DD-COMP-MAP-th-FEB.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   DD-COMP-MAP-th-FEB.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   DD-COMP-MAP-th-FEB.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   DD-COMP-MAP-th-FEB.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   DD-COMP-MAP-th-FEB.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   DD-COMP-MAP-th-FEB.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   DD-COMP-MAP-th-FEB.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   DD-COMP-MAP-th-FEB.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   DD-COMP-MAP-th-FEB.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   DD-COMP-MAP-th-FEB.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   DD-COMP-MAP-th-FEB.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   DD-COMP-MAP-th-FEB.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   DD-COMP-MAP-th-FEB.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" Benjamin Neuman, a virology expert at Texas AM University-Texarkana said  faecal transmission was “certainly worth considering”.But he said “droplets and touching contaminated surfaces then rubbing eyes, nose or mouth” were likely the main way the virus was transmitted based on current data.Meanwhile a report in - fulltext dgcidraven_jbs_etoc_email\"The Lancet says Chinese pneumonia expert Guangfa Wang was infected by the coronavirus while visiting Wuhan last month.He wore a face mask during his visit, but did not wear any protective eyewear and later complained of “redness of the eyes”.“Unprotected exposure of the eyes in the Wuhan Fever Clinic might have allowed the virus to infect the body.”The report noted that SARS – another type of coronavirus – also spread via the “mucous membranes in the eyes, mouth or nose”.It says doctors, some of whom have been working exhausting hours to battle the disease, should protect themselves.“All ophthalmologists examining suspected cases should wear protective eyewear,” it said.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Because very often it sure as hell ain’t the product.Last Saturday, the most read piece on the BBC news homepage was a clickbait “story” — taken from Twitter — about how Kim Kardashian eats chicken nuggets.Yes, you read that right. With £.billion of your money to its name, one of the most popular “stories” on the BBC’s news website was an item which didn’t cost a penny to make, wasn’t news and stretched the definition of “public service” far beyond breaking point. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg.James Purnell — a particularly puffed-up BBC exec — announced  months ago that he and his Radio  Education team would be expanding into podcasts. He stayed horribly true to his word.In , Auntie produces podcasts on everything from football and Love Island to what Towie star Gemma ­Collins’ latest musings are, which — thanks to the big names at the helm — are ­raking in listeners.For Purnell, this is something to be celebrated. Successful podcasts presumably mean more money in his already overstuffed pockets.But for the hundreds of private podcast makers out there, it spells the beginning of the end. Competing with a company which uses public funds to net the likes of Peter Crouch is nigh-on impossible.How, I ask you, can a state broadcaster justy putting hard-working private firms out of business Yes, Ollie Williams discussing his shock exit from the Love Island villamight be entertaining, but what ­“service” is it providing the public Can the BBC — which doesn’t make Love Island — really do a better job of a Love Island podcast than ITV, which does You’d think the BBC top dogs, who are desperate to cling on to the Royal Charter, would be asking these vital questions too.But in their desperate quest for “yoof” audiences, they’ve chucked their critical faculties out of the window.And it’s all for nothing. Because the quest is a wild goose chase. According to the latest Ofcom report, most kids don’t watch ANY linear TV.So the BBC is defending a dying, analogue means of ­communication. But no one in the corporation can bear to face this unwelcome reality.So instead of cutting their own whopping salaries, they scrap well-known and well- respected current affairs ­programmes such as the ­Victoria Derbyshire show.Why  Because the more ­visible the cut, the easier it is for luvvies to pretend that the BBC is the blameless ­victim of evil Tory austerity.Nothing, of course, could be further from the truth. In fact,anything, it is the Tories and their tens of ­millions of voters who are ­victims of the BBC.The repeated Horrible Histories ­“comedy” — which mockingly undermined the existence of “British things” — and the ­ludicrously PC recent East-Enders storyline, in which a deranged killer embraces Islam and becomes a hero, are the latest in a long line of ultra- liberal BBC content seemingly designed to rub ordinary, ­patriotic Brits up the wrong way.Things can’t go on like this. If the state broadcaster is to survive, there must be an urgent and fundamental rethink.First, the BBC’s parasitical website must be shut down. The stories it features are mostly dross, or  adapted from newspaper reports.To list just one example, when Brits want to know what’s happening with Megxit, they can buy The Sun — which was responsible for the scoop in the first place.If the BBC wants a web presencethey can use it to broadcast News . Next, the salaries of fat cat managers and C-list celebs must be slashed.Then the corporation must think hard about its media offering. BBC and its often extremely niche arts offering should be folded into BBC.Radio  and , with content already well covered by ­commercial markets, must be shut down. As must every ­programme across BBC ­channels which is designed to damage ITV’s ­ratings.And of course Brits should not be punished for refusing to pay a licence fee for a service they may not use.Decriminalising it — as Boris Johnson is understood to be seriously ­considering — is the right thing to do.If Auntie can swallow a big slice of humble pie, accept her glory days are over and slim right down to size, she may have a future.

The Mirror has spent a week speaking to people behind the scenes, who work day in and day out to put the party into power, about what went wrong in Decemberaposs election.Speaking anonymously they warn of a ided party - with figures from both the left and right saying Labour faces an uphill battle to win in .Staff repeatedly shared concerns about a failure to tackle anti-Semitism and an obsession with political purity that gripped the party from the leadership down. One party adviser warned: The public donapost care about aposismsapos and ideologies, they want us to explain how we can fix their lives in a clear way that they can see being implemented. If we donapost stop acting like a lecture on economic theory we deserve to lose every seat we lost to the Tories forever. An ex-McDonnell staff member said they succeeded in doing a lot of work in making the radical look like the only reasonable answer but squandered that progress with infighting.For one MPaposs staff member the defeat was a clear consequence of Jeremy Corbyn and his record. They told the Mirror: People want to know why we ignored them, why we doubled down on a man to lead us who was, in their eyes, unfit to lead the country. The isions in the party are deep - and show no sign of softening as the race to pick Mr Cobynaposs successor picks up. One former confidant of Mr Corbyn said the next leader needed to double down on being the outsider to take the party back to power - eventhat comes at the expense of annoying some of his most loyal allies, Labouraposs left-wing trade unions. He said: When we sided with old politics of the machine left, which we did again and again from  onwards, we lost. Why  Because we became less special and more like every other politician wrestling in the grime for power. Our next leader needs to recognise we win when we look dferent from the rest of the political class.  But for other the challenges are more parochial, they say that the turmoil of the last few years has seen a brain drain, with decisions made badly or for the wrong reasons. A staff member in Labouraposs HQ said the next leader needed to less politicalLabour was to win. She added: That seems counter-intuitive, but at the last election, we lost seats we could have won because we were trying to defend political allies of the leadership, or a political reading of the electoral map, that wasnapost matched up by the data. We clawed an acceptable performance back in  by putting resources where they were needed not where the Leaderaposs team wanted them to be needed. You can read the Labour insiders anonymous verdicts below. Former staff member for Jeremy Corbyn We set out a pretty radical vision in  but didnapost win the argument for it. We had a choice, double down with something more radical or try and win the argument around our popular policies from the last election. We choose the first, made some bold offers - but in the end, it was too much and we werenapost believed. The next leader canapost just jettison everything weaposve done to make the arguments for socialism - but now we need to win them.  Community Organiser We made a lot of progress when we connected what we cared about in Parliament to the lives of actual people. Not MPs telling people what their problems were, but working with communities to solve things they raised with us. Politics needs to become more people focused, and I worry that all the candidates see the answers to our current problems in machine politics. Iaposm voting for Rebecca Long-Bailey. Labour MP researcher People are angry at us. Where I work in the North, people want to know why we ignored them, why we doubled down on a man to lead us who was, in their eyes, unfit to lead the country. The public donapost care about aposismsapos and ideologies, they want us to explain how we can fix their lives in a clear way that they can see being implemented. If we donapost stop acting like a seminar on economic theory we deserve to lose every seat we lost to the Tories forever. Iaposm voting for Lisa Nandy. Former staff member for John McDonnell We won arguments around austerity - but couldnapost convince people that we were the best party to implement them. In the face of a mostly hostile media, we did a lot of work in making the radical look like the only reasonable answer. That is because after a decade of austerity, it is. But we sold that down the river by letting people engage in fights about fringe issues of internal party management and not stamping out racism in our movement. Iaposm voting for Rebecca Long-Bailey. Senior Organiser Under Jeremy, Karieand Jennieexperienced staff have been forced from their jobs leaving the party desperately lacking in skills, experience and institutional knowledge at manager and senior manager level. If we are to stand any chance of becoming a competitive party again, we have to fix this. Any new team has to have a clear out of HQ and some regions and bring in people who know how to get the job done. Otherwise, we are doomed to fail before we start.

In the UK, three million people say they are under strain in their relationships, according to Relate. And a third of married men and women who split say the reason for their orce was just “growing apart”. According to a UCL study, the most common reason for a marriage breaking down is the couple having problems with ­communication. But according to French love guru Fred Sirieix, the charming maitre d’ in Channel ’s First Dates, there are plenty of ways you can keep a long-term ­relationship on track. Fred gives Sunday Mirror readers some tips on how to maintain the spark: Go out every week At the beginning of a relationship, dates are the norm. But going out all the time is not sustainable, and eventually you’ve swapped swanky restaurants for nights on the sofa. But Fred says one night each week should be a dedicated “date night”. He says: “Having a date night a week is always a good idea – whether it’s going out for something to eat or just popping out to the pub for a pint, going to a restaurant or even going for a stroll. “Finding some ‘us’ time once a week, away from all the stresses of le, is vital.”  Be thoughtful Fred says an important way to keep that romantic connection in your relationship is to surprise your partner. “I just bought some flowers for my own partner,” he says.“I put them on Instagram and captioned them that they were flowers for her, so she saw them once on social media and then when she got home.“When she saw them, she called me straightaway – she got the pleasure twice!” He saysyou do little things like that, you are likely to get the magic back.  Move firstFred says he feels one of the main mistakes we make in relationships is waiting for the other person to make thefirst move or take responsibilitysomething is going wrong.He suggests that being the first to communicate a problem, along with a suggested solution, is best for both parties. “It’s about responsibility – and making the first step,” he says. “Show that you care, show you love them. Give it first and give it with generosity.” "},{"url":null,"title":"kate middleton earns herself impressive","story":"NewsKate Middleton earns herself impressive new nickname - inspired by Princess DianaKate Middletons fans have come up with a new unofficial title for the Duchess, and its very, very sweetShareCommentsByZoe ForseyLestyle Editor:,  FEB NewsShe gets involved in whatever theyre doing \" to FREE daily email alerts from Mirror - Royal FamilySubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Judi says: “It has been a perfect storm for the Royal Family lately but Kate has now taken on the biggest power position in the entire Firm. “She’s the new matriarch because while the Queen is strong, she’s getting older and needs that kind of support from someone she can trust.” Kate has come a long way from the shy, -year-old student who first caught William’s eye during a university fashion show in . Since marrying in to the Royal Family in April , Kate has often seemed uncomfortable in the glare of the public eye.  “In the early days, she would hide herself in William’s shadow, but it was clear from her appearance at the Baftas that all of that has totally changed,” says Judi. “She’s not remotely dependent on him any more.” However, Judi thinks that Kate’s newfound confidence has had a positive impact on Wills, too. “Seeing them hold court with superstars, it was obvious they have shted into real power couple mode. “It’s ironic, as that’s the path Harry and Meghan were meant to take, but Kate looks incredibly at ease in this new role.  The drama surrounding ‘Megxit’ – which saw Harry, , and Meghan, , controversially renounce their official duties – appears to have been the defining moment in Kate’s rise to the top of the Windsor tree.Judi says: “She’s been supporting William and acting as a mediatorduring all the recent arguments. “By playing out these complicated roles so perfectly, she has provedherself to be the royals’ big saviour.”Royal expert and author Ingrid Seward believes that the Queen, , is hugely grateful to Kate for stepping up. “She’s delighted with her,” she says.  “The Queen is very reliant on Kate because she’s so stable – and she’s simply untouchable in everything she does at the moment.” Although Ingrid does not believe Kate ever felt threatened by Meghan joining the family, she adds: “The recent fall-out between Harry and William would have been draining for her, so she’s probably feeling a huge weight off her shoulders that she doesn’t have to worry about Meghan’s influence any more.” Kate’s priorities may also be changing now that her and William’s children – George, six, Charlotte, four, and Louis, two in April – are becoming slightly more independent. “Charlotte and George are at school now, so she has more time on her hands,” Ingrid says.  “That means she can do more of what she really enjoys – and we saw that with the garden she designed at last year’s Cha Flower Show. “In earlier years, she always had to toe the line. Now she can pursue her own interests more freely.”  Kate’s popularity with the British public seems to have rebooted her sense of style, too. Ingrid says: “She used to be so careful, wearing little dresses and nude heels with everything, but she’s much less mumsy these days.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailThree words sum up the key to happiness for the hordes of kids taken in by foster mum Andy Hider... chaos, mess and, above all, laughter. With three kids of her own and a marriage split behind her, this extraordinary woman welcomed more than  needy youngsters into her family over  years. She had to find extra space in her home – but there was always enough room in her heart. There have been tough times, bad times, sad times – but overwhelmingly good times. Andy, , says of her remarkable le: “I wouldn’t swap it for winning the Lottery.” And on March  she will be at Buckingham Palace to receive the MBE for her services. Bristol-based Andy’s story is all the more remarkable in that she fell into fostering by chance. It was while visiting a library with her boys Adam, Ben and George, then , seven and two, that fate played its hand. Andy – who had no job and was strapped for cash – says: “I was browsing in the library when a bookmark fell on the floor. “I bent over to pick it up and saw an advert on the back asking for foster parents who could care for kids with challenging behaviour. Unlike in the past, the local authority didn’t just cover maintenance costs, there was a fee involved too, so I thought there’d be no harm going to the introductory meeting to check it out.”  With approval from her two older boys and support from a social worker, she began the assessment process. Six months later she welcomed her first foster child. Andy soon realised how steep the learning curve would be. She says: “I remember saying to my first foster son that he could bring his friends over, because that’s what I would have said to my own sons. Before I knew it, a big group of strangers was in my front room seeing who could spit the furthest!” After a bumpy start, Andy found her stride – taking a laid-back approach which allowed often troubled kids to feel at ease.  Since  Andy has specialised in long-term placements, with ages ranging from  to . She continues: “We stopped counting at around  – I moved from one local authority to another local authority, and then to a specialist fostering agency, so nobody was keeping track. “Our latest tally indicates it’s over , but the figure isn’t that important to me.” At first Andy could only foster three children at her house in Keynsham near Bristol. So she split one double bedroom into two, had her loft converted and extended at the back so she could accommodate five at once. For over three decades she says her house was “iniably full – of kids, chaos, mess and laughter”.But Andy insists she never believed in laying down too many rules. That way, she says, thereare fewer to break. She explains: “The rules I set are based around safety, I say no drinking or drugs and I insist on respect for everyone  in the house. “Some of the children throw everything they’ve got at you, but I don’t give up. “I’m tenacious and I like ­teenagers because I remember being one. I remember feeling like the rest of the world was against me – so I can identy with that. There was one girl whose boyfriend was using drugs. I tried to persuade her not to go out with him, but she did. “When she came home that night I told her we needed to talk. “I started to cry with concern for her welfare. She told me no one had ever cared enough about her before to cry and she said she’d never do it again. And she never did. She now has four wonderful children of her own.”  Two years ago, Andy gave away one of her ex-foster kids, Gary, at his wedding in Portugal. He had had  foster and kids’ home placements before she took him in. She says: “He was  when he came to me and stayed until he was . “To see him a happy, confident adult is amazing. I never feel sad when I say goodbye, I feel proud to have done my part and know we’ll always be close.” In  Andy was part of a BBC documentary with Men Behaving Badly actor Neil Morrissey, who spent much of his childhood in foster care. “Neil was so kind and so good with the kids,” Andy says. “It was also great for them – and anyone who saw the show – to see how foster care can be a huge positive, how you can make a success of your le like Neil had.”  She and the actor keep in touch and he even gave his number to her foster children, saying they could call. Andy says Neil “was the best ever advert for fostering”. She also says her own kids have prospered from the fostering experience, adding: “Adam, Ben and George have had to share me with other, much more demanding children – and witness their mum being threatened and abused. “But it taught them to be kind and understand how lucky they are. We became a team and I believe our ­experience enabled them to become more understanding, caring adults.” She recalls one of her foster children who moved out at  and went to London. “He called me askingI could help with spare clothes, some money and some cigarettes,” she says. “I called George, who was then living on the other side of London, and he got in his car to drive round to help out. We’ve all learned to put others’ needs ahead of our own.” "},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather forecast flights ferries","story":"NewsUK weather forecast: Hundreds of flights cancelled as Storm Ciara hits with mph windsThe Met Office has issued yellow and amber wind warnings for tomorrow as Storm Ciara causes chaos across the UK, closing bridges and delaying flights at Gatwick and Heathrow airportsShareCommentsByLucinda CameronMatthew Dresch:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video uk-braces-arrival-storm-ciara-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news uk-weather-forecast-flights-ferries-\"\" to FREE daily email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Forecasters have warned there could be delays or cancellations to air, ferry and train services, damage to buildings and a chance of power cuts caused by wild weather conditions. Storm Ciara was named by the Met Office on Wednesday and is moving eastwards towards the UK and Ireland. Drivers are being warned to take extra care on the roads due to the potential of dficult conditions caused by heavy rain, particularly on coastal or exposed routes. Network Rail and train operators in England issued an alert to passengers, which read: Only travel by train this Sundayabsolutely necessary, with warnings of reduced timetables amid speed restrictions. And a number of airlines including British Airways and easyJet are advising passengers due to fly this weekend to check the status of their flights before heading off due to possible delays. A number of ferry operators have also warned of potential disruption on Saturday and Sunday. CalMac, which runs services in Scotland, says the weather is aposlooking extremely problematic as far as delivering a scheduled timetable while Irish Ferries has said passengers should check timetables for any changes before travelling. Rail disruption could continue into Monday morning as repair work may be hampered by the conditions. Passengers are urged to check for updates before they travel. Strong winds have the potential to damage overhead electric wires and tracks due to debris or trees falling onto the railway.  Yellow warnings of wind have been issued for northwestern parts of the UK on Saturday. On Sunday, a yellow warning of wind covers the entire country, while an amber warning has been issued for south-east England. Met Office chief meteorologist Frank Saunders said: Storm Ciara will bring damaging winds and heavy rain across the UK this weekend and we have issued a range of severe weather warnings giving people time to prepare for potential impacts of the storm. Winds will increase through Saturday across Northern Ireland, Scotland, northern England and Wales, before turning very windy across the rest of UK through the early hours of Sunday morning. Gusts of -mph are expected quite widely across inland areas, with even stronger gusts of mph or higher along coastal areas, especially in south-east England and northern Scotland.

The animal, roughly the size of a small dog, is thought to have washed up in Melton Peter Demetre Park, near the US city of Charleston, South Carolina.Photos taken by Erika Constantine while she was walking her dog show that the creature has been almost reduced to bone, the Daily Star reports.“I take my dog, River, there very frequently,” said the -year-old from Jermyn, Pennsylvania. “We were just strolling and she went up to it. “I saw her picking at something with her nose and that’s what made me walk over there because she only does thatsomething is dead, orsomething interesting to her is over there. “I honestly did not know what it was. “It was the size of a small dog but the structure of the whole thing suggests it’s definitely not a dog. “I have lived here for about five years and I have never come across something like this.” Searching for answers about the identity of the beast, Miss Constantine published the photos online and got many dferent answers. “I thought somebody would be like, ‘oh, it’s like a seal’ and then I would go about my day but it stumped a lot of people,” she said. “There are so many theories as to what it is – the cops said it was a possum, it’s definitely not a possum. People were saying it’s a dog, people were saying it’s an iguana.  “Somebody said it was a bobcat which was interesting because they do have similar ribcages.” Other people suggested it could be the mythical chupacabra, a legendary creature that attacks animals and consumes their blood. The dog walker sent her photos to a professor at the College of Charleston hoping to have the mystery creature identied, but she is yet to receive a response. Miss Costantine thinks the creature might come from a secret island overrun by monkeys nearly  miles away. “It’s technically called Morgan Island but it’s nicknamed Monkey Island,” she said. “It’s not inhabited by humans, it’s all monkeys. That’s where all the monkeys that the government tested on live. “I think one of the monkeys from Monkey Island unfortunately might have got swept up in a current, the rip tide or whatever and then it made its way to Charleston.  “It wouldn’t really be the first time, my friend actually found a monkey fossil on the beach a while back, so I think it just kinda got washed up here .“Whenever I go to the beach, I always keep my eyes peeled for something cool because you never know what’s going to wash up.”The monkey population on Morgan Island has grown to nearly , after , specimens were shipped there in , CHStoday reports."},{"url":null,"title":"new images kobe bryant helicopter","story":"NewsNew images of Kobe Bryant helicopter moments before tragic crash releasedInvestigators from the National Transportation Safety Board said low visibility and foggy weather would be a key focus to find out the reasons that have caused the fatal crash after they ruled out engine failureShareCommentsByTfany Lo:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror sport other-sports american-sports video last-time-kobe-bryants-helicopter-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news us-news new-images-kobe-bryant-helicopter-\"\" to FREE daily email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters. Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailInvestigators looking into the helicopter crash that killed Kobe Bryant and his daughter Gianna say there is no evidence of a aposcatastrophic internal failureapos. The interim report issued by the National Transportation Safety Board days after the accident also said examination of both rotor assemblies found damage consistent with powered rotation at the time of impact. The preliminary findings pointed to no obvious signs of mechanical problems that may have contributed to the fiery crash on January . New images have been released by the NTSB which show the doomed helicopter moments before the crash that killed everyone on board. The death of Bryant, an -time all-star in the National Basketball Association and one of the worldaposs most admired sports figures, prompted an outpouring of shock and grief from fans and fellow athletes around the globe. The retired Los Angeles Lakers forward had been on his way to a youth basketball tournament in which he was coaching and his daughter and two other girls aboard the luxury chopper were due to compete. The report did not rule out that mechanical issues might yet be identied when the engines and other parts recovered from the wreckage of the Sikorsky S-B are disassembled and more closely examined. NTSB board member Jenner Homendy said two days after the tragedy that clouds, fog and limited visibility reported in the vicinity of the crash would be a key focus of the investigation. Videos and photographs taken by the public in the area depict fog and low clouds obscuring the hilltops around the crash site, including security video footage showing the helicopter disappearing into clouds moments before it went down, according to the report.  The NTSB also quoted a witness from a mountain bike trail in foothills surrounded by mist who recounted briefly glimpsing the helicopter emerging from clouds as it rolled to the left before crashing seconds later a short distance away from him. The pilot, an experienced aviator certied as an instructor, was navigating by visual orientation, not by instrument guidance, during the entirety of the ill-fated flight, the NTSB said. While he was licensed to fly by instruments, the charter company that owned the chopper, Island Express Helicopters, was only permitted to fly by visual flight rules when carrying paying passengers, the report said. Robert Clford, a Chicago-based aviation disaster lawyer, said flying a helicopter in low visibility is ill-advised without two pilots, evennavigating by instruments.  An experienced but nevertheless single pilot in bad weather is a bad formula for the safe operation of a helicopter, he told Reuters. Shortly before radar contact with Bryantaposs helicopter was lost, the pilot had told air traffic control he was trying to climb above a cloud layer, the NTSB said. Moments later the aircraft banked to the left and began to descend, slamming into the ground at more  miles per hourand bursting into flames.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA woman has claimed stress caused her to develop a condition that left her paralysed from the neck down. Courtney Runyon, , had a busy le of working, travelling and fitness when the disease left her in a nursing home for over three months. The former duct iron pipe manufacturer from Dallas, USA, began to lose feeling in her arms and legs but could not let go of her hectic lestyle. She continued her job in Las Vegas for six months and travelled through dferent states every week for work whilst losing more feeling in her limbs. When doctors in Nevada kept testing her for amyotrophic lateral sclerosisand multiple sclerosiswithout a diagnosis, she decided to see a specialist five hours away in Arizona. At The Mayo Clinic, Courtney received the news that she had chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy , a condition affecting one to eight of every , people. I was telling the Las Vegas doctors, aposyou donapost understand, every day I lt my arms up from my side, I can visibly see myself lting my arm up less and less, Courtney said. It was sort of a relief to be diagnosed with CIDP because at that point it was narrowed down to three neurological-related illnesses. ALS, with which you can die in two to ten years and Lyme disease where itaposs so unpredictable and dficult to put into remission. CIDP was the least severe of the three. CIDP is the chronic form of Guillain-Barre syndrome. Your nerves inflame and your immune system attacks your peripheral nerves which are in your face, arms, legs, throat, internal organs, and skin. One of the more common causes Iaposve heard from others with CIDP is the flu shot or a vaccination, but for me it was triggered by two stressful weeks in December  and I started to show symptoms two weeks later in February of .  One of the first things that I really had problems with was having a shower. I couldnapost lt my hands all the way up to my head so I would bend over to wash my hair but when Iaposd get out, the towel was way too heavy so my ex-boyfriend would have to dry me off. It got to the point where in August , I was going to a wedding in Mexico and I was getting coffee but I couldnapost open my wallet and I couldnapost get my credit card out my friend had to help me and I remember just breaking down crying in the airport. At the wedding dinner I can just remember I couldnapost get the fork up to my mouth. So I would get it on the fork and rest my hand on the table and then I would bend my head down and bite off the fork on the table being held by the weight of my hand.  Two weeks later I went on disability because I couldnapost speak. You had to be right next to me because it sounded like a scratchy whisper. I couldnapost talk to text, and when I was typing on the computer, I would throw my arms up onto the computer because I couldnapost lt them to put them up there and then I was trying to type but then I couldnapost move my wrists and my hands so then I started using my nose. I still thought it was just one of those things I thought would go away and get better, but I would go through all my testing and go on an autoimmune protocol diet for sixty days. I was thinking I was doing everything I needed to do. You just donapost think that you are going to become one of those people that this happens to.  But it came to the point where I was mentally adjusting and realising that I am one of those people and I canapost work. The immune system is thought to cause damage to the myelin sheath of the peripheral nervous system, often affecting the arms and legs first. I couldnapost close my throat all the way so when I drank liquids, I choked on them. They would just leak in my windpipes, she said. What sucked more was I couldnapost flex my stomach to cough it out so I would just be breathing the liquids without being able to cough them out and I couldnapost sneeze either. It was not my best look.  I had lost all my muscle, so the skin between the bone and the bed felt like sticking your finger in a car door. The day after Thanksgiving of , I had to move back to Texas. The nursing home discharged me because I was getting worse and insurance wouldnapost let me stay there anymore. After staying in two hospitals and three nursing homes for a total of  days, Courtney moved back in with parents Renee and Bob in time for Christmas. I went back home and that felt like defeat to the point I was dependent, but I still felt independent. I felt like Iaposd failed Iaposm having to go to live with my parents in full-time care, she said.But once I got there that was exactly where I shouldaposve been for sure my family is amazing they were so supportive, loving and relaxing, I shouldaposve gone there sooner, it was all so wonderful. I love the phrase, aposyou canapost heal in the same environment that made you sickapos. I had to leave Las Vegas - it was crazy there. I quit my job. I loved my ex-boyfriend, but he wasnapost helping at the time. If there are things that are stressing you out, youaposre not going to get well in the way you want to until you get rid of them.  My mother told me her early thirties were her favourite and here I was paralysed from the neck down in my early thirties. When something happens to someone, it is not necessarily the tragedy that makes it sad. Itaposs how that personaposs le was ruined and how the person responds to it that is sad. So, I thought how can I love these years of my le  Instead of going to physical therapy twice a week how about I go to a yoga and physical therapy retreat by the beach  Sometimes when I was in the hospital when I got uncomfortable like hair in my face that I couldnapost move, I would close my eyes and picture myself on a beach in a red dress.So, my friends threw me a surprise party after hospital and got me that red dress I always pictured so I could do that. I was just really trying to put focus on what I could do now that I couldnapost before. Which is why I filmed myself in the hospital in a wheelchair wearing fun costumes or why I went travelling even though I had to ask strangers to tie up my hair.

Two schools, where the child is believed to have spent time, have been temporarily closed near the ski resort where the child was staying.

The group of  includes a nine-year-old child who recently spent time in a school in Contamines - a mountain village of which he was a also resident - as well as in another establishment where he attended French lessons, regional health official Jean-Yves Grall told a televised news conference.

Health Minister Agnes Buzyn said a UK citizen recently arrived on a flight from Singapore and had been in contact with  people at the chalet in the Haute-Savoie Alpine region of south-eastern France. All  were admitted to hospital as a precaution, and four adults and a child were found to be infected with the flu-like virus. Ms Buzyn said the unnamed patients were in a stable condition and they were being monitored constantly. She added: Their clinical condition shows no sign of seriousness.

Alan Steele, from Wolverhampton, was moved to hospital on Friday while his we Wendy Marshall Steele remained trapped on board the Diamond Princess at a port in Yokohama, Japan. Mrs Marshall Steele, , said on Saturday her husband told her he will be retested in  hours andhe tests negative twice he will be released. Mr Steele, , revealed he is in an isolation room and he has become the hospitalaposs lab rat while undergoing tests and observation, leaving his doctor confused because he has shown no symptoms so far. Are you on board the ship  Email webnews@mirror. The ship has been isolated with  people having been taken to hospitals after testing positive for the SARS-like virus. Mr Steele wrote on Facebook message posted at about am local time on Saturday: I am in a isolation room and have become their lab rat as doctor confused as I have no symptoms and tests all say I am healthy apart from having virus. His we, who has not tested positive for the virus, wrote later: Just spoken to Alan. He will be retested in hrs. If he passes the test twice then he can go. Question is where  He canapost come back on ship, so who knows when we will get to see each other or which country.  Mrs Marshall Steele, a nurse, and the rest of the , passengers and crew are in a -day quarantine and will not be allowed to disembark until February  at the earliest. In an earlier post, she wrote: It was a hard first night without Alan. But hey. We are constantly in touch. Japanese doctors are excellent and he is in safe hands. Thank you all again. Mrs Marshall Steele said she was also well but had cabin fever as she continued to be confined to her room on the ship, where she will turn  on Tuesday. The newlyweds were due to fly back to Britain this week so Mr Steele could start a new job as a driver on Monday.  They had spent days confined to their cabin before Mr Steele tested positive for the flu-like virus, which has killed more than  people in China, where the outbreak began in the city of Wuhan in December. The ship was put in quarantine on Monday after an -year-old Hong Kong man, who disembarked the ship last month, was diagnosed, A total of  British passport holders - including crew - were among those who boarded the ship. David Abel, a friend of Mr Steele who is also a passenger on the ship, said Wendy is missing her husband a great deal but said they are in regular contact.  He told BBC Breakfast: Alanaposs been in touch with me a couple of times today. If all goes well, heaposs being tested again in a couple of daysapos time, andhe is clear they will test him again  hours later andhe still remains clear he will be released from the hospital. But whereaposs he going to go  He will not be allowed back on board the ship. Mr Abel said he thinks the process of quarantining is essentially important, but added: I wish the UK government would send out a ship or a huge plane and bring us to the UK. I would far sooner be in the UK under a better controlled environment than being on board the ship, to tell you the truth.  The shipaposs operator, Princess Cruises, said the vesselaposs quarantine was due to end on February , barring unforeseen developments, and confirmed all affected guests were being taken to hospitals. Passengers now have access to mental health counselling and enhanced internet access. Meanwhile, five members of a British family have tested positive for coronavirus during a holiday in the French Alps. They were infected by a relative who caught the bug in Singapore between January  and  and then met them at a chalet in Contamines-Montjoie, where he stayed for four days before ing to the UK. That man was the first UK national to contract the disease.  The man is thought to have been diagnosed in Brighton and was transferred to St Thomasapos Hospital in London, where there is an infectious diseases unit, on Thursday afternoon. Two other patients, who had recently travelled from China, are still being treated at the Royal Victoria Infirmary infectious diseases centre in Newcastle. One is a student at the University of York, while the other is a family member. Some  Britons being flown back from the coronavirus-hit city of Wuhan on Sunday will be quarantined at a facility in Milton Keynes. South Central Ambulance Service said Kents Hill Park, a conference centre and hotel, would be used to house the ing citizens after they landed at RAF Brize Norton.

His replacement Osman Sow was stretchered off on Saturday. Unfortunately, it sounds like he’ll sit out the rest of the campaign as well.But it’s a sign of the quality they have in their squad that Clark and Sow can be missing and you still have a striker of the calibre of Lawrence Shankland to lead the line. vw, px\"  Sow being out leaves a great chance for youngsters like Declan Glass and Chris Mochrie to show what they can do in the No  position.It’s unfortanute for people to get injured but also a great chance for some of United’s youngsters to impress.On top of Sow’s injury, Paul McMullan, Louis Appere and Calum Butcher have been carrying injuries recently, too.This week is an ideal time to give the players a bit of a break and recharge the batteries for the run-in.The Tangerines want to get that title wrapped up as soon as possible but this breather couldn’t have been better timed.Once again, other teams weren’t really able to make up any ground on the runaway leaders – Inverness clawed one point back at home to Alloa.United are the only team that have managed any sort of consistency this season – a wee break is just what they need to get going again."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/02/Gary-and-Piacquiao-940x531.jpg ","title":"boxing fanatic gary todd describes brushes with the biggest stars in the sport since move from st marys to sydney","story":"Interviewing Muhammad Ali, having lunch with Manny Pacquiao and tracking down Deontay Wilder # it#s all in a day#s work for Dundee-born Gary Todd.Growing up in St Mary#s, Gary never would have imagined that one day he#d get the chance to meet boxing legends such as Mike Tyson and Julio César Chávez, however after moving to Sydney in  his le changed completely.The former Rockwell High School pupil now has two international bestselling books on the sport of boxing, and has had the chance to travel to countries such as Japan, Canada, the Bahamas, Hong Kong and the USA.He said: #I grew up in St Mary#s andI#m honest I didn#t go to school a lot.#I went to MacAlpine Primary School and I was at Rockwell for a year, but I dropped out to start working and earning some money.#I got a job at the slaughterhouse, but after a while I felt like I couldn#t see a future for myself in Dundee, so I decided to do a bit of travelling.#I went to Australia on a visa and loved it so much I decided to stay.#My we Jenny came with me and we got married and started a family here.#The boxing fanatic decided to join a local gym near his new home in Sydney, and soon found himself interviewing some of boxing#s greatest legends for a book on all the dferent workouts used in the sport.He said: #I#ve always been passionate about the sport, so I joined the gym.#I started training there and I made some connections and pals, then I kind of slipped into writing my book.#Throughout the course of writing his workout book, Gary has travelled across the globe, getting interviews and pictures with over  boxing champions.However, it hasn#t all been a walk in the park for the father of three.He said: #One time, a bodyguard threatened to shoot me.#I was talking to Marvin Hagler, who#s actually my favourite boxer of all time.#His bodyguard was annoying me and getting in the way and we started arguing.#He threatened to take me outside and shoot me, and Marvin Hagler just had to stand between us.#Gary, whose day job is as a director at a construction company in Australia, has gained a large amount of fame and respect in the boxing community for his work.He has produced two books, Workouts from Boxing#s Greatest Champs Volume  and , which have been popular among fans of the sport.The -year-old has been invited to watch Deontay Wilder#s fight against Tyson Fury later this month in Nevada, and plans to continue his work interviewing the biggest names in the sport.He said: #I#m a family man, I#m a construction worker, and I#ve got a passion in le which is boxing.#I#ve been into it since I was  years old, when the first Rocky film came out in cinemas.#It took me around  years to finish my first book, and I went all over the world.#I saved up my money and frequent flyer miles, flying all over the world economy class.#In two weeks, I#m planning to fly to Las Vegas to watch the Tyson Fury vs Deontay Wilder fight as part a member on a press accreditation.#He also confessed that his thick Dundonian accent does present a bit of a challenge at times, saying: #I do get some comments on it.

There is no suggestion that I personally falsied this email.“The suggestion is that I forwarded the email after it had been falsied by someone .“I refute the allegations made against me and I can confirm I will be appealing against my removal from my post.Mr Christie also said he felt that the penalty seemed to be “disproportionate” to the accusations made against him.“No other allegations have been made against me,” he said.“I have worked in my current role for  years and have had an association with the council for  years.“I continue to have a huge respect for my council colleagues, council officers and elected members.“This is a very unfortunate time for me and I will need to take time to look at things moving forward.“I don’t wish to say anything further at this stage but will be making my intentions clear in due course.”Blue Parrot had provided sound equipment for DSMT for previous shows.DSMT producer and manager Lina Waghorn said: “I am shocked and saddened that Kenny Christie is no longer working with the council.“He was a great asset to DSMT and an inspirational teacher.”It’s understood students at DSMT were informed on Sunday January  that Mr Christie was “moving on to new projects”.It was made clear to students he was not ing and that Kris Mordente, a St John’s Academy teacher, would be taking over director permanently.A source at DSMT said: “It’s just a bit strange that he’s gone. Kenny was DSMT and DSMT was Kenny. I don’t think anyone knows how we’re going to operate without him.“He had been growing distant for a while, we have only seen him three times since August and at one point Lina mentioned bringing in an assistant director.“It’s not something we’d expect, I think everyone here including Lina would be reluctant to let him go.”A Blue Parrot spokesman said the company was not awarded the DSMT contract because “strictly speaking, we did not meet the deadline.”A Dundee City Council spokesman said: “We do not comment on inidual personnel matters.”Kenny Christie has been described as one of the most “sought-after” musical theatre directors in the country.He has worked with DSMT for over  years, producing several musicals like Les Miserables and Annie.His directing career began at the age of , producing a one-act play as part of the SCDA drama festival.In , Mr Christie became the world record holder for the fastest theatrical production, taking one piece from book to stage in just . hours.He has also taught and organised dance workshops ,in Dundee and Perth, and has worked with Dundee City Council to organise dance activities for school pupils.Mr Christie has also held the title of chairman of the Heads of Instrumental Teaching Scotland, as well as being the first Youth Adviser for Scotland for the National Operatic and Dramatic Association.Kenny Christie’s sacking comes in the wake of a separate fraud scandal that has rocked Dundee City Council in the past year.In October, the council’s head of construction Mark Ross quit in the midst of an investigation into claims he was treated to a golfing trip on the Spanish coast by bosses of a firm awarded an £ million local authority contract.The £.m deal to provide heat and smoke and carbon monoxide detectors was awarded to Edmundson Electrical without going out to tender.The trip to Spain took place weeks after the contract was awarded and included Mr Ross, a senior Edmundson staff member, another council employee and representatives of two other firms.It was later revealed that the second council employee was Kenny Muir, who also worked in the council’s construction department.He was sacked from his role earlier this month.Mr Muir is the fourth senior employee to leave construction services since September, following the resignations of Mr Ross and electrical supervisor Iain Gardyne, who is accused of selling thousands of pounds’ worth of council smoke alarms online."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/thecourier/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2020/02/Dundee-v-Partick-350x564.jpg ","title":"field set to make bow against jags","story":"Left-back Tom Field is set to be thrust straight into the Dundee starting line-up this weekend.The -year-old joined the Dark Blues late last Friday after news of first-choice Jordan Marshall’s injury came back worse than first feared.Scan results on the thigh injury Marshall picked up in training arrived around lunchtime on the day of the transfer deadline.That forced manager James McPake into swt action to add cover in the shape of Field, who had left boyhood club Brentford earlier that day.With the late arrival, last weekend’s clash at Greenock Morton came too soon to make his debut with Jordan McGhee playing in the unfamiliar role on the left of defence.After meeting his new team-mates and training all week, Field is now likely to make his bow in dark blue against Partick Thistle on Saturday.To give him some match action, Field took part in a bounce game at Stirling Albion on Tuesday in which Andrew Nelson and Paul McGowan also featured after missing out at Cappielow through injury.Nelson, who scored in the match, has been out since the turn of the year after surgery to fix a broken hand.After seeing Christophe Berra and Christie Elliott make their debuts at Morton with Conor Hazard making a second bow after ing on loan, Field is likely to make his first outing against the Jags.Manager James McPake said: “Tom Field trained this week.“Jordan Marshall being out is disappointing because he’s been excellent.“He will miss eight weeks at least, maybe .“It’s a problem deep in the thigh muscle so it’s dficult to know when it has healed.“Jordan is an explosive player so we have to make sure he is right with that one.”Berra, meanwhile, made his first appearance in over a month last weekend and manager James was pleased with his start to le at the club.He added: “Christophe was good.

The site was then occupied by Jamie’s Italian, which opened in February , before closing down in .Dustin Macdonald, chairman of the Aberdeen City Centre Community Council, said: “It’s disappointing to see so many units lying empty on Union Street but it becoming increasingly dficult for business owners who are up against online shopping.“There are a lot of empty units, particularly on the upper floors of Union Street, and it would be great to see that space being used.“But it is a widespread problem because businesses are up against online shopping nowadays. I do think there is an onus on business owners to try to make their building more appealing to customers.“There are grants available for business ownersthey wish to have the front of their stores done up, and I would encourage them to do so.”Under the city centre masterplan, a blueprint approved by the local authority in June , a number of objectives were set out to regenerate the city over the years to come, while conserving its heritage.Phase one of its planned projects are currently underway, which includes the rejuvenation of Aberdeen Art Gallery, which opened in November, and the pedestrianisation of Broad Street, which was finished at the start of August .Other schemes include installing suspended street signs in areas across the city centre and banning traffic on Langstane Place, Justice Mill Lane and Windmill Brae from pm to am.Phase two of the scheme is planned for years four to seven of the project and includes ersying employment space as well as developing skills and training in the services sector.The Queen Street initiative, which forms part of phase two, also hopes to deliver more than  new homes and incorporate a civic hub.In , a Union Street Conservation Area Regeneration Scheme , was launched. The five-year initiative aims to “restore the majesty” of Aberdeen’s main street, and is a £. million grant fund which is available to owners of eligible buildings to undertake high quality repairs, restoration and the refurbishment of buildings.Since its inception, it has been used to refurbish a former jewellers into a hot dog restaurant.Real Hot Dogs at  Union Street opened in August  after making use of the grant to clean up the shop front, however it closed in January last year.The scheme is currently planned to run until .Adrian Watson, chief executive of business body Aberdeen Inspired, said: “Union Street as a high street is changing and this is necessary, in a challenge that is not felt in Aberdeen alone, but across the country.“We need to think dferently about the experience we offer and of course there are still challenges here as we make this transition. Our efforts to continue revitalising Union Street are ongoing and enhancing the experience for those living and working in the city is an integral part of what we do as an organisation as we aim to drive footfall in the city centre.”Aberdeen City Council is taking an active approach to improve the city centre and has served notices on businesses deemed to “negatively impact the amenity of the area.”The owner of one business, Inspirations on Union Street which is vacant, was asked to make a string of repairs due to its condition bringing “signicant disamenity” to the area.An appeal was lodged with the Scottish Government last year which was rejected this month.Councillor Marie Boulton, the council’s lead on the city centre masterplan, said: “Union Street remains very much the heart of Aberdeen. The council is working with Historic Environment Scotland to conserve the fabric of its most important buildings by offering grants to owners.“CARS also aims to stimulate the economy by encouraging occupancy of vacant commercial units and upper floors for residential use. The council is continuing to invest in our heritage as well as events that showcase our unique

I am happy that the gaffer was responsible enough and looked  at the long run to pull me out of the game.#For me as a footballer I would have just said let me just go in. But that would certainly would not have been the smart decision. So I am happy he rested me.“I thinkwe had won that game no-one would have said anything about it.”Aberdeen’s season has suffered a slump since the winter break with just one goal in five matches, in a - cup defeat of League One Dumbarton.He said: “After the game the mood was down and no one was happy about the way we played and the result.“The next day you come in and we have a cup game coming where we can win a big prize for the club. So everyone turns that switch and looked forward.”Supporters booed after the loss to Saints and McInnes admitted players’s confidence has been affected by recent form.The scrutiny on McInnes and his players will increasethey exit the Scottish Cup today.He said: “The easiest way to fix that is to just get a goal. It could be a goal out of brilliant play where everyone stands on their seats and starts clapping and saying I have never seen anything like that before.“Or it could be the most ugly goal you have ever seen. Confidence is something hard to get backyou are lacking it. I don’t think there is anything you can do at home, in training – it is something that just happens.“After you get that confidence back and look back on what you have done you probably haven’t done anything dferent. It is something that just comes.”Ojo is set toto the starting line up today as Aberdeen bid to take another step towards ending the  year wait to lt the Scottish Cup.The summer signing revealed McInnes’ speeches about the importance of cup success has fired him up for the trophy bid.He said: “I know how much the Scottish Cup means to the gaffer and the club.“It is talked about a lot and that is why It means a lot to me.“Seeing the gaffer talking about it brings the fire into me as well and I want to go for it.”The commendable - draw at Ibrox aside, the Dons have been booed by their supporters in three of the last four matches.Today the Red Shed initiative willto the Merkland Road stand and Ojo has urged supporters to get behind the team.He said: “The initiative in the cup games with the Red Shed behind the goal is a big dference for us players. I watched the game from the sidelines on Wednesday and noticed it was quiet.“First of all that is because we don’t perform like we want to and the fans want to. There is not much people need at the moment to start mumbling when they are not happy. In the Dumbarton cup game it was dferent because there was so much support.“Even though it we only won - the performance going forward with the ball was better and we had more attacking threat.“That starts from the stands as well as the confidence comes from what I call the th man.“I don’t knowthey call the crowd the same here for the fans. That is why I think the game against Kilmarnock will be dferent.“The fans pay for their season ticket and have every right to have their opinion.“However it is my opinion that it would benefit us morewe had the support instead of sometimes negativity.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/02/2.50167313-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/02/2.50167313-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/02/2.50167313-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/02/2.50167313-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"northern goal the north of scotland football podcast from the evening express and press and journal","story":"Northern Goal is the north of Scotland football podcast from the Evening Express and Press and Journal, with new episodes released every Tuesday.We’ll discuss all of the issues surrounding Aberdeen, Ross County, Inverness Caledonian Thistle, Peterhead, Cove Rangers, Elgin City and the Highland League.Apple Podcasts: https:podcasts.apple gb podcast northern-goal idSpoty: https:open.spoty show yJamczTcjQbkEIEcQOr search “Northern Goal” in the podcast app of your choice."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column december 27 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLooking back over the last  months, no single story has dominated the headlines in these pages, but there have been important themes.There are the negative trends, of course.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll rugby players pictured in their prime","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowA black and white photograph featuring a Mid Argyll Rugby team, handed to the Argyllshire Advertiser by Tayvallich reader Donald Carmichael, has generated a great deal of interest.After we asked our knowledgeable readers to tell us a little more about the photograph, Lochgilphead#s Murray MacFarlane visited the office to offer some background information on the image.Murray named every member of the team in the photograph, but added: #I was playing rugby as stand-off at that time as well, so I must have had a hangover or something when the photo was taken.#He recalled that Mid Argyll Rugby Club played in the Glasgow District League and only just missed out on promotion to the national leagues during the s.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

Fulmar got off equal first with half a dozen others and the Bosun, at the tiller, is reported to have had a look of near terror on his face. If he had known that one of the yachts, Sinbad, had lost its rudder during the melee and was virtually out of control he would probably have been more frightened. Two boats, Islay and Saionara, were in trouble with burst and torn mainsails. Fulmar held her position well and was among the first half dozen boats up to Colintraive but thereafter the wind fell light and they got stuck in the south narrows and nearly all the boats passed them – those taking the north channel scoring very decisively.Down the Kerry Kyle they recovered some of the lost ground but when they rounded Ardlamont they were still well down in the tail. They passed through the Skate and this paid handsomely as they got a tremendous lt up the east shore and passed boat after boat – those out in the middle of the loch got stuck and never got going again. Seewolf was lying rd or th at the Skate but she crossed the line a very bad last of the whole fleet. A spell of very calm weather followed while Fulmar was away over at Kilfinnan but, a light air coming away, they managed to cross over to the west shore and there got quite a nice little breeze which brought them along splendidly till they reached the buoys south of the breakwater then it died – absolutely. And it took them half an hour to do the distance.Next day, in a strong easterly, they had a slow and strenuous trip through the canal to Crinan then, borrowing Davie Weston’s dinghy to save launching their own, they went straight out and anchored off the canal entrance.There was a straggling start at .am on Monday owing to there being no gun and no one quite knew when to go but followed Arcturus when she gave a lead. Fulmar was moderately well placed about the middle of the ruck. A quite steady easterly gave them a quick passage to Fladda but, off Sheep, it fell light and all were becalmed. This, of course, suited Fulmarfine as no one was moving and, as long as this was the case, she was piling up a fine credit balance of handicap minutes. She tried to keep as well up to the eastward as possible but did not quite succeed in passing east of Sheep island as Arcturus did .A puffer coming south with her smoke trailing away to the west gave them a hint which few,any, of the others took and they held more and more to the east and, as a consequence, got the first of a fresh easterly breeze and swept past boat after boat, most of which had held down to Mull. By the time they got to Duart and were able to bring the breeze dead astern they were well up in the first half and well ahead of their time allowance. Thereafter it was just a question of #Would the wind hold # Provided it did so they felt they had an excellent chance as, with the hold-up at Sheep, they had accumulated more than half an hour of handicap from the leading boats and had lots in hand for those but a little ahead of them.The wind did hold and Fulmar won the Tobermory Cup and the st prize for the second section of the race which with Saturday’s second prize made a very good showing for the weekend.The Mate, Tar and Skipper, were following the race as best they could from the shore. When they came down Loch Fyne side it was a dead calm and they were very surprised when they got to Tarbert to see the boats, half hidden in the rain, coming round Ardlamont – they had no inkling of the breezy start. In Loch Fyne they watched the very slow progress, then the rain cleared off and they were glad to see the big lt Fulmar got up the east shore after going through Skate. For the last two or three hours things went desperately slowly till late-ish in the evening a little breeze brought in the leading boards but it died and left Fulmar no further from the finishing line than the buoys south of the breakwater – she was well up and ahead of several in the big class and most of the small class. She had only about  yards to do when she stopped and, after hurriedly working out the elapsed time handicaps, the Skipper found she had  minutes in which to do them but she failed by a little over two minutes to do it. The Skipper thought she had won as he thought Vanda had been the leader up till then and it was a disappointment when, checking up, he discovered Sally of Kames was ahead of Vanda and had saved her time by two minutes on Fulmar.The start from Crinan was at .am and the Skipper, Tar and Mate got up at .and went across to see them go. The start was a bit of a fiasco as the officials slept in but all the boatsgot off more or less together. As it happens it was perhaps a good thing as, with all the boats starting together on a short line and with the strong easterly breeze that was then blowing there might, too easily, have been some nasty accidents.The Tar, Skipper and Mate went back to their beds then after breakfast went to Oban with little expectation of seeing anything more of the boats. Again they were surprised when, on going to the summit of the Pulpit Hill in Oban, they saw the leading boats just coming up to Duart – they did not know anything of the hold-up at Sheep.Anxiously they watched a number of boats come into view round a hill on Kerrera and were more than pleased when, well up amongst the leaders and passing boat after boat as they watched, they saw the red gaff sails of Fulmar reaching up the Firth of Lorn then running up the Sound of Mull. They watched until most of the boats were well out of recognition distance up the Sound then went home confident thatconditions remained as they were Fulmar had more than a good chance of winning that leg of the race and, with luck, the whole thing.Extract from The Glasgow Herald of Tuesday, July : #Clyde Cruising ClubIn the early hours of yesterday morning the yachts of the Clyde Cruising Club set off from Crinan on the nd leg of their face from Port Bannatyne to Tobermory. The first part of the race ended at Ardrishaig, after which the yachts went through the Crinan Canal.The winners at Ardrishaig were:-Class . st Sally of Kamesh m s.nd Fulmarh m srd Vandah m sExtract from the Glasgow Herald of Monday, July :-Clyde Cruising ClubThe  yachts which raced from Port Bannatyne to Tobermory under the burgee of the Clyde Cruising Club got a rare dusting and with as much wind as they wished the bigger boats came into their own. The  ton cutter Fulmar, which distinguished herself many years ago as one of the few finishers in a stormy Fastnet race, won the Tobermory Cup for the large class, and the  ton sloop Trefoil captured the Torridon Cup for the small class.Driven hard from Port Bannatyne by a fresh easterly, the yachts found a calm patch off Ardrishaig, but they were blown through the canal to Crinan, where the second leg of the race was sailed in a good easterly breeze, resulting in fast passages.

and embarked on a year-long campaign to eradicate dog fouling.Now, thanks to a successful bid for funding, new bins and bag dispensers have been located throughout the town.ldquoIrsquove always found the notion of dog poo smeared across our streets abhorrent, even as a small child, said community councillor Jackie Couchman.ldquoInnerleithen has a high density of dogs in a relatively small area which magnies the issue.ldquoMost dog owners are responsible and pick up, a sizeable minority do not and, it would seem, will not. I thought it was worth a concerted effort to seewe could make a dference to the state of our streets to benefit everyone. I was prepared to make a personal commitment of time and effort to this cause.The project got off ground last January when Innerleithen community councillors made the decision to try and rid the streets of dog mess.Reflecting on the actions they undertook, Jackie said: ldquoI became involved after Gordon Daly taped plastic bottles to lampposts to dispense free poo bags to those in need.\"Susan Meikle and I offered to help these from supplies Gordon had procured from the Dogs Trust.The following month, the community council was encouraged by local authority councillors to apply for funding through the Localities Area Bid Fund.ldquoThis concentrated my mind and I took it upon myself to complete the application with offers of help from both a previous applicant and The Bridge, said Jackie.ldquoWe heard our project had been shortlisted to be put to the public vote in time for our May community council meeting.But the timetable for the public voting process was disrupted by other political happenings, and after a tense wait and a flurry of activity to encourage voting, good news was delivered.Jackie added: ldquoWe heard our bid was successful in time for our July meeting.\"Various conditions had to be met before the funds could be released, including  percent of the amount applied for supplied by us, copies of our constitution and accounts.ldquoHaving won the funding, final details of ordering, delivery, installation and maintenance had to be agreed.Whilst waiting on the new bins to arrive, the community councillors did not rest on their laurels.With the help of SBC leader Shona Haslam, Jackie and Gordon stencilled anti-fouling signs on problem pavements in Innerleithen.Community councillors also mapped out locations for the new bins and Scottish Borders Council agreed to install these and remove or relocate the redundant ones.ldquoOperationally, the local authority agreed to provide the litter bags and to replenish the poo bags with us taking responsibility for funding them, added Jackie.With the bins now in place, the community council is due to meet on Monday to discuss further fundraising initiatives.The townrsquos community council, in particular, the poo-busting trio of Jackie, Gordon and Susan, have worked tirelessly this last year to combat the dog fouling issue in Innerleithen.Nevertheless, inevitable questions remain.Will they no longer witness the flattened deposit bearing the imprint of a shoe, the stressed parent quickly steering their child away from the offending brown mess, or irritated adult repeatedly scraping their foot off a kerb Probably not says Jackie, adding: ldquoWas it worth it  Yes.\"And in the shorter term it has made a dference.\"Longer term, my feeling is that it will depend on continuing effort and collective ownership of the problem. People have generally been very supportive although every post on social media has triggered lsquothey wonrsquot ever pick up commentsrsquo.\"Despite the campaign Jackie says itrsquos unlikely that everyone will become law abiding citizens and pick up after their dog, but says shersquod do it all again in an effort to keep clean the streets and grass verges of the bonnie town she resides in."},{"url":null,"title":"council-asked-declare-interest-planet","story":"CAMPAIGNERS descended on Thursdays meeting of Scottish Borders Council in a bid to convince the local authority to declare a Climate Emergency.So far  councils across Scotland have made the declaration as efforts continue to halt and reverse the damage being done to the planet.Despite the Extinction Rebellion protest outside the council headquarters at Newtown St Boswells, bosses have yet to issue any statement.Protestor Jennie Gibson said: \"The declaration is the first step to deal with the problem.\"It shows the council takes climate crisis seriously and so should we.\"It means they have to make plans to cut emissions and we can seethey do it or not.

attempted to defend their track record despite being rated amongst the worst performing in Scotland.Figures released by the Local Government Benchmarking Framework last week puts the Newtown St Boswells authority towards the bottom of the heap in most categories.With housing stock transferred over to Scottish Borders Housing Association and all cultural and leisure facilities in the hands of Live Borders, the local authoritys portfolio of responsibility has diminished over the past decade or so.But much of what remains under Scottish Borders Council control is lagging behind other authorities.As well as having the second worst roads in the country, according to the   findings, bosses at Newtown spent less than half the national average on repairs, pound, per kilometre against the Scotland-wide pound,.Although an argument can be made regarding the additional amount of carriageway in the rural Borders, similar authorities, such as Highland, Aberdeenshire, Moray and both North and East Ayrshire, all spent considerably more.Only Dumfries and Galloway, and Eilean Siar authorities spent less during  .Scottish Borders Council also spent below the national average on every aspect of education.Across Scotland the average spend per pupil in secondary education was pound,, while in the Borders it was only pound,.Primary pupil spend in Scotland was pound,, while in the Borders during   it was pound,.And pre-school spend per pupil in the Borders was only pound, against a national average of pound,.The number of sick days taken by teachers in the Borders was also worse than the national average.While spending on frontline education is well below Scottish averages, the amount spent on office-based administration and support across the whole authority during  , at seven percent of budget, was almost double the national level of four percent.Local MSP Christine Grahame believes Scottish Borders Council should re-prioritise its spending.She told us: \"I am sure Borderers will be angry at the information coming to light from this given how clearly it demonstrates the councilrsquos deeply skewed priorities for its spending.ldquoTime and time again constituents have contacted me to complain about the frankly dangerous state of some roads in the Borders and I have repeatedly raised it with SBC.\"To now find out it has the third lowest spend per kilometre on roads in the country, and that the area has the second worst A roads and B roads is an unsuprising but damning indictment of the councilrsquos priorities.ldquoWhy is this Tory-led administration spending poundm on vanity projects like the purchase of the Lowood Estate for speculative development, whilst it underspends on our schools, tourism and helping people back to work  Why does it spends so little on economic development to bring down the  percent of shops that lie empty in our town centres ldquoThere are serious questions for SBC to answer here and I for one will certainly look to see them held to account.Investment in helping people back to work was the second lowest, at . percent, of all the  authorities in Scotland.Scottish Borders Council also spent less than half the national average when it came to economic development and tourism.Across Scotland authorities averaged pound, per , population on attracting tourists and improving the local economy, in the Borders the spend was just pound,.And the figures also show that there was a higher proportion of empty town centre propertiesin the Borders than the Scottish average .Elderly care was also ranked poorly with only  percent of council services rated as good or above - the fourth worst in all Scotland - compared to a national average of  percent.Ron Sutherland, who had a successful career in corporate governance, finance and management, has been a strong critic of spending at Newtown St Boswells in recent years.The retired consultant from Innerleithen told us: \"As those who have attempted in recent times to get to the heart of topical issues, transactions and dealings will already be aware, it is often dficult to ascertain what goes on at SBC, through the barrier of smoke and mirrors around the councils Newtown St Boswells nerve centre.\"It might be thought that senior officials - of which we evidently have many - and elected members prefer to inhabit those parts of Council HQ located away from the spotlight of public scrutiny and accountability!\"However, the Local Government Benchmarking Framework provides an excellent opportunity for outsiders to gain an insight into our local authoritys performance in comparison with other councils across the country, and indeed against those with similar characteristics to SBC.\"Revelations of shortcomings in expenditure, or investment of council taxpayers money last year in several key local authority areas of responsibility such as roads, schools and education, tourism, economic and social development, etc. are unsurprising.\"There are fewany bright spots - especially worrying when SBC allocates almost twice the national average funding to administration support, doing little to dispel impressions of a top-heavy, inefficient organisation.\"This resonates with the recent eye-wateringly costly and confused SB Cares debacle - indicative of poor planning and organisational management allied to woefully inept financial control and monitoring by those senior people charged with doing just that, and paid handsomely into the bargain.For the record in the year to March , its last full year of operation, provisional accounts for SB Cares LLP disclosed a net loss of over pound. million, with net current liabilities - effectively, accumulated insolvency - in excess of pound. million - plus an audit report casting material uncertainty and signicant doubt on the organisations viability as a going concern.,params: .push\"In most peoples book, that would read like mismanagement, which would be little short of a scandal.\"Moreover, in the four years of so of employment, the CEO of SB Cares took home more than half a million pounds for his efforts and he was also employed as an executive director of SBC, in clear contravention of relevant guidelines relating to conflict of interest.\"Will anyone be held accountable \"In a statement from Scottish Borders Council, bosses attempted to highlight the amount of money spent with local suppliers and contractors was signicantly higher than the national average.But it didnt mention that only  percent of invoices were paid on time - against a national average of  percent, making it the fth worst for paying bills in the country.Rather than being disappointed SBC Chief Executive Tracey Logan prefers to look at more locally sourced surveys.She said: ldquoThese statistics are just one element of how we regularly monitor and report the performance of the council.\"Many of these figures are not new, and in some areas we believe that some of the local data we collect, for example the Scottish Borders Household Survey and those undertaken with Live Borders customers, are more representative due to the volume of responses received.\"These show much higher levels of satisfaction with services.ldquoHowever, every piece of information on our service delivery is useful, and we will use the statistics and comparison data to look at how we can continue to change, improve and invest to provide the best possible services to the residents of the Scottish Borders.Scottish Borders Council did fare well in council tax collections and support offered for looked-after children.And it has the second highest spend of any authority, at pound, per , population, on parks and outdoor spaces, with the national average being pound,.The signicant spend is down to the investment in new parks and the additional cost of staff from other departments.Council leader Shona Haslam said: \"It is abundantly clear when you look at the full range of data released that council services are under pressure across the country, with average performance falling across many areas.ldquoIn some measures this follows long periods of improvement, suggesting that we may be reaching a tipping point in how council services are being affected by the need for us all to make savings due to the gap between the funding required to maintain and improve services and that actually available.ldquoScottish Borders Council continues to make and maintain progress in some key areas, but we have to be realistic and acknowledge that services, particularly non-statutory ones, are impacted by reductions in spending.\""},{"url":null,"title":"borders-holiday-inspires-authors-debut-novel","story":"A NEW author has set his debut novel

I knew the importance of being part of a union, both for my own inidual rights and for the strong collective message it sent. That low-level hum of sexism has followed me through the movement, though. Working on a book about trade unions, Irsquove lost count of the number of times men have tried to lecture me about its history or sent me unsolicited emails with advice on how to approach the subject.Thatrsquos why it was gratying news this week that the Scottish Trades Union Congress will welcome its first woman General Secretary later this year when Grahame Smith retires. When Roz Foyer, a Unite stalwart, steps up to become the most senior representative for Scotlandrsquos , trade union members, it will also mark the first time that all trade union centres in the UK and Ireland will be led by women. Considering that women make up more than half of the UKrsquos trade union membership, itrsquos about time too.Despite the key role that women have played in labour struggles throughout history, the union movement was constructed in the model of men it was men who designed and built it, men who led it, and men who it catered to as default, with the standard worker often envisaged as a white male manual labourer. Ironically, while men ploughed on with making the union movement in their mould, women were often busy fighting their own workplace struggles for equal pay and equal recognition on the sidelines.This account of the origins of the trade union movement isnrsquot just subjective analysis, it is fact: addressing the TUC in , parliamentary secretary Henry Broadhurst called for Congress to ldquobring about a condition where wives and daughters would be in their proper sphere at home, instead of being dragged into competition for livelihood against the great and strong men of the world. More than  years later in , when women workers at the Plessey electrics plant in Bathgate proposed industrial action to resist its closure, male trade unionists blocked them in a vote.The trade union movement remains more essential than ever in this time of accelerated inequality and the plummeting standards at work, and many parts of it have worked hard to shake off a reputation as a working class old boysrsquo network but its history still casts many a shadow, in ways both subtle and brazen. Just two years ago, Glasgowrsquos majority-female council workers found themselves making history when they took strike action over historic pay inequalities and won. But it took the persistence of women workers who knew their worth and a new generation of female organisers to right a historic wrong set in motion by the unions themselves alongside a Labour-run council which didnrsquot even pretend to prioritise the interests of working-class women.Installing women in leadership positions, welcome as it is, is no silver bullet for tackling these structural and ingrained barriers for women in the union movement. While Foyerrsquos record as an avowed feminist is reassuring for women workers across Scotland, the challenge of transforming an entire movement is not hers to bear alone, and nor should it be in a project built on the ideals of collectivism and building power from the bottom up.But an STUC leadership that prioritises equalities and building power amongst women workers at community and branch level has the potential to be transformative, both for womenrsquos inidual lives and for the movement as a whole. After all,trade unions are to survive andto their former glory, they have no choice but to adapt to todayrsquos employment landscape, where a growing number of women face greater challenges than ever.When the union movement was at its peak in the s, it was in part because it recognised the dominance of industry and sought to organise manual labourers accordingly. But unions remain strong amongst those industries while the industries themselves dwindle alongside rapid deindustrialisation. Meanwhile, service and care sectors where women are more likely to be concentrated have expanded rapidly but remain largely unorganised, despite the plethora of problems encountered there, ranging from pay inequalities to insecure and casual work arrangements, health and safety and poverty wages.A feminist trade union movement would take seriously the challenge of organising these workplaces, engaging not only with current union members but with those not yet signed up ndash tackling head on a tension which has always existed for the movement. It would seek to build women activists at grassroots levels and elect them as leaders at branch and regional levels. It would prioritise pay equality, and maternity and discrimination rights, evenit made some male members uncomfortable or put some noses out of joint. And it would listen to the voices of all women, and minorities, and not just those who have traditionally been most represented.The trade union movement isnrsquot perfect, but it is vital. Itrsquos also changing, with recent campaigns around womenrsquos representation in the movement and new grassroots unions like United Voices of the World organising workers in the gender-based violence and charity sectors for the first time. And in Scotland, Glasgowrsquos equal pay women have created a watershed moment for female council workers across the UK, many of whom have long been exploited and are now making their voices heard for the first time. The opportunities are plentulthe movement chooses to take them.Andfresh leadership leads to a bold and radical agenda, and the building up of new generations of female trade unionists, the future could be bright for Scotlandrsquos women workers."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-its-five-minutes-walk-run","story":"THIS week a metal detecting enthusiast discovered treasure in the grounds of Trefoil House near Hermiston, Edinburgh.

The shambles surrounding two new ferries to serve Arran and the Hebrides now has the Scottish taxpayer on the hook for at least pound million, in what is merely the latest example of an embarrassing and costly public project that has run aground.Ferguson Marine, which won the contract in  and went under last year with debts of pound million before being taken into public ownership, blames the Scottish Government and CMAL, another state-owned company that owns the ferries run by CalMac. CMAL claims that Ferguson began work before agreeing final specications, and that cost overruns were its responsibility.Meanwhile, CalMac says that it never wanted dual fuel vessels, using marine diesel and liquefied natural gas , and Jim McColl, the industrialist who took on Fergusonrsquos in , says the system would never have provided a benefit.The Scottish Government stands accused of having insisted on LNG as a green gimmick, and of prematurely announcing the order to steal a march on a Tory spending commitment at Faslane, made on the same day by the then Chancellor, George Osborne.If, as the Scottish Governmentrsquos former adviser Luke van Beek suggests, there was a breakdown in communication, and that the brief for the project was dangerously vague, it can certainly be charged with having failed to provide adequate scrutiny of how public money was being spent, and to have stepped in to prevent matters becoming worse.After the fiascos at ScotRail and the hospital builds in Glasgow, Edinburgh and now Aberdeen, this is becoming a dismally familiar complaint. The latest mess ndash which holds up to ridicule both our proud shipbuilding heritage and the basic competence of Holyrood ndash is a particular embarrassment, and demands an urgent public inquiry. This, too, is a depressingly familiar call.Ministers have been far too ready to make excuses, dodge responsibility and ndash always a favoured tactic ndash accuse critics of ldquotalking Scotland down. If the SNP wishes to demonstrate that independence is a credible political option , it needs to begin operating with the basic level of competence citizens expect and deserve.The greatest service the SNP could perform for the nationalist cause is not to attempt to rerun the last referendum, nor to manufacture grievances to lob at Westminster, but to give the electorate evidence that politicians at Holyrood are capable of performing the tasks fundamental to government.That means upholding standards in public services, demonstrating responsible stewardship of the taxpayersrsquo money, ensuring infrastructure projects deliver the intended result and provide value for money and, above all, accepting that the responsibility for failure ultimately rests with ministers.Examples such as Crossrail and HS demonstrate that such failings are not unique to Scotland they are a perpetual risk in all government spending. But that is why the public is entitled to expect ministers to be vigilant against waste, delay and a failure to deliver. Scotlandrsquos record is undeniably poor.The Government at Holyrood is gaining an unfortunate reputation for expensive failures of this sort. Their apparent casual disregard for their basic duties, and for what the Scottish people have a right to expect, is a disservice to Scotland as a competent and capable nation which can attend to its own affairs.

History, music and crafting were of greater interest in lower and middle income groups, while sports and food were more popular in higher incomes groups. Natural heritage, theatre and drama and growing and gardening were equally popular among all income groups.The reported benefits of cultural participation include socialising and making friends, making localitiesbetter places to live and visit, increased health and wellbeing, education and learning, and building stronger local communities.Respondents from the Highlandsand Islands rated above the national average for all benefits, while people from the north east were also above average.People living in the west of the country had above average results for the role of culture in strengthening local communities, and for making better places to live and work.By contrast, residents in the south were below average for the perceived benefits, including stronger local communities, learning new skills and increased physical activity.When asked what form of cultural activity people would most like to see developed in their local area, film and TV dropped from the top spot, with greater priority given to nature and natural places, growing and gardening, and architecture and built heritagendash suggesting these were areas people would like to see better provided for in their own areas in the future.The National Trust for Scotlandsees the forthcoming culture strategyas a way for the country as a whole to increase opportunities to enjoy its culture and believes an expansive definition of culture must be adopted it to be relevant to the experience of most people.Diarmid Hearns, the Trustrsquos head of public policy, said: ldquoIn its new strategy, the Scottish Government has a real opportunity to show leadership on this, tackling the barriers we have identied and enabling participation from all in the community, across the country.ldquoOur research found Scots see many additional benefits from their cultural activities, including learning, making friends, or creating a better place tolive. But they also experienced barriers ndash and these were worse for those on lower incomes, and for those from ethnic minority groups.ldquoWe need to better understand what the opportunities are at a local level, and what the role of national and local government is in supporting culture. We also need to work together to tackle the inequalities in access to culture our research has identied.ldquoThis means looking at nationaland local cultural budgets and whether these are adequate for our ambitions.

But letrsquos agree on one thing: socialism is on the march in America. For now, the White House remains a distant destination. But the Left is on the road that leads to it and is starting to make some progress.Remember what leading Marxist moderate Mao Tse Tung once said: ldquoA journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, which I guess is true, evenhe later took the bus. Apart from which, it was the Taoist philosopher Lao Tzu who said it first. He also favoured small government, which Mao misread as ldquohuge government.And government of some size is what socialist presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders wants in America. Hersquos calling for ldquodemocratic socialism, something we never thought would ever get a hearing in the world HQ of capitalism.Beyond such moderate measures, Berniersquos more extreme grassroots supporters speak of ldquorevolution, and theyrsquore not using it in the mild sense. They mean in the Bolshevik sense. And, beyond Berniersquos ldquodemocratic socialists, a further left has developed that waves hammer and sickle flags and wants the full communist monty. Theyrsquore like something out of Britain in the s.Even mainstream Bernie supporters at meetings chant: ldquoWe have nothing to lose but our chains. The words were originally those of Karl Marx, though as with Lao Tzu therersquos a school of thought that he was mistranslated and that ldquochains should have read ldquoreading glasses.Berniersquos mainstream campaign, however, focuses on ldquoworking class people and the young. Bernie is ldquofor the people. His Democratic rivals for the partyrsquos presidential candidacy are ldquofor the moneyed people.The pitch appears to be working. The first caucus in Iowa saw Bernie lose by a mere . per cent to Pete Buttigieg , and hersquos also polling well in New Hampshire, which votes on Tuesday.For my part, much though I admire bits of Bernie, Irsquom not wholly convinced by him. That could be down to personal prejudice. During the impeachment show-trial of President Trump, he sat repeatedly dabbing at his beak with Kleenex, a practice that I cannot abide. Just as Irsquod never date one of these woman who keeps a paper hankie up beside the wrist-cuff of their pullover ndash disgusting! ndash I could never vote for such a man.However, perhaps thatrsquos just me. Many voters in America are clearly more tolerant, or less principled, which has led to senior establishment Democrats being ldquoscared to death that they could be going down the road first tarmacked by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn over here.In other words, for all the grassroots hullabaloo, Bernie will get trounced by Trump, just as Jeremy was by BoJo. In truth, I canrsquot see socialism getting a real snf of power any time soon in America. Apart from anything , as over here, it carries the albatross of liberalism rounds its neck, with the same woke insanity, Pelosi-style gimmicks, and manipulative legalistic attempts to subvert democracy.That said, itrsquos a mystery why America has never had a socialist movement until now. It had early martyrs and a strong trade union culture, but the whole gun-totinrsquo, ldquoeveryone can make it schtick remains deep-rooted in the popular psyche. And they seem to have a penchant for that peculiar old concept that they see as incompatible with socialism: freedom.Red flag over the White House  Never going to fly, Irsquom afraid. At least not for some time to come.+++SHOULDERGATE gripped the nation this week, after Labour culture spokeswoman Tracy Brabin flashed flesh from the controversial clavicle area of her body in the House of Commons chamber.As so often, the nation was bitterly ided over the issue. Traditionalists, and others people who uphold decency, thought the former Coronation Street starrsquos frock ndashthat is the word ndash was inappropriate wear in such a sombre sanctum of deliberation and waffle.Feminists, however, said she should be able to flash as much flesh as she wanted, but hell mend anyone who looks at it. They dressed the issue up, so to say, as ldquowomenrsquos right to blah-blah, which pretty much equates to the way a sulky teenager will say: ldquoDo what I want.At any rate, it was all good publicity for the frock-makers under advisement, as the pound garment has since flown off the shelves at online retailer ASOS.At the time of going to press, it remains a mystery why the same phenomenon has not followed the controversial wearing of double-breasted, pinstriped suits by top Tory toff, Jacob Rees-Mogg. Although a role model for many young men today, his sartorial tastes remain distinctly niche and unavailable at many fashion outlets.++++THE impressive taking out by police of a terrorist kneman in Streatham, London, has been applauded by all right-minded people. However, not everyone is in their right mind.Soon, the usual jaw-dropping allegations of ldquoIslamophobia and the shooting being ldquotoo extreme appeared online.What are people making such claims, readers  Correct: these people are nutters. I was going to say you could probably even find some complaining that the cops were white males, but I see now that you can take out the ldquoprobably. Jeez.However, one deeply disturbing aspect of the incident that has received little attention was the attire of the plain-clothes counter-terrorism officers. They were wearing hellip hoodies!Is a terrorist attack a legitimate excuse to lower sartorial standards like this  You could argue the habiliments were practical, providing a disguise by which the officers passed themselves of as being as slovenly as the average British citizen.But thatrsquos not how matters were dealt with by Colin Firth in Kingsman, where the undercover agent rendered himself inconspicuous by wearing a well-tailored, pinstriped suit and a pair of highly polished Oxford shoes.We trust the officers involved in the Streatham incident received a dressing down on ing to base.++++IN an arguably controversial move, a co-founder of mental environmental group Extinction Rebellionhas called for civilisation to be ldquotaken down and for humanity toto a ldquoferal state of consciousness.Simon Bramwell, speaking at an event headed ldquoBy Any Means Necessary, urged activists to ldquosabotage civilisation in order to save the planet. Sounds like a plan. But not a good one.Jolly Mr B added: ldquoExtinction Rebellion is the spirit of our age. It contains every dichotomy and absolutely every flaw and beauty that our present society encapsulates.Expanding on this, he went on, tongue in cheek we trust, to speak of XR being ldquowhite-supremacist, ldquoracist and ldquodeeply patriarchal, meaning ndash I think ndash that it was a broad church containing all sorts of nutters.Later, XR issued an official statement saying the movement was indeed a broad church ndash ldquoincluding lawyers, doctors, electricians, nurses, farmers, teachers and other hooligans ndash and adding that Simonrsquos views didnrsquot represent ldquothe position of Extinction Rebellion as a whole.Schism! When yoursquore in a whole, stop digging, guys. In the meantime, letrsquos toast Simon.

A lelong politician is not the right skills for this particular position.If we are to create an economy that funds our ambitions in the NHS, social care, police, infrastructure and climate change we need someone who has experience of managing the economy, not another political apparatchik.Ian McNair, Glasgow G.THE Scottish Government claims that its reason for demanding details from the Sun was to establish veracity and substance. A reality is that it had a readily accessible source of verication and substantiation in the shape of Derek Mackay.I might be a bit naiumlve but, regardless of the name and address of a -year-old, the question is whether a minister behaved inappropriately. Prior to the Scottish Government making the demand, Mr Mackay was in a position to very and substantiate whether such messages had been sent.The above aside, we dont know yet whether the First Minister asked two obvious questions before it approached the newspaper. The first of those questions is \"Did you do it \"If Mr Mackay denied it and this was why the Scottish Government sought evidence we now know that his denial would have been a lie. If he didnt lie then the FM was obliged to ask the next question, which would have been along the lines of \"Is this the only one \"Yesterday, the FM denied knowledge of any other instance. As a result, one of two things must be true. The first might be that the FM lied at Holyrood. The second is that she didnt ask the question. The first would be a bare-faced lie uttered by someone in high office. If she did not ask Mr Mackayhe had done this sort of thing before, we are left with a First Minister who is unable to bring an obvious question to mind in a crisis. The alternative would be that she chose not to ask in a hopeless effort to claim plausible deniability.Many of us wonderthis Governments first actions will always be to protect itself and the cause it promotes rather than protect the people of Scotland from the excesses of those who work within it and who are leading lights in that cause.Kenny Wilson, Greenock.DEREK Mackay should do the honourable thing now and resign as an MSP. His shameful conduct has no place in any decent society.The scandal involving Mr MacKay may only be the beginning of an intensely dficult period for the First Minister and for the Scottish Government with the highly publicised trial of Alex Salmond taking place next month and the ongoing debate over Indyref causing internal ision and doubt. However, followers of Scottish independence must look beyond personalities and media sensationalism during this thorny time to reassure themselves that their quest for self-determination rises above human failings and parochial party politics.It is important to keep a clear vision of what kind of country we wish to live in at this time when we are creeping towards the Brexit abyss and are ruled from Westminster by a Government that regards Scotland as a colony and those who represent us with a mixture of ambivalence and disdain. The quest for a land where social equality and justice, together with a stable economy wherein fair distribution of wealth is a priority, is eminently achievable within a Scotland, that through the EU or even EFTA, finds itself again part of a European family of nations. The very heart of the UK continues to decay from within thanks to the perpetual class system, self-interest of the economic elite and the archaic political system.We must look beyond the current travails of the Scottish Government and keep our eyes on the prize. Independence for Scotland is no longer a pipe dream, it is almost within our grasp.Owen Kelly, Stirling.WHY does Allan Fitzpatrick bother doubting the ability of the SNP to govern competently in an independent Scotland  Has he not yet realised that the whole point of independence is that we will have the government we choose, which means that he, like everyone , will have a choice of parties to vote for to run the government  Who is to say that the SNP will still exist, at least in its present form  Many of its current members who want independence will probably revert to parties with which they formerly had affinity and the SNP therefore will either disband or develop into a dferent party.What matters is Scotlandrsquos ability to run its own affairs efficiently under a government of our own choice.P Davidson, Falkirk.IrsquoM in no way shocked at the behaviour of some senior SNP politicians. But yet at every election the SNP portrays itself as an exemplar of upstanding behaviour, in direct contrast with the den of inequity at Westminster. It seems to think Holyrood is new, post-modern, a gleaming city on the hill. Westminster is colonial, stuck in the th century, sleazy, its politicians reflecting this.The numerous recent and past events demonstrate that SNP politicians are all too human. As prone to stupidity, misconduct, aice, licentious and pettiness as any other group of people that have ever existed.Perhaps the SNP and its supporters could stop pretending that their politicians are somehow scandal-free colossi sent down from Arthurrsquos Seat. Scandals will come and go. Hypocrisy tends to last longer.David Bone, Girvan.IAN Thomsoninvokes McMillanrsquos ldquoevents, dear boy comment. I think the more appropriate classical reference is Icarus. The SNP and its leaders have sailed too close to the ldquoSun for too long as they have stupidly attempted to break away from their Crete.Just as Icarus before, hubris has got them all in the end. Their dream is over. For that we should all be very grateful.John Dunlop, Ayr.Read more: Sturgeon accused of lack of leadership"},{"url":null,"title":"five-britons-test-positive-coronavirus-france","story":"The four adults and a child were diagnosed after they came into contact with a British national who recently ed from Singapore, the French health ministry said.The five British nationals, who are not in a serious condition, were staying in the Alpine resort area of Contamines-Montjoie near Mont Blanc.:Coronavirus outbreak: What are the symptoms and how does it spread To date,  countries were identied to be implementing travel restrictions through official reports, official statements  the media.Of these, WHO received  official reports from countries about their travel restrictions.WHO Situation Report  Feb https:t.co YvMApJNuu pic AERaFpvmdash World Health Organization February , French officials said the British national who was in Singapore ed on January  and stayed for four days in the area in eastern France, before ing to England on January .The five Britons whose diagnosis was confirmed, as well as people they had close contact with ndash  people in total, all of British nationality ndash were taken to hospital on Friday night in Lyon, Saint-Etienne and Grenoble.The health ministry confirmed their condition shows no signs of seriousness.A crisis unit has been set up and people who have been in close and prolonged contact with these new cases will be informed during the day and given specic instructions.The confirmed cases in France came as a British honeymooner transferred from the cruise liner Diamond Princess to hospital in Japan with the coronavirus was said to be feeling well and in good spirits.Alan Steele, from Wolverhampton, was moved to hospital on Friday while his we Wendy remained on board the ship.The liner had been isolated in the port of Yokohama before going back out to sea, with  people having been taken to hospitals after testing positive for the virus.Wendy Marshall Steele has been in telephone contact with her husband.

Unless that changes, Orkney will be left with the oldest fleet and the highest fares in the country — and that can only be described as blatant discrimination.”In a response to Councillor Stockan, the minister for energy, connectivity and the islands, Paul Wheelhouse, says Orkney Islands Council is “wholly responsible for the inter-island ferry services which they provide.”He says minsters understand the “signicant financial challenges that can fall on inidual local authorities with responsibility for ferries” and that the Government has “made clear our commitment to Orkney’s internal ferry services” with additional funding of £. million in total over the past two years.Councillor Stockan said: “I am extremely disappointed that the First Minister has chosen not to respond to our considerable concerns directly, or to meet with me to discuss an issue of fundamental importance to our community.“I can only describe the Government’s current position as irrefutable discrimination against the people of Orkney. The additional funding we received over the last two years was welcome, but fell far short of what is needed to fully fund our internal ferry service.“I call on the Government to address this when the budget is published this week — and I have asked the other parties at Holyrood to offer us their full support in securing full and fair funding for Orkney.“The running and replacement costs of Western Isles ferries are fully subsidised by the Government. It is only right and proper that we in Orkney should be treated in the same way.”In the letter, Councillor Stockan also criticises the Government for its continued failure to introduce Road Equivalent Tarf on routes linking Orkney to the Scottish Mainland.“The roll-out of RET began on West of Scotland ferry routes more than a decade ago, reducing fares for local people and visitors alike,” he added.“It is our firm belief that there is no impediment preventing RET being introduced on Orkney routes, and that any further delay is unfair and will result in signicant prejudice against local ferry users.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He played in bands in London, rubbing shoulders with the Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton and his jamming buddy, Ritchie Blackmore, who went on to form the legendary rock bands Deep Purple and Rainbow.He even jammed at a party with Cream bassist and vocalist, Jack Bruce.A visit from Screaming Lord Sutch, who wanted him to go to Germany with him as a bass playermade Jim think again about a career in rock music.His first passion was always art, and comic book art was his favourite genre.He declined Lord Sutch’s offer and after a few years ed to his beloved Orkney. Here he continued drawing for TV comics before working for AD. He was then head-hunted by the American giants, DC Comics and Marvel Comics.Sadly, Jim suffered with Parkinson’s Disease for over  years and passed away on December , .Despite the diagnosis he continued drawing, painting and writing original sci-fi stories for many years.This celebration of his le and art is dferent from other recent exhibitions, as it contains his le story, original artwork and artefacts relating to him.It also features many Orkney related pieces, rather than just sci-fi heroes like Judge Dredd and Batman.Local characters from the th century hang alongside paintings showing the story of St Magnus, wartime Hoy and illustrations from books, like The Bard of Ballarat and Willick o’ Pirliebraes.Jim’s we, Wendy, said: “I am delighted that the Orkney Museum is having an exhibition of my late husband Jim’s work.“The fact that a young boy from the small Orkney island of Hoy should become world famous in his chosen field of comic book illustration is an achievement in itself, but there were many other aspects to Jim’s le.“This exhibition gives an insight into his early le in Hoy, as well, as his time in the RAF and the excitement of being in the London music scene during the ‘swinging sixties’.“I think it is a true reflection of the times he lived in and I hope it will interest the folk who see it.”The Orkney Museum is open Monday to Saturday, .am-.pm, .pm-pm.

And, just to be clear, it would be equally as seriousthe teenager in question had been a girl.It is likely there is cross-party agreement that the -year-old Mackay should now stand down as MSP for Renfrewshire North and West. However, Nicola Sturgeon was right when she said that “no matter how upset and shocked all of us are in these situations, there’s a need for due process”.Despite the scale of the justied outrage, the full facts need to be established in a calm and considered way. After all, there may be questions for others to answer.It has long been known that those in positions of power will sometimes abuse it, but the MeToo movement should have spelt out the full consequences to anyone failing to grasp them.Once such conduct might have been brushed under the carpet, but society has changed, considerably and for the better, in refusing to tolerate it.MSPs are the democratically elected leaders of this country and their actions must be beyond reproach. It is, or at least should be, part of their job to send a message to those in positions of power in wider society about what is and is not acceptable behaviour.And an MSP, let alone a Cabinet minister, sending scores of unsolicited messages of the type described to a -year-old is, in the words of the First Minister, “unacceptable”.

There are now no more excuses.“We need a clear understanding of when RET and cheaper fares will be delivered for the Northern Isles. It is high time that passengers and businesses are treated justly.”Conservative list MSP Jamie Halcro Johnston said the government still had questions to answer over the ferry contract.

I already knew that the library held old copies of newspapers from previous research but I was unaware of the sheer volume of information available, and the fact that the library holds documents dating back to the early s.The open day allowed members of the public to come in, ask questions, get to know the department and find out how to use the resources to discover their family history and also the story of Ballymena‘ was like years ago’s growth as a town.The Heritage Collection will mean dferent things to dferent people. Some will have a purpose for their search, such as finding a long lost relative or tracing a map of their home area from years gone by. Others will simply visit and get lost in the vast records, pictures and resources on offer.As a bit of a history buff, I was transported back to my university and school days as Daniel Brown, the senior library assistant for the Heritage Department spoke of some of the hidden treasures within the library.He said past records of the old workhouse are available, giving an extraordinary insight into who was actually in the dreaded facility down through the years, and also into the meetings held by some of the officers.We have artefacts dating back hundreds of years. Some are very valuable to us today, such as a complete map of the original Adair estate from  as much can be learned from this. We also have lots of interesting memorabilia including war rationing books and images of the Queens visit to Ballymena after her coronation.Daniel, who has a personal interest in history, really enjoys showing people around the department, whether they be locals or from further afield.He told me: Weve had many tourists come in, especially Americans who are keen to learn more about their ancestry and research old family names. Its interesting looking back and helping people discover where they come from!You can also trace old church history through births, deaths and marriages, communion and membership rolls and even church offerings.It was down this path that I met Mary Carson and Anne McCaughey as they browsed through the pew rental records of Buckna Presbyterian Church dating back to .Both ladies are members of the Broughshane History Society and were looking through the old records searching for ious recognisable names, however their inidual interest in local and family history was not hard to see.Mary spoke about tracing her family tree and how her curiosity was fuelled by seeing two old pictures of her grandparents at her aunt’s house.She followed rthe trail to a local heritage collection where she was able to find out through old newspapers that her grandfather’s death had made front page news many years before.Her search also revealed that a family member she always believed to be her uncle actually turned out to be her cousin!Researching and delving into the past is so interesting in my opinion, and can also be rewarding, Mary told me. I have found out that Im related to, so many people I didnt know about.Anne agreed, and was full of praise for the resources available in the library. She recalled happy times of listening to older family members talk about the past but said it is often not like that today.Today the younger generation dont seem to be as interested. They are busy working on phones or listening to their earphones that they dont seem to care whats going on around them or what has went before, so they are going to have to depend on information and places like this library to trace their past.As I left them to their church history search, my eyes were drawn to the vast arrays of cases containing maps along a wall.Here there are ordnance survey maps from the s right up to the s. There are also Grfith valuation maps for Co. Antrim and Co. Londonderry as well as th century town plans and local government maps - it really is a local history lovers dream!There are far too many resources to list, but some that need a mention include the vast photograph collection from around Co. Antrim as well as multiple information packs on local schools, people and places all arranged by location and subject.Two of the special collections housed in Ballymena library is the Langford Lodge Collection and the  census for parishes in Co. Antrim.The Collection Officer for the library is Maria Diamond, who is always on hand to direct the public to what they are looking for.She was keen to point out the many online resources made available by the library, so as your search doesnt have to end when you go home!Family history and researching your ancestry has really taken off in the last few years, Maria told me.Therefore we have listed many online resources that can help people trace their history in their own time, or when the library may be closed.Maria enjoys her job, and said she has noticed an increase in the number of people using the department.We are generally a busy department, and we try to always be on hand to help guide people to their desired field of study.“We also enjoy welcoming groups and school classes to the Heritage Collection and tailor the activities to their age or field of study. We have lots of resources for children, and a wealth of information on the local area and how it was affected during major events in history, such as the two world wars or the famine. Teachers or groups just need to get in touch to arrange a visit.I was thoroughly impressed by my visit to the local studies department.Yes, I knew alot of information was available, however I was overwhelmed by the sheer volume of resources, how far back it dated and the way in which it was displayed.No matter what period you are interested in, or what local area there is sure to be some information that will aid your study.My visit to the Cultural heritage open day may have been for business, but my next visit to discover Ballymena of old will more than likely be for pleasure!

He attended St Mary’s Primary School in Portglenone and St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena.Speaking about his early involvement in music, he said: My parents didn’t play but they sent all of us to music and dancing for years and drove us to lessons and events every night of the week, I owe them a lot for that. They had a keen interest and were very supportive.I was sent to the local Comhaltas Ceoltoacuteiriacute Eacuteireannbranch in Portglenone when I was around .I started tin whistle classes with the late John Kennedy first, then progressed onto the button accordion with Tommy Doherty.My parents then started taking us to The Crosskey’s Inn every week for sessions and I also joined the Comahltas branch there too.That place had a huge effect on me, there were great musicians there of all ages and they really helped cultivate my interest growing up. I still go there when I can.As part of the Crosskeys Comhaltas we won many All-Irelands. We had a great gang at the time along with dedicated parents that were also passionate about the music.Going to the Fleadhs was as much about socialising with other kids in music as it was competing. We got up to all sorts of ilment that I won’t get into here!I started on the tin whistle, moved to button accordion then started to teach myself guitar when I was . I quickly became obsessed with the guitar.Its such a versatile instrument and one that you can literally play or learn any style of music on.From playing the guitar I was able to give a few other stringed instruments a go - bouzouki, tenor guitar, bass, electric guitar.Its not a big stretch to adapt the same skills on guitar over to other instruments, and its nice to have dferent colours available, especially when writing.Sometimes I write on the piano - because I’m not great at playing piano, you’re forced to think dferently and that can work in your favour.In terms of my influences, for the accordion it would be Mairtin OConnor or Dermot Byrne. For the guitar, its harder to narrow it down, but three that stand out are Arty Mc Glynn, Steve Cooney and John Doyle. My own style is probably some hybrid mix of those three.I have worked with Grammy nominated fiddler Liz Carroll, folk singer Karan Casey, Duke Special, Liam O’Maonlaiand Bela Fleck.I am involved with ‘Ulaid’ with John Mc Sherry and Donal O’Connor, and Scottish group ‘Fiddlers Bid’. As a guitar player I regularly work with a lot of other traditional bands including Lunasa, Flook, Buille, and the Mairtin O’Connor Band.BEOGABeoga was formed while Seaacuten was a pupil at St Louis Grammar School.He continued: At St Louis, I was involved with the Traditional Group the whole time I was there.Frank Cassidy directed it and was always very encouraging. We competed in ‘Slogadh’ competitionsand had great craic travelling around to the dferent competitions.Beoga was formed around this time and the teachers were very understanding about me missing days here and there to play gigs.I used to go to the States for these long weekends and be catching up on school work on the plane home.Whilst at St Louis I never actually studied music as an option. I didn’t have a classical background and for some reason never thought it would be a viable career option!Whilst studying for my A levels, I started to become really obsessed with music and decided that was it - I couldn’t even think about doing anything .Up until that point I was looking at careers in IT. I heard about a new course in University of Limerick offering a degree in Irish music, that didn’t require A level music, you just had to go for an interview and perform.I got in anyway and I met Niamh there. We were in the same class and became big pals and she ended up joining the band.She’s an amazing fiddle player and singer and I’m lucky to have found her!ED SHEERANBeoga have been together for around  years and they have been afforded the opportunity to travel the world doing what they love.Seaacuten said: We’ve toured a lot around Europe and North America but have also been lucky to tour in more exotic places like Japan, Australia and Russia. We’re travelling a bit less now, thankfully, but at one stage I was definitely seeing more of the band than my own family.One of the biggest audiences the band have performed to was a , strong crowd at the Glastonbury festival in  alongside Ed Sheeran.Sheeran, whose grandparents hail from the Emerald Isle, is well-known for his love of Irish traditional and folk music, even recording a version of The Parting Glass.He has said that one of his earliest musical memories is listening to the Irish Heartbeat album by Van Morrison and The Chieftains and he is also a fan of The Bothy Band and Planxty. Close friend of the band, Foy Vance, shares the same record label as Sheeran and had been supporting him on tour. They had listened to a few of Beogas tunes on the road, and Ed reached out to the band to help with his album.Seaacuten explained: We went to over to his house in Suffolk for a couple of days. It was all very relaxed, he made everyone feel completely at ease.The weather was amazing so we were outside in the garden a lot. We played on four tracks and two made it to the album so we’re delighted.One of them, ‘Galway Girl’, came about just jamming in the garden outside the studio. He was completely sound, we stayed in his house and had a few beers and even played a game of football at one stage.Working with Ed has presented a lot of new opportunities to play and write with other artists.Our friend Foy Vance was the guy responsible for introducing us to Ed. We’ve written a good few songs with Foy now and will hopefully keep creating more with him, he’s an amazing singer and an even more amazing songwriter and is finally being recognised as such.We’ve also worked with Johnny McDaid on the songwriting and production side of things, although he’s been crazy busy since Snow Patrol started touring again.Just recently we’ve been writing a bit with Cormac Neeson from ‘The Answer’. The collaborations are really exciting to me, you just don’t know whats going to come out of a writing session but that buzz of finishing the day with a song is a real high.Seaacuten believes there is a great local traditional music scene stating: I think traditional music is stronger than ever.He encourages all age groups to get involved and give it a try, commenting: If I had any advice, it would be to not to get too worked up about competitions and instead focus more on the social side of the music.While competitions can be good to focus on something, it can put a lot of unnecessary pressure on kids.In his rare free time, Seaacuten has a purpose built recording studio in Portglenone called Bannview Studios.He has been recording for about  years and recently moved into his current space about five years ago.He said:I regularly engineer and produce other artists here, so that keeps me busy outside of the bands schedule.Beoga will be releasing a new album in the Spring. It will include singles released over the last few months along with some new songs and instrumentals that the group have been working on over the last year.Beogas latest release is called ‘Make a Mark’ and features Co. Down singer Ryan Mc Mullan.

I’ve written about music and been to a lot of concerts over the years. The list below is typical of the tracks that stand out in my memory. I haven’t mentioned the Small Faces or Bruce Springsteen, SLF or other old favourites. I like to hear a lot of contemporary music too. Starchild and the New Romantic for example - a NY soulster I came across last week. Locally, Brand New Friend from Castlerock, are an outstanding punk pop sound. Anyway, here goes…!. Town Called Malice - The Jam. Laser eyed social poetry from Weller, tight Tamla baseline from Foxton and finger clicking rhythm from Buckler. Classic mod. . The Highest Apple - Runrig. Spiritual Scots Gaelic song. Our wedding dance, along with Van the Man of course,  years ago. . This Beautul Day - Levi Jackson. I used to be a Northern Soul DJ and had quite a collection of original vinyl singles. I love the genre still. This track has it all: dance, clear gospel uplt, a black civil rights cry for hope. It’s worth hundreds. I once tried to buy it on eBay behind my we’s back. Thankfully the bid didn’t make it. Confession is good for the soul. . Kennedy - The Wedding Present. Indie student guitar based noise. Great band live from the late s. Still going. Much the same as Copper Blue by Sugar - another favorite indie band.. Live Forever - Oasis. Slightly later and closer to the football culture of which I was a part in my youth. I interviewed them twice for music fanzines before they were famous. Influenced greatly by the Stone Roses - another favourite band. . At Least That’s What You Said - Wilco. Existential American alternative musings. Another great band live. Profound sentiments from Jeff Tweedy.. So Danco Samba - Stan Getz. Much into jazz as I’ve aged. I love Mile Davis up to the late s. This track is gentle samba. Relaxing.. Prelude to Cello Solo No.  in G Major- Pierre Fournier. One of the most moving pieces of music I’ve ever heard. I feel unworthy when I hear it. It touches the eternal. . In the Hours - Emily Deloach, Incredible Grace. I listen to Christian praise a lot, it comes with the calling. This track oozes gratitude for the Gospel. Always make me thankful. I love City Alight songs and a Presbyterian praise group called Red Mountain.. Dig a Little Deeper - The Watson Twins. Smoky, sultry, southern Americana. Played this song driving through mid State Tennessee last year. Right song in the right place. Something like Lucinda Williams or Gillian Welch.

He has alerted the relevant authorities. The site is just yards from the St Gall’s GAC clubrooms. Belfast City Council waste bags, household fridges, cemetery headstones, construction rubble, wood and huge amounts of other waste have een dumped on to the land and the massive mound is sliding close to the Ballymurphy Stream.The land is known as Milltown Glen and is situated between Maguire’s Garage, Milltown Cemetery and the Bog Meadows.Michael Culbert of St Gall’s GAC said that the issue of land ownership needs to be claried. “There is a gateway that runs from Milltown Cemetery, a lane, and it’s that land that is being dumped on,” he said. “We want a clean environment, we care about the environment. We have all age groups at St Gall’s, from six-year-olds up and have been in this area for approximately  years. We have never seen the like of this. This is a beautul glen, you have the Bog Meadows and here it’s the epitome of fly tipping. This is going on in the heart of West Belfast and it’s not on. We need someone with responsibility to hold whoever is doing this to account for the contamination of this area. We don’t want the river polluted.“It needs to stop and it needs to be cleared up and now our local councillor Steven Corr has taken up this issue.”Ulster Wildle Nature Reserve Officer Deborah McLaughlin told the Andersonstown News that the dumping has got worse since the start of the New Year.“This is an absolute eyesore and I have contact DAERAin relation to it as a lot of the rubbish will end up in the stream,” she said. “We are concerned at the level of fly tipping going on and concerned for health and safety. DAERA are aware of the issue and at the minute we are waiting to hear back from them.”Local Sinn Féin Councillor Steven Corr said the illegal dumping is “destroying the landscape”.“What we are seeing is a localised environmental nightmare,” he went on. “We are only a few feet away from this stream being contaminated. I can’t get my head around why somebody thinks it’s ok to do this. There are lorry loads of rubbish being dumped down a riverbank, killing wildle as it goes. I’ve never seen anything like this, on this scale, in West Belfast. This is fly tipping on an industrial scale, there is industrial waste on the site, glass, headstones. There is confusion as to who is responsible for the land but we would be calling on the Rivers Agency and the NIEAto work with us. Belfast City Council have offered support as their bags are also being dumped on the site. This land needs to be secured as a matter of urgency.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"martin rings the bell for the final time","story":"THE beginning of February will mark the start of spring and change for one West Belfast primary school principal as he prepares to retire.Holy Child Primary School principal Martin Short, himself a past pupil of the Andersonstown school, will hear the bell ring for the last time this week as he calls an end to the role that he has held for the past  years.“I started at Holy Child in September , I’m a local guy, came from Slemish Way, my three brothers came here, my sister went here, my three grandchildren are at the school now,” he said.“For me to think back then that I’d be the Principal of the school, it never crossed my mind but I’m so proud.”Martin told the Andersonstown News that he always wanted to teach.“I got that from the teaching and education I received at Holy Child, at St Mary’s Grammar School. The expectations in Holy Child are as high as anywhere  in Belfast and that has continued on.”Martin said that there were many moments throughout his career at Holy Child that stand out.“Our standards in literacy and numeracy, I’m very, very proud of those. We received an exceptionally good inspection report in  where there were no areas for improvement.“I took great pride in the whole business of ‘opening up the school’, so that the children could come in earlier for breakfast club, afterschools clubs. I’ve enjoyed working with our parents and the links our school has with the local post primaries in the area.“I think I’ve improved the fabric of the building. I fought to get the new windows installed and the final jigsaw of that project will be completed next month with the new windows in the foyer. We had a new roof, new heating system.“We won the big Gaelic Raffo Cup last year which was a great achievement, our shows, our choir, I’ve always been very proud of the strong links with St Agnes’ parish.”Martin spoke of the challenges he faced as school head.“The big challenge was finance. Budgetary constraints. Also the complexities of the special educational needs that children now encounter and the school having to meet those needs, was a massive challenge – all the while not getting enough funding. The big challenge of mental health within children and the influence of social media. We were three years without an Executive, with no direction from the department and that was a challenge for the school.”While not sailing around the world or taking up golf as part of his retirement plans, Martin explained that he will still be assisting and helping other schools through advisory work with CCMS.“I’ll be onhand to tell people to basically not make the same mistakes I’ve made, we all make mistakes what about trying this, try that and don’t be worrying about that too much.“I have a photo in my office from when I was here as a child, it has always reminded me to keep my feet on the ground and that the children are the most important thing.”When it comes to not pulling into the Holy Child car park next week, Martin said it will be a time of “mixed emotions”.“I will be very sad to leave the children, to leave the staff, the staff have been brilliant, the parents have been brilliant and I will miss that. I’ve done two ‘cycles of seven’,  years but I will be in and out of the school. I’m emotionally attached to this building, I’ve been here since I was four and I’m  now. I’ve loved every minute of it.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"queens uni supporting the spar craic","story":"QUEEN’S University are the latest institution to show their support to the annual SPAR Craic K taking place on St Patrick’s Day throughout the city.Starting at the gates of City Hall, the route will take in the Gaeltacht Quarter as well as the prestigious university, Botanic Avenue and Gardens before the finish line at Ormeau Park.

The officers in attendance were advised to wait outside while hospital staff dealt with a public health matter. Shortly before pm, police were advised they could enter the hospital.SDLP MLA Mark H Durkan said staff are well trained and well equipped to deal with suspected cases.I have had contact with the Trust on Thursday night and attended a scheduled briefing this morning, he said. I have been reassured that they do have the people and the practice in place to deal with any suspected cases of coronavirus that present.My thoughts are with the family who find themselves at the centre of this storm through no fault of their own. A spokesperson for the Department of Health said: We would like to again assure the public that plans are in place to deal with a positive test for coronavirus in Northern Ireland when it occurs. It is also inevitable that a number of people will continue to be tested on a precautionary basis in the weeks ahead and it is important to keep these tests in perspective. A test does not mean that a positive result is expected or likely. As of February , a total of  tests were concluded across the UK, of which  were confirmed negative and three positive.Dferent precautionary measures are taken as part of the testing protocols. This can include protective clothing for health and social care staff - for their protection and protection of the wider public. Again, the use of protective clothing should not be taken as an indication that a positive test is expected.Three patients in England have tested positive for coronavirus.A spokesperson for the Western Health and Social Care Trust said: We do not comment on the inidual treatment and care of our patients, for all information and guidance regarding the coronavirus please visit www.publichealth.hscni.net.Belfast Related ContentNorthern IrelandCoronavirus: Northern Ireland hospital was on #lockdown# as baby testedA baby is being tested for suspected coronavirus at Altnagelvin Hospital in Londonderry.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news b .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dcea--e-f-cceb_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news b .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dcea--e-f-cceb_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news b .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dcea--e-f-cceb_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news b .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dcea--e-f-cceb_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news b .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dcea--e-f-cceb_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"WorldAnger in China over death of doctor reprimanded for warning about coronavirusThe death of a doctor who was reprimanded for warning about China’s new coronavirus has triggered fury that communist authorities put politics above public safety.FeaturesI#ll wait a long time before ing to China, says Tyrone teacher who escaped coronavirus-hit WuhanI was born in Dungannon in  and in my early years I was an incredibly shy person.

When something is so integral to yourself, that was very dficult, he said.You have a constant internal dialogue and you hope it will change and then you find out that you just have to live with it. I didn#t know anybody who was gay at that stage. It is a very isolated situation to be in.Meeting his future we at University of Ulster when the pair were students at the age of , the couple eventually had one son. Mr Creelan also forged a career within the RUC and PSNI, eventually reaching the rank of inspector, before his retirement a number of years ago.Mr Creelan explained that it was the death of close gay friend in the force, Constable Darren Bradshaw, who was murdered in May , which prompted him to announce his inner feelings to his family.I guess it was in . I was in the police at that stage. For me I had wanted to do it for a long time, but it was the death of Darren and having to deal with that professionally that prompted me, he said.I was talking to my we about him and his death and that#s when we dealt with things.Her family reacted really badly at the time. We were still living together and trying to make things work. Once her family had found out, that became impossible. I was already not involved with my own family.You think you can make it work and when we separated our friends didn#t know why. I suppose I thought maybe she might know, but she had no idea whatsoever. It was a very brutal discovery.He added: When it happened, I had a very negative reaction and so it cost a lot in terms of friends and family at the time. With me, nothing had been going on other than what was in my head. My son would have been about nine at that time.My we and I had - child care and eventually when he was ready and wanted to ask the questions, he was told what the situation was.As a parent I didn#t change. Just as I took being married seriously, I took the job of being a parent seriously.From the dficult days of the past, Vincent now celebrates the immensely positive relationship he has with his son and grandson.I am in the very privileged position of being gay and being a parent and grandfather. I have a really great le with my partner, he said.I had a great career and I have a lovely family. As a -year-old now, the journey I have had the past  years is amazing. I am lucky I have a son who is  now and is one of my best friends. I look after my grandson very regularly.In that regard I am a firm believer that le gets better when you come out.Giving his reaction to ITV host Schofield public announcement on Friday, the Newtownards man said the support shown to Mr Schofield could shine a light for others.He has obviously been having those discussions with his family, which is a mature thing to do, he added.I do think he is in a great position to really say that this is a good, positive thing.

irish general election","story":"President Michael D Higgins and his we Sabina Higgins  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappPresident Michael D Higgins and his we Sabina Higgins By David Young, Michael McHugh and Aine McMahon, PAFebruary   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailIreland’s President and the main political leaders have cast their votes in one of the most unpredictable General Elections for years.The country is having its first Saturday parliamentary poll in more than a century.The voting pattern is unlikely to follow the flow of a week-day election, making turn out harder to assess.There were conflicting reports by early Saturday evening, with many areas reporting a brisk voting pace through the day – but Taoiseach Leo Varadkar claiming the numbers  going to the polls were actually low.Sinn Fein could be poised to challenge the -year duopoly of the state’s two main parties, Fianna Fail and Fine Gael, and the process of forming a coalition Government could be challenging, opinion polls suggest.President Michael D Higgins was accompanied by his we Sabina at a Dublin polling station.Micheal Martin, the leader of main opposition party Fianna Fail, voted with his we, daughter and two sons early on Saturday morning in Co Cork in the south.Fine Gael leader Mr Varadkar is facing a dficult battle to hang on to power – recent polls put his party behind Fianna Fail and Sinn Fein.He brought a box of Roses sweets for count staff at his polling station in west Dublin.Today is the day that people are in charge and every single vote countsMary-Lou McDonaldSinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald also cast her vote in the capital on an “important” day.She said: “Today is the day that people are in charge and every single vote counts.“People have told us throughout this campaign that they want change, that they want a change in our presentation and they want a change in government, so I am saying to people please come out today and vote for a change.“Bring your family, your neighbours and friends and come down and use your vote – today is your day.” vw,vw,px, px\"Fianna Fail leader Micheal Martin and family vote at St Anthony’s Boys National School in Ballinlough, Cork In Co Wicklow, south of Dublin, average turnout by Saturday afternoon had reached just over %, an electoral official said.Poor weather conditions caused by Storm Ciara and the Ireland rugby international were among other factors that could influence voters’ decisions on whether to enter the booths.In the last major survey of the electorate before polling day, Sinn Fein was leading the popularity stakes on %, with Fianna Fail second on % and Mr Varadkar’s party on %.If those levels of support are borne out when counting begins on Sunday, it would herald a major breakthrough for Sinn Fein south of the border.The odds would still be stacked against Ms McDonald leading the next government as Taoiseach since Sinn Fein only fielded  candidates in the race for the Dail parliament’s  seats. vw,vw,px, px\"Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald, with local councillor Seamas McGrattan, votes at St Joseph’s School in Dublin No party is expected to reach the -seat threshold to enable it to govern on its own, and a coalition administration of some complexion is almost inevitable.Sinn Fein may be unable to find enough like-minded left-leaning allies to form a workable government.Fianna Fail and Fine Gael are both centre-right in outlook and appeal to middle Ireland so have unequivocally ruled out any partnership with Sinn Fein.For either to change position on coalition partners would represent a major U-turn.If that case Sinn Fein would be unlikely to secure a place in the next government. vw,vw,px, px\"Voting is under way across Ireland Fianna Fail topped the opinion polls early in the campaign, and leader Mr Martin could yet emerge as the next Taoiseach.Mr Varadkar, meanwhile, will be hoping his administration’s economic record and handling of the Brexit process will convince enough voters to renew his tenure in Government Buildings.Brexit did not feature prominently in a campaign dominated by domestic issues like spiralling rental prices, record-breaking homeless numbers, controversy over the state pension age and a struggling health service.There appears to be a mood for change and Sinn Fein could attract support from younger voters who want to end Fine Gael’s nine years in power but are unwilling to trust Fianna Fail again after the financial crash that tarnished its last term of office.PARelated Content and Pat Breen , holding his

Creator, Tony McCourt, , said a similar Facebook page exists for the Brandywell area so he felt it was only right to set one up for Creggan.  Within a day it had , members and less than a week later it has amassed over ,. Built in the s, Creggan is one of Derry’s best-known estates. It has been home to an abundance of artistic and sporting talent, including Olympic athletes, a Eurovision winner, a Top Ten rock band and international footballers. googletag.cmd.push In the late s and early s, Creggan became a byword for political resistance all over the world. On the Memories of Creggan Facebook page, people have been sharing cherished photos of relatives, historically signicant portraits of the Troubles, images of friends playing on the street, tales of famed characters from the estate, all sorts of myths and legends true and untrue, and everything in between. Former Creggan residents who have emigrated all over the world, including those from America and Australia, have joined the page to reminisce and share old tales from their childhood. “Everybody is enjoying it,” Tony explained, “they’re all sharing old memories.” googletag.cmd.push Friends contacted Tony to tell him that they can’t get their mothers off the page, one of the ladies is -years-old and is “loving all the old photos so much”. He added: “They’ve said they’re getting no housework done and no wains are being watched because they’re all too busy on the page. People are talking about their schooldays and friends who haven’t been in touch for many years are reconnecting.”  Memories Tony spent most of his childhood in Creggan and lived there until he got married at the age of . His brother, Peggy, still lives in Creggan and Tony has happy memories of “great neighbours and friends”. “The page brings back good memories. Nobody had anything but everybody shared what they had with each other.” The Troubles were never far from peoples’ minds, and people had their own troubles, but Tony prefers to recall the joyful times. “There was a lot of heartbreak at that time. But I like to remember all the positive experiences I had growing up. Playing football in the street all day when there were barely any cars around. “I remember the first TV on the street, it was the Kennedy’s and we used to go in to watch the FA Cup final. I also remember watching Popeye and the Lone Ranger. “I had a bad leg at one time and I remember a friend of mines carrying me to Grianan Fort and back again.” Moving forward, Tony would simply like to see people use the page in a positive way. “There are no real rules, we’re just asking people to keep it clean and to refrain from any insults. “Everyone is finding it funny going through all the old photos and that’s what it’s all about.” With that said Tony was off to the attic to unearth a few more boxes of photographic treasures from his boyhood.  ‘Heroes’ Peggy McCourt has lived in Creggan Heights for sixty-two years, asked what the estate means to him, he proclaimed: “Creggan means community.” He explained: “It was tight-knit no one had very much but what they had they shared be it a cup of milk to a drop of sugar, or can you lend me ma three slices of bread. “We all grew up in the Creggan, most of the families came from the Springtown Camp so hardship was a way of le but they made sure their wains were fed and watered, even going without themselves. “Then came the civil rights movement, then a full-blown war on the streets but again the Creggan community rallied around those who were affected by the conflict. “So many young people were first interned just because they were Catholic, many were arrested, put though interrogation centres and ended up in prison.” Peggy continued: “The hunger strikes took their toll on many families but no matter what went on Creggan grew into the best estate in Derry – in the world. “Growing up was hard at the time we lost so many friends and family members but it was a fun place to grow up, friendships formed that still last to this day. The friends I had sixty odd years ago are as strong as when we first met.  “No video games, all street games, football, rounders, even cricket, hopscotch, all these plus many more sitting out till  or  telling ghost stories, then you ran home the living day lights scared out of you. “Creggan is more than a council estate, its a way of le, its in your blood, we don’t even have to look anywhere for heroes, Creggan is full of them they are called ma’s and da’s.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Derry dominated the final quarter of normal time but seven wides in the last ten minutes, including an Aidan McCluskey effort that clearly went inside the post, saw the home side fail to translate their control into a winner.

The Fermanagh keeper denied Doherty a second goal in the next attack, turning his effort over the bar. The Glen man added three further scores - including a sweet outside of the boot effort to cement the win. Derry elected to play against the breeze and for  minutes of the first half, they played a text book possession game against a gale force wind.

This was my fit. The gratication and sense of fulfilment in helping others became a part of me. I knew I could do this, loved doing it and I did not want to stop here. I knew that feeling of being in a corporate environment and feeling stressed, overworked and unfulfilled and being able to approach and work with iniduals and groups who were in the same position and offer them a road to productivity and happiness in their role was le changing. I wanted to do more. In the Secret Bob Proctor was the clear definitive practitioner for me. I got in touch with the Proctor Gallagher Institute and trained in becoming a PGI Consultant The programmes set by Bob Proctor and Sandy Gallagher are some of the most effective and efficient I have ever seen and I was thrilled to become a part of it and be able to offer coaching to clients in both the U.S and Ireland. I recently was promoted within this company to Senior Coach and Account Executive which now enables me to offer some of the most elite personal development programmes PGI has to offer. Working alongside these esteemed colleagues has been a huge ambition of mine and I have learned so many invaluable skills and ideologies that I cannot wait to share with more and more clients whether personal or in a group setting. As my journey to date describes, I have achieved some great things and I am still achieving and believing every day. But there has been for quite some time, a feeling of wanting to offer something back home. I often would hear stories in the news, and reports from my hometown Derry in Ireland of the suicide epidemic which has been playing on my mind for quite some time. It is with such sadness and despair that I have felt the strong urge to help in some way. Derry is such a beautul town steeped in wonderful facts of history and monument but there is a huge cry for help and I simply cannot and will not ignore this. In understanding these facts, I have purchased a building in the city and will be hosting mindset workshops for both adults and children in the near future. It is never too early to implement positivity and to teach the importance of le and its value. In addition to this my foundation for suicide prevention is well underway as I have been working constructively with a team of like minded professionals from the city in order to structure and further develop and implement this project which I know in my heart will instil a new light of positivity and hope for those going through tough times and needing some guidance. My connection to Derry has been growing as of lately and I have found myself travelling back and forward trying to help in ious ways. Myself alongside Catrina Crillyhave set up “Bee Me LTD” which is the first children’s personal development company of its kind. We will be launching a child friendly app and host Bee Me Camps which will have a fun and friendly environment where children will learn about self-image, empowerment, positivity and how thoughts create things. We’re excited about this project and cannot wait to see it develop. My journey has come with its teachings, its blessings and its le changing moments and I for one would not change any of it. I am at this point in my le where I am seeing my dreams come to reality. I am helping others to see THEIR dreams and make them a reality. My work is not work for me anymore, it is my passion and I feel incredibly lucky to wake up everyday to the le I have and to be able to share my teachings that will help my clients achieve the le they too want. It is my pleasure and my honour. The world is ours and we can think it into whatever we want it to be. And together, we are making it happen.

Born and raised in Derry until the age of , I always had a calling for adventure and opportunity, and it was at this stage in my le I took a huge leap of faith and went in chase of the American Dream. A little Irish girl lost in the big city of New York awaiting my immigration papers is where I learned so many le lessons and character building. At the age of  I stumbled upon a movie The Secret which would eventually change my le and my direction. googletag.cmd.push This movie for me was a beginning, an awakeningyou will. I had opened my eyes to a whole new world of self-belief, ambitions and possibilities. At the age of  I opened my first business which was a Health Care Call Centre. Alongside this I worked for a healthcare administration business which was family run and set up by my mother in New York. Whilst I found great business acumen and skillset in my work, it took its toll on me. The corporate pace and stress fuelled environment was not my fit so I sold my shares in the family business and sold my own business. googletag.cmd.push This was an important and pivotal moment for me in my le where I would embark on a journey of self-discovery and promise. From the beginning of le as I know it until now, I have never known fulfilment like being a mom. Being we to my husband, Dr Frank Dos Santos, and mother to our gorgeous and amazing children and brought me happiness like no other and for this I am eternally blessed and grateful. The le we share together is precious and I value this every day. There came a point for me personally, where I had reached that feeling of fulfilment and happiness and these feelings are what I embrace and evoke everyday in le.

Since diagnosis they have received the much needed help and support of Goldenhar UK, a charity run by families and volunteers affected by the extremely rare syndrome.Now Aodhans uncle hopes to be able to give something back by raising cash and swapping the backdrop of the Celtic Park for the Efel Tower in a fundraising drive.Marty told the County Derry Post: “It’s a very rare condition – I think  in  suffer from it and it’s visible from birth.“Obviously, neither my sister nor I had ever heard of it but she noticed that something wasn’t right. The doctors didn’t pick up on it but I suppose the condition is so rare that they hadn’t seen it before.“My sister had to push but the doctors then realised and to be fair to them they’ve been more than helpful. Some have come over from England to see Aodhan.The John Mitchels Claudy captain added: “It will affect the development of bones like his spine, but they won’t know completely until he grows up and they see more and more how it’s affecting him.“He will have to go through a few minor surgeries just to correct a few things and whenever he starts learning to stand, it’ll affect him that way, but he’s now eight months old and is developing into a happy, lively wee child.”Goldenhar Syndrome is so rare that initially Marty’s sister Catherine assumed they were alone in being affected in Northern Ireland, but since he posted his fundraising efforts online, others have been in touch.“My sister didn’t know that there was anyone  in Northern Ireland with the condition, but as soon as I put up the fundraiser, we’ve been contacted by a local lady who was able to provide my sister with a lot of information and they’re actually meeting up now.“I think there are cases in Northern Ireland but they don’t have a  or a chance to talk about it or help each other.”Marty opted for the Paris marathon despite other, closer alternatives and he is looking forward to taking on the challenge in its picturesque surroundings.“Ah, it was just more attractive. I don’t like running anyway but I just thought ‘why not ’ London is nearly impossible to get into so the Paris one was easy enough to get into and it’s probably nicer to run round than London.My mum and dad are hoping to go and my we, children and her family are all going. My sister-in-law Laureen , who lives in London, has actually decided she’s going to do it as well.“I’ve started training unfortunately, it’s not great at this time of year because it’s so dark, but it’ll give me a bit of an aim – it’s only another  or  weeks away! googletag.cmd.push “With the Gaelic season just being over, the fitness isn’t too bad – Christmas wasn’t too sore on me!” If you want to support Marty in his challenge, you can read his story and donate via the following Just Giving link: https:www.justgiving fundraising martin-donaghy  googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

After the bell had sounded, and after consulting with the ringside physician, referee Joel Scobie stopped the bout. It was a quicker than expected victory for Coyle who wanted the contest to go beyond one round.“Im always glad to have another stoppage but I wish it had gone on longer,” he admitted. “He didnt come out for round two. He had to retire on the stool after the first round. My first round was just feeling him out, and working the jab andanything follows up then just finish it, but I never got the opportunity for that. I never got the opportunity to show how well prepared I was. I came home unscathed and fresh with no injuries. I didnt even get hit once in the whole round so were ready to go again.”Dumas came into the fight with a decent reputation and even boasted twice as many knock outs as his opponent. But whilst his reputation preceded him, the reality turned out to be much dferent.“To be honest I expected him to come straight at me after the first bell went but he went onto the back foot,” Coyle continued. “My plan was to put him on the back foot and for him to come at me which would have suited me because he would have walked on to my shots. “He took me by surprise by going on the back foot. Maybe he thought I was a lot bigger than he expected or maybe, when I threw the jab, he thought he had to do something dferent. He didnt hit me so I never felt any power. Anything he did throw my footwork was too fast and he didnt land a glove. As soon as he threw, I wasnt there. I was just in and out, in and out. He couldnt hit me.” googletag.cmd.push Another stepIt may have been over much too soon for Coyles liking, but regardless, it is another step in the right direction for the -year old, who is expecting big things in . “Its just part of the game,” he stated. “Its another knock out on my record which is good for me. I put in over  rounds of sparring in the build up as well so its not to say that Im not getting the rounds. I put the hard graft in the gym so I have those rounds under my belt anyway. Ill take the TKO but I wanted to showcase everything I have been working on over the last three months.”Coyle has no objections to getting back into the ring again so soon, and having stopped his last two opponents in double quick time, he is eager to get as much in-ring experience as possible. “Thats the next step. I would like to be back quickly. I want to get the rounds in. Ive only had three rounds in nine months. In that case I would like to get a fight just for the rounds. It wasnt in the plans butwe get the go ahead well take it.“The fight in the summer is going to be a massive step because I want to break into the top ten or top five in the world.” googletag.cmd.push SponsorsConnor would like to thank the following sponsors for their continued support Classique Floor Designs, The Thirsty Goat, Frankie Ramsey’s, The Bentley Bar, Paul’s Butchers, Brooklands Fencing, Sandwich Co , RJB Tiling, Curley’s Cars and Evolve Clothing official.

The bypass is the single biggest road scheme ever proposed for the district.Roads officials have previously insisted that the planned scheme will greatly benefit both strategic and local road users by reducing journey times and improving road safety. In addition, officials are confident that the schemersquos economic assessment demonstrates that the bypass would provide a good economic .Designed to alleviate chronic town centre congestion in Ballynahinch and along the main approach roads to the town, major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the bypass where major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane.Cllr Walker argued that the Newry, Mourne and Down area has missed out on signicant roads funding for decades, with many major schemes constructed in other parts of the Province.ldquoI believe the time has come for this council to demand its fair share of infrastructure funding, he declared. ldquoI have been a councillor for over  years and the bypass issue has been raised during every one of them.ldquoThe government department has now moved to a position with all its ducks in this particular scheme now in a row. The public enquiry has been completed and the only thing delaying the scheme is funding.Cllr Walker said he believed that with the Assembly restored and a local minister at the helm of the Department for Infrastructure, the council needs to seek an urgent meeting with Ms Mallon to seek the immediate release of bypass funding to not only alleviate town centre congestion in Ballynahinch, but provide a major boost for the wider South Down area, in particular, tourism.Slieve Croob councillor, Cathy Mason, described the market town as the ldquogateway to the wider South Down area through which all traffic must pass, including HGVs.ldquoThis not only frustrates drivers who are part of the through traffic, but increases tension and danger for those living, shopping and working in the town. The proposed bypass will run round the eastern periphery of the town with a grade-separated junction at the Crossgar Road, she continued.ldquoHousing is also being permitted up to the line of the planned new road and includes the potential for a park and ride site. The bypass has been proposed since the s and for decades local community and political representatives from all parties have demanded this new road.Cllr Mason said the new infrastructure minister must signal the start of work on the multi-million pound road scheme as soon as possible.She said that in , the then Infrastructure Minister Chris Hazzard announced his decision to proceed with the bypass proposal and instructed officials to continue to prioritise this scheme until completion unless instructed otherwise by a new minister. Cllr Mason continued: ldquoWith the infrastructure minister now in place following the restoration of Stormont, funding should now be signed off and construction allowed to commence as soon as possible.She said the tender process for construction should begin as soon as possible, suggesting there is no reason why construction cannot commence this time next year, with the scheme complete and open to vehicles by .Rowallane councillor Robert Burgess is also keen to see work on the bypass get underway and hopes that the new infrastructure minister will also formally sign off the scheme to upgrade the final section of the A between Doranrsquos Rock and Rowallane Garden in Saintfield.ldquoThe bypass is critically important to the social and economic regeneration of not only Ballynahinch but the wider South Down area, he said.Cllr Burgess added: ldquoIn addition, the A is the main link between Downpatrick and Belfast and while there have been ious upgrades, the section between Doranrsquos Rock and Rowallane Garden is simply not suitable for the huge volume of traffic which uses this busy road. Itrsquos upgrade is also a priority..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th February 2020 Caroline.jpg","title":"Caroline’s love of Newcastle beach inspires St Patrick Centre exhibition  ","story":"A NEWCASTLE artistrsquos fascination with the townrsquos famous beach has inspired her latest exhibition.Caroline Williamson is showing over  pieces of her work throughout February at the St Patrickrsquos Centre in Downpatrick.Just opened this week, Caroline said that the exhibition is called lsquoShell Sounds from the Shorersquo.She said: ldquoOne of my fondest memories is walking down the Newcastle beach, collecting shells with my grandmother.

The pick of those four has now been decided after years of exploratory talks and detailed investigations. Ironically, the final choice is of a route which dfers only slightly from one suggested by the  Downpatrick Area Plan.The new road will begin, effectively, from the entrance to the Meadowlands housing estate in Church Street and will run behind existing Church Street premises on a widening parallel, into the town centre.It will emerge onto the lower part of Scotch Street, across the rear of the Town Hall building and into Irish Street. Use of the present entrance to the new Irish Street car park will probably be made to swing the road through the rear of Market Street into St Patrickrsquos Avenue and on into the Ballydugan Road.KILLYLEAGH mdash A row is brewing in Killyleagh over proposals to open a pool hall in the townrsquos High Street.Angry residents in the area have drawn up a petition objecting to it being opened because they say that area has already suffered severely at the hands of vandals.Local councillor, Mr Sam Osborne, explained that  objectors had signed the petition because they were concerned that the pool hall would bring with it a sinister element.He said people in the immediate vicinity of the empty premises to be turned into a pool room were afraid to go to bed at the weekends and they fear this could escalate.Mr Osborne stressed he did not object to the idea of the pool room, he hoped it would take young people off the street, but he felt it was being sited in the wrong area of town.BALLYHORNAN mdash Plannersrsquo refusal to allow a new caravan site at Ballyhornan will have a major effect on Down Councilrsquos development programmes for the area, it was claimed this week.The claim was made by Downpatrick councillor, Mr Eddie McGrady, who said planners were wrong to issue such a decision until a general development policy had been worked out.Mr McGrady also said he could not understand why there should not be potential for a new holiday location on the Lecale coast, where a number of such locations already existed.He stressed that in the absence of an Area Plan the council should have a policy on this.A planning spokesman confirmed there would be a policy on locations for caravan development when the area plan was published.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Mrs Margaret Atkins, we of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr Humphrey Atkins, made a surprise visit to the Plessey Telecommunications factory in Ballynahinch on Tuesday morning.While her husband was at Stormont trying to thrash out the provincersquos problems in the round table talks, Mrs Atkins was having an extensive two-hour tour of the factory, under the guidance of senior Plessey officials.Mrs Atkins arrived shortly after .am and after a y talk with senior management, including Mr Harold Davies, regional director, and Mr Gerry OrsquoNeill, manager at Ballynahinch, she was shown around the factory.She met and spoke to many of the factoryrsquos -plus employees, sharing jokes and listening and enquiring about what kind of work was done.CROSSGAR mdash Sgt Matthew Cuffey, of st Crossgar Boysrsquo Brigade, has won the Northern Ireland Squad Commanderrsquos Shield at the annual squad drill finals in Omagh on Saturday.Matthew and the st Crossgar Company were representing Down Battalion at the finals, and although the squad finished third mdash three points behind hat-trick winners st Castlederg mdash there was some consolation in the squad commanderrsquos success.This very high honour for Down Battalion and indeed, has been won four times previously by Crossgar boys since the competitionrsquos inception in .Down Battalion officers were delighted at the results, and congratulations are extended to the companyrsquos captain, Mr R Dickson, and drill officers, Mr D Nesbitt, and to the boys themselves.DUNDRUM mdash The controversy over whether a section of lane way in Dundrum would remain open is almost over mdash and itrsquos now virtually certain that it will not be closed.Members of the Dundrum and District Community Committee were told of this at their monthly meeting in the Bay Inn on Tuesday night by the secretary, who read letters received from the estate agents and solicitors of the Lord Downshire Estate, who previously owned the lane.The controversy, highlighted by the Recorder last week, had flared up when local residents sensed Mr Albert Donnelly, the owner of the caravan sites on either side of the lane, which runs from Castle Hill to the junction with the Dromara Road, was preparing to close the lane.Pillars had been erected on the lane and residents were adamant gates would not be put up to block their right of way. The lane had been sold by Lord Downshirersquos estate to Mr Donnelly, but there had been some doubt whether a right of way clause had been ed.This has now been cleared up by the letters from Lord Downshirersquos estate agents and solicitors, who pointed out that the lane way had been sold but that the right of way was reserved.

I would just like to thank Air Ambulance NI for all that they have done for me.Her mum explained that she desperately tried to avoid the collision.ldquoI saw her in the last two or three secondshellip and I tried to drive into the hedge but a telegraph pole stopped me and Ellie hit the front of my vehicle with the quad, she recalled.The sound of the collision has left an indelible mark on her.Kerry Anderson, head of fundraising for Air Ambulance NI, said the organisation is so glad to hear that Ellie is making such great strides in her recovery and that the medical team was able to provide her with the urgent medical care she needed.ldquoAir Ambulance NI is a vital service that depends on public donations, Kerry explained.ldquoIt costs pound, per day to keep our helicopter in the sky and accidents like this prove how important that is.The air ambulance operates seven days a week for  hours and since its first mission in July , it has responded to to more than , call-outs..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th February 2020 Sofley.jpg","title":"Sofley doubles up for Saintfield aces as Rec get the boot  ","story":"SAINTFIELD United welcomed Wellington Rec to Pigeon Hill on a breezy afternoon, looking to build on a run of strong performances.Neither team gave anything away in the early exchanges and it took a moment of magic from James Sofley to break the deadlock, as he cut in from the right onto his left foot and fired a thunderbolt into the top corner.This gave the hosts a lt as they were well on top for the next  minutes, but they failed to capitalise with another goal.A sloppy ending to the half from both teams meant that the scoreline remained - at the break.The second half began with the visitors pushing to get onto level terms and they were nearly rewarded with Harper being called into action to make a smart save low to his left.Minutes later he was beaten, but the ball struck the crossbar.

The former SDLP councillor was Mr McGradyrsquos election agent.Mr Doris joined the former Downpatrick Urban District Council and was re-elected to Down Council in  and served as the districtrsquos first citizen in  .He retained his seat during several council elections and retired from the council when it formally went out of business in  when it merged with its neighbour in Newry and Mourne to become one of  new super councils.Tributes to Mr Doris have been paid by SDLP leader Colum Eastwood, South Down MLA Colin McGrath, former South Down MP Baroness Margaret Ritchie and fomer council colleague Dermot Curran.Tributes have also been paid by Rowallane DUP councillor Billy Walker and UUPrsquos Robert Burgess.Mr Eastwood paid tribute to the le and legacy of Mr Doris whom he described as an ldquoSDLP stalwart and founding party member.ldquoJohn lived his le in service of others, continued the party leader.ldquoHe had a deep passion for his community of Downpatrick, which he represented with dignity for many years, as councillor and Down Council chairman. John was also the election agent for former South Down MP Eddie McGrady and played a key role in the seismic election in which Eddie unseated Enoch Powell.Mr Eastwood said in addition to his love for his community and constituents, Mr Doris was ldquodeeply committed to the aims and values of the SDLP, working towards peace, social justice and civil rights throughout his le.ldquoJohn was a shining light in some of the darkest days. Even after his retirement, he remained a loyal SDLP member and provided wise counsel to the new generation stepping forward in South Down and across the North, said the party leader.ldquoI want to express my deepest sympathies to Johnrsquos we Mairead, his children and the whole Doris family. In this very sad time, I hope they find the admiration of Johnrsquos friends and colleagues of some comfort to them.Mr McGrath said his friend and former party colleague epitomised the term ldquogentleman.The Assemblyman described Mr Doris as a ldquogentle giant of politics and someone who took him under his wing, teaching him the ropes of being a good councillor.ldquoJohn was also a successful businessman in Downpatrick but never lost his social justice roots and always did what he could to help people, said Mr McGrath.ldquoHis quiet way and manner often won out and he delivered for people on the matters that meant most to them. He was there for people in their hour of need. I offer my sympathies to Mairead and his family at this time.Cllr Curran described Mr Doris as man who had the interests of his local community very much at heart. He said his friend put the people of Downpatrick at the top of his agenda and fought valiantly for them on a range of issues, not least, social justice.ldquoJohn was proud of his roots and Downpatrick was coursing through his veins. He was my colleague and friend and he will be sadly missed by a great many people. My sympathies are very much with his we Mairead and the family circle. Downpatrick and indeed the wider district has lost a great man who was held in high regard by all those who knew him, said Cllr Curran.He added: ldquoJohn and I were very close and had many conversations over the years about a great many things. I and many others from all walks of le will miss him very much. As far as John was concerned, people always came first.Cllr Walker described Mr Doris as a ldquogentleman and explained their paths first crossed in  when he was elected to the council.ldquoJohn was a man for whom I had the utmost respect. In all the years we served on Down Council I never once heard him say a cross word abut anyone and he never brought sectarian politics into the chamber.ldquoHe was a councillor for the people and I was very saddened to learn of his passing. My thoughts are with his we and family. The thoughts and prayers of many people are with them at this terribly sad time, added Cllr Walker.Rowallane Ulster Unionist councillor, Robert Burgess, said he will always remember attending his first council meeting when Mr Doris introduced himself.ldquoI had nothing but the highest respect for John. He was a man of integrity and while we may have dfered politically I regarded him as a friend and a man who had the interests of Downpatrick and indeed the wider district at heart, he said.ldquoJohn was an absolute gentleman and was someome whom I held in the highest regard.

But credit due to both Paddy and Alec for their performances against regular league players.Group four, headed up by Colin McKinty, always a dangerous competitor in competitions, but he had to contend with an equally talented player in Sean Poland, who has been in great form recently.John Campbell, another player who is in sight of a regular place in the Strangford C team and the affable Katy Rice, improving with every game she plays, completed the group.The first spot in this group was always going to be tight, but McKintyrsquos steady defence was the key factor in finishing top of this group with Poland second.Group four with Michael Carey having steered Strangford B to their third consecutive isional title, was the clear favourite to finish in first place, but would have to contend with the Drumaness No  Pat Mulholland, who has been in excellent form throughout the league campaign.Also in this five-man group were Michael Deery, team-mate Niall Houghan and Drumaness man Seamus McGivern, more at home on the snooker table, but still no stranger to the plastic ball.The games in this group were hotly contested, but in the final game of the group Mulholland and Carey would battle it out for the top place.The first game could have gone either way with Pat just edging home -.The next was equally close but, in the end, it was the Drumaness man who finished in top place with just five points the dference.The first quarter-final match was an all-Strangford clash between McKinty and McCusker.The first two games were shared, but the steady place of McCusker, mixed with well-judged attack, saw him take the next two games to progress to the semi-finals.The second match featured the Drumanessrsquo Pat Mulholland and Charlie Murray. This was easily the match of the round.Mulholland won the first two games, the next two went to Murray with a nip and tuck decider before Mulholland just edged it -. The third match of the round involved second seed Donald Campbell taking on his skipper Michael Carey.The games were all close, but the blistering attack of Campbell saw him progress in straight games. Vincey Poland had perhaps the easiest match of the round against new comer John Campbell.As expected, Poland had too much iation for his opponent and ran out a comfortable - winner.McCusker stated this competition a dark horse to a least reach the final.His opponent in the semi-finals was Donald Campbell and he started as favourite.This semi-final turned out to be the closest match of the competition. John won the first two games and looked confident to reach the final.Back came Campbell to even the score, but McCusker won the first four points of the game and held on win -, leaving Donald to reflect on a match he should have won when he held a game point in the first encounter of the match.The next match was a close affair, but Poland was always in control with Pat Mulholland delighted to have reached this stage of the competition.It was a gallant effort from the Drumaness man but, in the end, Poland booked his final place with a straight game victoryThe home crowd was pleased to see a local man in the final of the competition, but knew he needed to produce something special to beat a player of Polandrsquos stature.The games were close and John, encouraged by his supporters, did everything he could to stem the flow of winners from one of the leaguersquos best backhand exponent, but to no avail and lost in straight games.League secretary, Jim Ritchie, thanked the Strangford club for staging this event and providing refreshment throughout the evening and the competitors for their generous contribution to the charity fund.Competition referee, Peter Deeny, also acknowledged the friendly, competitive spirit in which this event was enjoyed by all participants..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/10992503.jpg","title":"bandstand malcolm mcdowell","story":"How long have you been performing Where do you perform What is your favourite song to perform and why What has been your biggest gig to date Any funny gig rehearsal stories Who are your major influences What would be your dream gig Best moment as a musician so far What is the most unusual venue you have played What is your lsquogo-torsquo encore song Whats the best thing about performing Do you always perform solo or do you also play with a band What does  hold for you Any last words This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The -year-old grandmother has seen her fair share of long, hot dry spells and torrential rains, but recently, like so many farmers, Justine has watched helplessly as her crops have been decimated, in turns, by floods and drought. It’s been bad before, but not this bad. ‘‘This year the biggest challenge has been weather. We have experienced here many extremes, heavy rainfall or excessive heat, but now the dry spells are longer, the rains heavier,’’ said Justine..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button ‘‘These challenges mean we are not able to feed well. I now survive on one meal a day, but previously I could afford three meals a day.’’Justine is part of the Ojama Ageing Farmers Group, a collective which received vital support from local charity, Self Help Africa.‘‘Before the project I used to toil like any other old helpless woman in the village. We were people begging from people. I didn’t have access to financial services, but when the group set up, old as I am, I got sunflower seeds which I planted. When I sold my harvest I was able to buy a heer.’’Self Help Africa is doing amazing work in Uganda, helping people get back on their feet after years of displacement and hardship, but where one battle is beingwon, it seems another is looming large, threatening to scupper all the good work.Behind Uganda’s verdant beauty, climate change looks like dulling the shine off the so-called ‘pearl of Africa.’ Prolonged dry seasons and more intense rainfalls have become the new normal. The resulting floods damage homes, crops and businesses, and thus household incomes, They also, of course, pose a serious risk to health due to water-borne disease. Environmental change is a common refrain among the Ojama Ageing Farmers group, which was formed in  and now has  members, made up of women and men. The group’s chairman, John, reflects on Self Help Africa’s assistance. ‘‘Before, feeding ourselves was dficult, but Self Help Africa gave us  bulls for ploughing. They also gave us some groundnut seeds and cassava cuttings, which we have been planting, except for this year - we lack those things due to last year’s heavy rains. Most of our seeds were rotten because there was too much rain, so there was no good harvest. People are not feeding properly now.‘‘There is not any other crop apart from sweet potatoes. We cut them in pieces and then they dry for future eating in February, March, April - that’s what we will use.’’It is a terribly sad story and one echoed by other members of the group.

These protestors against Irish language legislation gathered at Stormont last month as talks including such laws approached their conclusionCurrently, the policy requires a third of the eligible electorate in a Belfast street to sign a petition to begin the process. A letter is then sent to everyone in that street on the electoral register asking for consent to bilingual signage.The resident has three options, ‘Yes’, ‘No’ and ‘Don’t Care’. At least two thirdsof the people surveyed must be in favour of the proposal to erect a second street sign in a language other than English..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button If the resident gives a ‘Don’t Care’ reply, ora letter is not ed, it is considered a negative response by the council. Sinn Fein are proposing the council continues with the policy of a third of the eligible electorate in the street initiating the process, but amends the policy so that % plus one of respondents would determinethe petition is successful. The party also proposes non-respondents and ‘Don’t Care’ responses to be treated as void votes, and not to be considered negative responses, as with current practice.DUP group leader George Dorrian said the system “for introducing such street signs has been in operation for some time and there is little rationale for any change to it”.He added: “The focus of the council should be on areas where we can deliver for everyone who lives in Belfast rather than on potential areas of ision.”The Sinn Fein motion said that the council “has one of the most restrictive policies of any council in the North in regards to Irish Language Street Signage Policy”.It adds: “If we, as Elected Members were held to the same standard as this policy in the Local Government elections, not one Member would have been ed to serve on this Council, as we would not have met those restrictive parameters.”Ronan McLaughlin, SF councillor for Black Mountain, said the proposal “would bring us in line with the vast majority of other councils, including Lisburn and Castlereagh. We’re not trying to change the parameters in which the petition for an Irish street sign is triggered”.Members of the People and Communities Committee agreed to defer a decision on the motion until next month.l Morning View, page ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"win a luxury visit to galgorm spa and golf resort  ","story":" getRequiredClientIdforjpiconsole.log requiredClientIdcatch]EV.Core.updateUserProfile]EV.Core.updateUserProfile....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Publishing Ltd#s standard Terms and Conditions.

This year, she will celebrate her ninety second birthday and she discusses a letime of activism across Europe.Veganuary is an annual event which encourages people to go vegan for a month. In last yearrsquos campaign, a quarter of a million people pledged to try a vegan diet.More NewsVale school pals brave the shave for animal charityPenarth father of four is recognised in New Year Honour list for services to cricketHouse prices increased in the Vale of Glamorgan, latest figures showOnce a fringe movement, veganism is quickly gaining a vast appeal, especially amongst the young, as the environmental benefits of a plant-based diet become clearer.According to a study by the Vegan Society, , people in the UK were vegan in  ndash  and a half times higher than in . Almost half of these were people aged below .Veganism has brought with it a lucrative trade in plant-based produce as businesses move to accommodate the concerns of their customers and promote ethical alternatives to meat.Long before veganism became a dietary and commercial trendsetter, however, June Holder, a -year-old woman from Penarth, had her eyes opened to the costly effects of meat consumption. After eating a vegan breakfast at a local cafeacute, she settled down to tell me her story.ldquoIrsquove been vegan for  years, she said. ldquoMy daughter had a stall at Camden Market, and she used to collect masses of money for animal rights there. It was her who first introduced me to the cause.ldquoLater on, I organized a charity coffee morning and sent the money I raised to Compassion in World Farming. In , they sent me a magazine which showed what happened to the animals. Well, I sat down that morning and read what theyrsquod sent me ndash and I was vegan!Whilst the public has become more receptive to veganism, June still encounters hostility: ldquoPeoplersquos reactions y when I tell them Irsquom vegan. They become hostile because theyrsquore guilty, I suppose.ldquoI remember that a vegan group had a stall in the market a few years ago. They were advertising parts of Alsatians to eat. People were horried. So, when they were angry, I had a chance to talk to them. lsquoYou accept that any animal can be treated like this except when it comes to your dogsrsquo, I told them. Well, they had to accept it. How could they not Originally from Penarth, June moved to Dinas Powys from Barry after her husband, Derrick, passed away  years ago.Derrick was the owner of Holders Menswear, a menrsquos fashion store which was once renowned throughout the Vale of Glamorgan and beyond.Junersquos decision to become vegan sparked  years of dedication to activism. She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her. One poem describes the day of protest in Brussels. It reflects Junersquos unceasing dedication to animal welfare but also her frustration at the pace of change:ldquoThe writer of these verses was, quite some time ago, in Brussels with a poster which now rings yet more true. lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo is what the message said.ldquoThen round it went to young and old for everyone to read. From countries all round Europe, but the farmers paid no heed. Live transport, a huge issue then, continues just the same.Another poem read:ldquoChristmas is a time to spend, but why not save instead  In sheds around the country to sate the publicrsquos lust for something huge to set their feast. The turkeys just exist.ldquoTen million in this country at Christmas time alone. Is this the way to talk of peace and teach our children love Veganuary runs throughout January.

The UKrsquos withdrawal from the EU will begin later this month and we have a Conservative Government in Westminster until at least .Regardless of the numbers in the Commons, the Labour Party still has to stand up for those we represent. I am confident that my colleague, Stephen Doughty MP will continue to do that.The Labour Party will now move to elect a new Leader and Deputy Leader, a chance to reunite the Party and hold the Prime Minister to account for his actions.I am truly glad to see that several MPs from across the Party have put their names forward to stand for both positions. This offers the membership and the country a broader choice.I am yet to decide who I will back in the forthcoming election but I know that I want to see a vision from each of the candidates. For me, that vision needs to be a realistic reflection of our last decade out of government in Westminster, but also a strategy for reconnecting with our voters and securing a Labour government which can deliver for those who need us most.Finally, I want to thank the staff across the NHS and wider public services for their hard work under increasing pressures, particularly during the winter period.Our public services work hard all year round and many take the sacrice of working over the Christmas and New Year period for which I, and many others, are extremely grateful.As everyou would like to speak with me, you can call my office on    or write to me at Vaughan.Gething@assembly.wales or Office of Vaughan Gething AM, Room C, National Assembly for Wales, CF NA. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Who they are will have a real influence on Welsh Labourrsquos prospects in  and beyond. We are the most successful part of the UK Labour family over the last decade in terms of winning elections and running a national government. However, that cannot be taken for granted. An unpopular UK leader could make our task much harder next May.The first and most important attribute the next UK leader must have is the ability to fulfil the mission of our party - to become a party of government again across the UK, not just a party of protest. I want someone who can implement our labour values in government, not just talk about them.That requires some honesty about why we took such a beating at the general election, together with the willingness and strength to do something about it. Offering more of the same would be a betrayal of people who need a UK Labour government and will condemn the UK [or what is left of it] to a further decade of the Tories.We didnrsquot get hammered in  for one reason alone - there were a number of them. Agreeing to the election in the first place when we plainly were not prepared. Agreeing to an election certain to be dominated by Brexit. Our vacillation on Brexit when people wanted certainty and leadership. The factional infighting. The demonisation of the last UK Labour government, asthat would encourage people to vote for us. I grew up with  Tory years in power and I know that things really did get better following Labourrsquos victory in .An overloaded manesto with some popular policies but without a key central message. A costed manesto that then had a huge extra spending pledge added to it, meaning that people didnrsquot believe that we were serious or credible one even the policies they liked. A staggeringly inept UK campaign that wasted the amazing dedication of our volunteers, prepared to go out in the cold and rain to campaign. Our abject failure on anti-Semitism. This and much more.Many people recognised that Boris Johnson is a dishonest man who is completely out of touch with most peoplersquos lives. Lots of people still voted for him or refused to vote Labour because they could not trust and support us. Our own people - long term Labour voters - struggled to support us. Our leader was undeniably part of the reason why. Blaming our defeat solely on the mainstream media or whichever side of the Brexit ide we favour isnt honest and will not help us to win in the future.I donrsquot much care whether someone claims they are from the left, soft left, centre or old right of the Labour Party. We all have a stake in our party and the countries of the UK. These are serious times and we need a serious figure who can nail the Tories and the clown in number ten.Irsquove been interested in what Lisa Nandy has to say and believe that Lisa and many other figures have a key role to play in rebuilding our party ndash first as a credible opposition, then as a credible alternative government at the next UK General Election.However, I think the person best placed to win the argument, and even more importantly to help us win an election, is Keir Starmer. Itrsquos not the protesting, or the taking part that counts. Itrsquos the winning and the decisions you get to make in government that can change peoplesrsquo lives and change the country for the better. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He acted to prosecute MPs who had abused expenses and Murdoch journalists in the phone-hacking scandal when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.We need to win back these voters that we lost in the last general election. It was heart-breaking on election night, to see Labour lose places like Wrexham and Bridgend.The UK Labour Party must get back to being a party that votersrsquo can trust. That means we cannot just have a ldquoone more heave approach. We need someone who can speak to the whole of our country, not just one region or subset of voters, with the values and vision to win. Keir fits the bill. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors.

Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
