[{"url":null,"title":"Prince Andrew offers cooperate Jeffery Epstein investigation","story":"Share this article Andrew has categorically denied having any knowledge that Epstein was sexually abusing teenage girls. The prince announced that he was withdrawing from his royal duties late last year amid renewed attention over his friendship with Epstein, and Giuffre\u0027s claim that she had several sexual encounters with the prince, starting when she was just 17.Giuffre says that after meeting her in Florida in 2000, Epstein flew her around the world and pressured her into having sex with numerous older men, including Andrew, two senior US politicians, a noted academic, wealthy financiers and the attorney Alan Dershowitz, who is now part of President Donald Trump\u0027s impeachment defense team.All of those men have denied the allegations.Giuffre has said she had sex with Andrew three times at Epstein\u0027s request, including once in London in 2001 at the home of Epstein\u0027s girlfriend, Maxwell.Andrew has maintained that he does not recall ever meeting Giuffre - even though there is a photograph apparently showing him with his arm around the then-17-year-old on the night she says she first slept with him.            Prince Andrew is pictured with Epstein in Central Park in New York in February 2011         Virginia Roberts, who claims that Prince Andrew had sex with her after Epstein trafficked her to London, is pictured with the Duke of York in 2001In the November TV interview with the BBC, Andrew insisted he did not spend time with Giuffre at Tramp Nightclub in London on March 10, 2001, after which she claims the pair first had sex.The duke denied he slept with her on three separate occasions, saying the encounter in 2001 did not happen as he had taken his daughter Princess Beatrice to Pizza Express in Woking for a party, and they spent the rest of the day together. Giuffre has previously described their alleged time together in London in vivid detail, claiming that Andrew had been \u0027sweating\u0027 as they danced together in the London nightclub.  Andrew disputed that detail, saying he has a \u0027peculiar medical condition which is that I don\u0027t sweat or I didn\u0027t sweat at the time\u0027.He also said that her story didn\u0027t make sense because he didn\u0027t know where the bar in Tramp Nightclub is. \u0027I don\u0027t drink, I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever bought a drink in Tramps whenever I was there,\u0027 he said.   Questioned about the photo of him and Giuffre together, which friends of the Duke have said could have been faked, Andrew said that public displays of affection are \u0027not something he would do\u0027 but refused to reveal whether he thought the image was doctored.He said: \u0027Oh it’s definitely me, I mean that\u0027s a picture of me. I don\u0027t believe it\u0027s a picture of me in London because when I go out in London I wear a suit and a tie. \u0027That\u0027s what I would describe as my travelling clothes if I\u0027m going to go overseas. There’s plenty of photographs of me dressed in that sort of kit but not there.\u0027                 In a November TV interview, Andrew maintained that he does not recall meeting Giuffre US Attorney General William Barr has vowed to aggressively investigate and bring charges against anyone who may have helped Epstein, who killed himself in his jail cell last summer while he was awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.The case brought renewed scrutiny to Epstein\u0027s many high-profile associates, including Andrew, who says he met the financier in 1999. The pair maintained their friendship even after Epstein served 13 months in a Florida county jail after pleading guilty to charges of soliciting prostitution in 2008. Andrew came under fire in 2010 after it was revealed that he stayed at Epstein\u0027s Manhattan home following his release from jail.     Asked during the November interview whether he regretted continuing his friendship with Epstein, Andrew said: \u0027Do I regret the fact that he has quite obviously conducted himself in a manner unbecoming? Yes.\u0027 The BBC interviewer replied: \u0027Unbecoming? He was a sex offender.\u0027Andrew then apologized, saying: \u0027I\u0027m being polite, I mean in the sense that he was a sex offender. \u0027But no, was I right in having him as a friend? At the time, bearing in mind this was some years before he was accused of being a sex offender. \u0027I don\u0027t there was anything wrong then, the problem was the fact that once he had been convicted I stayed with him and that’s the bit that, as it were, I kick myself for on a daily basis because it was not something that was becoming of a member of the royal family and we try and uphold the highest standards and practices and I let the side down, simple as that.\u0027 Andrew was also friends with Maxwell, the British socialite accused in several civil lawsuits of recruiting girls and young women for Epstein to sexually abuse.Last week, a former police protection officer for Andrew came forward to claim that Maxwell would visit the prince at Buckingham Palace up to four times a day and that the pair would enjoy picnics together on the grounds of the estate in London. Met Police officer Paul Page, who worked for the Royals from 1998 to 2004, told The Mirror he first became aware of who Maxwell was in 2001 when the privy purse - the office that handles the Queen\u0027s private income - called to inform him that a guest was coming to see Andrew but that the name was not to be entered into the book. \u0027She turned up in a chauffeur-driven Range Rover and we let her in. Half an hour after that me and my colleague walked through the garden to go back to the police lodge and he was having a picnic with her by the summer house, opposite the Queen\u0027s ­bedroom window,\u0027 Page said.\u0027One of my colleagues saw her come in and out the Palace four times in one day.\u0027 Andrew claimed in the BBC interview that he last saw Maxwell in the early spring of last year, months before he was arrested on sex trafficking charges.  Maxwell has denied any wrongdoing related to Epstein but is believed to be one of the key figures in the US government\u0027s probe. Two guards who were supposed to be monitoring Epstein the night he was found dead have already been charged with falsifying the jail\u0027s log books to indicate they were performing checks on prisoners, when they were actually sleeping or browsing the internet.  Prince Andrew \u0027had visits from Ghislaine Maxwell 4 times a day\u0027 says ex-protection officer - Mirror Online"},{"url":null,"title":"Samantha Markle explains public fell sister Meghan","story":"Share this article \u0027Clearly there were some things that happened because the public\u0027s not stupid.\u0027They were witnessing some things that they didn\u0027t think were so cool and she didn\u0027t step up to the plate and fix them.\u0027That includes family, that includes public spending, there was a lot that happened that was attributable to behaviour.\u0027It wasn\u0027t about racism, it was about hey you guys aren\u0027t being cool step up to the plate and fix it.\u0027Samantha, who is twice orced and suffers multiple sclerosis, has been estranged from Meghan for more than a decade and was not invited to the royal wedding.          Samantha Markle, who shares Meghan\u0027s father Thomas (pictured), said it her behaviour that meant Meghan fell out of favour with the public Asked if there was any chance of her reuniting with her sister, she said: \u0027I didn\u0027t feel that\u0027s possible given that there was so much malice, there was so much attacking when it could have been nipped in the bud and we could be playing footsies under the table.\u0027She said she hopes Meghan and their father Thomas, 75, can reconcile before he dies.\u0027He was almost a single dad to her her whole life, gave her everything.

Normally on road trips your eyes are peeled onto the road and its so physically and mentally exhausting that it is tiring. Here, I am looking around at some pretty trees and enjoying the ride,\u0027 he said.Ryan felt the recharging stops actually made the trip more fun rather than just stopping at a regular gas stations only to get back on the road, as would be the case in a regular gas fueled vehicle.After 20 hours of driving, Ryan had traveled 956 miles and was still some distance away from the Windy City.He notes that despite the car saying a single charge would last for 270 miles, each time he \u0027filled up\u0027, after about 200 miles the battery power began to dwindle.         Ryan says charging stations, pictured, need to be located next to the highway like gas because otherwise drivers need to deviate from their route adding time and mileage to the journey         Ryan said he felt as though he was was a passenger along for the ride and enjoyed the trip\u0027Overall its a good experience and feels like I\u0027m a passenger in an airplane with everyone having their own seat,\u0027 he said in an 18-minute long YouTube video.Eventually, after several more charging station stops and another 250 miles later, Ryan reached Chicago having driven for 28 hours in total with around 7½ hours dedicated to charging the vehicle.By the time he arrived in Chicago after travelling 1,236 miles, it had been almost 36 hours since leaving Austin.Ryan took time to sum up the experience explaining the positives and negatives of the whole journey.         He said wouldn\u0027t do something similar until electric cars become more popular with longer battery life and more places to charge up\u0027The cost was free!

The superchargers are often located 5-10 miles away from the highway and added a significant amount of time to the trip.Ryan said that he felt the Autopilot was great on a long road trip because he was able to look around and not feel so mentally exhausted by having to keep his eyes on the road at all times.However, he said that he would never make such a long road trip in the car again because of the overall amount of time spent charging which added a significant amount of time and mileage to the overall journey."},{"url":null,"title":"Youll nut nearer squirrel this","story":"Share this article          \u0027I like to take pictures with a lot of emotions in them, and I find that it\u0027s easy to pretend that squirrels are little humans in fur costumes,\u0027 he said \u0027It\u0027s like a Disney version of nature photography, I don\u0027t want to add toys or trinkets, I prefer pictures where they have expressions that makes you think you know what they feel.\u0027Squirrels don\u0027t hobnob with other squirrels, except when very young, they don\u0027t care for anyone eating their food really.\u0027I don\u0027t spend a lot of time on the captions, I just try to open up my mind and see what comes to me, most of the time a lyric from an old song.\u0027Occasionally, I come up with a really funny one, and when I do, I\u0027m prouder of the caption than the picture.

At the inquiry into the October 1999 Ladbroke Grove rail crash, which saw 31 people killed, the Attorney General agreed not to prosecute based on evidence given at the hearing to ensure the whole truth was heard. Michael Mansfield QC, representing victims, told the inquiry the timing of the application for prosecution for immunity is \u0027highly reprehensible and highly questionable\u0027.He said: \u0027We have a major question over why it has been done today.\u0027It has caused immense anxiety, distress and anger at a time which has come throughout a much longer period of waiting after this disaster, of waiting to get to the point of accountability, as it were, to be almost thwarted at the doors of the court.\u0027Chairman Sir Martin Moore-Bick said: \u0027I agree this application has come very late in the day and at a most inconvenient time.\u0027It\u0027s very disappointing, I might even use a stronger word.\u0027 Unite the union has said it will be a \u0027mockery of justice\u0027 if key witnesses in the Grenfell Tower inquiry are granted immunity from prosecution when they come to give evidence.         Witnesses involved in designing and choosing materials at the Grenfell Inquiry are applying to claim \u0027privilege against self incrimination\u0027 to protect themselves from the prospect of prosecution, the inquiry into the disaster has heardUnite assistant general secretary for legal affairs Howard Beckett said in a statement: \u0027The corporate manslaughter legislation in the UK is already weak enough, without giving companies, who could have been culpable in the deaths of 72 innocent people, immunity from prosecution.\u0027If the Attorney General upholds this request it will be a mockery of justice.\u0027If the companies involved in installing the cladding knew it was flammable and unsafe and then allowed it to be installed anyway they should of course be prosecuted.\u0027This is a key test of whether the Government wants a proper inquiry which reveals the truth or if they are simply involved in a whitewashing exercise.\u0027It comes after the inquiry heard that certain key firms which revamped the high-rise block appeared to know two years before the disaster that a planned cladding system would fail if exposed to fire, according to internal emails disclosed on Tuesday.Scotland Yard said in September that it had completed 17 interviews under caution in its investigation into the fire regarding gross negligence manslaughter, corporate manslaughter and health and safety offences, and said \u0027the number will continue to increase\u0027.  Sir Martin said the development had caused him a \u0027little surprise\u0027 as \u0027hitherto there has been the fullest co-operation with the inquiry\u0027.The retired appeal court judge said: \u0027Very recently I\u0027ve been advised that, when they are called to give evidence, which of course will start next week, many of the witnesses who were involved in the design and choice of materials are likely to claim privilege against self-incrimination as a reason for not answering questions.\u0027Privilege against self-incrimination is a rule of law that protects a person from being required to answer questions if to do so truthfully might expose him or her to a risk of prosecution.\u0027It is a very broad principle and will extend to any answers which might assist in, or lead to, a prosecution.\u0027This development has caused me a little surprise because hitherto there has been the fullest co-operation with the inquiry, both in the form of giving written statements and in the provision of documents, and no one so far has sought to avoid doing that or to answer

to questions in the inquiry will be used in furtherance of a prosecution against them, thereby giving them complete freedom to tell the truth without any concern for the future.\u0027           Sir

control services processed and considered the application for building control approval during the refurbishment of Grenfell Tower.\u0027On behalf of the council, it apologises unreservedly for those failings\u0027.RBKC owned the west London block but it was run by an arms-length body, the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation, which oversaw the refurbishment.The inquiry heard earlier this week that building control officials failed to ask for comprehensive details of the project including materials used in the cladding system.Victims of the Grenfell Tower fire rejected the council\u0027s \u0027unreserved apology\u0027 after it admitted its building controllers made several key failings before signing off a refurbishment which saw the building coated in flammable panels.The Grenfell United group said there was \u0027no true remorse\u0027 in the admission by the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, adding it was \u0027insulting to survivors and bereaved families for them to suggest they are being honest about their role in our suffering\u0027.RBKC counsel James Maxwell Scott QC told the inquiry on Wednesday: \u0027The council has identified a number of failings in the way its building control services processed and considered the application for building control approval during the refurbishment of Grenfell Tower.\u0027On behalf of the council, it apologises unreservedly for those failings.\u0027He added: \u0027Grenfell Tower is a tragedy which should never have happened. This council could have done and should have done more to stop it happening.\u0027  Listing failings of the organisation, Mr Maxwell Scott said it \u0027failed to ask for comprehensive details on the cladding system including the crown\u0027 and failed to identify that the insulation materials used in the cladding system were not of limited combustibility.He added: \u0027Building control failed to recognise that insufficient or no cavity barriers to seal the cavities at openings within the walls, including around the windows, had been indicated on the plans submitted to it.\u0027Building control did not have a formal procedure for tracking the progress of applications for building control approval ... had one been in place, it would have reduced the likelihood of aspects of the application or the building control approval process being overlooked.\u0027He said it should not have issued a completion certificate on July 7 2016.In a statement, Grenfell United said: \u0027There is no confession here, barely any honesty and certainly no true remorse.\u0027They have no choice but to accept that it was a total failure for their building control to sign off the refurbishment.\u0027They have not opened up about all the other ways they were disturbingly reckless in the project from start to finish and how they treated us before and after the fire.\u0027It is insulting to us that they are trying to argue that despite signing off a building that was a death trap they should not share any responsibility for it.\u0027This argument makes them no better than all the companies we have heard this week, passing the buck and minimising their own role in the disaster.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Pub bans men wearing jobby catcher tracksuits flip flops bearing mankles","story":"Share this article \u0027It may seem trivial but there was that jeans halfway down the ar** trend a few years ago and it went unchecked to the point that we had a lad sitting at the bar with his strides basically round his ankles, displaying a massive skidmark up the back of his threadbare shreddies.\u0027If you\u0027re going to base your fashion choices on what the staff at Urban Outfitters were wearing, there\u0027s a place created especially for you.

We know that on that voyage something happened because she delivered a mayday message early December saying she\u0027s in distress.\u0027And then that was it. They never found any wreckage. They never found any lifeboats, bodies or anything. The vessel just disappeared after that point. So we\u0027ve been trying to determine what happened.\u0027         A team of marine biologists and underwater explorers have identified the SS Cotopaxi off the coast of St. Augustine, Florida (pictured, how it passed through the Bermuda Triangle)          The ship had sent out wireless distress signals on December 1, 1925, two days after it left Charleston but it has only now just been found (pictured, ers examine the wreck)To help pinpoint the possible location where the SS Cotopaxi sunk, Barnette contacted British historian Guy Walters to help do some digging. Walters combed through ship records at the archives of Lloyd\u0027s of London, who were the insurance brokers of the SS Cotopaxi. There he discovered something previously unknown about the SS Cotopaxi\u0027s voyage. The ship had sent out wireless distress signals on December 1, 1925, two days after it left Charleston. The signals were picked up in Jacksonville, Florida, placing the ship in the area of a shipwreck found nearly 35 years ago.Armed with this new information, Barnette headed to Florida with his e partner, Joe Citelli, to e the wreck. However, their e as well as the use of an underwater drone to survey the ship, did not produce any corroborating evidence.          The ship is one of the triangle\u0027s biggest secrets and even popped up at the end of Steven Spielberg\u0027s 1977 blockbuster, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, where it was found in the Gobi Dessert having supposedly been placed there by aliens         Their research and findings will be revealed in the premiere episode of the new Science Channel series, Shipwreck Secrets, premiering Sunday, February 9 (pictured, a grab from the show)From there, Barnette met with Al Perkins, an avid er who has been ing the area since the 1980\u0027s. On these es, Perkins had collected souvenirs - one of which might helped solve the mystery.To gather more evidence, Barnette enlists the St. Augustine Lighthouse and Maritime Museum, a non-profit organization dedicated to researching and preserving the 500 year long maritime history of the region. Two of their leading maritime archeologists Chuck Meide and Brendan Burke are experts in discovering, exploring and identifying wrecks in the area. Together they headed to the wreck - and what they found was truly astonishing.Further research was able to corroborate the wreck\u0027s location compared to where the distress signals were sent out, leading Barnette to come to no other conclusion: they\u0027ve uncovered the long-lost SS Cotopaxi.Shipwreck Secrets then visited with Douglas Myers in Long Island, NY, the grandson the SS Cotopaxi Captain William J.

Today she works in creative services for advertising brands.Dunning\u0027s cross-examination Under cross-examination by defense lawyer Arthur Aidala, Dunning said that one of the lunch meetings she had with Weinstein was at Robert De Niro’s restaurant in Tribeca.During the seven months she knew him, Dunning and her fiance also had dinner with Weinstein and his ex-wife Georgina Chapman.Weinstein got her tickets to see the Broadway show The Producers and one year Whoopi Goldberg’s birthday.Aidala questioned her motives behind coming forward and accused Dunning of going on a \u0027media tour\u0027 that began in Fall 2017 with the New York Times and include NBC Nightly News, MSNBC, Sky News, and CNN.In all the interviews Dunning only talked about Weinstein’s proposition for a threesome.It wasn\u0027t until July last year that Dunning told the Manhattan District Attorney’s office about the previous incident where he allegedly touched her up her skirt.Dunning agreed that was correct. At the end of her examination Hast asked Dunning \u0027Are you getting anything from this?\u0027 in an effort to have the jury hear if she was benefiting in any way from going public with her story. \u0027No,\u0027 Dunning said choking on tears. \u0027If anything, I’m losing. I’m spending money, I’m spending time. It’s the hardest thing I’ve ever done. I wouldn’t wish this on anyone.\u0027         Weinstein was in good spirits in court on Tuesday. When a reporter asked him if he was afraid of Chihuahuas, Weinstein laughed and replied, \u0027Do I look like I’m afraid of chihuahuas?\u0027In an exclusive interview with DailyMailTV last year, Dunning said she was terrified to see the shamed Hollywood executive in the flesh again. \u0027I have thought about what would happen if I ran into him again over the years. And I just do not want to see him. I do not want to interact with him, I do not know what I would to say to him. It is still pretty emotional and it would be really hard to be face to face with him again.\u0027 Weinstein later offered her the opportunity to read for a potential acting role and Wulff went to his apartment for it. There Weinstein allegedly pushed her onto a bed and raped her.  Weinstein, 67, is accused of five felony counts including rape and predatory sexual assault. Those charges stem from the alleged assaults of former Project Runway production assistant Mimi Haley in 2006 and aspiring actress Jessica Mann in 2013. The movie mogul has pleaded not guilty to those charges and his defense team is honing in on his accusers\u0027 continued contact with Weinstein after the alleged assaults.  What\u0027s happened in the trial so far So far two accusers, Mimi Haleyi and Soprano\u0027s actress Annabella Sciorra, have testified against Weinstein. On Monday Haleyi, whose allegations are at the heart of the Weinstein case, broke down in tears as she recounted how the film honcho, who got her a job as a production assistant on the show Project Runway, allegedly forcibly performed oral sex on her while she was on her period at his New York City apartment in July 2006. She also claimed he raped her at a TriBeCa hotel two weeks afterwards.\u0027I did reject him, but he insisted. Every time I tried to get off the bed, he would push me back and hold me down,\u0027 Haleyi, 42, said choking on tears.          Haleyi (in cream trench coat) worked for Project Runway, a reality show Weinstein produced. Pictured in court on Monday         She broke down in tears as she recounted the alleged rape saying: \u0027I was crying no, no. I told him I’m on my period. It was as if he didn’t believe me. I said something like where is it then? He literally pulled my tampon out\u0027              Annabella Sciorra cried as she took the stand in Harvey Weinstein\u0027s New York trial last week to tell how he allegedly raped her in 1993 or 1994.

He literally pulled my tampon out,\u0027 she added. She underwent an intense cross-examination where Weinstein\u0027s attorney Damon Cheronis claimed she had a consensual relationship with Weinstein and zeroed in on her continued contact with the producer even after the alleged assaults, showing e-mails and notes in her diary.   On Tuesday Haleyi\u0027s roommate in 2006, Elizabeth Entin, testified to corroborate her claims.  Entin said on one occasion Weinstein barged into their home to demand Haleyi go to Paris with him but got scared by her pet Chihuahua Peanut.Last week Annabella Sciorra testified that Weinstein forced his way into her Manhattan apartment one winter night in 1993 or 1994 and violently raped her. In total six women are expected to testify against the producer, while more than 90 women have accused the Miramax founder of sexual misconduct, harassment, rape, and unwanted touching.Who are Weinstein\u0027s accusers who have or will testify?Actress Annabella Sciorra testified last week against Weinstein, claiming he raped her in her New York City apartment in 1993. Former production assistant Mimi Haleyi testified Monday and claimed Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on her inside his apartment in 2006. A third accuser, Jessica Mann, is slated to testify this week on how the movie mogul allegedly raped her in a Midtown Manhattan hotel in 2013. Costume designer Dawn Dunning claims Weinstein sexually harassed her and tried to pressure her into having a three-way with him and his assistant when she was 24 at a Manhattan hotel in 2004.   Aspiring actress Tarale Wulff claims Weinstein masturbated in front of her as she was working as a cocktail waitress at Cipriani Upstairs in Manhattan and he later assaulted her in his bedroom in 2005.  A sixth woman, Lauren Young, claims he groped her in a hotel, masturbated and ejaculated onto a bathroom floor in February 2012 at a dinner event during Oscar season when she was 22.  In addition to these six accusers the judge is allowing four other women to testify to establish a pattern of behavior, even though most of their allegations are too old to prosecute as crimes according to state law. The trial started on January 6 and could last until early March.  "},{"url":null,"title":"Its not goodbye au revoir British MEPs sit European Parliament time","story":"Share this article \u0027Do we want to be like a small island, Little Britain, where we\u0027re just trying to be in the pocket of Donald Trump and the United States?\u0027You know what?

Andrzej and Zofia Pilecki knew nothing about the mission that had taken their father away from them for most of their childhood. It was only when they were in their 60s, as the iron curtain fell, that the details of Witold Pilecki’s extraordinary second world war mission began to emerge.Then, in 2012, a British war correspondent who was looking for a new subject after covering wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, stumbled across the story. He discovered that Pilecki, a former cavalry officer, had become a leading member of the Polish resistance – and deliberately got himself interned in Auschwitz so that he could send intelligence to London. He survived that ordeal only to fall into the hands of the Soviet regime, who took possession of Poland in the postwar carve-up of Europe.Jack Fairweather was in his late 30s and the father of two young children when he began work on the book. When The Volunteer was crowned Costa book of the year this week, Fairweather paid an emotional tribute to Andrzej and Zofia, who were among hundreds of survivors who helped him piece together their father’s story.In undertaking the task, Fairweather knew he would have to honour Pilecki’s own insistence that “any falsehood would profane the memory of my fallen colleagues”. Every single word of the book is either from Pilecki’s own writing, from interviews Fairweather conducted, or from first-hand accounts by people who lived alongside Pilecki, drawn from the many thousands of testimonies held in the Auschwitz museum.Sitting in his publisher’s office the day after his win, Fairweather sums up the five years he spent on the book: “Years of always chasing your quarry and looking for a glimpse – for one of those very special moments when you suddenly see the full man. It can be a story detail or a snippet you find in the archive.”One such nugget popped up when he took Pilecki’s octogenarian nephew back to the Warsaw flat the nephew’s family had lived in when he was a toddler. The nephew was just three the night his uncle was taken away. He remembered that his teddy bear had just fallen out of his cot. Pilecki, writes Fairweather, “quickly picks up the bear and hands it to the boy and the mother lets the Germans in. ‘See you soon,’ he whispers to the child. Then, against every instinct he must have had, he steps into captivity.”The story must have become a family anecdote, Fairweather says. “For me, it really spoke of one of his great characteristics: at times of greatest stress, when you’d expect him to be thinking of himself, he was always able to reach out and engage with other people.” Part of the puzzle, adds the 41-year-old author, lay in working out what drove “this apparently ordinary man, with no great record of service, to expand his empathy, his moral capacity, to piece together the Nazis’ greatest crimes when others looked away”.Pilecki managed to get 10 reports smuggled out of the death camp during his two and a half years there, but they fell on deaf ears and were forgotten. Their significance only began to emerge in the early 90s, when Polish archives – sealed by the Soviets – were opened to Polish historians. But one important piece of the jigsaw was missing: the testimony Pilecki was known to have written during a spell in Italy after he escaped from Auschwitz by using a duplicate key made by a metalworker friend in the camp.“The goosebumps moment,” says Fairweather, “was when my researcher phoned me from the Polish Underground Study Trust in London saying it had been found.” The document – entrusted to a colleague when Pilecki made the fatal decision to return to his homeland under the Soviets – had been handed over to the Polish government in exile in the 60s, but had been kept secret for fear of reprisals against people it named. “There it was in his loopy blue handwriting,” says Fairweather, “still in a little beige folder.”One of the most poignant discoveries for Fairweather was that the second world war didn’t end in May 1945 for Poland and a lot of Europe. “For us, it was victory parades and celebrations. But for them, it marked the transition to the brutality of Stalin, when more than 80,000 people who had resisted the Nazis were arrested and tortured. Hundreds were shot and thousands more deported to the gulag.”Growing up in Wales, the eldest of four children born to teacher parents, Fairweather was steeped in a war history that made little mention of the Polish resistance. “We always think of the French,” he says, “but Polish intelligence was much bigger and more sophisticated.”Pilecki survived in the camp by using his underground contacts to wangle the relatively easy jobs of carpenter and hospital block handyman, though they did not shield him from witnessing Auschwitz’s horrors. “One day while scratching in the frozen earth for roots,” writes Fairweather, “he had the grim thought that they’d be better off if the British simply bombed the camp and brought an end to the suffering.” Pilecki developed this thought in one of his reports, reasoning that nobody would die in vain if Auschwitz was obliterated, because it would expose what was going on, while ending the “monstrous suffering”.Fairweather arrived at the book via an Oxford degree followed by a career as a war correspondent, which began when his tutor suggested him for a job at a Kolkata newspaper. While working there as a copy editor on the letters page, he took himself off to report on the 2002 terrorist attack on the US cultural centrein the city, selling it to the Daily  in the UK “for three months of my salary at the paper”. He was given a break as a stringer in Kuwait where, “by a bizarre coincidence”, a former schoolfriend of his mother’s turned out to be a member of the Kuwaiti royal family and head of the civil service. His first big scoop was an interview in which, contrary to official briefings, the Kuwaiti foreign minister said the country would be happy to be the launchpad for an attack on Iraq aimed at toppling Saddam Hussein.Stints in Afghanistan and Iraq followed, resulting in two books. He talks of “the heroism of ordinary people” – in particular, the Iraqi driver who, with Fairweather typing out the story of an attempted suicide bombing in the back seat, managed to outrun a Shia squad who had been sent to kidnap him. “We were bouncing all over the place for 45 minutes. I was saying, ‘Please drive more carefully. I’m trying to write a piece.” Only when they’d arrived back in Baghdad and he had filed his story did his driver tell him exactly what had been going on.It’s a great tale but, he says, it is nothing compared with what Pilecki lived through. “To be able to get this man’s story was the greatest honour of my career. My books about Iraq and Afghanistan were attempts to understand what I’d experienced. But in this case, I was trying to follow in the footsteps of this man – and be confronted by history as it confronted him.” He adds: “When we think of western war heroes, they give us solace and a story about our experience. But Poland wasn’t ever able to commemorate its heroes because for decades they were ‘enemies of the people’.”Fairweather – who now lives between London and Vermont with his American wife, the journalist Christina Asquith – is well aware that The Volunteer owes part of its power to the fact that Auschwitz is now passing out of living human memory. “I wanted to speak to as many people who had witnessed Pilecki in action – and many of the people I interviewed are now dead.”He pauses. “We’re living in a time of turmoil, with resurgent nationalism and rising antisemitism. That’s why Pilecki’s story is so important. I find it really inspiring.

The state operator of last resort will take over running of the services from 1 March.The UK transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said: “This is a new beginning but it is only a beginning. Northern’s network is huge and complex and some of the things that are wrong are not going to be quick or easy to put right. But I am determined that Northern passengers see real and tangible improvements across the network as soon as possible.”He added said that the current privatised model was not working, saying: “We know change is needed and change is coming.”Unions and campaigners welcomed the move but said it should be followed by broader nationalisation, while the rail industry demanded the urgent publication of a government review spelling out plans for reform.The Northern franchise has been run by Arriva, a subsidiary of Germany’s state-owned Deutsche Bahn, since 2016 but the operator’s ambitious plans to modernise and expand train services gave way to a grim reality of worsening punctuality and reliability, and a failure to achieve promised improvements.Northern is the biggest franchise in England by the length of its route network and serves more than 500 stations north of Derby. It also receives the biggest state subsidy for its operations, running at £763m last year, including indirect funding for track access.In a written ministerial statement, Shapps said a cross-industry rail taskforce would be set up to help north-west England’s railways recover, while the new state operator would produce a masterplan of local infrastructure improvements needed to help services run smoothly.The transport secretary had announced earlier in January that Northern’s finances meant that the current franchise arrangement could only last months. Shapps eventually decided against accepting proposals from Arriva for a short-term management contract, which northern transport authorities had described as a “reward for failure”.Arriva said many of the problems were unprecedented and out of its control, such as postponed infrastructure upgrades that affected the rollout of more electric trains, leading to the prolonged retention of the infamous Pacer trains. Meanwhile, a long-running dispute with the RMT union led to widespread strikes.Chris Burchell, Arriva’s managing director for UK Trains, said: “We had a clear vision for the Northern franchise that would better connect the cities of the north with more frequent, reliable and modern services and unlock economic growth. It was clear however that, largely because of external factors, the franchise plan had become undeliverable.“We recognise however that overall service improvements have not come quickly enough, and passengers deserve better. For that, we wholeheartedly apologise.”The Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham, and the Liverpool mayor, Steve Rotheram, welcomed the news, saying: “Today’s news is a victory for passengers who have had to endure almost two years of misery and mayhem on Northern rail.”But they said it was “only the start of fixing the north’s railways”, calling on the government to commit to investing in modern rail infrastructure required. The decision means the Conservatives have nationalised two major rail franchises in less than two years, after taking over the east coast line in June 2018, now run as LNER after the collapse of Virgin Trains East Coast.Shapps last week said that the future of another, South West Railway, was in doubt, after the First Group-MTR joint-venture said it was running out of cash. Questions also hang over the TransPennine Express and West Midlands Trains franchises.Unions said Northern would need “significant investment” to turn it round. Mick Whelan, the general secretary of Aslef, the train drivers’ union, said: “We welcome today’s decision because we want the railway in public ownership but let’s do it properly, with a clear, long-term, strategic vision, not just as a short-term response to the years of franchised failure.“There won’t be an immediate improvement because many of the systemic failures at Northern cannot be remedied overnight.”The RMT union predicted the decision would “open the floodgates” for other franchises to be taken in to the public sector.Mick Cash, the general secretary, said it should not be a short-term fix: “This has to be a permanent move followed up with the investment and planning needed to deliver the rail services that passengers deserve after years of privatised chaos.”A root-and-branch review of the rail industry, which will recommend replacing the current system of franchising, has been completed by the former British Airways boss Keith Williams but is yet to be published by the Department for Transport.The industry body the Rail Delivery Group said that Northern had been “hamstrung by a flawed industry structure”. Their chief executive, Paul Plummer, said: “The industry’s proposals to the review set out a radical alternative to the status quo. This review must be published urgently.”Passengers in Manchester had few good words to say for Northern but were mixed in their view of whether nationalisation would help.Simon Kendall, 45, a freelance IT consultant, said his 30-minute commute from Littleborough to Salford Central was often “nothing but appalling”, with trains often delayed, cancelled or overcrowded, with fewer carriages than usual. “I was on a train last year and rain was coming in through the roof, and newspapers were used to mop up the water.”However, he said: “I’m not sure whether public ownership will work unless they decide to invest in the infrastructure. Northern rail has had no real investment for years and it’s a service that is used heavily by the public. Why spend money on HS2 when it’s the local rail networks that really need investment? Northern transport has been neglected for far too long.”Ursula Katz, 75, who travels three times a week from Hebden Bridge into Manchester to look after her grandchildren, said her service was often delayed or cancelled, especially at weekends. “The trains only run hourly and then they’ll cancel it and you have to wait an hour for the next one, and then it’s standing only,” she said.“I’m all for nationalisation of the trains. These franchises make life difficult for commuters, profit a lot and don’t reinvest. I hope that nationalising will make things better.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9f76db75df69099889a3b4d13f6ab60afaf26ca/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ebbe079cfdb9fa37f9400d1200a47273","title":"africa coloniasation english language oxford dictionary nigerian","story":"The British empire forced its colonies to abandon their own languages. Now they are making English their ownThere is one expression I have grown up hearing from relatives of a certain age, but never been able to accept. It’s the description of Twi – the Akan language spoken by my family – as “the vernacular”, a term which implicitly compares it with the colonial language, English, and somehow finds it wanting. The word itself is a revealing symptom of the colonial project. Just as nations like the Yoruba, with a population of more than 40 million, were patronisingly described as “tribes”, when in fact they were substantial nations, African languages were downgraded to “the vernacular”. It’s a term more befitting of a regional dialect than a nation’s language, with its own history, politics and literature.The attempt to discourage Africans from speaking our own languages not only failed, but has had the glorious result of backfiring, to the extent that now Britain’s own inhabitants are officially adopting African vocab. This month the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) added Nigeria’s first entries to already recognised gems like “howzit” from South Africa. Other Africans will recognise lots of the latest lingo to get the OED stamp – “chop”, to eat or to misappropriate funds “next tomorrow”, the day after tomorrow “sef”, a great Pidgin flourish for emphasis.Nigerian pre-eminence in the English language is nothing new. One of the first global literary successes by a black author was The Interesting Narrative, by the Igbo writer Olaudah Equiano, the beautifully written 1789 account of his enslavement and subsequent freedom.English was imposed on Africans by force. “In Kenya, English became more than a language: it was the language, and all the others had to bow before it in deference,” wrote the great Kenyan novelist Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o. In his seminal book Decolonising the Mind, he described children at his English-speaking school in Nairobi being beaten if they were caught speaking Gĩkũyũ.One of my favourite grievances with that colonial legacy, and the ongoing failure to give the descendants of empire equal status, came via the unlikely topic of weather systems. “Yo why storm Brendan?” wrote the doctor and TV presenter Dr Ronx earlier this month, “I’m out here waiting to be blown away by storm Oluwatunde! We need to decolonise storm names!” Why storms always have European names can be added to a growing list of questions: why don’t British schools teach the history of empire why does it have no national museum why do we glorify colonial violence as personified by figures like Cecil Rhodes why do we know the name of William Wilberforce but not Equiano, a key abolitionist as well as celebrated author?The great thing about language though, is that it waits for no one. While calls to decolonise curricula – and weather – seem likely to continue falling on deaf ears, culture moves on. Several years ago I wrote about how the situation of “the Queen’s English” in Ghana – once associated with superior education and intelligence – has become more perilous, with the potential to attract derision under the acronym LAFA – locally acquired foreign accent.The paradox of empire is perhaps most visible in its legacy of language. The psychology of colonisation could not have worked without suppressing expressions of existing culture, and “educating” its subjects to believe in their own inferiority. But the independence of the African continent in the 20th century could not have come about when it did without the unity that was forged out of common languages brought by colonisers – English, French and Portuguese. The resulting ambivalence towards English is shared not just on the African continent but in the diaspora as well. As the great African-American writer James Baldwin once wrote, “my quarrel with the English language has been that the language reflected none of my experience”. But, Baldwin conceded, “it might be made to bear the burden of my experience, if I could find the stamina to challenge it.”His words reflect a fatigue with the colonial story, which I often share. But at the same time, we always did find the stamina to challenge it, whether or not that was recognised by dictionaries."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29f77d66d24a6e1f0470e59ae0bae1c5e999a588/0_0_4984_2991/master/4984.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2466c660510833a8138d18dd387a13a5","title":"brexit britain hard line immigration openness","story":"New proposals won’t mean restricting the numbers of people coming to the UK – just a new form of opennessBrexit will be “done” by 31 January, except little will change. What the Brexiteers have mistaken for a single moment will in reality be a lengthy and painful process. In most policy areas shaped by EU influence, post-Brexit changes will be slow and incremental. There is, however, one exception to this rule: immigration.After 1 January 2021, free movement will end and EU and non-EU citizens wishing to move to the UK will (unless they are Irish citizens) be treated the same. Despite this shake-up, it’s still unclear what Britain’s new immigration system will look like.When Boris Johnson and Priti Patel promised an “Australian-style points system” last year, their plans were largely vacuous. The Conservative government subsequently commissioned the independent Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) to advise on the shape that Britain’s future immigration system should take. Johnson and Patel probably didn’t expect the MAC’s outgoing chair, Professor Alan Manning, to dismiss talk of their Australian-style points system as, aptly, “pointless”. For good measure, the report also notes that the UK has far more to learn from Austria – where skilled migrants are generally required to have a job offer – than it does from Australia, where many are not.Whether or not the MAC recommendations are adopted in full, big changes are on the way. Theresa May’s 2018 white paper recommended a salary threshold of £30,000 for skilled migrants with a job offer. Businesses – in sectors such as fashion, technology and research, all of which employ EU nationals who, while far from unskilled, earn less than £30,000 – argued for a reduced threshold of £20,000 or £22,000. The MAC report has split the difference, proposing a £25,600 threshold, higher in some better-paid occupations, with special rules applying to NHS and education sectors. Crucially, the report also argues that if the government really wants to adopt a “points-based system” for the most highly skilled migrants, it will need to be far more flexible about the sorts of people it admits – and recognise that not everyone who arrives in Britain will succeed, at least not necessarily in material terms.These proposals should please businesses, although some in lower-paying sectors such as hospitality and food processing, especially outside London, will still face a big shock. The NHS should be able to live with the new arrangements, which essentially say that not just doctors and nurses, but people working in lower-paid positions, will be eligible under the new rules. It will be far harder for social care to adapt to the changes, where the MAC – as it did in its last major report – argues that the problem is that care workers aren’t paid enough because the care system has been persistently underfunded and that the government shouldn’t use immigration as a way of dodging these issues. Their point is valid but it will be of little comfort to those who rely on Britain’s care system now.All this will amount to rapid change. There will need to be consultation, particularly with employers, if not on the big decisions then on a host of second-order questions and then there will need to be time for business to get used to the new system, which will be considerably more costly and burdensome than freedom of movement.For many employers that depend on immigrant workers from the EU, and therefore don’t need to interact with the immigration system at all under the current arrangements, this is not simply a matter of extending and tweaking existing processes and procedures. Businesses (particularly small ones) will suddenly find there are Home Office forms to fill in, fees to pay, and time-consuming bureaucracy to navigate. Time is short – by the summer, employers will want to know what to say when making job offers to EU nationals. The most important immediate impact of Brexit for business will be lots more red tape.So will post-Brexit Britain, without free movement, become closed to all except the “brightest and best”, vindicating Brexiteers who voted to restrict immigration and slow the pace of demographic and social change? Or will we move into a new era, in which global Britain will benefit from skills and talent from all over the world, rather than simply sucking in cheap labour from the rest of Europe?The answer is likely to be somewhere in between. What is certain is that these proposals are far more liberal than anything we could have expected from Theresa May. Immigration-bashers and nativists in the Conservative party and beyond will find this uncomfortable – particularly the resulting increase in immigration from outside the EU. But immigration is a less salient issue among the electorate than it was in 2016, and public perceptions of the economic and social impact of immigration on the UK are far more positive than they were at the time of the referendum. For some people, at least, ending freedom of movement - and hence restoring “control” over immigration - may be more important than guaranteeing lower numbers of migrants.So there are grounds for at least cautious optimism. Contrary to the hopes and fears of many, Brexit looks less like it will make a decisive turn towards restricting immigration. Instead, consistent with the more benign aspects of our history, it may signal a different form of openness.• Jonathan Portes is professor of economics and public policy at King’s College London, and is a senior fellow at UK in a Changing Europe"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c73ff24059f9694ae812d84af8d6b57589973c17/0_0_941_573/master/941.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a612bdc5fb289636f6b925ad3fb5212d","title":"iraqi discoveries help shed light on british museum treasures","story":"Work of trainees in Iraq has enabled new understanding of objects going on show in UKFor decades they have been part of the collection of the British Museum, appreciated for their inidual significance but in many cases shorn of much of their context owing to the circumstances of their discovery and retrieval during the buccaneering period of early archaeology.Now dozens of important artefacts that were removed from Iraq in the late 19th and early 20th centuries are being brought back into focus in an exhibition drawing on groundbreaking discoveries made by Iraqi archaeologists amid the turbulence of the country’s recent history.Among the objects on display is a small dolerite statue dating to around 2130BC, purchased by the museum in the 1930s. It depicts a king called Gudea, who ruled the ancient city of Girsu, one of the world’s first urban civilisations, on the site of modern-day Tello in southern Iraq.The statue shows him in a position of prayer, as do many others of him, according to Sebastien Rey, a curator of ancient Mesopotamia at the museum. But while experts knew from written sources that Gudea constructed a temple in his city, no trace of it had been found.That changed thanks to a discovery made through the Iraq emergency heritage scheme, set up by the British Museum in 2015 to train local archaeologists in heritage protection at a time when many of the country’s historical sites were under threat from destruction by Islamists.By revisiting the site after decades, Rey and a team of local trainee archaeologists discovered not only the site of the king’s 4,000-year-old temple, but also a bakery attached to the temple where huge quantities of bread would have been produced as offerings to the gods.It is believed to be the first example of this kind of set-up in history, ranking it as an “absolutely 1010 and beyond” discovery, Rey said.The purpose of other museum-owned items that have puzzled experts for decades has also become clear as a result of the heritage scheme digs. For example, a collection of inscribed cones: similar items were found inside the temple’s walls as talismanic deposits.Iraqi law forbids archaeological discoveries from being removed from the country, so the new finds will be represented in photographs, reconstructions and video alongside the museum’s own collection.The exhibition, titled Ancient Iraq: New Discoveries, will visit the Great North Museum in Newcastle and the University of Nottingham Museum between March and December.

The NBA legend died at 41 in a helicopter crash with his 13-year-old daughter and seven friends on Sunday, and though Colbert never met him, he said he felt “a strange connection” to this particular type of tragedy: when he was 10, Colbert’s father and two older brothers died in a plane crash that was also in heavy fog. “One of the terrible things about that shock, and the heartbreaking … unreality … nightmare quality of someone huge in your life who just disappears is not knowing what happened,” he said.Unlike a plane, Colbert continued, helicopters don’t have on-board flight recorders – so-called “black boxes” – which can aid investigations. The plane carrying his father and brothers had a flight recorder, “and because investigators knew what happened in that cockpit, new rules were created to save other people’s lives”.Colbert referenced his friend, a helicopter pilot who flew him on vacation in New Zealand and whose father also died in a plane crash at the same age. Her son also died in a helicopter crash, and explained to Colbert that because the they don’t carry black boxes “when a helicopter goes down, we don’t know how to improve the helicopter. We don’t know how to improve the flying of the pilots so this doesn’t happen again in the future.”While nothing will take away the pain for the families in the Bryant crash, Colbert said he hopes that “perhaps someone can take action to make sure that there are some ways to record what is happening in these helicopters so that it doesn’t happen as often”.These families are now in misery, Colbert said. “Why compound their misery with mystery about what happened to their loved ones? It’s better to know than not to know. Because if we know, we can possibly stop this from happening to someone else in the future.”On the Daily Show, Trevor Noah addressed the plight of former national security advisor and “broke-ass Monopoly Man” John Bolton, whose reputation on Fox News has taken a hit. “Not too long ago, John Bolton was clearly part of the Fox family,” Noah said before rolling clips of Bolton given a hero’s welcome to Fox and messing around on flipboards with the Fox and Friends team. “He’s like the goofy uncle who just wants to have fun and wipe Iran off the planet.”But now that Bolton’s forthcoming book alleges that Trump personally told him to withhold aid to Ukraine pending their commitment to investigate his political rivals, Noah said, “Fox News has made it very clear that he is no longer invited to the family cookout.” The mood on Bolton has soured — Lou Dobbs, who once praised Bolton on-air as “a great American,” now linked him to a conspiracy theory. “Damn, one minute, John Bolton is a great American,” said Noah, “and the next, he’s a tool for the deep state. I haven’t seen a flip like that since bread.”“Think about it,” he explained, “for all of human history, we were like ‘bread is the life force that sustains human civilization for thousands of years.’ Then all of a sudden five years ago we were like fuck you bread! I eat sandwiches on lettuce now.’”Bread metaphor aside, it’s clear that “Fox News has put out a clear message to every single one of Trump’s supporters: it doesn’t matter how much they liked you before,” Noah concluded. “If you talk smack, they will turn on you faster than John Bolton on a flipboard.”The White House is “reeling” from the Bolton revelations, said Jimmy Kimmel, and McConnell may not have the votes to block witnesses anymore. The de facto chief of defecting Republicans, Sen. Mitt Romney, told reporters on Tuesday that “it’s increasingly likely that other Republicans will join those of us who think we should hear from John Bolton.”“That’s right, the mitt is about to hit the tan,” said Kimmel. “Who would’ve ever thought that the most rebellious Senator would be Mitt Romney?” Kimmel then addressed Romney directly: “The defendant in the trial gets to withhold evidence if he wants to, and that obviously is insane. But you, Senator Romney, are not insane.” He seems like a guy who wants to do the right thing, “and the right thing is to insist on having a fair trial.”Kimmel promised that if Romney could convince other Republicans to allow witnesses to testify, Kimmel would send him his own dairy cow (which appeared on stage) and a lifetime supply of Twinkies. “The future of our democracy is in your soft, creamy hands,” said Kimmel. “I know you want to do this.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40a42a2299a6b44456b74732a4d05bedfced62e0/0_0_4979_2987/master/4979.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3cfb1b6381e9a863be1c3e8e9cd91124","title":"teachers tell us if you think the planned pay rise is enough","story":"If you are a teacher working in England we would like to hear your thoughts on salaries in the profession In light of the government announcing plans to raise salaries for teachers in England, we’d like to find out whether this measure is enough to stop teachers leaving the profession.

Reed Morano directs and Blake Lively plays Patrick herself.The movie is an interesting mix of Le CarréLudlum locations, invoked with jittery, paranoid urgency – with a little bit of Luc Besson’s film Léon (1994), which featured grizzled Jean Reno instructing young Natalie Portman in the hitperson’s trade. The Rhythm Section gets off to a bit of a dodgy start, with Stephanie’s initial life rather absurdly sketched as that of an angry, grief-filled person who has supposedly drifted into prostitution and drug abuse. (Stephanie’s heroin addiction – and her cigarette addiction – miraculously vanish as the action heats up.) But when a journalist called Proctor (Raza Jeffrey) puts her in the picture about how her family died, she sets out on a mission to find the killer, and this puts her in touch with maverick MI6 tough guy Boyd (Jude Law), who lives in the Scottish Highlands, and shadowy US contact Serra (Sterling K Brown). Lively’s scenes with Law are very watchable, as he tutors her in fanatical fitness and hand-to-hand combat, teaching her to stay calm and let her measured heartbeat and breathing provide the all-important physical “rhythm section” needed as background music for the bravura solo of murder. The rapport between Law and Lively allows the movie both to relax and pick up the pace. Morano puts together good fight scenes, robust stunt work and tasty car chases. It’s destined to be viewed on a million long-haul flights, but it works perfectly well as a thriller.• The Rhythm Section is released in the UK and in the US on 31 January and in Australia on 20 February."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6583cc8bcca356591a6cb0ff2be706e9837099fc/0_219_6570_3942/master/6570.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b2489e5ff877a6a066b393e004409d3","title":"kim joy recipe blueberry frangipane cream mini mug tarts","story":"Crisp pastry, plus a tiny bit of jam and sweet and nutty frangipane, topped with a swirl of whipped cream all the elements of a delectable dessert in miniature mug form.Makes: 24 mini-tarts (or about 12 larger tarts)For the pastry225g plain flour155g salted butter, at room temperature 40g caster sugar 1 medium eggFor the frangipane 100g salted butter100g caster sugar1 medium egg34 tsp almond extract100g ground almonds For the whipped cream topping 130g double cream20g icing sugar12 tsp vanilla bean pastePlus Strawberry jam 24 frozen blueberriesIcing sugar and waterHard pretzels Cocoa powderPut the flour in a mixing bowl chop and add the butter.

The “complicated” nature of the UK’s relationship with the kingdom is so powerful that you can’t expect it to be confined to the mere arms trade or the superprime London property market. Ultimately, the formbook suggests, Saudi Arabia will wish to acquire a huge reputation-laundering machine, with a somewhat smaller stadium-based athletic content facility attached. What we used to think of as “the football club”, if that isn’t going back too far to make sense in this day and age.Happily, the Saudi regime are not the only ones whose priorities are somewhat out of whack. Only last week, I was marvelling at the point-missing evident in a newspaper headline announcing that Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman had “TAUNTED JEFF BEZOS WITH A SEXIST MEME”. Ooh, then now he’s REALLY gone too far. Yet within mere days, that headline’s football equivalent has presented itself, with a warning that “TV piracy row could hit Newcastle takeover bid”. Well, 134 crucifixions between January and September last year … but I guess we found it. TV piracy: the last taboo.Yes, according to reports, Saudi Arabia’s alleged bid for Newcastle United could meet opposition from the Premier League over its involvement in alleged state-sponsored piracy. My mind’s eye immediately spools forward to the moment a week or so hence, where a regretful-looking Sky Sports reporter will stand outside St James’ Park and say: “Whilst the Premier League was OK with the beheadings and the dismemberment, Jim, this dodgy feed stuff has ultimately proved the dealbreaker.”The pirate outfit in question is BeoutQ, which has lifted content from the Qatar-based BeIN Sports, as part of Saudi Arabia’s ongoing and multi-pronged economic conflict with its fellow Gulf state. The European Commission has been on the case of Saudi state involvement in this piracy, after rights holders including the Premier League and La Liga lodged a complaint about what they see as simple theft. This week the EC reported back, accusing Saudi Arabia of “causing considerable harm to EU businesses”. The latter is thought by some to be quite the blot on the Saudi copybook.All we are told this time is that Ashley has let it be known he is furious at the leak at this delicate stage of negotations, and is “demanding answers”, which certainly sounds cheaper than demanding strikers, or left-backs. There is also a suggestion that Mike is in talks with two bidders besides the Saudis – suggesting he has been the highly unfortunate victim of a triple leak. Honestly, what are the chances?Against this questionable backdrop, then, it is arguably the off-the-record comments from the Premier League which are more intriguing, with one anonymous source saying a Saudi takeover would present an “interesting challenge”. I enjoyed that euphemism, as though we were talking about an intermediate-level sudoku, or the problem of how to dispose of a journalist within an embassy using low-fi surgical instruments.Even when the test is actually failed, it has often proved no bar on the unfit or improper. Back in 2010, the Blackpool owner Owen Oyston failed it on account of a rape conviction, and was duly instructed to dispose of his majority shareholding in the club. He did no such thing, though the Premier League apparently vaguely thought he had complied. Oyston used the subsequent years to indulge in what a high court judge called “illegitimate stripping” of the club.In 2017, the Saudi consortium will already know, the Premier League updated their owners’ and directors’ test to take in the notion of “conduct outside the United Kingdom that would constitute an offence”. Well now. Where do you start? And, indeed, where do you end? Either way, testing times for the poor little test could lie ahead, and you certainly wouldn’t trust Ashley not to force English football to take in even more dirty washing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/079bcc6c28f2388ea8c3d1ee044063f2463fdcdf/90_142_2691_1615/master/2691.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c189c4ed9e9f677477b18a5aceb72432","title":"manchester city v manchester united carabao cup semi final second leg live","story":"A poor Lindelof backpass nearly lets in Aguero. De Gea does enough, racing out of his box and block-tackling Aguero. The ball pings out for a goal kick. And that’s the end of the first half. City were by far the better side for the first 35 minutes, but then Nemanja Matic scored, and now we’ve got ourselves a cup tie.45 min: Sterling has a whack after cutting in from the left. The rising shot hits Lindelof on the upper arm. Sterling wants a penalty, but the defender had no time to react, and his arm was right by his body in any case, in a natural position. The referee waves play on.43 min: City have the ball in the net, the result of a sweet flowing move from right to left involving Bernardo, Mahrez, Aguero and De Bruyne. The latter rolls a ball infield for Sterling to slap home from six yards. But there’s to be no first goal against United for Sterling. He’s gone a split second too early, Lindelof holding his position bravely. The flag goes up correctly for offside.41 min: Silva nearly settles their nerves, dribbling dangerously down the right, past Shaw and into the box. He rolls a pass across the face of goal. A toe-poke would do it, but Aguero is uncharacteristically on the back foot. United were opened up there.39 min: De Bruyne rolls a pass towards Sterling on the left. The ball’s travelling at 1mph. Sterling lets it trundle slowly under his boot and out for a throw. City and their followers are suddenly a bag of nerves. They need to settle quickly.37 min: City have been the better side. But United have held firm at the back, and now look. Suddenly the Etihad is a very nervous place. Bravo hesitates over a simple clearance and is nearly closed down by Greenwood. A collective sharp intake of breath, but the keeper clears eventually.Fred curls the free kick in from the left. Silva can only eyebrow a clearing header towards Matic, level with the right-hand post, just inside the box. Matic meets the dropping ball first time, and sweeps a glorious shot into the bottom right! Bravo had no chance, and this semi-final is back on!34 min: Rodri comes sliding in on Lingard as he races down the left. He clips him, and is slightly fortunate not to go in the book. Just a free kick. From which ...32 min: Otamendi, accidentally or otherwise, gave De Gea a wee nudge in the ribs there. The keeper also landed painfully on his boot when the pair fell. A sore one, but he’s a big man and is soon up and about again, fine to continue.30 min: De Bruyne clips a pass down the inside-left channel to release Sterling, who should get a shot away upon reaching the box, but hesitates, allowing Maguire to slide in. The resulting corner ends in a free kick to United, with Otamendi and De Gea falling in a tangle. The keeper’s landed awkwardly, and looks in some pain. On comes the physio.29 min: Fred loops it towards the far post. Matic tries to meet the high ball, but falls over under a pincer movement launched by Rodri and Cancelo. He wants a penalty but it’s shoulder to shoulder to shoulder and he’s not getting it. 28 min: Lingard drifts in from the left and pings a pass to Greenwood, who is clumped from behind by Otamendi. A free kick to the left of centre, 35 yards out. Everyone lines up on the edge of the box, waiting for Fred’s delivery.26 min: Walker sprays a long pass down the right. Walker springs the offside trap and whips a cross towards Aguero, who is denied a close-range header by the presence of Lingard. The resulting corner comes to nought.24 min: City are playing with the patience and confidence you’d expect from a superior team two goals to the good. Pass, pass, passity pass. Suddenly they spring forward en masse, Silva and Aguero combining before teeing up De Bruyne just to the left of the D. De Bruyne looks for the top left, but his fierce rising shot is a wee bit too high.22 min: City stroke it around the middle of the park, re-establishing control.20 min: Some good work by Williams down the inside-left channel, as City are pushed back a little. His attempt to work a cute, crisp move with Shaw and Lingard doesn’t quite come off, but full marks for ambition.19 min: Mahrez fires it long down the middle, but his pass is too meaty for Aguero. City are happy to mix it up. United don’t look comfortable in defence, whatever they do.17 min: Upon taking the corner, City ping it around awhile. Eventually Sterling peels off down the left and looks like bursting clear into the box. But he runs it out of play with a heavy touch. A wry smile as he picks himself up.16 min: Gundogan, Silva and Aguero shuttle the ball upfield at speed. Suddenly Aguero is drifting left to right, across the face of the box. He launches towards the top right. De Gea claws it out for a corner.14 min: Fred spins out of trouble in United’s final third and suddenly there’s a lot of space to work with, City’s press beaten. First Wan-Bissaka nearly breaks clear down the right, then Williams crosses from the left, only just failing to find Martial in the middle. Some hope for United all they need to do is beat City’s press. All they need to do!13 min: Sterling whips in low from the left. Aguero nearly gets a toe to the cross but misses it by an inch and the ball sticks to De Gea.12 min: United spend a little time in the City half. They don’t really go anywhere but that’s not the point of the endeavour. It’s their first prolonged period away from their own third.10 min: VAR isn’t interested. It’s just a corner. The fact that Maguire slipped clumsily might have swayed the decision, but it’s VAR, so who knows. The corner comes to nothing.9 min: De Bruyne crosses from the left. Under the ball, Sterling wants a penalty kick as he’s bowled over from behind by Maguire, who took him down while slipping. This is going to VAR.8 min: Now De Gea is forced to kick a Mahrez snapshot clear. United are finding it difficult to get out of their final third. City have flooded the midfield and are all over them.7 min: Bernardo, quarterbacking from deep on the left, floats a diagonal ball into the box. Aguero breaks clear of Shaw down the inside-right channel, guiding a header across De Gea and towards the bottom left. De Gea sticks out a strong arm to parry clear. Stunning save.5 min: City are beginning to find their groove. Rodri has a whack from distance. It’s charged down and half cleared. City come straight back at United. De Bruyne nearly breaks through down the middle. Bernardo then overhits a pass that would have released Sterling down the left.3 min: Wan-Bissaka launches long. The ball bounces off Martial’s chest. Poor control. Had he taken that down, he had Greenwood to his left, ready to assist in attack, with City light at the back.2 min: All a bit frantic in the opening stages. A poor clearing header by Maguire gives De Bruyne the chance to scoop a pass down the middle with the view of releasing Aguero, but Matic reads the play well to intercept and clear United’s lines properly this time.Here we go, then! A quick blast of Blue Moon, then United get the ball rolling in front of a full house at the Etihad. A derby-day roar. The semi-final is happening!Here come the teams! City wear their famous sky blue shirts, United sport their legendary red. The home fans enjoy their usual pre-match singalong of Hey Jude. We’ll be off in a minute or two!Pep talks! He looks extremely relaxed in contrast to his slightly more edgy opposite number. “We have 2-0. They have to play the game to score goals. But we are going to try to score goals and play our game.”Ole Gunnar Solskjaer speaks. First on the Bruno Fernandes transfer: “We’ve agreed with the club so we can hopefully announce it very soon. That’s of course exciting.” Then last night’s attack on Ed Woodward’s house: “Everyone at the club and proper supporters were disgusted with what had happened. Fans can be passionate and opinions can be voiced in different ways. We’ve got to stick together and stay united.” And finally on tonight’s upcoming spat: “We need to score two more goals than them! We’ve done it before. We need to match our performance six weeks ago. PSG away is always a good memory. But we need a proper performance with and without the ball. We will throw loads of energy at it.”United have also announced the impending arrival of Bruno Fernandes. This is what they’re getting for their £47m, subject to a medical.There are two differences to the side City put out in the first leg. Joao Cancelo and Sergio Aguero come in for Benjamin Mendy and Fernandinho.United make four swaps from the first leg. Harry Maguire, Luke Shaw, Nemanja Matic and Anthony Martial come in for Daniel James, Andreas Pereira and Phil Jones, who drop to the bench, and the injured Marcus Rashford.This may not be the greatest Manchester United side of all time, and Manchester City might look well in control of this tie. But if you believe in the spiritual - things like club DNA, that kind of stuff - this League Cup semi-final remains in the balance.Pep Guardiola certainly thinks so: “It’s Manchester United. They can do it. They have done it.” Twice in the Champions League recently, in fact, coming back from two goals down to beat Olympiakos in 2014 under David Moyes, then repeating the trick against PSG last year with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer at the wheel. Say what you will about the current state of United they’re still a club who know how to turn around a cup tie.There’s also the weird lop-sided nature of the Manchester derby to take into account. United have won their last two matches at City’s gaff, and three of the last five. City, who by contrast regularly turn United over at Old Trafford, have won just one of their last five derbies at home. The away side has won five of the last six. There’s no point trying to rationalise any of this. It is what it is.So while United go into tonight’s second leg 3-1 down, and their chances on the face of things look slim, they’ll retain some hope. Then again, only Tranmere Rovers have ever let a two-goal League Cup semi-final lead slip, in 1994 against Aston Villa City have won seven of their last eight matches in all competitions and if Pep’s men turn it on like they did in the first half hour at Old Trafford, the holders will breeze their way to the final yet again.Who will face Aston Villa in the Wembley final on March 1? City should finish the job, and are the hot bookies favourites. But in the Manchester derby, nothing’s ever certain. So good luck to the sky blues, good luck to the reds, and may the best team win. It’s on!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a2ce6b36832ba0073e274e1d304d9c799009550/0_162_3733_2239/master/3733.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2afc771b1eb699334494320c9d27168b","title":"dream job what happened next","story":"Caretaker on a remote Irish island is the latest viral posting to attract thousands of applicants. But what’s it like to bag a job in a million?As another year of environmental turmoil and political upheaval loomed at the start of 2020, thousands of people – from Alaska to South Africa – turned their sights to the peace and tranquility of Great Blasket, a remote island a mile off the west coast of Ireland. There are no other residents, no electricity, wifi or hot water, but droves of would-be-caretakers were charmed by the idea of looking after a cafe and three cottages there.The posting, which has so far received more than 23,000 applications, is the latest “dream job” opportunity to go viral, following vacancies for a barefoot bookseller in the Males and a cat sanctuary manager on the Greek island of Syros. But do these dream jobs ever live up to expectations? And what of the one-of-a-kind jobs that never hit the headlines?We asked some lucky candidates to find out.It’s somewhat serendipitous that Mari Huws and Emyr Glyn Owen became the new wardens of Ynys Enlli. The couple met on the island on “a perfect summer afternoon” two years ago, so when they spotted the vacancy to run the place on Facebook, “we shared one of those looks between us – the looks that speak louder than words. We had to go for it,” says Huws. “Many people assume that people who want to live on an island are escaping from something, but for us it was more about realising a dream.”The pair quit their jobs, packed up their homes in north Wales and have hit the ground running since arriving in September 2019.The job involves manual labour: digging drains, building fences, mixing cement and fixing broken tractors. But no matter how tough the work, the pair can always end their day with a walk through the fields and a swim in the Irish Sea at sunset.“There aren’t many aspects of mainland life that we miss,” says Huws. “The boatman once told me that ‘the world comes to Enlli’ – and he’s right.”The posting had already gone international by the time the couple applied, but they managed to beat more than 10,000 other applicants to become the new keepers in May 2019.On a typical day, they wake up around 5.45am to prepare breakfast for 10 guests. Coffee is served at 7am, hot breakfast at 9am. There’s a history talk and demonstration of the antique foghorn equipment before guests are shuttled back to the mainland. Beds are remade, bathrooms cleaned and lunch is hastily eaten before the next guests arrive. Appetisers and sparkling wine are served, followed by a four-course meal, often using herbs and vegetables from the island’s garden. Danse and Waterson clock off around 10pm. “It’s definitely a full-time-plus job,” he says.Even “non-guest days” are busy with laundry, buying gasoline and groceries, and prepping food. “It’s easy to allow this to become your whole world,” says Danse. To enjoy a proper day off, the pair disappear away from the island, somewhere without cellphone reception. But they’re learning to carve out time for themselves on the island, too.“We’ll pull out our lawn chairs and look out at the city, maybe have a glass of wine,” says Waterson. “It’s rare that we sit and enjoy it but when we do, it’s amazing that we have this to ourselves – at least for a couple nights a week.”When the New York Times announced it wanted to send a journalist to every location on its list of 52 Places to Go in 2018, a cultural phenomenon ensued. The posting went viral, memes were generated and 13,000 people applied. Jada Yuan, then a staff writer at New York Magazine, was chosen as the lucky writer and soon embarked on a whistlestop tour covering 38 countries over six continents.“I knew I was going to have to take every moment I could to stop and enjoy it, but I also knew it was going to be a ton of work,” says Yuan. As well as pumping out Instagram updates, photographs and a print column each week, Yuan learned last-minute that she’d be organising most of the transport and accommodation herself. “It wasn’t until two days before I left that I realised that would mostly be on me,” she says. “I was constantly trying to get to the next place but also writing about the previous place.”Despite missing trains in India, running out of money in São Tomé and Príncipe, and battling an ever-growing list of articles to file, Yuan found ways to overcome the “travel rage” and enjoy the small wins.“There wasn’t really an average day on St Kilda, it’s a pretty wild place,” says Craig Stanford who, from April 2017 to November 2019, worked as the National Trust for Scotland’s resident archaeologist on the isolated archipelago.The post is a “semi-legendary job in Scottish archaeology”, says Stanford, who spent six months each year conserving, promoting and protecting the archipelago’s cultural heritage, including some of the 1,260 unique stone huts known as cleitean.“Food is probably the most challenging part of the job – you really have to plan it quite carefully,” says Stanford. A helicopter will try to deliver food twice a week, but in a place where “every hour of your day is defined by nature”, the archipelago is impenetrable most of the time. “You end up eating some weird things from the back of the cupboard.”The first time Karen Aspen set foot on a boat, she ended up on an eight-month adventure sailing around the Caribbean. As a temp for an Edinburgh catering company, she was sent to work as the onboard cook for a group of businessmen on a weekend sailing trip around Scotland’s west coast.Without a job to return to, she stayed with the 60ft yacht as it travelled down to Portsmouth on England’s south coast, helping out with a two-month renovation before joining its next voyage across the Atlantic. “I just said: ‘I could do that,’ as you do when you’re 19,” laughs Aspen. Once in Antigua, she cooked for wealthy tourists who chartered the yacht before it was hired by the Canadian film-maker Gregory Colbert to track sperm whales for his film Ashes and Snow.“I was one of those girls who had dolphins on her pencil case,” says Aspen. She never thought she’d see a whale or dolphin in real life, let alone learn to listen out for them on a hydrophone or have a job “where you could walk up on deck and there’d be a whale 10 feet from you”.And despite the complete lack of time off or personal space out on the water, she returned to the Caribbean several times after her spontaneous adventure to continue work on the film.“It was a real turning point for me in my life,” says Aspen. “I was meeting all these people who were following their passions and doing what they really wanted with their lives ... it’s something I would aspire to do – to live life on my own terms.” This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Other victims included approximately 74,000 Poles, 21,000 Roma, 15,000 Soviet PoWs and at least 10,000 from other nationalities. More people died at Auschwitz than at any other Nazi concentration camp. Susan Pollack and Ivor Perl were children when they were transported to the camp, two of an ever decreasing number of survivors who are able to provide first-hand testimony of what happened to them. They speak to Anushka Asthana about their time at Auschwitz, and how they rebuilt their lives afterwards.  With thanks to Arthur Cary. His documentary The Last Survivors features Susan and Ivor. It is on BBC2 at 11.30pm on Monday 27th January.

Plus: Dan Sabbagh on Huawei’s role in British infrastructureFrom the moment Britain entered the European Economic Community in 1973, the question of how closely to align with other European countries has been a vexed one. Britain emphatically voted to remain in the club in a referendum in 1975 but throughout the 1980s the relationship began to fray. By the 2000s, Britain had opted to remain outside the single currency and support for the separatist UK Independence party was growing until David Cameron took the fateful decision to call a referendum on membership of what was then a 27-member European Union.  John Palmer was the ’s Brussels correspondent in 1973 as Britain entered the EEC. He tells Anushka Asthana that he remembers it as a time when Britain was investing in its European future and it was Labour and not the Conservatives that was most wary of what was then primarily a free-trade zone.

She celebrated the former Labour chancellor Roy Jenkins for his role in paving the way for the founding of the single currency.British MEPs including Molly Scott Cato broke down in tears as they addressed the parliament for the final time.But with negotiations between the EU and the UK over the future relationship due to start on 3 March, Von der Leyen also made an appeal for the British prime minister to listen to the calls of the UK’s car industry and aerospace to maintain EU standards outside the bloc. understands that earlier in the day, the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, had been urged by France during an internal meeting of EU27 diplomats to demand that the UK sign up to dynamic alignment across the board on state aid, environmental, social and labour standards.The French argued that the UK could not be given a competitive advantage from which they would reap idends in the future.Barnier gave a non-committal answer, sources said, but he emphasised that protecting the single market was a more important aim than achieving tariff-free access to the British market for EU goods.Speaking to MEPs, Von der Leyen said the EU was offering an unprecedented “zero tariffs, zero quota” deal but suggested that Britain needed to align on basic standards for that to be achievable.The commission president told MEPs: “We will certainly not expose our companies to unfair competition. And it is very clear the trade-off is simple.“The more the United Kingdom does commit to upholding our standards for social protections and workers’ rights, upholding our guarantees on the environment and fair competition …“Just days ago some of the largest business associations in Britain particularly in the car and aerospace industry asked their government to maintain EU standards and rules and I think this is in our mutual interest.“I believe the United Kingdom and the European Union have a mutual interest in the closest possible partnership,” Von der Leyen continued. “No new partnership will bring back the benefits of being part of the same union. But we have the duty to see the best for the British and European people in a post-Brexit world.”The commission president concluded by quoting George Elliot: “Only in the agony of parting do we look into the depths of love. We will always love you and we will never be far,” Von der Leyen said.Guy Verhofstadt, the former prime minister of Belgium who led for the parliament during much of the last four years since the referendum result, asked MEPs to reflect on what had gone wrong.But Verhofstadt’s explanation that the EU had not become federal enough and that the exemptions and rebate offered to the UK had created an unattractively sclerotic bloc failed to convince Farage, however.In his final statement to the parliament, where he has been an MEP for 21 years, Farage said: “Once we have left we will not be coming back and the rest is detail … When I walked in here, you all thought it was terribly funny. You stopped laughing in 2017.”Farage’s party colleagues waved union flags and gave three cheers as he concluded his comments.“Put your flags away, if you are leaving,” responded Mairead McGuinness, an Irish MEP who was chairing the debate as vice-president of the parliament, as Brexit party MEPs left their seats.Barnier spoke in the debate to single out the former Liberal Democrat MEP Andrew Duff and outgoing Labour MEP Richard Corbett for praise in developing the EU.He referenced the words of former cabinet minister Chris Patten, who had once asked if the defence of the national interest could solely be a national concern. “Is it not necessary to be European over and above being a patriot?” Barnier asked."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/789a5d91a479309a3526d6426a53e2df5be5a4e2/0_95_3200_1920/master/3200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=600c3911b2fbf261cbf17164ab2a509d","title":"the britons getting out before brexit drawbridge goes up","story":"UK nationals rush to settle in Spain before they lose their rights as EU citizens on 31 DecemberCampaigners for the rights of British nationals in Spain have reported a rise in the number of inquiries from people rushing through plans to establish residency in the country before the Brexit “drawbridge goes up”.Sue Wilson, the founder of campaign group Bremain in Spain, says now that Brexit is “concrete and is happening” they are seeing evidence of Britons “expediting their plans” for retirement or a career move to Spain.Under the withdrawal agreement British nationals can settle in another EU member state right up to 31 December and claim lifetime rights as EU citizens.“We have people inquiring what the rules are and we are saying to people that as long as they move before 31 December they will have the same rights as those of us who are already here. It is in the withdrawal agreement,” says Wilson.“Even if you haven’t reached pension age and you have paid in for enough years to make you eligible you will have the right to an uprated pension for life under the withdrawal agreement.”Not all rights are guaranteed and the campaign group British in Europe has urged Brussels and London to secure those that have yet to be negotiated, which include freedom of movement and the right to return to the UK with an EU family member after Brexit. But the rights to study, work and retire remain for those moving before 2021.We spoke to some who have already taken the plunge.“I did a spreadsheet at 4am in the morning and concluded that we could probably go now and that’s exactly what we did,” he says.Andy and his wife sold their house and upped sticks from Manchester to Spain in October.“We had always planned to retire out here, then Brexit put that into stark relief. The way that had been implemented put the fear of God into us, really, in terms of getting out here,” says Andy.“I had the vague idea of retiring somewhere between 55 and 60. We have a strict budget and I’ll have to work but we’re glad we did it. We didn’t like the rhetoric and the type of deal people like Dominic Raab was talking about didn’t seem to stack up. There was nobody to talk to – you couldn’t ring the government and ask: ‘Is this the position? Is this cast in stone? Can we trust you?’“We are not economic migrants. We considered Australia many years ago but in terms of employment it’s more complicated. The freedom of movement is key. You can cross a border into France, Spain without even noticing and you have the ability to work with no questions asked. That’s why we chose to become residents here.“Emotionally it’s quite difficult. The biggest step has been leaving all the friends and family and you want them here with you. Three months in there are days when you do feel homesick but there is Facetime and Skype.”But he and his wife have no regrets. “Our fear was the drawbridge would go up and the rights we had pre-Brexit wouldn’t be there.”Lesley and her husband Colin moved in March 2019 from Coventry, where two out of three constituencies voted leave.A former Conservative voter, she now supports the Liberal Democrats although did tactically vote Labour in the last election.“I wasn’t planning to retire for a number of years, but with Brexit looming in March 2019 we decided to make the move. We got here at the beginning of that March to make we have residency appointments booked in good time before 29 March so our rights would be secured.“I worked for the NHS for 25 years and because I moved early I’m a bit poorer but I’m happier.”She and Colin, a former HGV driver, had already downsized property when the referendum happened and had not intended to move full-time to Spain.They thought they would get a camper van and enjoy their retirement years touring Europe. But he had reached retirement age and was on his state pension, and EU reciprocal healthcare rules means he will continue to get NHS-funded care in Spain.“I’m really glad we did it but I still feel angry and sad, not so much for me but my grandchildren. My overriding feeling is that it is the young generation that will lose out. I just feel sorry for them,” says Lesley.Moved earlier than planned in February 2018 because of Brexit.“Almost two years ago I found myself in a bit of a panic because of Brexit. I felt I wanted to move to the EU and I needed to do it pretty quickly.“I spent 40 years working in pharmaceuticals and was used to looking at things 18 months, two-year windows at a time. I thought: if we don’t do this within six months, the door is going to be slammed, the drawbridge will be up.”A orce and his age makes it difficult financially to buy a decent property where he wanted in London where his daughter is, but in Spain, where he rents an apartment for €600 (£500) a month, there are all sorts of possibilities. “Not only can I afford to rent but I can buy as well.”Served in the US, Canada, Sudan and Turkey, travels to Cartagena two or three times a year and has been going to Spain since he was 21.Peter had wanted to retire to Spain for some time but delayed it because his daughter was not so keen. “Then the referendum happened,” he says. He is putting his house up for sale and intends to move before the end of the transition period.“Leaving England would be a wrench. I often analyse why I feel so strongly about getting out of this country. The last sentence says it all because I didn’t say ‘why I feel so strongly about going to Spain’. The reality is that I want to leave the UK because I don’t feel I belong here any more owing to the fact that democracy has been so undermined, and since Boris Johnson has become prime minister my fears have worsened.“I often questioned whether I was just getting over-emotional because I was being deprived of something I wanted. But that is not the case. I have been angry since 24 June 2016 and nothing has happened to appease me.“When I look at the mess Brexit has created, I thought I would literally leave lock, stock and barrel and move my pension into Europe.“I’ve been an activist since 2016. I joined the Lib Dems and read the . I used to read the Daily  and for 40 years voted for the Tories. I consider myself right of centre but when I look at it I’m a social democrat. They have moved to the right and that leaves me left of centre.“This is not the same country that I was born in. It sounds overly dramatic, but I just do not feel comfortable in any way here.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ec502892bf51eb7666aa17b03004d1cdf40553e/283_927_3495_2097/master/3495.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=22c32fb31394c17ae48a29d52fa5b013","title":"uk presses china to let dual nationals join coronavirus exodus","story":"China does not recognise dual nationality and is not letting Chinese passport holders leaveThe British government is urgently pressing Beijing to allow dual nationals to leave China after public outcry over families being split up during the coronavirus evacuations.Only British passport holders who do not also hold Chinese nationality are being allowed to leave. The British embassy in Beijing is urging the Chinese to let dependents of British nationals and British-Chinese dual nationals leave too.“Our priority is to keep British nationals and their family members together and we have urgently raised this with the Chinese authorities,” a Foreign Office spokesperson said on Wednesday.The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, raised the issue of dual nationals with his Chinese counterpart on Tuesday, but the Chinese government has maintained its stance.It is a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals, or possibly seafood. New and troubling viruses usually originate in animal hosts. Ebola and flu are examples.Severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers) are both caused by coronaviruses that came from animals.The virus causes\u0026nbsppneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. If people are admitted to hospital, they may get support for their lungs and other organs as well as fluids. Recovery will depend on the strength of their immune system. Many of those who have died are known to have been already in poor health.Human to human transmission has been confirmed by China’s national health commission. As of 27 January, the Chinese authorities had acknowledged more than 2,700 cases and 56 deaths. In the past week, the number of confirmed infections has more than tripled and cases have been found in 13 provinces, as well as the municipalities of Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing and Tianjin. The virus has also been confirmed outside\u0026nbspChina, in Hong Kong, Macau, Japan, Nepal, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, the US, and Vietnam. There have not been any confirmed cases in the UK at present, with the more than 70 people tested for the virus all proving negative. The actual number to have contracted the virus could be far higher as people with mild symptoms may not have been detected. Modelling by WHO experts at Imperial College London suggests there could be as many as 100,000 cases, with uncertainty putting the margins between 30,000 and 200,000.There were fears that the coronavirus might spread more widely during the week-long lunar new year holidays, which start on 24 January, when millions of Chinese travel home to celebrate, but the festivities have largely been cancelled and Wuhan and other Chinese cities are in lockdown.Unless you have recently travelled to China or been in contact with someone infected with the virus, then you should treat any cough or cold symptoms as normal. The\u0026nbspNHS advises\u0026nbspthat there is generally no need to visit a doctor for a cough unless it is persistent or you are having other symptoms such as chest pain, difficulty breathing or you feel very unwell.No. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. It increases the likelihood that the World\u0026nbspHealth\u0026nbspOrganization will declare the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern on Thursday evening. The key concerns are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital.Families have spoken out about the prospect of being split up during the evacuation process. Sindy Siddle travelled with her husband, Jeff, and nine-year-old daughter, Jasmine, to Hubei province to spend the lunar new year with her family. The family, from Prudhoe, Northumberland, are now facing their “worst nightmare” as Sindy has been told she will not be allowed on the evacuation flight as she has a Chinese passport.Jeff Siddle said: “Having to leave Sindy in China would be the worst thing that anyone could be put through. How am I going to tell Jasmine that her mum has to stay behind?”Natalie Francis, 31, a teacher from York, was told that her three-year-old son, who has a Chinese passport, would not be allowed to leave.Chinese authorities have imposed the same restrictions on other countries evacuating citizens out of the country, including the US. China does not recognise dual nationality, meaning any citizen who wants to get a passport from another country is supposed to give up their Chinese one.Many people unofficially hold two passports by acquiring a second nationality without informing the Chinese authorities. But in recent years, driven partly by an anti-corruption campaign, there have been greater official efforts to crack down on dual nationals.Official advice from the UK’s Foreign Office says: “If you are British and Chinese, you are likely to be regarded by the Chinese authorities as a Chinese citizen, even if you travel to China on a British passport. If you enter China on a Chinese passport, we may not be able to help you if you have a problem.”Along with the US, Japan also began evacuating citizens out of the region on Wednesday.Meanwhile, British Airways has suspended all flights to and from mainland China. Some other commercial airlines are still operating out of airports in the country, but with Hubei province in lockdown, people in that area have no option for leaving other than evacuation flights.UK officials have confirmed that evacuated Britons will be placed in quarantine for 14 days upon their return."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4846e73088f977dbc4a8b9e4e839eb74b2b01bc/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1dba4eb9a7d4e63f486b661a457466e","title":"i finally had control it was my account starting over again in emergency accommodation","story":"For a woman staying in refuge, sorting out a new bank account is made all the more difficult when you can’t reveal the addressI suffered domestic abuse for several years when I was with my husband. The abuse would be in the house, but in front of others he would act completely differently. I was trapped, too frightened to leave, given all that he had done to me and threatened to do. He controlled every aspect of my life, including the finances. He set up a joint account, but the Jobseeker’s Allowance came in his name and only he accessed that account. I would have to ask him for money, even for basic essentials.After many years I eventually found a way to leave him. I was supported by Birmingham and Solihull Women’s Aid, who found me emergency temporary accommodation in a refuge.One bank saw me three times and gave me false hope, each time saying that they would accept. Then in the final appointment they said the manager had now refused because I didn’t have an address. I was so upset and frustrated. It was like I didn’t matter, nobody cared. It was humiliating and again I had no control. I was worried how I would manage without the universal credit money. I had to feed my children. We had been surviving with support from my family and donations.Staff at the refuge then told me that HSBC UK had started a new way to open an account for women in refuges, a way in which we did not have to give the refuge address. An appointment was made and I attended a branch of HSBC UK far away from the shelter with staff support. They were patient and really kind to the kids and me. During the appointment I did think they would say no at any moment, but when they said the account was open I was so relieved.I finally had control. It was my account.

Rising columns of plasma, superheated to almost 6,000C (10,800F), show up as bright spots at the centre of each grain – epicentres for the violent release of heat from the sun’s interior to its surface. As the plasma cools, it descends back below the surface via narrow, shadowy channels between neighbouring granules.This intricate level of detail will help improve understanding of the sun’s behaviour and allow its activity cycle to be predicted more accurately.The US National Solar Observatory’s $344m (£265m) telescope features a four-metre mirror – the world’s largest for a solar telescope – and is located at the 3,000-metre (10,000ft) summit of the Haleakalā volcano on the island of Maui.Valentin Pillet, the director of the National Solar Observatory, described the telescope, which had been under construction since 2013, as a “formidable technological achievement”. A major challenge was maintaining the telescope’s primary mirror at ambient temperature while it looked directly at the sun – any temperature deviation causes air turbulence that could ruin the image quality. The heat is intense enough to rapidly melt metal at the mirror’s focal point.Each night, a swimming pool’s worth of ice is emptied into eight tanks. During the day, coolant is routed through the ice tanks and distributed through the observatory by 7.5 miles (12km) of piping. More than 100 air jets are also positioned behind the main mirror.Incoming light from the sun is deflected from the primary mirror into a chamber of mirrors that sits below the observatory’s dome. Here, the light is bounced from mirror to mirror as it is apportioned between spectrometers, polarimeters and other various other instruments. The observatory’s full suite of instruments, which will allow scientists to measure the magnetic field from the sun’s surface up to its outer atmosphere, will come online later this year.The observations could help resolve longstanding mysteries of the sun, including the counterintuitive feature that the corona – the sun’s atmosphere – is heated to millions of degrees when its surface is only 6,000C. Understanding the physics of solar flares and coronal mass ejections could also significantly improve the ability to predict space weather, which can render GPS systems unreliable, take down power grids and knock out communication channels.The release of the images comes as Nasa’s Parker solar probe makes observations from the edge of the sun’s atmosphere, and before the launch of the Solar Orbiter mission, a European Space Agency-Nasa collaboration, next week."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6705246f45b60f6cccb5c4c057165534081e5add/0_362_6582_3949/master/6582.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=55c4c919bc359965c66a7478b1befc0b","title":"i always wanted to be a dad the rise of single fathers by choice","story":"A growing number of men are pursuing parenthood through surrogacy, adoption or fostering – without a partner. Here, dads who have gone it alone share their storiesThe first night Joe Norton brought home his adoptive sons, Tarren and Owen, he considered his new life, then thought: what have I done? “It’s a monumental decision you’re making, and you’re making it on your own,” says the 54-year-old educational manager from Yorkshire. “The enormity hit me.”Going from being a single man to the sole carer for two children was tougher than he had expected. There was the misbehaviour, particularly when the boys, who are brothers, began to settle in. (Experts call this period “regression”, but it is usually a sign that children are beginning to relax around their new parents.) He was also stumped by unexpected questions – what size socks did the boys wear? Norton had no clue what to buy. “You have an idea what size a T-shirt should be, but socks are a different thing,” he says, chuckling.But it was rewarding, much more so than Norton had hoped or dreamed. Three months after the adoption was completed, in October 2012, Norton took Owen and Tarren – then aged six and five respectively – on a break with family friends. On that holiday, the boys started calling him “Dad”. “It was emotional,” Norton says. “It was all starting to happen.”Norton is one of the growing number of men in the UK who are choosing to become single fathers. Whether through surrogacy, adoption or fostering, these men are deciding to go it alone. While there are no reliable figures documenting the number of men starting families on their own (rather than becoming the primary caregiver after their partner leaves or dies), experts agree that it is becoming more common. There was a record number of single-parent adoptions in 2018. The singer Ricky Martin had twin sons via a surrogate, while the footballer Cristiano Ronaldo is rumoured to have used the same method to have his eldest three children.“We are seeing more men wanting to adopt than in recent years,” says Natalie Gamble, a lawyer specialising in fertility and surrogacy law. In addition to the spike in adoptions, Gamble tells me that single-father surrogacy is becoming more prevalent after a long-awaited change in the law enabled single parents who use surrogates to apply for full rights over their child. “Parents have to apply to the family courts for a parental order previously, only couples were able to do this.”Without a parental order, a surrogate could, theoretically, reclaim their child at any moment – a prospect that terrorised Ian Mucklejohn for many years. In 2001, Mucklejohn, a business owner from Newbury, became Britain’s first surrogate single father. Then 58, he used an egg donor and a surrogate in the US to have triplets – Piers, Lars and Ian. Although Mucklejohn was their biological father, he would have had no legal recourse to keep the boys if the surrogate, Tina Price, had chosen to claim them. “All she had to do was get on a plane and come and get them, no matter what she had signed,” he says.The law changed in January 2019, after Gamble brought to the high court a test case involving a British single father who had had a son, “Z”, via a US surrogate. (Having initially contested the case, the government conceded that the law discriminated against single parents when the president of the family ision of the court declared it incompatible with human rights legislation.) Now, solo parents who have children through a surrogate can apply for a parental order listing them as the child’s only legal parent. Gamble was there the day that the father of “Z” obtained his parental order, the first in the UK to record only a father. “It felt really monumental,” she says.Thanks to the legal change, more men are considering surrogacy. “The options are opening up,” Gamble says. “More British surrogates are willing to be matched with fathers.” Dr Sophie Zadeh of University College London is researching the men who choose to become single fathers, in conjunction with the University of Cambridge’s Centre for Family Research. She tells me that many men decide to go it alone for the same reason that many women do – none of their relationships have worked out and they want to have children before they are too old.This was the case for Norton, who separated from his wife in 2009. “I’d always grown up expecting to have children,” he says. “I’m the oldest of four and three of my siblings are adopted, so when my marriage broke down without children I decided that adoption was the best way.” But going through the adoption process on his own was difficult – it is an intrusive process that can take years, and there is no one to share your frustrations with.But not everyone who becomes a single father does so in the wake of a failed relationship. “I always knew, from a very young age, that I wanted to be a dad – and also that I never wanted to be a biological father,” says 35-year-old Ben Carpenter, a stay-at-home parent from West Yorkshire. “There were vulnerable children out there and I wanted to adopt them.” Carpenter applied to adoption services aged 21. “I knew it was what I wanted to do. Instantly, I completely found my niche.”Over the next decade, Carpenter adopted five children: Jack, Ruby, Lily, Joseph and Teddy. All have special needs – Lily is deaf, Ruby is blind, Jack is autistic and Joseph has Down’s syndrome. Teddy died last year, aged two, from complications relating to Cornelia de Lange syndrome. “He was a wonderful little boy,” Carpenter says. “We’re all gutted.” They set a place for Teddy at the dinner table this Christmas, as a reminder that he was still part of the family.Being a single dad can be challenging if, like Carpenter, your children have special needs. Carpenter’s mother lives with the family and helps with childcare. Even so, he can end up being pulled in more directions than he can manage at any one time – he wasn’t able to get to all the children’s nativity plays, because they attend different schools and the schedules clashed – but he is adamant that his parenting responsibilities are manageable. “I do find time for myself,” he says. In fact, he is considering adopting again. “It’s so rewarding to see a child – whose future is, in some cases, so bleak and dark – flourishing into a child who is thriving and cared for.”Carpenter receives an adoption allowance and child benefit, but still has to budget carefully each month to make ends meet. Indeed, using a surrogate from abroad is an option only for well-off people: the majority of Zadeh’s research cohort who used surrogates had high incomes. “I feel so privileged to have been able to do this,” says 54-year-old Simon Burrell, an educational manager from Brighton. His son, William, was born to a US surrogate late last year. William’s birth was dramatic – he was born two weeks early, on Boxing Day, meaning that Burrell had a mad rush to get to the US and missed the birth. Meeting his son for the first time felt wonderful, he says, but was less overwhelming than he had expected. “I felt like I knew him already,” he says. “I didn’t have that feeling of being overcome or in tears. I was his only parent, he needed me, and I was already a day and a half late getting there.”As we speak, William is sleeping in another room in Burrell’s rented apartment in California he is waiting for William’s paperwork to come through so he can bring him home. Burrell estimates that the surrogacy process, which was arranged through the British agency Brilliant Beginnings, cost about £200,000. Burrell funded it through the sale of his home in London. “It’s unfair that other men who would also be good fathers can’t do this, but they don’t have the option.”Adoption and fostering are alternatives for which you don’t have to be wealthy, says Carpenter. “You can be from any walk of life, as long as you go through the process and are deemed to be a suitable person to adopt. There is no set adopter.” In addition, foster parents are eligible for financial allowances that adoptive parents don’t receive.“My own experience of fostering was that they were incredibly open to single fathers,” says Gareth K Thomas, 34, from south Wales. He has been fostering two boys, aged 13 and 10, and their seven-year-old sister since 2017. “The people going through your fostering application aren’t interested in your sexuality or your marital status. They just want to know that you’ll be a good parent to these kids.” He advises single men who want to foster to get experience of being around children – Thomas volunteered with the Scout Association.He has taken to fostering with great happiness – and relative ease. “Sometimes I have to pinch myself,” he says, laughing. “We go away for weekends, camping, take the dog for a walk, go for hot chocolate. I think: it’s my job to do this? Someone is going to find me out soon.” He hopes to encourage other single men to consider fostering. “The door is wide open,” he says. “That’s the message I would like to get across.”But not everyone’s experience of fostering as a single father is so positive. James, 39, a business owner from London, applied to become a foster parent in January 2018 after attending a fostering roadshow. “I’d wanted to do it for a while,” he says. “I didn’t have much desire to have kids of my own, because I thought it was better to sort out the kids we already had.” After being approved in November 2019, James was introduced to Carl, the 14-year-old he would be fostering.As a single carer, James expected support from foster services, but this was not to be the case. “All the promised support evaporated,” he sighs. It took 10 weeks for James to find Carl a school placement, meaning that he was unable to work. His finances began to unravel. He pleaded for more support from fostering services, to no avail. “I was going to them breaking down in tears.” Eventually, James had to end the placement. “The last thing I wanted to do was let this kid down, but that’s what ended up happening. It was really upsetting and stressful.” He wishes that the foster services had been more realistic about how much support they could offer. “I’d come to care about the kid to have to end the placement was horrible.”In a society that is set up to regard women as primary caregivers, being a single father can feel alienating. Zadeh says: “Men get questions asking whether it’s Mum’s day off.” Even in relatively progressive California, Burrell gets comments. “They say: ‘He’s so cute! How’s the mother?’”Single fathers can also be viewed with suspicion or seen as unfit parents. “People assume they can’t parent properly because they are male,” says Zadeh. Her research indicates that fathers are subject to greater scrutiny from healthcare visitors than mothers. “They’re seen as that bit more unusual,” she says. When Burrell told his friends about his plans to have a child, some questioned whether he was biting off more than he could chew. “We’re used to the idea of women as single parents, but there seems to be an assumption that men can’t do it on their own,” he says.Worse still is when people allege that single fathers are predators. Social media trolls have accused Carpenter of molesting his children. “They tell me that they hope I’m arrested for my crimes of abusing children, and that’s the only reason I wanted to adopt. They cannot cope with the fact that a man wants to love and care for children.” But Carpenter emphasises that those people are in a minority. “Nine out of 10 times, the feedback is so supportive and wonderful.”Mucklejohn has seen attitudes towards single fathers change since he became a parent. “In 2001, I was described as selfish, or undertaking a business transaction to get the children,” he says. Although no one writes about the family critically now, those years caused damage – Mucklejohn’s son Ian struggled to cope with the negative press. “It made him want to be invisible at school,” Mucklejohn says. “He kept a very low profile for fear someone would tap his name into a search engine.”As society becomes more accommodating of single-parent families, whether male or female, it is likely we will see more solo fathers on the school run. But there is still a way to go. “Whether, in 50 years, there will be such a societal shift that we see men doing most of the primary caregiving, I’m not sure,” says Zadeh. She points out that statutory maternity leave is up to 52 weeks, whereas statutory paternity leave is up to two weeks. (However, adoption leave is equivalent to maternity leave.) “These conditions would have to be levelled out before you saw more men taking on non-traditional roles.”About a week after William’s birth, the emotion finally came. Burrell had woken at 7am, fed the baby, made coffee and looked out at the beautiful mountain vista he can see from the window of his rented apartment. “It hit me,” Burrell says. “I’m his daddy. It’s real. This is how we’re going to be now, until he leaves home. That’s when it finally dawned on me.” He felt his heart expanding with love, and he was calm.Some names have been changed"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/011c353cca3d894d8c31aa5244615ed9f341a806/152_175_1995_1197/master/1995.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c5884ab31ae3ea88557cc1ae734e915","title":"ministers told to find 5 savings to refocus on pms priorities","story":"Departments told to identify potential cost-savings in order to boost funds for hospitals, schools and ‘levelling up’Sajid Javid has written to ministers urging them to identify projects that could be scrapped, to cut costs and “refocus” resources on Boris Johnson’s priorities of hospitals, schools and “levelling up”.“This will allow us to refocus our efforts towards the things which matter most: strengthening our NHS making our streets safer and levelling up opportunity across the country,” the letter says.Officials will be expected to examine their budgets line by line, asking whether each item supports what Johnson likes to call “the people’s priorities”.Asking for potential spending cuts is standard practicebefore a spending review – but the emphasis on excising plans that don’t fit the Johnson agenda underlines the urgency with which Downing Street hopes to reshape government.March’s budget is expected to include a significant expansion of long-term investment, funded through extra borrowing, as the Conservatives ditch the tight spending constraints of the past decade.In a speech during the election campaign setting out his plans for the economy, the chancellor said: “Incredibly, at the moment, we can borrow in real terms at negative rates, meaning it is a responsible time to invest.”This approach of borrowing to invest was enshrined in Gordon Brown’s “golden rule”, and championed by a string of Labour shadow chancellors – but rejected by successive Tory chancellors as too lax.Javid is also expected to use Brexit as an opportunity to rewrite the Treasury’s “green book” for measuring the value of investment proposals – a decision that could favour costly plans such as the controversial HS2 rail project.Javid said he would still aim to match current spending with tax revenues, however. “We can’t run an overdraft for ever on our day-to-day spending,” he insisted in his November speech.That is likely to mean the Tories’ more immediate manifesto promises, including recruiting extra nurses and police, will have to be funded partly from within existing budgets – with detailed plans set out in a spending review expected by the autumn.Whitehall departments are being urged to consider ditching some activities outright in order to save money, rather than seeking the “efficiency savings” often favoured by previous administrations.With many infrastructure projects taking years to deliver, Downing Street insiders also say Johnson is impatient to identify more immediate ways of appealing to voters – particularly in some of the seats it snatched from Labour last month.The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said the letter, which was first leaked to Sky News and the Sun, was evidence that the chancellor would not end austerity, however.“We were promised by Johnson and Javid that austerity had ended and the cuts in public services were over. They clearly aren’t on this evidence. Another Johnson lie exposed,” McDonnell said.Johnson is determined to shift the emphasis away from Brexit after the UK formally leaves the EU on Friday evening, and focus on domestic priorities.He is expected to make a speech next week setting out his approach to negotiating the future relationship with the EU, a task that will begin in earnest in March, once the EU27 have agreed collective negotiating guidelines.The Department for Exiting the EU will cease to exist at 11pm on Friday, when the UK officially leaves the bloc – and Johnson has asked ministers and officials to avoid using the word “Brexit” in communications after that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56adafdca0749d7e59df88a0cfc654e896742714/0_118_4244_2546/master/4244.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e9568b823dc82e63a88d3311c4bfcbbe","title":"russian athletes face blanket ban tokyo olympics","story":"Russia has been warned that its track and field athletes face a blanket ban from the Tokyo Olympics – unless it accepts senior officials forged documents and lied in an attempt to help a world champion escape a doping ban.World Athletics issued the ultimatum after a report from the Athletics Integrity Unit found the Russian Athletics Federation had shown no contrition following its staff being charged with doping offences after conspiring with the 2018 world indoor high jump champion, Danil Lysenko, who had missed three doping tests.The AIU said a responsible member federation “would have admitted the charges and shown contrition for its conduct, but Rusaf has chosen to do neither”. It added: “Instead, Rusaf has gone to great lengths to deny any involvement in the matter, blame others and attack the process. This approach is deeply concerning for the AIU Board as it seems to indicate that the current leadership of the federation is merely a continuation of the former.”In a statement World Athletics said that if Rusaf continued its “blanket denials approach” over the Lysenko case it would go to the court of arbitration for sport to get the federation thrown out of the sport.World Athletics also confirmed it would not consider any applications for “authorised neutral athlete” status for the 2020 season unless Rusaf and its former officials admitted the charges against them.A total of 29 Authorised Neutral Athletes from Russia competed at the 2019 World Athletics Championships in Doha in October, winning six medals.In a statement, World Athletics said that if Rusaf admitted fault its council would decide on a new process that would result in the federation and Russian athletes being given another chance, next month.Meanwhile another top British coach has joined Malcolm Arnold in severely criticising UK Athletics for its terrible performances since London 2012. Max Jones, who led the British Athletics team at the 2000 and 2004 Olympics, said he was “astonished” that UK Sport continued to fund UKA given that athletics had gone backwards.Speaking to the Track and Field Stats and Research website, Jones said: “What I’m constantly astonished at is that no account is taken of the £100+ millions of lottery money that has been invested in the sport over the last 20 years.“We are no further on than 25 years ago and certainly have gone backwards from 25-40 years ago and that at a time when we don’t have to face a ‘stoked up’ Russia! When will UK Sport wake up to the fact that ‘insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results?’“To use a housebuilders’ analogy, they spend far too much on building the roof (the elite) while neglecting the foundations (grassroots) which will ultimately lead to a slowdown in talent emerging and therefore less talent to work with.”On Tuesday Arnold, who was British Athletics head coach at the 1996 Olympics, told the  that UKA was guilty of a “dreadful neglect” of the sport since 2012."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4933d1c0e7d8af2da0461bf992da05b792e96932/76_198_3319_1992/master/3319.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f75bb12f06ae7dd217d1cc52af38114","title":"super league 2020 preview","story":"Things rarely stand still in rugby league for too long. Super League began amid a blaze of glory in Paris in March 1996 and, on Thursday, the 25th edition of the competition will start in Wigan. It is a sport which seems to be constantly revolving, rather than evolving. But despite all the changes one thing has never altered: rugby league’s insatiable appetite for mainstream media attention.This year, albeit in slightly unconventional – and in one man’s case, unwanted – circumstances, you suspect the sport finally has its wish. It began with good intentions and positive overtones last week in Leeds, when a newly rebranded, fresh-feeling Super League launched the 2020 campaign with verve, vigour and, for once in rugby league, widespread positivity.How quickly things can change. The news of Israel Folau’s arrival at Catalans on Tuesday, spreading discontent across the sport that he will be playing in Super League this season, dramatically shifted the tone ahead of the big kick-off when Wigan will host Warrington in a mouthwatering opener (more on that later).Folau’s move to Perpignan has caused a stir way beyond traditional league circles, and has strenuously tested the theory – which feels incorrect in this instance – that there is no such thing as bad publicity. The likes of Keegan Hirst and Gareth Thomas have made it abundantly clear they do not think Folau should be welcomed in rugby league, a message shared by many.Only when Folau steps on to a field in England will the response to his signing be truly understood, though. Wigan’s snap decision to dub their game with Catalans in March “Pride Day” is the first of many similar responses from clubs: including Wakefield Trinity, where Folau could make his Dragons debut next weekend. Expect plenty of hostility.Before then, however, there is plenty to digest. Incredibly, the Folau news has managed to push aside what, in any other year, would be the biggest news in rugby league – the likely debut of Sonny Bill Williams this weekend. While Folau comes with considerable baggage, Williams is rightly being profiled as the competition’s standalone star, as you would expect.He and Toronto Wolfpack bring the level of external profile competition bosses have craved for years and, unlike Folau, this is all positive for rugby league. The eyes of the world will be fascinated to see not only how Williams and Toronto get on in their debut season in Super League, but how the Wolfpack deliver on their promise to change rugby league’s reach forever.British sport has not witnessed anything quite as remarkable as a transatlantic team playing in one of its major leagues before, and while Toronto have been around for three years, the fact they are now among the elite means we will find out just how serious they are. Signing Williams is a strong start, and Super League bosses have capitalised accordingly.As they should, too, because this is the start of a two-year period which will take British rugby league into a new era. There is a home World Cup at the end of next year, as well as the renegotiation of the game’s broadcast deal with Sky Sports. The landscape of the sport will change forever post‑2021 players such as Williams, teams as unique as Toronto and the added interest which comes with them cannot harm those talks, you suspect.There are no shortage of talking points elsewhere, too. George Burgess’s arrival at Wigan is one such dynamic to monitor, as is what is certain to be another battle against relegation for three or four teams, with no clear candidate to drop into the Championship.As it has done so often in the past, rugby league feels like a sport undergoing radical change in 2020. Traditionalists and purists may have to get on board with a new era for the sport which encapsulates teams from Canada and France, the prospect of live streaming being incorporated into a new TV deal, and plenty more. Whether it’s Folau‑gate, the Sonny Bill hype or anything else, you sense it’s going to be a rollercoaster year for a sport never afraid to push the boundaries."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b5ce39d227d831c434210cdf35977916f8f876e/0_0_5124_3073/master/5124.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e00d6b308231638bc427a46750c8d36","title":"tell us about the websites your children visit","story":"We want to hear from parents and young adults about the non-mainstream sites they and their children accessWith new rules for technology companies to protect children online announced by the UK Information Commissioner’s Office, we want to hear about the non-mainstream sites children and young people access.Some of these principles include:We want to know about the surprising sites that children and young people visit.

We’ve had a chance to review what they’ve said about it, so for now we have to see what that means from an execution and implementation perspective. It’s pretty complex,” he said.But he also expressed the hope that the UK would change its mind over time, because more competitors to the Chinese telecom company would come forward than the existing two, Ericsson and Nokia.“There is also a chance for the United Kingdom to relook at this as implementation moves forward,” Pompeo said, emphasising that work was being done “to make sure that there are true competitors to Huawei” so that “we can deliver true commercial outcomes across real secure networks that aren’t subject to the Chinese Communist party’s control”.Boris Johnson spoke to Trump on Tuesday afternoon shortly after the proposal was announced, and apparently emphasised collaborating to develop alternatives to Huawei, a sentiment reflected in Pompeo’s remarks.A Downing Street spokesperson said: “The prime minister underlined the importance of like-minded countries working together to ersify the market and break the dominance of a small number of companies.”Pompeo will meet Johnson and the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, during his visit. He is due to appear with Raab on Thursday, with Huawei, the Anne Sacoolas extradition case and future trade talks expected to be discussed publicly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72ab06d671b5b661bee8af0679fd490bbb6b65ee/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a298c33edea38fbed4999859d205931b","title":"alexis ohanian paternity leave male success these things are not mutually exclusive","story":"Alexis Ohanian says paid parental leave was vital when his wife, Serena Williams, gave birth to their daughterIt’s been roughly three years since Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian found out he was going to be a father, but he’s still grappling with the profound awareness of his own mortality that came with it.It first hit him when tennis star Serena Williams, his now wife, presented him with a bag full of positive pregnancy tests, and again a few months later when she almost died after giving birth to their daughter, Olympia. Now, he thinks it’s here to stay.“That overwhelming sense of mortality is the hardest, biggest thing that I suspect I’ll be spending the rest of my life really wrestling with,” Ohanian, 36, says. The multimillionaire venture capitalist is speaking from Palm Beach, Florida, where he is working from home, having just collected Olympia, now two, from “school”.The US is one of only three countries in the world not to have any federally mandated parental leave, and the vast majority of American workplaces do not offer it.But things were different for Ohanian, who was able to take 16 weeks’ paid paternity leave from his then employer Reddit (he now works full time for Initialized Capital, an early-stage venture capital fund which he also co-founded).“I couldn’t imagine going through that as a husband and having to decide or even think for a second about choosing between your wife and your career. That is an inhumane choice to expect someone to make in a modern society.”The experience had such a profound impact on Ohanian that he has since become a prominent voice in the US on fatherhood and an advocate for a national paid family leave law.“My wife and I … we have means, we run our own careers, we have family, we have literally every advantage we could ask for when a newborn shows up, and yet still it was such a traumatising period,” he says.Williams, 38, narrowly escaped with her life when she suffered a pulmonary embolism after giving birth by emergency C-section. Following multiple operations, she was bed-bound for the first six weeks of Olympia’s life and many of the childcare duties fell to Ohanian. He had never held a baby before.“I learnt how to do a diaper and I learnt how to do all these things and just get comfortable with this tiny little person that I was now responsible for.”That crash course gave him the self-belief to handle future challenges. “I feel a confidence and a calm that is a direct result of having that time early when I had no fucking clue what was happening. But I figured it out and it worked.”From the beginning he has shared his experiences of fatherhood on social media, which he believes is uniquely placed to normalise fathers as caregivers and undo negative stereotypes such as the “Homer Simpson incompetent dad”.He believes a culture change is under way – evidence of which he claims can be found in his social media feed and group chat which he says is full of “dads doing dad things”.As more high-profile US figures take time off for the birth of their children, such as Chance the Rapper and the baseball player Daniel Hudson, Ohanian says, there has been “a bigger sea change in perception around fatherhood, around masculinity”.Ohanian and co-founder Steve Huffman started Reddit after graduating from the University of Virginia in 2005 and sold it the following year for a reported $10m to $20m. It’s now one of America’s most popular websites.He says a big part of encouraging men who have access to paternity leave to take it is about redefining what male success looks like. “These things are not mutually exclusive. A man can be just as career-driven, just as passionate, just as effective whether or not he takes time off to be with his family when welcoming a new child.”Ohanian says he did not consider the practicalities of paternity leave until he was about to become a father. When Reddit first introduced its policy he thought it was “reasonable” but admits he did not compute its significance.“It wasn’t until a couple of years later when I was using the policy that I realised this is indispensable and it’s something that a lucky few get access to in America, that really everyone should.”Last year, he went to Washington DC with other fathers to meet with members of Congress to talk about the issue as part of Dove Men+Care’s Pledge for Paternity Leave. He says they “came away from that trip feeling pretty optimistic because everyone there on both sides of the aisle agreed that this is something that we need”.The biggest questions, he says, were around how to fund it, but that he is “glad we’re already at that part in the conversation”. He also takes hope from recently passed legislation entitling 2.1 million federal workers to 12 weeks of paid parental leave.Ohanian will not single out which of the multiple proposed bills on family leave he supports, but in terms of paying for it, he thinks the paid family leave policies that have been introduced in some states – through an insurance fund model – could work nationally. While in an ideal world he would like to see new parents get six months off, he appreciates that may be ambitious.Having lost his mother to brain cancer, he would ultimately like a family leave bill to include time for caring for sick relatives. “I knew what it was like in my early 20s to have to take care of a dying and really debilitated parent and luckily, again, I was an entrepreneur and so I could build the schedule that I wanted to build and I had that flexibility, but the reality is not many people have that.”In the absence of a national law, private companies, especially in the tech industry, are increasingly offering paid family leave as an employee benefit. When Facebook’s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, announced his leave after the birth of his second daughter, he took it as an opportunity to publicise the company’s four-month policy.Ohanian, who excitedly refers to the competition between companies on parental leave as an “arms race”, predicts that in the next 10 years, as demand for tech talent rises across other industries, more companies will start offering it.It’s also valuable for employee retention and productivity. “My instinct here is that yes, an employee will be more productive if they have some sense of peace over how their castle is doing, how their home is doing.”Initialized Capital offers 16 weeks’ paid parental leave. Last year, a quarter of their employees – including three fathers – took it. Ohanian, who refers to himself as a “business dad”, has also started investing in “family tech” companies like The Mom Project, a recruitment service for mothers, and the childcare app Kinside.To get to gender equality, though, he says it’s essential that men take as much parental leave as women. “No matter who’s getting pregnant, if both parents are taking leave then it sort of nullifies that penalty for having a uterus.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0731b001b211dbbde4f4e72c944f88633230ff52/0_175_5242_3145/master/5242.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb0d04e92dce38e71331ff05a5acb100","title":"tory mp criticised over plan to speak at event with far right figures","story":"Daniel Kawczynski to attend Rome event with hard-right, anti-immigration speakersA Conservative MP is facing criticism for planning to speak alongside some of Europe’s leading hard-right, anti-immigration figures including the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, and a niece of Marine Le Pen.Daniel Kawczynski, the MP for Shrewsbury and Atcham, is one of 22 speakers due to address the National Conservatism conference in Rome next week.Italian far-right leaders who will attend the conference include Matteo Salvini, the leader of the League, whose hardline immigration measures included the closure of Italian ports to NGO rescue vessels and the abolition of key protections for asylum seekers.Another is Giorgia Meloni, the leader of the “Italians first” Brothers of Italy party, who has been accompanied to political events by Rachele Mussolini, a granddaughter of the dictator Benito Mussolini.Orbán has been Hungary’s prime minister since 2010, and in 2018 he won a third consecutive term. He has been accused of promoting conspiracy theories, usually with antisemitic undertones, about the influence of George Soros, the billionaire philanthropist, in Hungary and across Europe. He has also tapped into another far-right conspiracy theory, that of the “great replacement”.Marion Maréchal, Le Pen’s niece, has claimed France is becoming “the little niece of Islam”. She has also marched against same sex-marriage and is being touted as a possible far-right contender in the 2022 presidential election.Sponsors of the conference include the London-based thinktank the Bow Group, International Reagan Thatcher Society and Nazione Futura. The UK-based journalist Douglas Murray is also due to speak.It is not clear why Kawczynski, a Polish-born Brexiter and former adviser to David Cameron on eastern Europe, has been invited. Last January his request for the Polish government to veto any extension of article 50 was rebuffed. Questions have arisen over how Boris Johnson’s government will treat far-right, populist leaders after winning an 80-strong majority in December’s general election.Tim Montgomerie, a former journalist who was hired by Downing Street as the prime minister’s social justice adviser in September, said this month that the UK would forge a “special relationship” with Orbán’s authoritarian government after Brexit.Johnson was criticised two years ago for congratulating Orbán on his election victory. His own victory was greeted warmly by both Meloni and Salvini.Responding to Kawczynski’s pending attendance, Prof Rafał Pankowski, a co-founder of the anti-fascist organisation Never Again, said the Conservatives were treading a dangerous path.“The event brings together radical conservatives, rightwing populists and neo-fascists it is an example of growing trans-national cooperation of authoritarian forces.“It is important to draw a clear line between democratic political leaders and the far right, but the distinction is becoming blurred as a result of actions of conservatives like Kawczynski. Through rubbing shoulders with the far right, they legitimise xenophobia, which is a growing global problem,” he said.Margaret Hodge, the newly elected parliamentary chair of the Jewish Labour Movement, called on Johnson to prevent his MP from attending the event.“Johnson does not miss an opportunity to criticise Labour’s antisemitism. While I have agreed with him at times on that, it would be intolerable if he did not stamp out the attendance of one his senior MPs at a conference that will promote racist views,” she said.The Conservative party has been approached for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36753c76ff254957876dc56d600daec78dc09b19/0_115_3422_2053/master/3422.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c5616f0abdd5fb1ecdd945d1911b1adf","title":"what is the coronavirus symptoms china wuhan virus sars infection","story":"What are the symptoms caused by the virus from Wuhan in China, how is it transmitted from one person to another, and at what point should you see a doctor?It is a novel coronavirus – that is to say, a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. Many of those infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city, which also sold live and newly slaughtered animals. New and troubling viruses usually originate in animal hosts. Ebola and flu are examples.The virus causes pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. If people are admitted to hospital, they may get support for their lungs and other organs as well as fluids. Recovery will depend on the strength of their immune system. Many of those who have died are known to have been already in poor health.Human to human transmission has been confirmed by China’s national health commission. As of 29 January, the Chinese authorities had acknowledged about 6,000 cases and 132 deaths. In the past week, the number of confirmed infections has more than tripled and cases have been found in 13 provinces, as well as the municipalities of Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing and Tianjin. The virus has also been confirmed outside China, in Hong Kong, Macau, Japan, Nepal, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, the US, and Vietnam. There have not been any confirmed cases in the UK at present, with the more than 70 people tested for the virus all proving negative. The actual number to have contracted the virus could be far higher as people with mild symptoms may not have been detected. Modelling by WHO experts at Imperial College London suggests there could be as many as 100,000 cases, with uncertainty putting the margins between 30,000 and 200,000.There were fears that the coronavirus might spread more widely during the week-long lunar new year holidays, which started on 24 January, when millions of Chinese travel home to celebrate, but the festivities have largely been cancelled and Wuhan and other Chinese cities are in lockdown. At the moment, it appears that people in poor health are at greatest risk, as is always the case with flu. A key concern is the range of severity of symptoms – some people appear to suffer only mild illness while others are becoming severely ill. This makes it more difficult to establish the true numbers infected and the extent of transmission between people. But the authorities will be keen to stop the spread and will be anxious that the virus could become more potent than it so far appears.Unless you have recently travelled to China or been in contact with someone infected with the virus, then you should treat any cough or cold symptoms as normal. The NHS advises that there is generally no need to visit a doctor for a cough unless it is persistent or you are having other symptoms such as chest pain, difficulty breathing or you feel very unwell.No. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. It increases the likelihood that the World Health Organization will declare the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern. The key issues are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact.Healthcare workers could be at risk if they unexpectedly came across someone with respiratory symptoms who had travelled to an affected region. Generally, the coronavirus appears to be hitting older people hardest, with few cases in children.

Photograph: Brent LewinBloombergPrivacy experts have warned that political parties, sports clubs and community organisations should stop using WhatsApp, the instant messaging service, for group activities.It follows news this week that the GAA had told its member organisations that using the platform raised the risk of non-compliance with strict data privacy laws introduced in 2018.“My advice would be to stop using WhatsApp immediately. WhatsApp in my view does not comply with GDPR and should not be used,” said Daragh O’Brien, managing director of data privacy consultancy Castlebridge. He said that while the messaging service was appropriate for personal use, its use by professional or community organisations raised a series of compliance concerns regarding the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).He said the use of the platform potentially breached requirements around the fair and transparent and lawful processing of data, as well as the security, integrity and confidentiality principal in the GDPR. This was due to the automatic sharing of group members’ information with other members who may not be known to them.“While I might want to take part in a sports group, I might not want all members of the club to know my mobile, which can then be copied, saved and used for other purposes,” Mr O’Brien said. “Administrators and organisations need to recognise that non-compliance carries significant risk to the organisation and therefore the convenience of consumer based tools needs to be balanced against appropriate controls to protect the privacy and safety of members.”Two years agoIn a statement on Wednesday, the GAA said its member clubs were first warned two years ago not to use WhatsApp and other instant messaging apps.“GAA clubs, like all data controllers, need to ensure and promote compliance with data protection legislation, including the GDPR and the Data Protection Act.”The organisation said that its position is outlined in its social media policy and supporting guidelines for GAA clubs. It is pushing clubs to use its own games management system, which enables email and text messaging, as well as messages sent within the app. The issue came to national prominence this week after the child protection officer of the Laois GAA County Board issued a strong warning to members about using the WhatsApp service. Laois Today reported on Monday night that Seamus Lahart told a county board meeting: “I can’t stress it enough, you have to scrap WhatsApp.” Speaking on RTÉ’s Morning Ireland programme on Wednesday morning, the GAA’s data protection officer Kelly Cunningham said: “The GDPR was not written with inidual GAA clubs in mind, however because each GAA club is processing their member’s data, we in turn are data controllers under the legislation, so we need to make sure every club is compliant with the legislation.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4155593.1580329382!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"talks to take place aimed at averting strike by home help staff over pay restoration","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe trade union Siptu had balloted members working in a number of organisations providing home-help services.

Photograph: Nick BradshawThe Green Party leader Eamon Ryan has launched a broadside against Shane Ross describing him as “possibly the worst Minister for Transport that I’ve ever seen and that’s saying something”.Speaking as the party published its transport policy, Mr Ryan said he did not want to be personal but there had been a complete absence of any “decision making, any leadership, any initiative, any interest” in the area.The Dublin Bay South TD said the voters would decide but if recent opinion polls reflected reality, one in 10 people would vote Green and on that basis they could win 15 seats.He said they had 39 candidates and “everyone of them I think would be able to step up to the plate and do a better job than Minister Ross”.Mr Ross has been contacted for his response to Mr Ryan’s comments.In its transport proposals, the Green Party is considering a “frequent flyer” levy. Dublin Bay North candidate Cllr David Healy said the first two flights a person takes would be tax free under the policy but those taking multiple flights “would find the tax quite high”.Closed railway linesDublin Fingal TD Joe O’Brien said the party would review Ireland’s rail network from 100 years ago, which ran to nearly every part of the country, to determine if closed lines could be redeveloped.Its proposals also include a re-organisation of the Department of Transport, which the party believes is “simply incapable” at present of addressing the issue of carbon emissions, which have trebled for road transport in the past 30 years.The party would invest 10 per cent of the transport capital budget in walking infrastructure and a further 10 per cent in cycling, said Cllr Patrick Costello, a Dublin South Central candidate.Dublin Central candidate Neasa Hourigan said one in 10 people walk to work, while the EU average was five in 10.The Green Party says it would not fund the long-promised upgrade and expansion of the A5 from Donegal to Derry despite it being a priority cross-border project.Car reliantMr Ryan said the part would instead seek to restore rail connections to that part of that country “and that might also enhance the development of all those other counties in between”.Clare candidate Cllr Róisín Garvey said rural communities were car reliant and there needed to be a better bus service and more options for rural transport.“If you design for cars you get cars. If you design for people you get people,” she said.Asked about Mayo candidate Saoirse McHugh’s opposition to the carbon tax, which the party favours, Mr Ryan said the Green Party allowed different views but that ultimately the parliamentary party would decide “what happens next”.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"\u0026lsquoWhole world needs to be on alert now \u0026rsquo says WHO as death toll rises to 132 and 6,000 infectedSome 47 people were on White Island when volcano erupted on December 9thHigh-speed rail and cross-border ferry services to be stopped, with flights reducedArdern\u0026rsquos Labour Party-led coalition in power since 2017 will face conservative challengeEmbassy exploring options to evacuate six Irish nationals under lockdown in cityIrish embassy in Beijing monitoring situation but has no plans for an evacuationChinese government steps up efforts to restrict travel and public gatheringsChina temporarily bans sale of wildlife as death toll rises to 56, with nearly 2,000 infectedCity of Wuhan to ban non-essential vehicles from downtown area starting from SundayAuthorities rush to build makeshift hospital as number of suspected cases nears 8,500WHO says it\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquotoo early\u0026rsquo to declare emergency as Scotland reports four suspected casesVerdict aimed at preventing threat of genocide rebuffs Aung San Suu Kyi\u0026rsquos assurancesVictims were American residents air tanker crashed while fighting fires in alpine regionWHO will determine on Thursday if outbreak constitutes a global health emergencyLast year Taiwan became the first Asian country to recognise same-sex marriageControversial new law seen as unconstitutional by opposition, causing months of protestSixth death in China where wider outbreak feared as hundreds of millions begin travelling for lunar new yearHealth commission confirms that coronavirus can spread from person to personCricket ball-sized hail stones smash windows and see residents sledding through streetsOver 60 cases of novel coronavirus identified in Wuhan amid fears it could spread further"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4155446.1580329763!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"meps overwhelmingly endorse brexit deal giving uk go ahead to leave eu","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritain’s Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage holds a union flag during a European Parliament plenary session in Brussels on Wednesday. Photograph: John ThysAFP MEPs in Brussels overwhelmingly endorsed the Brexit withdrawal agreement on Wednesday evening, giving a clear go-ahead to the departure of the UK from the EU on Friday night at midnight Brussels time.The vote was carried by 621 to 49, the final stage of the ratification process which now only has to be signed off formally on Thursday by the European Council.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspOnce it leaves on Friday the UK will enter a transition period until the end of December, during which the two sides will try to reach a trade agreement.In a debate tinged with sadness and emotion over Brexit, a handful of UK remainer MEPs, including Northern Ireland’s Naomi Long, appealed unsuccessfully for a No vote, pledging that they would fight to return to the EU.Sinn Féin’s Martina Anderson, also representing the North, said she would vote for the agreement, which although “an ugly compromise” was better than a hard border on the island of Ireland.Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage clashed with chairwoman Maireád McGuinness over his group’s insistence on breaking house rule by waving Union Jacks.He taunted European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen with Boris Johnson’s “courageous” promise not to contemplate a “level playing field” in the upcoming trade talks – the idea that the UK would need to maintain common regulatory standards with the EU.“Britain is too big to be bullied,” he said.Once the vote was passed, the chamber rose to sing Auld Lang Syne as members embraced departing British colleagues.The debate focused less on the withdrawal agreement and more on the future relationship talks, with Ms Von der Leyen again putting down a marker on the critical importance of regulatory alignment between the EU and UK.“We will not expose our companies,” she said.“The more the UK does to uphold our standards, the closer and better the access to the single market.”\u0026nbspShe pledged in particular to ensure that the commitments made in the withdrawal agreement on citizens’ rights and on the Irish protocol were implemented. And, in speaking of her regret at the UK departure, Ms Von der Leyen quoted George Eliot: “Only in the agony of parting\u0026nbspdo we look into the depths of love.”The leader of the European People’s Parliament group, Manfred Weber, insisted that although the timeframe for trade talks is tight, the EU “need the best agreement, not the quickest”.Proposing the vote to approve the withdrawal agreement resolution, former Belgian prime minister and chair of the parliament’s Brexit steering group Guy Verhofstadt, insisted that the reasons advanced for Brexit were fundamentally flawed. The loss of sovereignty, he said, was a feature of the age we live in, the power of multinationals, of China and the US.“Europe is just the way to regain that sovereignty,” he said.Fine Gael MEP Seán Kelly said he was asked by many in Britain to vote against the agreement. “My heart said yes, my heart, no.” Young people in the UK did not want to leave, he said, but their time would come. “We’ll welcome them back,” he added.Alliance MEP Naomi Long said she would vote No. “We are not accepting Brexit now,” she said. “While Northern Ireland may withdraw, people in Northern Ireland will not withdraw the hand of friendship.”Speakers from the British Lib Dems, Scottish National Party and British Labour also said they would vote No.But the overwhelming mood was of a reluctant Yes, to allow what chief negotiator Michel Barnier called “an orderly withdrawal”.He said, in remarks clearly aimed at Mr Farage, that the challenge was to be European “in addition to being a patriot”.“Europe boosts our own national patriotism,” he said.Checks between Great Britain and Northern IrelandTánaiste Simon Coveney has said that “regardless of what Boris Johnson has said”, Brexit “will involve checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland” when the Brexit transition period ends later this year.The Minister for Foreign Affairs said that Ireland needs to prepare for checks on goods travelling between Ireland and Great Britain after the UK leaves the EU’s trading rules later this year.Although the UK leaves the EU on Friday, it will continue to observe the bloc’s rules until the end of the year.Mr Coveney said that “Northern Ireland is considered an entry point into the single market effectively because of the commitment not to put any form of checks or border infrastructure between Northern Ireland and the Republic of IrelandHe said that committees need to be set up to discuss how to manage the new arrangements and new infrastructure will be needed “to make this a reality” and make sure that the North continues to observe EU rules as provided for in the Withdrawal Agreement.All this, he said, will be very challenging, and the next Government will have to work with the Stormont administration to implement the new rules in a way that “doesn’t stoke isions and tensions.”Fine Gael ministers sought to focus attention on Brexit on Wednesday with warnings that severe economic turbulence may lie ahead if the UK leaves at the end of the year without a trade agreement.“If Brexit goes badly, all will change,” the Minister for Business Heather Humphreys told a press conference on Wednesday, while the Mr Coveney said that Brexit is “coming at us like a freight train whether we like it or not.”The Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe added that the “train is picking up speed.”Asked why Brexit had not become an issue on the campaign trail, Mr Coveney replied that “People are fed up of it . . . But we don’t have the luxury of being fed up about it.”He said that while to date the election campaign had been about public services, he expected that people would begin to focus on the threats of Brexit, especially after the UK leaves the bloc on Friday night.Mr Coveney denied that he had made personal attacks on the Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin. Last week, Mr Coveney said he knew Mr Martin “better than most people” and that he was not the person he wanted to see leading Ireland into the next phase of Brexit - provoking an angry response from Fianna Fáil.On Wednesday, Mr Coveney said that he only wished to contrast the experience of Taoiseach Leo Varadkar with Mr Martin, and give his view that Mr Varadkar was better equipped to handle the next phase of Brexit."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4155505.1580327286!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"a lot of pubs are having parties in the town with the highest leave vote in britain","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLocals chat at a  food store  in Boston, England. The town, in Lincolnshire, voted by  a 75 per cent majority to leave the European Union in the 2016 referendum, giving it the highest proportion of Brexit voters in the UK. Photograph: Darren StaplesGettyIn Boston, Lincolnshire 75.6 per cent voted to leave the EU, the highest leave vote in Britain, but most people I speak to express relief rather than joy that it’s finally happening.“A lot of pubs are having parties,” says Leanne Walker, who is in the midst of washing up in Crumbs Café.“Most of the people we know voted ‘leave’,” says Jayne Shinn, also washing up. “But we’re sick of hearing ‘Brexit, Brexit, Brexit’.”Why did they vote leave? Everyone says “immigration”. There are 65,000 people living in Boston and according to the 2011 census, 13 per cent of them are migrants, largely from Eastern Europe, drawn here to work in the polytunnel farms and factories around the town. More recent estimates suggest the foreign born population of Boston is up to one in five.“They don’t mix,” says Jayne Shinn, also washing up. “They go to their own shops and send their money home.”Reduce the numbersWill Brexit change things? “It will hopefully reduce the numbers,” says Robinson. “I’m not saying they’re all the same.”What about those who say that immigrants are necessary for all of the farms nearby?“Before they all came our local men did that work,” says Shinn.“But would they do it now though?” asks Robinson. “They don’t work like that anymore.”“I used to work on the land,” says Michelle Casey, another employee. “It was hard.”“So did I,” says Shinn. “What do you think ladies?” she asks two older women who’ve come to the counter to pay their bill.“Nowadays, you wouldn’t get the young people out of bed,” says Lorraine Wiseman. Her friend, Pauline Cooper, nods in agreement. I explain that I’m asking what will happen if the migrants leave. They change their minds quickly.“We didn’t need migrants years ago and we don’t need them now,” says Wiseman.“The ones who are here won’t really go back,” says Carol Rate, the owner of the café.“We should make them go back,” says Cooper, darkly.Moroccan-born mayorAnton Dani, the Moroccan-born mayor of Boston, believes Brexit day is worth celebrating. On Friday he’s welcoming the crew of Good Morning Britain to his café, Café de Paris. He entered politics after a speech he gave on Question Time lamenting a lack of integration in Boston (a report from the centre right Policy Exchange think tank has since found it to be the least integrated town in Britain). He subsequently became a UKIP counsellor but has since joined the Conservative party.For Dani the leave vote was about “dignity and sovereignty”. Europe took Britain for granted, he says, and they will still need to trade.“Don’t laugh, but I watch Eurovision, 90 per cent of the contestants sing in English. They’re using our language but still they don’t give us any points. Europe wants to use us, but they don’t like us.”Why was leaving important to Boston? “The government hasn’t really supported the influx of migration that came to Boston. The infrastructure was hit very hard.”That said, he thinks there are misunderstandings. He knows some voters believed a leave vote would lead to migrants being sent home, whereas, he says, “controlled migration” is economically necessary. He had an argument recently with a constituent who was angry that foreigners still lived there. He sighs. “Brexit is not a magic wand. But on Friday the 17.5 million who voted for Brexit will have their day.”In the Kathmandu costume shop and sex shop, Cerry Fletcher tells me she can’t wait to celebrate Brexit day. Her main worry is crime, which many in Boston blame on migrants. The percentage of serious crime in Boston is in keeping with the national average, but Fletcher says she is frequently harassed by drunk men on the street. She doesn’t want to malign all immigrants, she adds.“I’m an immigrant myself.” She came from Ireland as a baby and is named after County Kerry. “It’s spelled with a ‘C’ because my granddad was drunk when he registered it.”Brexit and crystalsOver at the market, Alan Clarke who runs a stall called Destiny, Dragons and Dreams selling “mystic gifts” voted ‘leave’ for reasons of national sovereignty. He’s less concerned with immigration than others I meet. “But the politicians have wasted so much time.”Does he believe in mysticism? He says the mysticism is largely his wife’s thing, but he believes in “the healing crystals . . . I’ve seen them work. Anything you believe in can work.” He laughs. “Like Brexit. It has to work.”Fishmonger Carl Edwards is the only remain voter I meet in Boston. “Brexit is the biggest mistake this country ever made,” he says. “But that view wouldn’t make me many friends here. My peers have told me we must leave and I must accept that. I think it’s turned us into a very racist, insipid nation.”Polish financial adviser Iga Paczkowski runs a business called “Lincs-EU” which she characterises as an unofficial citizens’ advice bureau. She was deeply disappointed by the referendum results. But everyone was disappointed, she says, even those who voted for it.Poles have been here since Polish pilots were here during the war, says Paczkowski, but they’ve stopped coming now. The rules about residency keep changing so even though she has “indefinite leave to remain” she feels insecure.“People are saying it’s ‘us and them’ but there is no ‘us and them’. Those who tell me to go home: This is my home. Please don’t ask me to leave.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4155248.1580312023!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"how republicans came to deify the presidency","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUS president Donald Trump: Republicans who believe that Trump has a case to answer also know that he will turn his tweets, his voters and his donors on any who defy him. Photograph:  Mandel NganAFP via Getty ImagesIt was plain that Christian Bale is the actor of our times when he made constitutional jurisprudence sing on screen. As a fearsome Dick Cheney in Vice, he encounters, digests and then implements the “unitary executive theory”. This lavish construal of White House power, touted by right-wing lawyers in the 1970s, sidelines those bothersome checks and balances. It was the intellectual alibi for perhaps the mightiest vice-president in US history.This week, as Donald Trump’s lawyers fend off impeachment charges, the film rewards second viewing. The likes of Alan Dershowitz have not majored, you will notice, on the facts of the Ukraine scandal. Only so much time is spent on whether the president sought Kiev’s help against his domestic opponents, on pain of withheld aid. Instead, the legal defence is that such behaviour lies well inside his remit anyway. The quid pro quo purportedly set out in a new book by John Bolton, the former national security adviser, is not damning, says Dershowitz, “even if true”.When the Senate acquits Trump in the coming weeks, partisan fealty will be the main reason. That, and what Michael Gerson, the former speech writer to George W Bush, calls “understandable cowardice”. Republicans who believe that Trump has a case to answer also know that he will turn his tweets, his voters and his donors on any who defy him.There is another motive at work, though, and it is as troubling as naked fear and my-party-right-or-wrong. Lots of Republicans sincerely believe in an all-powerful presidency, at least when one of their own occupies it. Their vote to acquit is the culmination of half a century of conservative thought in that direction. And for all the uniqueness of Trump, his special knack for reducing once-serious conservatives to jelly, this deference to executive power will not vanish when he goes.Nixon and ReaganAfter likening Franklin Roosevelt to a monarch, conservatives rather came to terms with presidential power. They cited the unique exigencies of a world hegemon. Richard Nixon assumed wide discretion to prosecute the Vietnam war. Ronald Reagan needed legal cover for secret operations in Central America. Under Bush, it was the war on terror that justified a new round of centralisation, with Cheney as the de facto if not de jure beneficiary.Thus did the party of small government come to deify the White House. Thus did a party of constitutional originalists read sweeping powers into parsimonious text. It took a big-government liberal, Arthur Schlesinger, that fixture of Camelot, to deplore the “imperial” presidency.In China, the US has a different challenger now, but the Republican answer – a free hand for the commander-in-chief – never changes. It is all the more urgent, they would say, in a world of rising autocracies. Some conservatives fear for America’s viability as a superpower if its leader has to act with less freedom than is enjoyed by Xi Jinping (or Vladimir Putin in Russia or Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan).When liberals accuse the GOP of strongman-worship, they tend to mean a shallow and pathetic adulation, a schoolyard crush on the tough kid. If only. It is more thought through than that. It is a legal doctrine backed by a political analysis. At its core are misgivings about whether checks and balances, as presently constituted, are reconcilable with great-power status. This tension between limited government and national grandeur is innate to conservatism. John Locke does not always prevail over Thomas Hobbes. Raw powerA case in point is the Republican defence of this president. At times, it does not contest the facts so much as question all the fuss, as though there were something herbivorous and emasculating about constitutional niceties in a world governed by raw power. For all the focus on Trump, a President Mike Pompeo (now secretary of state) or a President Nikki Haley (the recent UN ambassador) could count on no less awesome latitude from Republicans.The partisanship behind the coming acquittal is aired often. It is the main part of the story, no doubt, but it is also the domestic part. The global dimension of what is the first impeachment over foreign policy is sometimes missed. For 50 years, conservatives have wondered if the president is too trammelled to guard US interests in a brutal world.It is not a frivolous concern. There are Europeans with similar qualms about the fragmented, consensualist EU in an age of unitary autocrats. Still, we are left to guess how Republicans will feel about an imperial presidency when it is Bernie Sanders or another Democrat atop the Augustan throne. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Read more about the Donald Trump administration"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons january 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178.Rebecca Long-Bailey challenged over claim she worked through the night to keep Labour afloat Police are more interested in \u0026#39process\u0026#39 than crime fighting, says policing ministerComment: On an emotional last day in Brussels, Nigel Farage had this message for the EU... and they didn’t like it one bit\tTate in hot water with unions over £40,000 \u0026#39head of coffee\u0026#39 role which dwarfs salary of curatorsWhite House moves to block John Bolton\u0026#39s book release, citing classified information\u0026#39Knives out\u0026#39 for Bernie Sanders as Democrat opponents launch heart attack advertVictims of The Troubles will only be compensated if injured \u0026#39through no fault of their own\u0026#39, Boris Johnson saysAmsterdam\u0026#39s 20,000 Airbnb hosts must get tourist licences or stop operating, court rulesPaul Farnes, last Battle of Britain fighter pilot ace, dies aged 101Northern Rail to be taken into public ownership as Transport Secretary puts other operators on noticeBBC News is \u0026#39super-serving\u0026#39 the old and must focus on the young, boss saysWatchdogs investigate two UK deaths which may be linked to vaping Stubhub warned by watchdog to stop using \u0026#39misleading messages\u0026#39 to sell ticketsScottish Government gave Ferguson ferry contract to highest £97m bidder due to \u0026#39vested interest or corruption\u0026#39Coronavirus: Inside the locked down Chinese city with virus deja vu Greece to deploy floating barriers to stop migrants reaching Aegean islandsUrsula von der Leyen tells UK that Europe \u0026#39will always love you\u0026#39 as MEPs approve withdrawal agreementFrench writer accused of child rape expresses \u0026#39regrets\u0026#39 over sex with minors, saying he \u0026#39didn\u0026#39t know\u0026#39 it was a crimeComment: Oxford and Cambridge need new collegesRaffle tickets unveiled to win Mexico\u0026#39s presidential jetWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus inside locked chinese city virus deja vu","story":"These days, getting fresh food in Foshan for Li Xiyan means waking early and having sharp elbows to fend off other people. Shops are struggling to replenish stocks after authorities blocked numerous transport links across China in efforts to contain the coronavirus outbreak.“The supermarkets don’t have much,” said Ms Li, 55, who lines up before the doors open at 8am. “It’s OK, we just eat less.But simple meals at home are a far cry from how she normally spends this time of year, celebrating the Lunar New Year holiday at banquets with family and friends.  In Foshan, in south-eastern Guangdong province, local officials have cancelled public events and shuttered tourist attractions – including a theme park honouring homegrown kung-fu icon Bruce Lee. Few cars travel the roads, shops are shuttered and empty public buses criss-cross the city, which is known for its textile manufacturing.  Many have obeyed the government’s recommendation to stay at home to try and reduce exposure to the new virus, which has infected nearly 6,000 and killed more than 130.Guangdong has confirmed more than 200 cases, making it the second hardest-hit after Hubei province, which is home to Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak. Wuhan is on lockdown as experts race to work out the cause of the virus, and how to stop it, and British nationals have been evacuated.For many in Foshan, this is old news – this city is where scientists believe the first Sars case developed, a coronavirus epidemic that originated in China, spread abroad, and killed nearly 800 people in 2002 and 2003.  “It’s not that scary,” Ms Li says. “We’ve been through this before.”  As of midnight Tuesday, the number of cases exceeded the 5,327 people infected by Sars nearly two decades ago.  The figures have been ticking rapidly upward in the four weeks since China announced it was investigating a new mystery disease, though the country\u0027s centre for disease control estimates a mortality rate of less than 3 per cent, lower than the 10 per cent that were affected by Sars.The government is providing more frequent updates now than it did in 2002, when officials actively suppressed news of the Sars outbreak, exacerbating disease spread and creating panic and confusion among residents. Still, there is growing evidence that the official numbers released may not paint the full picture just yet.The  interviewed Kyle Hui, 42, whose stepmother Chen Min, 65, died within 10 days of developing a fever and cough – symptoms consistent with the new coronavirus infection.  But doctors never tested her for the disease, and her death wasn’t included in the official government count, suggesting the scale of the problem remains far greater than Chinese authorities have acknowledged.  Updates are even harder to come by for doctors working in hospitals designated for treating coronavirus patients, including at the Foshan No. 1 People’s Hospital, where two workers in hazmat suits, blue latex gloves and face masks, pictured below, checked the temperature of everyone entering the building.The infectious diseases ward had its doors propped open, and a sole doctor’s coat hung outside the canteen, as teams of police patrolled the ground. One officer shooed the  away.Information about new developments, including the number of admitted patients infected with the new coronavirus, is hard to come by at the hospital.“There’s no internal communication – we aren’t told much,” said Mr Yang, a doctor at the hospital, who declined to give his full name as he wasn’t authorised to speak to media.Instead, details are being reported to senior health authorities, before being passed on and disseminated through China’s state-controlled media outlets, from where he and the rest of the country’s 1.4 billion citizens are getting their information.“The situation is very serious,” he said. “Now we know it’s contagious and the risks are very high.”“It’s tiring work, being a doctor – it’s hard and dangerous,” he said. “But this is the way things are right now in the country hopefully, it will get better.”  Doctors at The First People\u0026#39s Hospital of Foshan are struggling with poor communication about the virusLocals, though, find the state media updates reassuring. Zhang Yonghang, 30, an English teacher, follows them daily, and remains unfussed, even though China has now raised the highest public health alert.“I don’t think it’s as bad as back then,” Ms Zhang said, referring to the Sars epidemic, when she remembers being worried. “This time, It seems like the government is more nervous, because of all the Lunar New Year travel.”“Staying at home, we’ve been quite bored,” she said, while taking a stroll with her husband and three-year-old daughter in a park next to the Foshan hospital. Long days of doing little will continue for the next few weeks as her school has delayed the start of classes until mid-February.Not everyone is so relaxed. Delivery man Mr Fei, 23, pictured below, in neighbouring Guangzhou, a city of 15 million and the capital of Guangdong province, slips on gloves for protection when he send takeaway deliveries to hospitals.“Of course I’m worried when I have to fulfill those,” he said. “But if I feel that way, others will, too, which means if I push it off, they might as well.”“So I think I better just do it – at this time, it’s better to be strong and help out.”Fei a delivery man in HebeiWith the disease outbreak, fewer orders are coming in, and he expects to take home half of his usual wages – at most 3,000 yuan (£330) this month. So he’s now looking for temporary jobs to make up the difference.Mr Fei, like anyone who ventures outside, is now required to don a face mask. People are also frequently stopped at mall entrances, toll booths, makeshift roadside stands, even parking garage entrances to have their body temperatures checked.  Workers are screening for a fever, an indicator of a potential coronavirus infection, though it’s unclear how effective this will be in combating further spread as scientists have found it’s possible to be infected and not display any symptoms.Members of the public have their body temperature screened at a mall in FoshanExperts are racing to understand the novel coronavirus, investigating how the virus jumped between humans and figuring out in what ways people become infected – all important clues that could inform disease prevention and treatment.  “Now we know there are second, or third-generation cases that have come from those first cases,” said David Heymann, an infectious disease expert at Chatham House, who led the global response to Sars as the executive director of the World Health Organization’s communicable diseases cluster.  “The question we have is, how is it transmitted?” he said. “Is it just by close bodily contact, is it face-to-face when someone coughs in another person’s face?”Until experts discover more about the new virus, allowing health officials to get a better handle on the situation, many Chinese will continue lining up for fever checks and disinfectant spritzes – a handy solution as shops are all out of anti-bacterial hand gels, soaps, wet wipes and cleaning liquids.Cleaners will also keep disinfecting hotel lobbies, shopping centres, and elevators, with signs everywhere showing the sanitising schedule.It’s hard to think about much else with public health announcements emblazoned on billboards – “Have you washed your hands today? Did you remember a face mask today?” – along with propaganda slogans about “government control” over the epidemic.In rural villages, they’re even broadcast on loop over loudspeakers.  Still, Ms Li says life keeps on churning for her and her daughter, Li Sha, 28. The main difference is that they’ve hoarded face masks and always carry a bit of disinfectant hand gel with them.  But “the vegetables are a little bit more expensive,” complained Ms Li. Rebecca Long-Bailey challenged over claim she worked through the night to keep Labour afloat Police are more interested in \u0026#39process\u0026#39 than crime fighting, says policing ministerComment: On an emotional last day in Brussels, Nigel Farage had this message for the EU... and they didn’t like it one bit\tTate in hot water with unions over £40,000 \u0026#39head of coffee\u0026#39 role which dwarfs salary of curatorsWhite House moves to block John Bolton\u0026#39s book release, citing classified information\u0026#39Knives out\u0026#39 for Bernie Sanders as Democrat opponents launch heart attack advertVictims of The Troubles will only be compensated if injured \u0026#39through no fault of their own\u0026#39, Boris Johnson saysAmsterdam\u0026#39s 20,000 Airbnb hosts must get tourist licences or stop operating, court rulesPaul Farnes, last Battle of Britain fighter pilot ace, dies aged 101Northern Rail to be taken into public ownership as Transport Secretary puts other operators on noticeBBC News is \u0026#39super-serving\u0026#39 the old and must focus on the young, boss saysWatchdogs investigate two UK deaths which may be linked to vaping Stubhub warned by watchdog to stop using \u0026#39misleading messages\u0026#39 to sell ticketsScottish Government gave Ferguson ferry contract to highest £97m bidder due to \u0026#39vested interest or corruption\u0026#39Greece to deploy floating barriers to stop migrants reaching Aegean islandsUrsula von der Leyen tells UK that Europe \u0026#39will always love you\u0026#39 as MEPs approve withdrawal agreementFrench writer accused of child rape expresses \u0026#39regrets\u0026#39 over sex with minors, saying he \u0026#39didn\u0026#39t know\u0026#39 it was a crimeComment: Oxford and Cambridge need new collegesRaffle tickets unveiled to win Mexico\u0026#39s presidential jetWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/02/14/18/Airbus-A380.jpg","title":"airbus corruption investigation settlement investigation sfo bribery","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.European plane maker faces multi-billion euro fine but avoids criminal prosecution over alleged bribery schemeAirbus has agreed a settlement likely to cost billions of dollars over allegations of bribery and corruption.The European plane maker reached a deal with British, French and US authorities after a three-year investigation into payments made to intermediaries to secure contracts for jet sales.“Airbus confirms that it has reached agreement in principle with the French Parquet National Financier, the UK Serious Fraud Office and the US authorities,” the aerospace group said.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“These agreements are made in the context of investigations into allegations of bribery and corruption as well as compliance with the US international traffic in arms regulations.

The discovery of the crater, named\u0026nbspOccator, led some to speculate that it had been constructed by an alien civilisation – though it is most likely just an accident of light and shadow on the surface.In the new research, conducted by scientists from the\u0026nbspUniversity of Cadiz and published in the journal\u0026nbspActa Astronautica, participants were shown one of those mysterious formations on the planet\u0027s surface. They were then asked to describe what they saw, with many people pointing out the unusual formation.The scientists then did the same with an artificial intelligence system, which had been trained to spot squares and triangles in images. The AI also spotted the formations – and, once it had, it meant that participants also saw them too.Both people and artificial intelligence detected a square structure in the images, but the AI also identified a triangle, said Gabriel G\u0026nbspDe la Torre, the neuropsychologist who led the study.\u0026nbspAnd when the triangular option was shown to humans, the percentage of persons claiming to see it also increased significantly.The researchers said the study should warn those hunting for alien civilisations that the use of artificial intelligence could confuse us and tell us that it has detected impossible or false things. But it might also help us spot structures that would never have been noticed by humanity, he said,\u0026nbspBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Factories outside Wuhan area will not reopen after the lunar new year holiday until 10 February, Mr Cook said, but Apple built the delayed restart into its wider revenue forecast.Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Those currently paying a lot in daily fees are likely to see their borrowing costs reduced while those who are less heavily into their overdrafts will pay more.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Torches are lit using a flare ahead of the Up Helly Aa Viking festival.

It has previously warned that it would look at introducing a cap on overdraft charges if lenders did not introduce competitive rates.HSBC, First Direct, M\u0026ampS Bank and TSB will all introduce rates of 39.9 per cent while NatWest is to charge half a percentage point less. Nationwide has already brought in a 39.9 per cent rate for its current accounts and Barclays will charge 35 per cent.Lloyds Banking Group has said its customers will be charged new “personalised” overdraft rates of up to 49.9 per cent from April.In a letter to lenders, the FCA wrote: “We are writing to you to understand more about your new overdraft pricing and the measures you have in place to help customers who may be adversely impacted by the changes you are making to this pricing.”The watchdog introduced changes to overdraft rules after it found that unarranged overdraft fees can be 10 times as high as charges for payday loans.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The latest version of Apple’s wireless earbuds\u0026nbspAirPods sold well during the festive season.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesShares in the company rose 1 per cent after the announcement. Apple has more than doubled in value since a low last year, adding more than $725bn\u0026nbsp(£560bn)\u0026nbspto its market capitalisation and cementing its position as America’s most valuable company.Apple sold $56bn-worth\u0026nbsp(£43bn) of iPhone 11s in the quarter, following the launch of the latest iteration of the firm’s flagship handset in September.

Those currently paying a lot in daily fees are likely to see their borrowing costs reduced while those who are less heavily into their overdrafts will pay more.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Torches are lit using a flare ahead of the Up Helly Aa Viking festival.

Britain will go to the polls tomorrow to voteA surfer off the North East coast at TynemouthThe FCA said on Tuesday that it has asked banks how they decided on their new rates, which have clustered around 40 per cent. It has previously warned that it would look at introducing a cap on overdraft charges if lenders did not introduce competitive rates.HSBC, First Direct, M\u0026ampS Bank and TSB will all introduce rates of 39.9 per cent while NatWest is to charge half a percentage point less. Nationwide has already brought in a 39.9 per cent rate for its current accounts and Barclays will charge 35 per cent.Lloyds Banking Group has said its customers will be charged new “personalised” overdraft rates of up to 49.9 per cent from April.In a letter to lenders, the FCA wrote: “We are writing to you to understand more about your new overdraft pricing and the measures you have in place to help customers who may be adversely impacted by the changes you are making to this pricing.”The watchdog introduced changes to overdraft rules after it found that unarranged overdraft fees can be 10 times as high as charges for payday loans.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Ms Melis suggested that deregulation after Brexit could help persuade financial services businesses to remain in the UK.“If the government can position the UK as having a more favourable regulatory environment and separate it from the red tape of European regulation, then we may see the UK win back its crown and attract new talent to the sector,” Melis said.Adopting a light-touch approach to regulation after Brexit – dubbed the “Singapore-on-Thames” model by some critics – would likely prove controversial.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The world is watching to see if the UK and the EU can overcome the political hurdles around Brexit and secure a deal that makes economic sense.\u0026nbsp“With European economies facing significant economic headwinds, it is vital that policymakers keep a sharp weather eye on wider European competitiveness, and seek to maintain open and unfettered access to global capital markets through Europe’s primary international financial centre in the UK.”Separate research conducted by ZYen found that New York overtook London as the world’s top banking hub in September 2018 and extended its lead last year.Despite the increasingly bleak sentiment about London’s future, its financial sector is still expanding at a healthy clip, at least on some measures.The UK’s net exports of financial and related professional services grew by around 5 per cent to an estimated £82.8bn in 2018, up from £79bn in 2017.\u0026nbspIn currency markets, London has consolidated its dominant position, accounting for 43 per cent of global foreign exchange revenues last year.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Daniel Kaluuya and Jodie Turner-Smith are the unlikely couple thrust together on a go-nowhere blind date, only for tragedy to transform them into folk heroes roaming across the USA searching for shelter. It’s a spellbinding debut. (Adam White) Guaranteed to be one of the major players in next year’s Oscars, Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite works better the less you know about it. What you should know is that it is a devilishly inventive deconstruction of class, brimming with energy, dark humour and nervous tension. (Adam White) Rising from the ashes of the aborted Universal Monsters multiverse, which was due to star Johnny Depp and Tom Cruise, this rebooted Invisible Man uses the iconic branding to tell the smaller and far more intriguing story of a woman on the run from her invisible ex. Elisabeth Moss is the domestic violence survivor convinced that her supposedly dead boyfriend has merely mastered the art of invisibility. Leigh Whannell, who directed 2018’s wonderfully inventive sci-fi thriller Upgrade, is behind the camera. (Adam White) A Quiet Place would surely have been better off as a standalone film, but the financial success of writer-director John Krasinski’s B-movie-style horror tale put paid to that. This isn’t to say there’s no more story to tell. In fact, Krasinski made no secret of the fact he had a whole universe he could one day explore, and sure enough, joining returning stars Emily Blunt, Millicent Thomas and Noah Jupe (so brilliant in Honey Boy) are new additions in the form of Cillian Murphy and Djimon Honsou. (Jacob Stolworthy) 519 No Time to DieWhile Daniel Craig’s Bond tenure has been marked by severe whiplash in terms of quality, there remains something incredibly exciting about the arrival of a new 007 movie. No Time to Die, Craig’s final outing as the super-spy, also boasts an intoxicating array of talent on and off screen, from Cary Fukunaga on directorial duties, to a script co-written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge and cast newcomers including Ana de Armas, Rami Malek and Lashana Lynch. (Adam White) Little is known about the plot for Antebellum, the feature film debut of artists and music video directors Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz. But the thriller\u0027s trailer is a visual feast, with Janelle Monáe appearing to be caught between the present day and the horrors of a 19th century plantation. From producer Jordan Peele, director of Get Out and Us, it also features Jena Malone, Gabourey Sidibe and Kiersey Clemons. (Adam White)719 The Woman in the WindowAn adaptation of the pulpy bestseller (which itself was engulfed in mystery when a New Yorker feature claimed its author, AJ Finn, had extensively lied about his personal life and history), The Woman in the Window puts Amy Adams centre stage for the first time since 2018’s Sharp Objects. She’s an agoraphobic psychologist convinced she has witnessed a murder across the street from her apartment. Julianne Moore, Gary Oldman and Brian Tyree Henry co-star. (Adam White) Watchmen star Yahya Abdul-Mateen III continues his incredible ascent with the starring role in this remake. Produced by the ubiquitous Jordan Peele, the new Candyman revives the hook-handed killer originated in 1992’s genuinely terrifying Bernard Rose film, but with a black and female director and predominantly black cast – which ought to mean the frustratingly ambiguous racial themes of the original can finally be given their due. (Adam White) The sequel to 2017’s mega successful Wonder Woman is a rare thing: a DC film worthy of excitement. The first outing saw Patty Jenkins become the highest-grossing woman director in cinema history, and she’s looking to beat her own record with a follow-up centred on the Amazon princess’s battle against a villain named Cheetah (Kristen Wiig in her superhero film debut). That Jenkins describes it as “a grand tentpole like they use to make in the 1980s” is reason alone to mark its release on your 2020 calendar. (Jacob Stolworthy) Soul is a curious new Pixar film that appears to emulate the philosophical wonder of Inside Out with the lived-in cultural exploration of Coco. Jamie Foxx is a struggling musician who finally gets his big break, only to experience a freak accident that propels him into a mysterious netherworld in which souls are imbued with talents and passions, before being implanted in newborn babies. It looks gorgeous, is potentially insane, and is co-written by Tina Fey. (Adam White) Hours after the first reviews of both Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and Cats took over social media, Warner Bros dropped the trailer for Tenet, Christopher Nolan’s top secret espionage thriller. It’s fair to say plenty of sunshine was stolen – and for good reason. Tenet marks Nolan’s return to the mind-melting thrills of Inception and, while the plot remains unknown, it seems to focus on a team of heroes who must rewind time to prevent the outbreak of war. Sign us up. (Jacob Stolworthy) Tom Cruise is taking a (short) break from carrying out impossible missions in 2020. Instead, he’ll return to the cockpit for a sequel to the daddy of all Eighties films, Top Gun. There’ll surely be an element of “teach new dogs old tricks” in the Joseph Kosinski-directed film as Pete “Maverick” Mitchell mentors a new generation of US Navy fighter pilots. We’re hopeful the result will – wait for it – take our breath away. (Jacob Stolworthy) 1319 Barb and Star Go to Vista Del MarIt’s not the Bridesmaids sequel everyone begged for nearly a decade ago, but Barb and Star is its spiritual follow-up at least. Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumulo, the women behind the 2011 smash, write and star in this new comedy, playing two best friends who venture out of their small Midwestern community for the very first time. They soon get mixed up in a villainous plot to kill an entire town, while Jamie Dornan and Damon Wayans Jr also star. (Adam White) 1419 The Many Saints of NewarkWhether you like it or not, a film prequel based on The Sopranos is being released in 2020. The presence of David Chase, the HBO show’s creator, goes a long way to abate any concerns fans might have, and it’ll at least be a fine chance to explore the mobsters’s family history. The film is expected to focus on Dickie Moltisanti, the father of Christopher, whose memory loomed large over the series. (Jacob Stolworthy) 1519 Last Night in SohoEdgar Wright is adding “psychological horror” to his filmmaking repertoire with Last Night in Soho, a neon-soaked thrill ride starring quite the ensemble (Anya Taylor-Joy, Matt Smith, Diana Rigg). The intriguing plot focuses on a young girl for whom “time falls apart” after she’s somehow transported to the 1960s. It sounds like a cult hit in waiting. (Jacob Stolworthy) The feel-good West End smash is transformed into a feel-good movie, with Richard E Grant, Sarah Lancashire and Sharon Horgan leading the story of a teenage boy who overcomes insecurity by embracing drag. Newcomer Max Harwood portrays the title character. (Adam White) Regardless of whether you’re a keen follower of the Marvel Cinematic Universe or not, The Eternals should pique your interest. Sure, it may be spearheading a brand new phase of Marvel franchises – there really is no end to the studios’ box office stronghold – but it features what has to be one of the most eclectic casts ever seen in a superhero film: Angelina Jolie, Kit Harington, Kumail Nanjiani, Brian Tyree Henry and Salma Hayek.

That’s a fairness issue.”An Oxford University spokesperson said: “Greater competition inevitably means more students will be disappointed, but we want the best talent possible for the outstanding education we offer.”They added: “More than 69 per cent of undergraduate offers were made to pupils attending state schools, and a record number to those from under-represented backgrounds.“The changes we have brought in, with widespread support across the university and its colleges, have increased and ersified the pool of students applying to and receiving offers from Oxford.”Only a handful of black academics in top roles in British universitiesUK universities ‘increasingly reliant’ on income from Chinese studentsHalf of bosses at elite universities handed larger pay packetsThe OfS said access to university has been a “postcode lottery”, with young people from the northeast and southwest of England much less likely to go into higher education than those in London.Sir Michael Barber, chairman of OfS, said: “What is an assumed rite of passage for many young people across the country is often viewed very differently in rural and coastal communities, the industrial heartlands and military towns.“The north-south ide crops up in many debates around equal opportunities, and higher education is no exception.”Universities found to have failed to improve access can face sanctions by the watchdog including fines.\u0026nbspChris Skidmore, universities minister, said: “It is damning for the sector that large gaps still remain between disadvantaged students and their peers.”He added: “I am pleased to see universities being ambitious in their plans to reach out to those from disadvantaged backgrounds and to support them through their studies. But for universities which do not meet their registration conditions, I fully support the Office for Students to take appropriate action.”Office for Students\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspUniversity of Oxford\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Ms Melis suggested that deregulation after Brexit could help persuade financial services businesses to remain in the UK.“If the government can position the UK as having a more favourable regulatory environment and separate it from the red tape of European regulation, then we may see the UK win back its crown and attract new talent to the sector,” Melis said.Adopting a light-touch approach to regulation after Brexit – dubbed the “Singapore-on-Thames” model by some critics – would likely prove controversial.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

When they arrive at the Earth\u0027s ionosphere, they excite the oxygen and nitrogen atoms found in the upper atmosphere, and that energy is released as lights.Created with Sketch.Northern Lights across the UK - in pictures Show all 6Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The beautiful colours of light shining through the Sycamore Gap at Hadrian\u0027s Wall in NorthumberlandThe sky surrounding St Mary\u0027s Lighthouse in Whitley Bay, NorthumberlandThis shot was taken in NorthumberlandThe beautiful skies could be spotted across the sea in Giant\u0027s Causeway, Northern IrelandThe lights seen over Great Park in NewcastleA beach in Saltburn, North YorkshireThe beautiful colours of light shining through the Sycamore Gap at Hadrian\u0027s Wall in NorthumberlandThe sky surrounding St Mary\u0027s Lighthouse in Whitley Bay, NorthumberlandThis shot was taken in NorthumberlandThe beautiful skies could be spotted across the sea in Giant\u0027s Causeway, Northern IrelandThe lights seen over Great Park in NewcastleA beach in Saltburn, North YorkshireWhile the northern lights are often seen as one phenomenon, they are something like clouds: there are a whole host of different kinds, each of which are formed in their own particular ways.The new discovery began when the University of Helsinki\u0027s\u0026nbspMinna Palmroth looked to collect these different kinds of northern lights, in collaboration with enthusiasts. Those hobbyists took photographs of thousands of different examples of the northern lights, which she picked through and categorised for a book to guide those watching the\u0026nbspaurora borealis.A complete guide to the Northern LightsBut as the hobbyists collected those images through Facebook, they found that many of them included a kind of auroral form that was not part of the existing classification. Those were set aside to be examined later, and the book was published.Just days after it came out, enthusiasts spotted the mysterious form again: they saw a green-tinged, even set of waves that looked similar to dunes on a sandy beach. They told Professor Palmroth, who was able to get to work looking into it.One of the most memorable moments of our research collaboration was when the phenomenon appeared at that specific time and we were able to examine it in real time, says Northern Lights and astronomy hobbyist\u0026nbspMatti\u0026nbspHelin\u0026nbspin a statement.The hobbyists and space researchers worked together to collate photos from across Finland. Combining the images – and looking for clues such as stars in the background – allowed the scientists to discover where exactly the lights were coming from.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Their waveform stretched 45 kilometres across.That height put them in a particularly neglected part of the sky: it is where the Earth\u0027s atmosphere collides with the edge of space, and is difficult for satellites to see.Due to the difficulties in measuring the atmospheric phenomena occurring between 80 and 120 kilometres in altitude, we sometimes call this area \u0027the\u0026nbspignorosphere\u0027, she said in a statement.The phenomenon appears to happen because of the bore phenomenon. Scientists say that gravity waves are born in the atmosphere and then rise up – but when they hit a particular layer, they can be bent and stretch out for long distances.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

His partner, Jade Samuel, is currently on maternity leave and is due to return to work in two weeks, but won’t be able to if he\u0026nbsphas left the country, which he said would leave her “struggling to cope”.Mr\u0026nbspNembhard, who has been fighting his immigration case for years, said: “I’m really depressed. I cry when I think about my child. It’s really sensitive because I’m the world to her, and she’s the same to me. We have a really close bond and this is all starting to affect her.“My partner will struggle to cope. I don’t know what I’ll do if I have to leave my kids. The Home Office is destroying their lives.”The Jamaica charter flight is an outrage – but so are many othersDozens to be deported on first Jamaica charter flight since WindrushThe Jamaican national arrived to the UK on a visit visa in\u0026nbsp2011. He met his ex-wife and applied to remain in the country with her but his application was refused.He continued to fight the case but was accused of assault by his ex-wife\u0026nbsp– whom he had by this point separated from and got together with Ms Samuel – an allegation he still denies.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe courts found him guilty and he was sentenced to prison shortly after his daughter was born. He was then immediately detained under immigration powers, before being released on bail and settling down in east London with Ms Samuel\u0027s and their daughter.In February 2019, he was one of several Jamaican threatened with deportation despite being key witnesses in the inquest into the death of an immigration detainee – but he was granted last-minute reprieve after solicitors intervened.Without immigration status, Mr Nembhard has been unable to work, but Ms Samuels, who works as a supervisor at a jewellery wholesalers, said the family “makes it work” as he is able to care for the children while she works.“He’s an amazing dad. He is their primary carer. I want to be able to work and continue providing for my family. If he is deported I’ll become a single mum, I’d have to rely on benefits. I’ve never had to do that. It took me a long time to get to this position at work but this means I will have to stop working, she said.“When he was detained on Monday, I did the school run instead of him. My daughter asked, ‘Where’s dad? Has he gone to that place again?’ She’s been emotional. I’ve had to let her school know. She keeps asking when he’s coming home. They’re really close.Dozens to be deported on first Jamaica charter flight since Windrush“The immigration situation has really shaken us up over the past few years. Every time we get a bit of stability, they seem to take him away again. He deserves to be with his family. Here is where his life is.”Mr Nembhard was detained despite the fact that he had a further submissions appointment with the Home Office in March where his immigration case was going to be reconsidered.David\u0026nbspLammy, the family’s local MP, condemned the Home Office for putting them in this situation, saying the lives of Mr\u0026nbspNembhard’s\u0026nbspBritish wife and children were being “devastated” by the department’s “gross mishandling” of the case.The Labour MP said more broadly, that it was wrong for the Home Office to be chartering deportation flights to Jamaica and other parts of the Caribbean before the much-delayed\u0026nbspWindrush\u0026nbspLessons Learned Review has been published, adding: How can the Home Secretary be sure she is not making the same mistakes?”Naga Kandiah, of MTC Solicitors, who is representing Mr Nembhard, said his detention was making it difficult to effectively prepare for his Home Office interview in March, and accused the Home office of acting in a harsh and heartless manner towards\u0026nbspBritish children and their parents.Without notification, Mr Nembhard was detained. Due to the complexity of his case, we need obtain to all of his past papers from previous solicitors, coroner\u0027s inquest papers, instruct medical and social worker reports, but we cannot do this as effectively as he is incarcerated, he said.His family are suffering due to the absence of Mr Nembhard at home. His British wife and British children are not only deeply worried by him being incarcerated with no certainty, but also, struggling to cope as a family unit in day to day activities.The Home Office said it will be operating a charter flight to Jamaica in the coming weeks and those being deported had all been convicted of crimes in the UK.A spokesperson added: “Foreign nationals who abuse our hospitality by committing crimes in the UK, should be in no doubt of our determination to deport them. Our priority will always be to keep the British public safe.“The UK, like many other countries, uses charter flights to return people to their country of origin when they have no legal right to remain.\u0026nbsp“The majority of those returned are on scheduled, commercial flights but this isn’t always an option, especially if the inidual is a foreign national offender.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It’s just not acceptable,” Gloria Allred, who represents five alleged victims, told BBC Radio 4’s Today. “Prince Andrew has a moral obligation to volunteer to speak to law enforcement – that’s what he said he would do.”Lawyers could “seek to subpoena Prince Andrew” in their civil lawsuit, she said.Another lawyer, Lisa Bloom, suggested Mr Berman had been left with “no choice” but to comment publicly because he did not have the power to subpoena the royal as part of the criminal investigation.The prosecutor did not go into detail on what information investigators were seeking from Prince Andrew, but he said Epstein “couldn’t have done what he did without the assistance of others”.One of Epstein’s alleged victims, Virginia Guiffre, has alleged she was forced to have sex with Andrew when she was 17.

He can be heard talking on camera, saying: “Look at these little guys. It’s alright, it’s ok. You’re frozen to the ice.

German courts ruled egg producers could continue grinding male chicks to death until a scaleable means of determining the sex of an embryo in an egg was found.Shredding of chicks is permissible under EU law, so long as death is instantaneous and the bird is less than 72 hours old.\u0026nbspChick-fil-A to end donations to anti-LGBTQ organisationsHundreds of songbird chicks starve to death in European heatwaveSame-sex penguin couple have welcomed their first adopted chickParent bird spotted feeding cigarette butt to chickMr Guillaume said the same timescale would apply to banning the castration of piglets without anaesthesia, according to AFP.Boars are usually castrated to encourage animals reared for meat to put on weight, and because fat in the meat from uncastrated pigs can apparently gives off a more potent smell when cooked, and is known as “boar taint”. But boar taint only usually affects 20 per cent of uncastrated pigs.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We would like to draw readers’ attention to the fact that sadly, the UK egg industry treats male chicks as though they are inanimate waste products, not living, breathing animals who are all iniduals and feel pain and suffering. They are routinely gassed at just a day old.“Laying hens, even in free range systems, can be crammed many thousands at a time into noisy, dusty, filthy sheds, some never able to access the outdoors. This is a far cry from the deceptive imagery on egg box packaging, with happy hens roaming freely in the sunshine, abundant grass underfoot. Once their laying declines and they are no longer deemed economically viable, they are typically crammed into crates and trucked off to the slaughterhouse at just a fraction of their natural life.\u0026nbsp“But really, we have no need to use and abuse animals in food production. The best thing we can do to help end this shocking cruelty is to give up eggs and other animal products and embrace a cruelty-free, vegan diet instead.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

So far  people have been tested across the country - all have been confirmed negative by the Department of Health.The World Health Organisation is not yet calling this a global emergency - but how deadly is this outbreak Existing data concludes a rough fatality rate of two per cent, meaning one in  people die of the infection. Some  to  per cent of cases are severe, meaning people require hospital treatment or ventilation as the disease causes a pneumonia-like illness.While the SARS-like virus, known as -nCoV, is fast becoming an international cause for concern, it is still a far cry from the virus pandemics in the past, which have ravaged entire countries and claimed millions of lives.Here we take a closer look at the worst ever pandemic viruses to date.It was a case of pass the plague in  A.D. when an early case of smallpox broke out.Known as the Antonine plague, it began with the Huns who then infected the Germans, who passed it onto the Romans whose troops spread it throughout the Roman Empire.Galen, a Greek physician, witnessed the outbreak and recorded the symptoms: blackish diarrhoea, which suggested gastrointestinal bleeding, intensive coughing, foul-smelling breath and red and black skin eruptions all over their body.The total deaths have been estimated at five million, and the disease killed as much as one-third of the population in some areas and devastated the Roman army.This plague continued until about  A.D, claiming Emperor Marcus Aurelius as one of its victims.From  to  an outbreak of the Black Death ravaged Europe, Africa and Asia, with an estimated death toll between  and million people.Thought to have originated in Asia, the Plague most likely jumped continents via fleas living on rats that lived aboard merchant ships.It took ten to fourteen days before the plague killed off most of a contaminated rat colony, by which time, after three days of fasting, hungry rat fleas would then turn on humans, their bite causing a swelling – or “bubo” — most often in the groin, on the thigh, in an armpit or on the neck.Hence the name bubonic plague.The infection took three to five days to incubate in people before they fell ill, and another three to five days before, in  per cent of the cases, the victims died.The Black Death began in London in the poor, overcrowded parish of St. Giles-in-the-Field and ended up wiping out  percent of the population during that terrible summer.When it hit a household, the house was sealed, a red cross painted on the door and the whole family was condemned to death.Dead bodies became so prevalent that many remained rotting on the ground and it created a constant stench.The Spanish flu pandemic, often regarded as one of the deadliest in history, killed an estimated million people of the million it infected as it tore through Europe in  and travelled to the US, killing , Americans.By comparison, the First World War, which ended in , had around million deaths.The first wave of the  pandemic occurred in the spring and was generally mild with the sick experiencing typical flu symptoms such as chills, fever and fatigue then recovering after several days.However, a second, highly contagious wave appeared with a vengeance in autumn of that same year and victims died within hours or days of developing symptoms, their skin turning blue and their lungs filling with fluid that caused them to suffocate.At the time, there were no effective drugs or vaccines to treat it. Citizens were ordered to wear masks, schools, theatres and businesses were shuttered and bodies piled up in makesht morgues with many having to dig graves for their own family members.It became known around the world as the Spanish flu, as Spain was hit hard by the disease and not subject to the wartime news blackouts that affected other European countries.What separated the  flu pandemic from other influenza outbreaks was the victims — instead of killing young people and the elderly, it struck down completely healthy young adults, while leaving children and those with weaker immune systems still alive.By the summer of , the flu pandemic came to an end, as those that were infected either died or developed immunity.Asian Flu was a pandemic outbreak of Influenza A of the HN subtype that originated in China in  and lasted until .In the first few months, it spread throughout China and its regions but by the midsummer it had reached the United States, where it initially infected relatively few people.Several months later, however, numerous cases of infection were reported, especially in young children, the elderly, and pregnant women.The pandemic also reached the UK and by December a total of , deaths had been reported in England and Wales.Estimates for the death toll y depending on the source, but the World Health Organization places the final tally at approximately million, , of those in the US alone.The Zika virus is a mosquito-borne flavivirus transmitted primarily by the aggressive blood-sucking Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and symptoms included fever, rash, joint pain and red eyes.In May , the first local transmission of Zika virus was reported in Brazil and researchers believed the virus was introduced during the August  World Sprint Championship canoe race, held in Rio de Janeiro, which attracted participants from four Pacic Island nations, including French Polynesia, with active Zika transmission.The virus soon spread and affected more than .million people in  countries, thanks to the mosquito’s ability to thrive in city le, flourishing in litter, open ditches, clogged drains, old tyre dumps and crowded flimsy dwellings.The virus was also linked to thousands of babies in Brazil being born with microcephaly, a neurological disorder where the baby had an underdeveloped brain and an abnormally small head.There were also a rising number of stillbirths and miscarriages in mothers infected with the virus.The children that did survive faced intellectual disability and developmental delays.From the first reported case on July ,  in Hong Kong, it took only  days before outbreaks of this virus — referred to as the Hong Kong Flu — were reported in Singapore and Vietnam, and within three months had spread to The Philippines, India, Australia, Europe, and the United States.While the  pandemic had a comparatively low mortality rate, it still resulted in the deaths of more than a million people, including , residents of Hong Kong itself, approximately  per cent of its population at the time.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

All good stuff.The only toxic fly in the Fair Trade, ethically sourced, organic ointment was that Charles flew to Switzerland in a private jet, emitting around six tons of carbon dioxide.There are excuses. Or,you are being generous, reasons.Charles was on his way to Israel and Palestine, where security concerns make commercial flights unviable.But after all of Charles’ fine words on climate change, the use of a private jet sent a dferent message.He was campaigning to save the planet decades before that was fashionable. But whatever the merits of his beliefs on climate change, the brutal fact is that establishment hypocrisy makes most people reach for the mute button.The nation’s honeymoon with Harry and Meghan did not end because we are racist bigots who could never accept a mixed-race woman in the Royal Family.Harry and Meghan were adored.They broke the spell when they wagged their virtuous fingers about climate change while hopping on and off private jets. It was their establishment hypocrisy that killed our love.One law for them and another for us. That makes people switch off.It isn’t complicated. You can fly by private jet OR you can lecture the world about saving the planet.But you can’t do both. Isn’t that screamingly obvious The Royal Family are not the only establishment hypocrites. Labour’s Emily Thornberry — Lady Nugee, a champion of the working man — thinks we should all send our children to the local comprehensive school.Even though, Lady Nugee confessed to Andrew Neil, that’s not what she chose for her own children.Establishment hypocrite.Harry and Meghan abandoned this country claiming they long for “financial independence”. Yet the millionaire couple always seem quite content to have some poor sucker sponsoring their lavish lestyle.There is no way Canadians will foot the bill for Harry and Meghan’s security.It is not politically possible for any Canadian PM to foist that expense on to their taxpayers.Ex-Mountie Larry Busch, who in the past has protected the royals in Canada, predicts the job will take  full-time officers and cost in excess of £.million a year.Who is going to pay for that  The “financially independent” Harry and Meghan  No chance.I can see it now. Mounties will do the heavy lting and British taxpayers will get the bill. THAT is why we went right off Harry and Meghan — their rank establishment hypocrisy.We have been endlessly told Harry and Meghan plan to refund us for the eye-watering £.million it cost to do up Frogmore Cottage, the beautul home in Windsor they no longer need or want.A refund I will believe it when I see it.Can we get a receipt THE Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Bill received Royal Assent from the Queen on Thursday. After all the years of pain and paralysis, it was finally official.The UK is leaving the European Union.Yet this historic moment did not even warrant a mention on the BBC’s Six O’Clock News.Incredible.And conclusive proof that the BBC no longer speaks for the nation.So the new Director-General of the Beeb has an existential problem.Because everyone at the corporation voted Remain, the largest vote for anything in our history – leaving the EU – has been treated as the ignorant spasm of .million uneducated, racist bigots.From crappy little comedy- shows to prestige news and current affairs, the BBC has been unapologetically biased against Brexit.The state broadcaster should be scrupulously neutral.In recent years, the BBC has been brazenly partisan.Look, we all have fond memories of growing up with the BBC. But this week I watched football on Sky and BT, drama on Amazon Prime and Netflix.None of the sport and drama I craved was on the BBC.Feeling nostalgic for Top Of The Pops and Whatever Happened To The Likely Lads  is not worth £. a year.The BBC is nakedly biased. And the BBC is increasingly irrelevant. So why does it still get £billion a year from the licence fee WITH Cats bombing at the box office, many of the cast are desperately distancing themselves from the furry turkey, including James Corden, who says he has not even seen the film.The exception is Taylor Swt, who says she has “no complaints”, adding: “I had a really great time working on that weird-ass movie.”But Taylor understands there are greater problems in le than having a flop at the box office.In an essay to mark her th birthday, she writes about her mother’s brain tumour.“Both my parents have had cancer and my mom is now fighting her battle with it again,” Taylor writes.“It’s taught me there are real problems and then there’s everything .”There is nothing like the loss of a loved one’s health to put le’s little knocks into perspective.THE president of the Durham Miners’ Gala sneers that he would rather be “dead in a ditch” than allow newly elected Tory MPs to attend.Alan Mardghum says: “ did their best to destroy the Durham miners and the miners of Great Britain.”Does Mardghum honestly believe the mediocre Marxist muppets of today’s Labour Party have any interest in his community The Labour Party of today openly despises the British working class.That’s why so many ex-miners voted Tory.The proud, hardworking, patriotic communities of the North East have realised the Tories are now the party of the working class.If Alan Mardghum can’t see that, then he is dead in a ditch already. From the neck up.GEARING up for her turn as Catwoman in the next Batman movie, Zoe Kravitz reclines for the cover of the new issue of Elle magazine.You know you are getting old when you are shocked to learn the new Catwoman is the daughter of rocker Lenny Kravitz.A le peerage for a man who has done so much to make our lives a misery.Andthat doesn’t kill off the ermine-clad, silver spoon-sucking upper chamber for ever, nothing will.BORIS Johnson has asked Royal Mail chiefs to release a set of stamps commemorating Brexit to go on sale in January .It will be tough to improve upon the idea in Thursday’s Sun of a two-finger salute in front of the EU flag.The uniquely British gesture dates to the Battle of Agincourt in , when the French promised to cut off the index and middle fingers of English and Welsh archers.As French knights died in the Agincourt mud, our bowmen stuck up two fingers. More than an insult, it is a defiant message.We are still here.

She gives her take on how an inability to retain independence left Meghan feeling vulnerable.Jo also reveals how free-spirited Meghan was not always able to make the compromises necessary to accept the constraints of royal le and analyses the “boyfriend shirt” she wore when first dating Harry . . . plus the Hamsa ring she put on to ward off evil.I ALWAYS feel deeply unsettled when my own feelings of love, goodwill and optimism are turned on a sixpence in exchange for scepticism, cynicism and disappointment.It indicates very strongly that I feel cheated and, perhaps worst of all, fooled.It is no exaggeration to say that this has been the personal rollercoaster of emotions I have been on with Meghan and Harry.I vividly remember standing in my garden that sweltering day during May , looking through the living-room window to watch their royal weddingand welling up with the emotion and promise of it all.Strangely, I don’t recall experiencing the same when William and Kate married seven years earlier, but there was something truly signicant about Meghan joining The Firm.She signied new, fresh, modern, showbizzy blood — and abundant, gracious, progressive attitudes.Above all , the love they had for each other was palpable.Perhaps I should already have been exercising some caution with my enthusiasm when Harry fired warning shots across the media about the treatment of his girlfriend and the supposed racist undertones.But I, for one, felt utterly encouraged and buoyant about this woman’s humility, dignity, compassion and empathy.What could possibly go wrong Now,  months down the line, I cannot deny I feel hoodwinked — and can well imagine that is how much of the population feels.As a nation of welcoming Brits , it is like we invited Meghan into our adorable, unpretentious and homely BB. She stayed for dinner, took the complimentary soaps and shampoos then walked out in search of the nearest hotel.Regardless of how they want to dress it up, the two of them have turned their backs on the UK and it feels like a kick in the teeth.What really stings is that it does not feel like it was a long-term plan, but it simply came about when Meghan re-read the membership rules, months after signing on the dotted line, and decided it cramped her style. I’m pretty certain all the statutes will have been made clear to her from the start, many times over. Everything will have been scrutinised and pored over in minute detail. The Royal Family is a watertight institution, after all.But propelled by her personal ambition, and presumably a wilfulness to reform the family, becoming a royal would not only give her a  for her humanitarian work but also fame on a level she would have been unlikely to have otherwise ever achieved.What she could not cope with was her loss of control and the fact that being part of a team inevitably means diminished autonomy.But some of her story has echoes of when Sarah Ferguson joined the family back in the Eighties.Fergie was a jolly, fun, self-deprecating young woman who thought she would have the ride of a letime. But she found herself profoundly restricted by her mother-in-law’s budget and her husband’s dullness. Instead of making a dignied exit, she had her toes sucked by another man because le was not as much fun as it had promised to be. It was ugly.The prospect of joining the Royal Family would fill me with horror — and it did so even way back in , when I was pictured alongside HRH Prince Edward at the theatre.I had become good friends with his best friend, James Baker.One night I joined James, Edward and another of his friends to go to the theatre.By sheer coincidence I was “papped” next to the prince.Excited and furious speculation ensued the following day about the mystery Swedish blonde — I was  and not yet on the ladder of fame — and I was quickly dubbed his latest flame. One newspaper even ran the headline “The Prince And The Showgirl” with old photos of me in school drama productions.It was my first experience of such widespread exposure and it came as an absolute shock.HRH was kind enough to phone me to offer his support and urge me to “say nothing”, which I duly did.After some months, the two of us did have a few dates, and while I, a most common commoner, would never have been considered “royal material”, le in The Firm crossed my mind on a few occasions.And it did not especially fill me with joy.I got the strong impression Prince Edward himself would have given anything to get in a car and drive away from it all, which was hardly the greatest endorsement. But despite getting a lot of flak over preceding years for dropping out of the Marines and then pursuing a career in the arts, the prospect of him walking away would never have been one he would have seriously entertained.His sense of duty, loyalty and obligation was too great.I really got a good insight into the restrictive le he led, along with his lack of access to any kind of normality.All the while he was surrounded by rules and traditions, and then there are the courtiers and staff, there to stle and control your many moves, constantly keeping your behaviour in check.I would go to dinner and bring my own bottle of white wine because budget and taste would have dictated a ghastly bottle of Liebfraumilch or some other type of sweet white wine, and thus a less fun evening.Because despite the Royal Family being an international brand, it seemed at the time, at least, that “taste” as such had somehow eluded Prince Edward.He was stuck with whatever the butler would bring and I am guessing money spent on wine was not considered money well spent.The foodwas decidedly plain and a tad dull.Everything in his apartment was so staid and old-fashioned.Nothing had been redecorated for decades and the bathroom had a very quaint old toilet.In my naivety, I had foolishly thought the royals would have the absolute latest in fashion and interiors, but it was like stepping back in time.Perhaps this was how Meghan experienced things, too, but with thoughts and attitudes. I would swear and push the boundaries because I felt it might amuse and maybe inspire more than a touch of reality and authenticity.But the thought of a loon like me being shackled to his le was enough to make me want to run for the hills — regardless of the universal fame that might have been waiting.The idea of a woman as fiercely independent as Meghan being defined and tethered by such an exclusive, traditional club seems, with hindsight, utterly impossible.Her initial sense of goodwill and charitable ambition appears to have been overtaken by her refusal to accept any opinion or critique.I am afraid I know to great personal cost that the limelight can be blinding.But it is a deal you make with yourself and, in her case, it was a deal she made with the British public — to serve.It is not asshe has given it her best shot for seven years and can no longer hack it.This self-defeating move away reeks of impatience, petulance and bitterness.Put simply, her new le became burdensome and an inconvenience when she discovered she could not run her own show.Her father, like mine — who opened his doors to the media when I was photographed next to Prince Edward — became a thorn in her side and she had no tools with which to deal with him.He became an embarrassment a mistake and a mess she could easily have dealt with but felt it more important to proceed with her new le and leave him behind. And then there is Harry: A man smitten and obsessed, a man who has been waiting for a Meghan all his le, someone to nurture him.He has sacriced everything for his we, willingly.He has given up all that he has ever known and everyone he holds dear to chance it all thousands of miles away, isolating himself in pursuit of a le that is not only unclear but precarious.There is no doubt that the Royal Family needs reduction and considerable reform to reflect modern times.But the thought that a newcomer might consider herself best positioned to be that subversive influence would be laughableit was not so hurtful and insulting to much of this country that has been so supportive of this historical institution. The noises from Team Sussex have been distracting, persistent and problematic because the le of a royal is, I am afraid, to toe the line.There is no halfway house, no part-time royalty — the job is not part of the gig economy.By trying to carve out a more contented, niche le for themselves, the Sussexes have made survival considerably more complicated with absolute exposure guaranteed and a letime’s guarantee of judgment and critique.I cannot be the only one who feels painfully disappointed and cheated, beguiled by Hollywood stardust and  promises.And now we are left wondering what the whole shebang was all about, becauseHarry and Meghan thought exiting was challenging, when this all ends in tears — as I fear it will — coming back to the fold will be utterly inconceivable.I DO believe that Meghan married Harry with good intentions and had every belief she could make a positive contribution to the Royal Family.I can also see how Harry, a vulnerable young man who lost his beloved mother at such an early age, could fall in love with a strong, independent woman who could provide some direction.What I do not think Meghan was prepared for was the pressure of doing everything by the book and having to follow so many rules once she had entered into the so-called Firm.The former actress was the first senior royal to have come from a background where she had already established her own successful career.She is an ambitious and determined woman who is not afraid to speak her mind and wants to do things her own way.Meghan is certainly assertive. She is determined in the face of adversity but is also vulnerable and perhaps not as tough as she likes to make out.It is also clear that she became deeply unhappy with royal le and her inability to retain her independence.During all that turmoil, Meghan was not able to publicly speak out about her feelings, so would send subtle messages.She would express how she felt through her jewellery, such as the butterfly earrings she wore shortly after her pregnancy was announced, which symbolised lightness against tension and the sense of hope and endurance.She was also seen wearing a Hamsa ring, used to ward off evil, while in the Canadian embassy. It was the day before the bombshell announcement that they were moving abroad.She often handled her pregnancy bump, wanting consciously or otherwise to draw attention to her developing baby and what it represented moving forward — her new future and family.There is no doubt in my mind that as much as Meghan adores Harry, she had a clear focus in mind from the moment they began to have feelings for each other. There were no coy hints or suggestions from her, as there were with Kate.Nor was she prepared to play the waiting game, hanging on in there until Harry was ready to propose.From the white “boyfriend shirt” she wore right at the beginning of their relationship to the way she looked at Harry and touched him, even in public, Meghan did not shy away from being loud and proud about where she wanted things to head.I think this behaviour stems from a stubborn insecurity that will not go away, and Meghan is not good with situations that are out of her control.Perhaps her coping mechanisms are not as strong as she thought. Maybe she is so determined her family will not suffer like she has in the past that she has become super-protective and frustrated at times.Meghan has had to battle a fair amount of adversity in her le, even before she met Harry.This includes a dficult, and now estranged, relationship with her father and half-sibling, with whom she no longer speaks.I do wonder why she seems to be cut off from her close childhood friends. And why do some of Harry’s oldest pals feel they have been discarded as a result of his relationship with Meghan She is a strong influence on Harry, undoubtedly.Meghan would probably admit that she is strong-willed, not always able to make the sacrices or compromises which are necessary to accept criticism or interference from the Royal Family.Perhaps there is a touch of the narcissist about her, putting her own feelings ahead of the dutul le she signed up to.For example, she seems to find it dficult to understand what her father has been going through or see his perspective.Also, when she told the ITV documentary crew, “It’s not enough to just survive something”, before adding, “You have to thrive”, that shows how important her own happiness and wellbeing is to her.But many strong and influential people have that narcissistic streak. They find it hard to tolerate a situation that makes them feel distressed or to manage a situation over which they have little control.What is interesting is that, following the move to North America, Meghan and Harry have effectively swapped roles.Instead of Meghan being the royal princess at Harry’s side, he will now be more at her behest, having to adapt to a totally dferent sort of le, and one that he could never have imagined.He might feel some resentment in due course, or he may adapt like a duck to water.Will their marriage last They have a tough journey ahead, but I hope so and I wish them well.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It began in the far eastback in  and since then, has spread to Italy, Argentina, Mexico, South Africa and Vietnam, where it’s presented by Hoang Rapper. Seriously.Five weeks ago the global pandemic reached Britain and those millions of us who were infected have spent an uncomfortable month trying to work outThe Masked Singer is so bad it’s good or merely so bad it’s an affront to humanity.Somewhat reluctantly, I’ve finally got to admit it’s the former, despite having more than enough self-inflicted wounds and production flaws to sink most programmes.The Masked Singer is, for starters, no sort of contest, and while some of the singers, like Chameleon Justin Hawkins, disguise their identity brilliantly, John Barrowman could no more hide his showbiz light under the Large Hadron Collider than he could a unicorn outfit.There are also issues with that hopelessly random , Jonathan, Rita, Davina McCall and Donny Osmond Ken Jeong, who are either deliberately muddying the waters or are actually thick and deluded enough to believe a Joel Dommett-fronted show might also feature “Margot Robbie”, “Ray Winstone”, “Gemma Arterton”, “Helen Mirren” and “Olivia Colman”, in fancy dress outfits.God knows, it must be hard for them to confront the idea The Masked Singer is now the biggest thing in their careers. The only people I actually feel sorry for, though, are the poor dancers who’ve suffered the torments of hell on this show.The absolute worst of which was doing the twist, wearing only towels and snorkels, while that trippy octopus thing sang Splish Splash standing up in a bath. Yet still I watch. Why  Well, I’ve no realistic choice when the alternative is as tedious as BBC’s The Greatest Dancer.But I’d also choose The Masked Singer over X Factor, The Voice UK and practically any other Saturday night alternative the two main channels have served up recently, for the simple reason the basic guessing game concept and the end-of-show reveal are infuriatingly brilliant.Indeed, I’d go so far as to say Tutankhamun removing his head to reveal former Home Secretary Alan Johnson is one of the TV highlights of the year so far. Inevitably, the overlong shows, repetitive nature of the process and relative disappointments, like discovering it was Kelis in the daisy outfit, will quickly cure me.I’m sticking with The Masked Singer for now, though, because a slightly better bet than Natalie Cole has just reared its head in the duck outfit. After several weeks insisting it was a Spice Girl, Jonathan Ross now thinks: “It could be Diane Abbott . . . ”And, you never know, she might even do her own version of a Spice Girls song,  Become . I’ve rarely wanted anything more.BEST TV hour of the past week was Channel ’s SAS: Who Dares Wins, despite the fact its contestants were only visible for about  per cent of ­Sunday night’s show.Rest of the time they were blotted out by a gigantic Atlantic p***-storm which had engulfed the beautul and brutal island of Raasay, on Scotland’s west coast, so that all you could actually see were some green blobs lumbering up and down the mountains and all you could hear was swearing, from Ant Middleton.Or Foxy. Or possibly Billy. Or maybe even Ollie. “Put the casualty on the f***ing stretcher. Grab the f***ing stretcher and f***ing get him off the f***ing hill. That’s how we f***ing do it. Now move.”A big ask, I think you’ll agree, and the only one who seemed equal to it was James, an estate agent, who’s cracked every single challenge but not a single smile since episode one.He has, however, hinted at a very dark backgroundand claimed, with an entirely straight face: “It’s dficult to sayI’m good at hiding my emotions, ’cos I don’t have many.”No sooner had he said it, though, than Ant and the boys were pressing play on a Skype message from his mum. “Hi Peanut!” At which point James turned into a blubbing, schoolboy wreck.THE burning issue and question on Channel ’s mind last night was Bring Back The Bush: Where Did Our Pubic Hair Go  Where indeed  If it isn’t exactly where you left it or down the back of the sofa.Who worse to investigate this pressing issue, then, than Chidera Eggerue, the creative force behind the “Saggy Boobs Matter” campaign, who clearly craves attention and victim status but hasn’t worked out any better way of getting them than by making a gigantic exhibition of herself.So she’d set herself a real “challenge” here. “I’m growing my pubic hair for the next six weeks.” Exactly the sort of zero-effort empty gesture millennials seem to love.Chidera wasn’t quite confident enough in the project to go it alone, though, so she’d roped in four other minge martyrs to sprout away, while she went to LA to gawp at a porn shoot and work out why it was all the fault of men and the media.With the help of some anecdotal cobblers and an old copy of Playboy, Chidera eventually established the “flawless, hairless women” era was all about blokes “policing women’s bodies”, and the only way to fight back was, as I’d feared: “By revealing our bushes to the world.”When push came to shave, though, two of her mates insisted on wearing massive pants for the climactic photoshoot, the smartest one opted out completely and Chidera herself unveiled something that could’ve been her chuff, but could just as easily have been Ben Kingsley in All Hail The King. Bring Back The Bush  Bring back National Service first, please.But I honestly don’t think they’d get it even then.THIS week’s winner is Susanna Reid and Penny Proud from the Proud Family cartoons.Emailed in by Ricky J.

At times since the decisive referendum vote in , it looked asBrexit would remain a distant fantasy, thanks to the determination of much of the pro-EU establishment to overturn the result.But in the end, the will of the public has prevailed over federalist ideology. The dream of national freedom is about to become a reality.This change in status will represent a daunting challenge for Britain. No longer a regional province in the EU’s empire, we will take charge of our own destiny, with control over our economy, borders, laws, trade and justice system.With self-governance comes tremendous responsibility - and doubts and concerns about trade deals. But our nation can rise to the test.Indeed, Brexit could be the cue for the renewal of our institutions and the rebirth of our democracy.After all, we have achieved so much in the past as an independent nation, pioneering Parliamentary rule, leading the Industrial Revolution, and defeating tyranny in two World Wars.Given this heritage, there is no reason why Britain cannot embrace a new era of greatness.Yet that is not how the embittered Remainers see our future. Immersed in their worship of Brussels, obsessed with goal of European integration at the expense of nationhood, they continually preach the gospel of defeatism and despair.According to their gloomy propaganda, Brexit is a disastrous mistake, which will leave Britain hopelessly in decline.In their view, our country cannot survive on its own. The cold winds of isolation will be felt outside the warm embrace of the EU federation.This is the message that the pro-EU brigade has been peddling for years, ever since the referendum was first proposed.During the  campaign, the Government embarked on its notorious Project Fear, full of grim warnings about the dire consequences of abandoning our EU membership.One Treasury paper predicted that a vote for Leave would “represent an immediate and profound shock to the economy,” followed by a massive rise in unemployment and a meltdown in sterling.But these dire forecasts have not been realised. Instead, since , the British economy has proved to be remarkably robust.There has been no recession, no collapse in the property market, no explosion in the dole queues. On the contrary, the British jobs miracle has continued to accelerate.Only last week, official figures revealed that unemployment is down to its lowest level since , while the national workforce is at its largest in history.Particularly striking is the rise in self-employment to over five million, which indicates that the culture of enterprise is flourishing.Investors have not been deterred by Brexit.According to the Financial Times, “UK equities are positioned to outperform their peers in Europe and the USA.Manufacturing is also poised to prosper. Last week a survey by the Confederation of British Industry highlighted the biggest surge in confidence within this sector on record.Commenting on the “bullish” economic mood in Britain, the distinguished German journalist Alexander Von Schoenburg, editor-at-large of the bestselling BILD newspaper, wrote last weekend: “I see a nation with a strong sense of purpose, built on trust in its own capabilities and a powerful economy.I see a vibrant, open place that can attract huge amounts of foreign investment, has an unrivalled record in business start-ups and is a global pioneer in scientic and genetic research.”Von Schoenburg is right. Our independent future can be a golden one. Already the International Monetary Fund, which in  warned of recession, now predicts that over the next two years, economic growth will be twice as fast in the UK as in any other G state in Europe.What the pessimists ignore are the huge advantages held by Britain, like the global dominance of the English language, the cultural reach of our arts, music and entertainment industries, the strength of our financial services and the solidity of our political system - which was recently demonstrated again in the defeat of Jeremy Corbyn’s quasi-revolutionary Labour party.A recent poll of , chief executives, carried out by the consultancy firm PwC, found that the UK is increasingly attractive to global businesses looking for growth and investment opportunities.Commenting on the survey, PwC’s chairman Kevin Ellis said that “viewed against the turbulent global backdrop, the UK is a beacon of relative stability.”Indeed, on the eve of Brexit, the real crisis is faced, not by Britain, but by the EU and its member states.Whereas Britain can show its dynamism by the embrace of global competition and commerce, Europe is still trapped in outdated economic structures, characterised by heavy regulation, state intervention and unaffordable welfare.Almost every European nation is now in trouble, dragged down by sluggish growth and political dislocation.While Germany hovers on the brink of recession, France is in turmoil because of ferocious opposition to attempts by President Macron’s Government to reform its vast public sector and expensive pension schemes.Spain is now in the grip of socialism, Italy in economic sclerosis. Ireland’s current General Election is unlikely to give any one party more than  per cent of the vote, a recipe for more fragility.For the EU itself, Brexit represents a threat to its very existence.That is not just because of the loss of Britain’s budget contributions, signicant though they are.It is more becauseBritain prospers outside the EU, then the justication for Brussels rule would be permanently demolished.All the claims about the necessity of political integration would be exposed as delusions. That is why pro-EU campaigners so dread the possibility of a booming Britain on the continent’s doorstep.Our success would be the EU’s nightmare.There is, of course, no guarantee that Britain will flourish.There could be dficult times ahead, prompted by a global recession or the refusal of the USA to reach a trade deal because of security objections to the involvement of Chinese telecoms giant Huawei in our broadband network.Equally, the EU might prove tough in its own negotiations with us about a trade agreement. Already this week the Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has warned that the EU has “the upper hand” and the “stronger team”.But the cause of British independence has triumphed over serious obstacles in the recent past.With determination and vision, our country can do so again, emboldened by the taste of freedom.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It seems certain people are jumping the gun.Andrews fightback comes as Jeffrey Epsteins victims lawyers have said the royals lack of cooperation with the FBI is a slap in the face and raises more questions.In a dramatic press conference on Monday, the FBI said they had contacted the royals attorneys, requesting an interview, but had been provided zero cooperation.US lawyer Lisa Bloom, who is representing five of Epsteins alleged victims, yesterday blasted the princes lack of assistance, while another lawyer representing Andrews accuser Virginia Roberts Giuffre said his failure to cooperate raises even more questions.Speaking to Sky News, Ms Bloom said: He did an interview where he showed zero compassion for the victims and after the backlash he said no, I have compassion for the victims and to prove it Im going to cooperate with law enforcement.And now we find out hes shown zero cooperation.This is really a slap in the face to the victims, to the five who I represent, to the probably hundreds more who allege Jeffrey Epstein assaulted them.Why doesnt he want to cooperate I think thats the question. What is he trying to hide, what is he afraid of.It has since been reported the FBI had been trying to interview the under-fire royal since November.Geoffrey Berman, the US attorney for the Southern District of New York, revealed the prince’s lack of cooperation on Monday during a dramatic press conference outside Epstein’s mansion.He said: “The Southern District of New York and the FBI have contacted Prince Andrew’s attorneys and requested to interview Prince Andrew, and to date, Prince Andrew has provided zero cooperation.”The top prosecutor said he was revealing the information because the prince “publicly offered, indeed in a press release, to cooperate with law enforcement investigating the crimes committed by Jeffrey Epstein and his co-conspirators”.Speaking at the press conference – held to promote a new law to make it easier for child sex abuse victims to sue – Mr Berman said the probe into Epstein’s network was continuing.Mr Bermans explosive revelation sparked fury from those representing victims of sex beast Epstein – including Ms Roberts Giuffre.The American mum-of-three, now , claims she was forced to have sex with the prince three times when she was a teenager, after being trafficked to him by Epstein.ITS been two months since Prince Andrew vowed he would help in the investigation against his paedo pal Jeffrey Epstein.But the Duke of York was thrown into the spotlight as the FBI revealed they had received zero cooperation from the Queens second son.So what has the -year-old royal been doing while US authorities say they were desperately trying to contact him Instead of helping the FBI, he seems to have found the time to jet off to Spain for luxury golfing breaks, go horse riding with the Queen, help Princess Beatrice plan her forthcoming wedding, attend royal dinners and enjoy Kate Middletons birthday bash.While Epstein victim Virginia Roberts begged him to come clean in August last year, the royal was pictured enjoying a round of golf at the exclusive Real Club Valderrama in Sotogrande, southern Spain.Prince Andrew finally sat down to answer the mounting criticisms three months later in November - vowing in the Panorama interview that he was willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency in their investigations.Yet he seems to have done everything but cooperate with the authorities.In fact just two days later, stripped of his royal duties, he was seen riding with his mother, the Queen at Windsor.The royal then kept a low profile - not conducting any official engagements since then.Instead, the keen golfer has been apparently kept busy with family le with his daughter Princess Beatrices engagement to Mapelli Mozzi.However, the dad was not seen at the couples engagement party in December.Instead, he was only seen heading to Christmas lunch with the rest of the Royal Family at Buckingham Palace.His schedule then saw him a week later attend the Sandringham church service with the Queen before joining the Royal Family celebrating Kate Middletons th birthday.The weekend just gone saw him busy with engagements - again spotted riding horses with friends on the grounds of Windsor Castle.The royal has vehemently denied her claims.Sigrid McCawley, who represents Ms Roberts Giuffre, said: Prince Andrew should take most seriously the deeply held belief in this country that no one is above the law.She added: Prince Andrews continued refusal to cooperate with the authorities after freely acknowledging that he would be prepared to answer enquiries raises even more questions about the role he played in the international sex trafficking ring Jeffrey Epstein and others operated.Jack Scarola, another lawyer representing Ms Roberts Giuffre, told The Sun: “It is obvious that Prince Andrew is persisting in a pattern of non-cooperation which is now been going on for years.“I would certainly believe that he should recognise his moral obligation to participate in the search for the truth.“With all that the victims of Jeffrey Epstein have been through – over so many years – I would say that they expected nothing dferent.”Speaking directly of Andrew’s accuser, he added: “I am sure that Virginia had no other expectations than Prince Andrew would refuse to voluntarily cooperate.”Andrew claried his intention to co-operate with the FBI following his disastrous interview with BBC’s Newsnight in November.During the BBC interview, Andrew said he would have to consult with his lawyers before testying under oath about his ties to Epstein.But in a statement after the broadcast, he said: “Of course, I am willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations,required.”FBI and federal prosecutors in Manhattan are trying to bring justice for dozens of Epstein’s victims – by going after his alleged accomplices.Epstein, , killed himself in jail last year while awaiting trial on child sex trafficking allegations – following numerous bungled probes into his conduct.Prosecutors had accused him of sexually exploiting dozens of women and girls in New York and Florida before he hanged himself.Shortly after Epstein’s death, Mr Berman issued a statement vowing to continue the investigation into his co-conspirators.They are now said to be zeroing in on Ghislaine Maxwell – a close friend of Andrew – who is alleged to have acted at Epstein’s ‘pimp’.Maxwell – who is currently in hiding – has denied any wrongdoing.He said he had “no recollection” of meeting Ms Roberts Giuffre and claimed he was at a Pizza Express in Woking on one of the days they were meant to have had sex.When asked whether he regretted continuing his friendship with Epstein, the prince said: “Do I regret the fact that he has quite obviously conducted himself in a manner unbecoming  Yes.”“Unbecoming ” Miss Maitlis replied. “He was a sex offender.”A Buckingham Palace spokesman declined to comment on the FBI claims last night, but a source close to the prince said: “This issue is being dealt with by The Duke of York’s legal team”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

up from , on Sunday, according to World Health Organization figures.But Zhong Nanshan, from Chinas National Health Commission, warned: I believe it should reach a peak in a week or around ten days.He added that he doesnt expect the outbreak to increase at a large scale - despite the soar in case numbers.During the SARS pandemic, between  and , the number of infections reached , in mainland China, where  people were also killed.While some experts believe coronavirus is not as deadly as SARS, there are fears over it spreading quickly and key features are still unknown, including how lethal it really is.Like other respiratory infections, it is spread by droplets from coughs and sneezes, with an incubation time from one to  days.There are limited signs it may also be able to spread before symptoms show.The World Health Organisationhas said it is confident in Chinas ability to contain the coronavirus, but concern is mounting as cases continue to rise.Last night, the death toll rose by  to  - almost all in the province of Hubei - where the virus emerged last month at an animal market in the capital, Wuhan.The central province of about  million people is under virtual lockdown.Concern is also growing over the impact of the virus on the worlds second-biggest economy, with airlines cutting flights to China and global companies restricting employee travel there.In what could be a major step towards reining in the disease, scientists in Australia said they had developed a lab-grown version of the coronavirus, the first to be recreated outside China.Efforts are underway to find a vaccine, but even the most optimistic timelines suggest eight weeks to several months of scientic development before human clinical trials can begin.By that time, hundreds more could have died and numerous other countries infected.As infections spread and the number of cases rises, numerous countries are scrambling to get citizens out of Wuhan, while also hoping to keep the virus at bay.The city, with a population of  million, is racing to build two dedicated hospitals for coronavirus victims, with the first ,-bed facility to be completed next week.The capacity of the second will be expanded from , to , beds, the official Peoples Daily said.It comes amid fears over a rise in coronavirus cases in patients whove never been to China.Vietnam was the first country to report a positive coronavirus case spread to a person who hasnt been to China, the World Health Organisation confirmed at the weekend.Since then there have been further cases of domestic human-to-human transmission in patients in Germany, Taiwan and Japan.A taxi driver from Japan, who was driving tour groups of people visiting from Wuhan, where the virus originated, was among those to test positive for the bug.Another included a man in Germany who had come into contact with a colleague who had travelled from China for a training course.The virus has spread across China and to at least  countries globally after the initial outbreak in the city of Wuhan.Its terrying spread is being tracked across the globe on a live heat map charting where and when it has struck.The first death, that of a -year-old man, has now been recorded in Beijing, where the youngest case was also reported - a nine-year-old girl.So far there have been no reported deaths from coronavirus outside of China.An outbreak of the virus is understood to have started at an open air fish market in the Chinese city of Wuhan - which has since been put in lockdown after  people died and more than  people were infected globally.A new study published in the China Science Bulletin this week claimed that the new coronavirus shared a strain of virus found in bats.Previous deadly outbreaks of SARS and Ebola were also believed to have originated in the flying mammal.Experts had thought the new virus wasnt capable of causing an epidemic as serious as those outbreaks because its genes were dferent.But this latest research appeared to prove otherwise - as scientists scrabble to produce a vaccine.In a statement, the researchers said: “The Wuhan coronavirus’ natural host could be bats … but between bats and humans there may be an unknown intermediate.Meanwhile, scientists at Peking University also claim that the deadly virus was passed to humans from bats - but say it was through a mutation in snakes.The researchers said that the new strain is made up of a combination of one that affects bats and another unknown coronavirus.They believe that combined genetic material from both bats and this unknown strain picked up a protein that allows viruses bind to certain host cells - including those of humans.After analysing the genes of the strains the team found that snakes were susceptible to the most similar version of the coronavirus.It meant that they likely provided a reservoir for the viral strain to grow stronger and replicate.Snakes are sold at the Huanan Seafood Market in central Wuhan and may have jumped to other animals before passing to humans, they claim.But a senior researcher at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, who asked not to be named, said the findings should be treated with caution.He told the South China Morning Post: “It is based on calculation by a computer model.“Whether it will match what happens in real le is inconclusive.“The binding protein is important, but it is just one of the many things under investigation. There may be other proteins involved.”The expert believes that the new strain was an RNA virus, meaning that its mutation speed was  times faster than that of a DNA virus such as smallpox.British Airways announced it has halted all its flights to and from China - as the Governments urgent plans to evacuate Brits from the outbreak epicentre of Wuhan are being finalised.The Government has advised against all but essential travel to mainland China due to the coronavirus outbreak.Experts have warned the deadly bug will become a worldwide pandemic  governments do not impose heavy global travel bans.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I trust you’.”The chopper had been climbing out of the clouds when the aircraft banked left and began a sudden and terrying ,-foot drop before its crash.Determining what caused the crash will take months, with investigators scouring the crash site for clues and collecting debris.But the Sikorsky S-B helicopter was missing the terrain awareness warning systemthat warns pilotsthey are flying too close to obstacles, the National Transportation Safety Board revealed yesterday.The transit agency previously made two recommendations to the Federal Aviation Administration that the government agency require helicopters carrying six or more passengers to have the technology installed, but the FAA refused.The recommendations were made in March , two years after a similar helicopter – a Sikorsky S-A++ – fatally crashed in the Gulf of Mexico and killed all  passengers aboard, NBC News reported.Though TAWS would have been helpful for the chopper to have, officials said theres no guarantee it would have prevented the fatal crash.Do you have a story for The US Sun team Email us at exclusive@the-sun or call   .  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s called Brewdog.”Mairi Beaver, who runs the successful fashion and lestyle blog This Girl Can, believes the boozer deserves praise, but gave the owners a word of warning.She said: “Whilst I applaud anyone who advocates that ‘jobby catchers’ shouldnt be worn anywhere other than the gym, suggesting that a cheeky turn up is not welcome in the hipster-heartland of Leith is a bit risque.“I love the tongue-and-cheek approach - much more preferred than the bouncers of George Streets approach.”Last May, the pub left punters in stitches after introducing anti-theft pint glasses with the hilarious slogans on them.The display slogans said Im voting UKIP and “I Stole this Glass from the Dreadnought because II’m a twat.”"},{"url":null,"title":"kate middleton centre royal family megxit plans","story":"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are expected to take on more responsibilities after Prince Harry and Meghan Markle dramatically stepped down as senior royals and moved to Canada.But it has been claimed today that Prince William is determined his own charity work will not take a back seat - with we Kate to be increasingly involved.A source claimed today: William knows he will have a lot more work this year and is happy to perform whatever duties the Queen asks of him.

The figures lay bare that the five-week policy simply isn’t working - it just drives people further into poverty.Unless the DWP moves to a policy where benefits are paid promptly the queues for food banks in Glasgow, and across the country, will continue growing.One million people are already receiving it and by the time the system is fully rolled out in , nearly  million will be on it.But there are big problems with the flagship new system - it takes  weeks to get the first payment and it could leave some families worse off by thousands of pounds a year.And while working families can claim back up to  per cent of their childcare costs, they must find the money to pay for childcare upfront - we’ve heard of families waiting up to  months for the money.Working parents across the country told us they’ve been unable to take on more hours - or have even turned down better paid jobs or more hours because of the amount they get their benefits cut.It’s time to Make Universal Credit work.

But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord. You might also be able to change your payments to get them more frequently, or you can split the paymentsyoure part of a couple.Budgeting Advance - You may be able to get help from the government to help with emergency household costs of up to £youre single, £youre part of a couple or £you have children. These are only in cases like your cooker breaking down or for help getting a job. Youll have to repay the advance through your regular Universal Credit payments.

Mr Murray, who hasnapost yet made it through to the next round of the contest, said the party deserved a race that wasnapost just between continuity candidates who believe one more heave will get us over the line. It came as the partyaposs only remaining Scottish MP received the endorsement of two former Labour Prime Ministers - Gordon Brown and Tony Blair. Mr Murray, who was a critic of Mr Corbynaposs leadership, told the Mirror: At the moment it looks like the choice could be between continuity and continuity with the deputy leadership race. Butweaposre talking about being a democratic party then we need to be in a position where the contest represents the arguments about how we can win again. I think to win we need to listen to the people whoaposve rejected us over the last decade, we need to accept that weaposve ignored what people want from us and look to our successful past to learn how to win again. Andthat argument isnapost in the contest then we will be poorer for it. Rivals Angela Rayner and Richard Burgon - both seen as incredibly loyal to Jeremy Corbyn and his vision of the party - have made it through to the final round of the contest with endorsements from unions and socialist societies. Despite this Ms Rayner has racked up  Constituency Labour Partiesendorsements. The effect of this Mr Murray argued is to leave the contest as a choice between two candidates with a similar analysis of why Labour was comprehensively rejected at the ballot box in December. Mr Murray has the backing of the Labour Movement for Europe, but without support from two more unions, he will need to rely on  CLPs to put him on the ballot. So far he had received eight CLP nominations, compared to Dawn Butler on , Richard Burgon on eight and Rosena Allin-Khan on four. Gordon Brown announced his endorsement of the Edinburgh South MP in comments to Scientists for Labour, a group affiliated to the party and of which he is patron. Mr Brown said: I know Ian Murray to have been committed to and directly involved in supporting investment in science in our country, not least because of his association with Edinburgh University and in particular its science campus at King’s Buildings.

Verbal reports were given by Mr Lavery and elections chief Andrew Gwynne. One source at the meeting said Mr Lavery blamed media attacks for Mr Corbyn’s poor leadership ratings. He criticised some MPs and shadow cabinet members for “indiscipline” which he said undermined the party’s efforts.   The insider said: “It was like a parallel universe. You’d have thought we were the slickest, best run party and had actually won.”  However, Mr Gwynne had apologised for the “devastating” result and told colleagues: “If we don’t learn the right lessons of our defeat under the new leadership then we’ll be out of power for longer than just four years”.  And he admitted that Mr Corbyn’s leadership had “drawn on” Labour’s support.  But a second Labour party report, published by the FT, blamed Brexit - while largely absolving Mr Corbyn from blame.  The post-mortem found it would be “unrealistic” not to say its policy to hold a second Brexit referendum played a “decisive” role. While the authors accepted there were “negative views” of the outgoing leader they did not lay direct blame at his door. Far from being a weak or isive leader, they concluded instead that he was the victim of four years of unrelenting attacks on his character. This was an “assault without precedent in modern politics”, they said. But they did admit that a glut of policies had been confusing for the public - although it defended their radicalism. NEC members were shown a third report on the party’s community organising efforts by Karie Murphy, Mr Corbyn’s ex-chief of staff who led the day-to-day campaign.

Only .% of women in the UK breastfeed up to a yearI want to add to that stat  use my voice to support all those who need it. #Breastfeeding After hundreds of mums praised the picture the MP told the Mirror: Oh I am so happy, the response has been so overwhelmingly positive. I did go back and forth about posting the picture, but I am not ashamed of feeding my son and why should I be  She said that she had ultimately made the post to help people realise this isnapost something mums should feel ashamed about. It is a chance to use my position to encourage people to feel comfortable feeding their children whenever and wherever they need to, she said. In that spirit, Ms Davies-Jones said she has been asking questions about breastfeeding in the House of Commons. She added: I went to see the Speaker Lindsay Hoyle and it turns out there isnapost a ruling onwomen can breastfeed in the chamber of the House of Commons. There was a committee set up by John Bercow about making the place more family friendly, but they never decided on breastfeeding. So I asked what would happenI did breastfeed in the chamber and the Speaker said he didnapost know. Now I am not saying I am going to be the first person to do that, but there are a lot of mums in Parliament.

Backbencher Adam Holloway claimed many people would rather be on the streets than in a shelter because it allows them to fund drug and alcohol addiction. During a Commons debate on the issue, Tory backbencher Adam Holloway said homelessness should be treated as a health issue - allowing drugs and alcohol to be used in shelters and improving mental health care. The Gravesham MP spent time on the streets in  - while filming a documentary, No Fixed Abode for ITV. He did so again in  to learn more about the problems faced by those sleeping rough. He told MPs about meeting an alcoholic on the streets in London called Andy, who claimed he had a flat to go home tohe wanted to.  Mr Holloway said: Andy was drinking, I donapost know, probably  cans of beer a day. But Andy wasnapost actually homeless. Andy had a flat, he in fact showed me the keys to his flat. But Andy was living at Westminster for two reasons. He was lonely in his flat in North London and how on earth is an alcoholic going to generate enough money to buy beernot from begging on the streets  I didnapost meet him, but a friend of mine reported that a guy who had been a heroin addict in Covent Garden for many years who had his leg cut off eventually. And this guy absolutely maintains, and this is my experience too, thatthe public were not so generous and didnapost enable people to buy the heroin and buy the alcohol then he would have got off the streets an awful, awful lot earlier. The reality is that many people choose to be on the streets.This caused Labour MPs to shout out in disagreement.Mr Holloway continued: Before you stand up in outrage, thereaposs a reason for this. If youaposre like Andy and youaposre addicted to a drug, you have a problem, you need money. You do not get money from beggingyou are sleeping on the floor in one of the Governmentaposs No Second Night Out hostels. You donapost get money to buy heroinyouaposre sitting in your council flat, you get it by being out on the streets.

But after  January  there could be major changes, especiallythere is no trade deal with the EU.Weaposve written more about those changes here, but what you need to know is this: the UK has a Brexit deal. It helps stabilise the process of leaving the EU. But it does not deal with the future relationship with the continent after that.Here is a short guide to what the Brexit deal is, what it does, and what it doesnapost do. The aposBrexit dealapos is an international treaty that makes it legal for the UK to leave the EU.It consists of the -page Withdrawal Agreement that Theresa May agreed between the UK and EU - plus  pages of amendments from Boris Johnson to change rules on Northern Ireland.It governs the very complicated process of becoming the first country ever to leave the EU - disentangling the nation from thousands of EU laws built up over decades. That deal has now been passed into law by the UK Parliamentand European Parliament. That means the UK will legally have left the European Union at pm on January  and be unable to cancel Brexit. What does it do   The deal is designed to ensure there arenapost legal gaps when EU law automatically ends on Brexit day. Most importantly it creates a apostransition periodapos, which extends all EU laws until  December  while the UK and EU negotiate a permanent trade deal. The Brexit deal said this transition period could be extended by two years, but Boris Johnson decided to make that part illegal when he translated the deal into UK law. The deal also includes guarantees on the rights of EU citizens who are already here to stay, with a new aposindependent monitoring authorityapos to ensure their rights are upheld. EU citizens can continue arriving in Britain until  December but must then apply for settled status in order to be able to stay. Meanwhile the deal lays out the framework for a £bn aposorce billapos, paid from the UK to the EU over several decadesto cover outstanding commitments between both sides. Crucially, the Brexit deal also includes the arrangements for Northern Ireland... What does it do for Northern Ireland   By far the most dficult question was Northern Ireland - how to solve the problem of trading with both the Republicand Great Britainat the same time. The first version of the Brexit deal, secured by Theresa May, contained a backstop which would have forced the whole of the UK to follow EU customs rules with no time limit. Boris Johnson axed that for a hybrid system - with dferent rules for customs and the single market. Northern Ireland is part of the UKaposs customs territory. But firms will have to sign customs formsthey send goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland - and pay customs dutiesthose goods arelikelyto move on to the EU in future.Meanwhile Northern Ireland and the Republic will share some EU single market rules - forcing checks on manufactured and agricultural products crossing the Irish Sea. The Northern Ireland Assembly - known as Stormont - will get a vote every four years on whether to let EU law continue in this way. But this vote could be passed by a simple majority - denying the DUP a veto on staying under EU laws long-term.

He had been accused of murdering his childrenaposs nanny, Sandra Rivett, and had gone on the run following her death. There have been no confirmed sightings of the peer in more than  years and in  he was legally declared dead. But now, Sandraaposs son, Neil Berrimen, claims to have uncovered bombshell evidence that proves Lucan is alive and has carved out a new le in Australia. Neil says Lucan, who is now in his s, shares a home and lives as a Buddhist - and has handed police his dossier of evidence. The -year-old said: He has been alive all this time. Lying about who he is. Lying about it to his new friends. “They are fully aware he is a mystery elderly Englishman and not who he is claiming to be. “The people he lives with know he has a mystery past and what he tells them does not add up. They have had their suspicions for many years. “Lucan is a deceitful conman and he is the man who murdered my mother. “There is absolutely no doubt in my mind he escaped that night, with the help of friends who helped him get across the Channel and get a new passport, and incredibly he is still alive. “From my own inquiries he’s had at least six dferent identities. Neil has spent more than £, of his own money in his quest to find out what really happened to the man who killed his mother. Lucan disappeared after the murder of Miss Rivett at the family’s exclusive mews home in Belgravia, Central London, on November , . Born into a wealthy family, Lucan had plenty of connections and on the night of the murder fled to a friendaposs house. He wrote two letters to his close friend, Bill Shanyd Kidd. In one of them he said: I am only concerned about the children. If you can manage it I would like them to live with you.” Eton-educated, Lucan was one of the early members of the exclusive Clermont Club in London, which prided itself on its A-list membership. Founded in  by John Aspinall, its original crowd included five dukes, five marquesses,  earls and two cabinet ministers. The rich and famous were desperate for a seat at the influential and the club soon boasted A-list members like Hollywood star Peter Sellers, James Bond author Ian Fleming, artist Lucien Freud, and businessman James Goldsmith, father of Jemima and Zac. Despite working as a merchant banker, Lucan quit his lucrative role to become a professional gambler, something he developed a taste for while he was serving in the Coldstream Guards. He earned himself the nickname aposLuckyapos after winning £,, which would be worth about £, today, in just  hours in . But Lucan also had huge losses, which he would brush off in front of his friends, who were among the wealthiest men in the world. He met and married Veronica Duncan in  and the couple welcomed their child, Frances, the following year. In , and by now a full-time gambler, Lucan was even in the running to become the next James Bond but declined an invite to screen test for the role. After breakfasting at am and walking his dog, Lucan would spend most of his days at the exclusive club in Mayfair. The members would while away hours playing poker, blackjack and roulette, along with Lucanaposs favourite fame of backgammon. In his book The Gamblers, author John Pearson said: “At the heart of the Set lay a belief that risk-takers are the people who make civilisation tick. “Cruel, heartless and snobbish, they gambled with their fortunes and kept a stf upper lip when they lost. “This and a loyalty to each other that transcended everything .” Rich and entitled, the members hated Harold Wilson and would gossip for hours about the royal family, many of whom they were familiar with. Bill Shand Kydd was a former jockey whose older brother was married to Princess Dianaaposs mother for almost two decades. His we was Lucanaposs weaposs sister and had introduced the couple. Every member of the club was rich and extremely well connected - which founder Aspinall had planned from the start. However, Lucanaposs betting losses were by now far exceeding his winnings, something he largely kept secret from his we. Two more children followed, George and Camilla, and Veronica suffered from post-mtatal depression. This, coupled with Lucanaposs increasing gambling debts, was taking a severe toll on their marriage and at Christmas in  he moved into a small house close by. Veronica tried to reconcile but Lucan was adamant the relationship was over and all he wanted was custody of their three children. In , Lucan had lost a bitter court case with his we over who would care for their children and the cost of fighting it had left him in serious financial trouble. He was by now drinking heavily and his friends in the Clermont Club were starting to worry, especially when he started ranting about wanting to murder his we. James Goldsmith, a key member of the Clermont Club, acted as a guarantor on a £, overdraft for Lucan, which remained unpaid for years. For decades rumours have swirled that Lucanaposs friends at the club, who had access to private jets and bolt holes around the world, whisked him out of the country following Sandraaposs murder. Then, in an interview eight years ago, the Clermont Clubaposs former secretary, Shirley Robey, said she believed Lucan had fled and had been living abroad for the last  years. Shirley claimed to have overheard a chat between club owner Aspinall and James Goldsmith about Lucan.

Everybody around her, social workers, family, came together to make sure her le could be good. We look have very positively, everybody made her happy. The couple attended a Barnardoaposs information event after a friend saw newspaper advert at the same time they were discussing the idea of fostering behind closed doors and gave to them by complete chance.  Colin already knew about the incredible work Barnardoaposs does as some of his school friends lived in one of their childrenaposs homes. The couple now focus on giving the children who stay with them happy memories from their childhoods in a bid to ensure they have nice things to look back on when theyaposre older. He said: When children come in to a strange environment they seem a bit confused and scared. Itaposs great having chuldren who are close in age to them. As adults we stand back and let the children do a lot of the engaging. They soon settle in to the routine. Sharon adds: You can have a child that settles within a few weeks and feels like theyaposve been here forever. But some donapost settle for years. The couple once looked after one boy who packed his bags every time they had an argument as he was convinced they would say they had had enough of him and kick him out, even though he had lived with them for four years.

And a home win over Dunfermline shows their form in Inverclyde is just as good as it’s ever been.Morton finding their feet both home and away makes what is always a dficult trip an even stfer test for Dundee.Win and their quest for consistency starts anew – lose and the Dee and McPake could be staring down the barrel."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/01/2.49944745-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/01/2.49944745-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/01/2.49944745-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/01/2.49944745-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"dundee seal loan return for goalkeeper conor hazard","story":"Dundee have confirmed the signing of goalkeeper Conor Hazard on loan from Celtic for the rest of the season.The Northern Ireland international played five games for the Dark Blues in an emergency-loan spell earlier in the campaign and s to challenge Jack Hamilton for the No  jersey.Hazard arrived from the champions in October when Hamilton needed surgery after suffering from appendicitis and impressed during his short time at the club.He played in wins over Ayr, Alloa and Morton before heading back to his parent club in November."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/01/19798931-897x564.jpg ","title":"dundee united 2 2 hibs appere solo goal earns united cup replay","story":"Louis Appere earned Dundee United a Scottish Cup fourth-round replay as they twice came from behind to draw with Hibs.Christian Doidge gave the Hibees a dream start after eight minutes at Tannadice before Lawrence Shankland scored a classy equaliser in first-half stoppage time.Martin Boyle put the visitors back in front with a powerful drive on  minutes before substitute Appere curled home a leveller on  minutes which earned the Terrors an Easter Road replay and a place in the hat for the last- draw.United showed five changes from the team which faced Partick last weekend with Jamie Robson, Calum Butcher, Ian Harkes, Peter Pawlett and Paul McMullan coming in for Adrian Sporle, Declan Glass, Nicky Clark, Louis Appere and Mark Reynolds.It was Pawlett#s first start for almost three months, with McMullan and Harkes seeing their first action since the last Dundee derby.What had been billed as the tie of the round got off to a frenetic start.

However, Mark Connolly was in the right place at the right time to clear Florian Kamberi#s effort off the line.Hibs weren#t to be denied five minutes later, though, as they opened the scoring through a low Doidge effort.

Boyle was again the creator-in-chief, with his surging run into the Terrors# half leaving United back pedalling before Melker Hallberg saw his shot foiled by Siegrist.Kamberi again fired towards his fellow-countryman just before the half-hour but this time it was an easy save for United#s Swiss stopper.The Tangerines were struggling to get a foothold in the match and had created few chances as proceedings approached the half-way point. When Liam Smith found Harkes at the edge of the box to fire in a fairly innocuous shot, however, the mood seemed to lt around Tannadice.On  minutes, Siegrist again halted a deflected Kamberi effort from a matter of yards as the Hibees continued to press. United were starting to enjoy more possession, though, and went in at half-time with the tie level thanks to Shankland#s th domestic goal of the season.In the last of three minutes of added time at the end of the first period, Harkes strolled through the heart of the Hibs defence before sliding in Shankland to slot home from eight yards despite being under heavy pressure.United weren#t level for long, though, as two minutes into the second period the men from Edinburgh were back in the lead.Scott Allan played provider as he laid in Boyle to drive home low beyond an outstretched Siegrist from fully  yards.Kamberi#s battle with Siegrist continued on  minutes with the goalie again denying the striker#s thunderbolt from distance with the rebound just evading Boyle on the follow-up.Allan fired over just after the hour as the Terrors, again, fell out of the game as boss Robbie Neilson ordered their first change of the afternoon, sending Appere on for Pawlett.And young attacker Appere had the desired impact  minutes after coming on, picking up possession on the left before twisting and turning away from Steven Whittaker and then David Gray to curl a delightful effort beyond the helpless Ofir Marciano for -.Both teams pushed for a winner in the closing  minutes, with Siegrist pulling off a top save from Doidge in injury time, but it never came, meaning these two will have to do it all again a week on Tuesday in the capital.Dundee United : Siegrist , Smith, Watson, Connolly, Robson Harkes , Butcher , Powers McMullan, Shankland, Pawlett .Subs not used: Deniz, Sporle, Reynolds, Sow and King.Hibs : Marciano , Naismith , Porteous , Hanlon , Stevenson Hallberg, Allan, Whittaker Boyle, Doidge, Kamberi.Subs: Bogdan , Slivka, Newell, Horgan and Shaw.Ref: Kevin Clancy.Att: ,."},{"url":null,"title":"exclusive hibs kid fraser murray set for dundee loan","story":"Hibs youngster Fraser Murray is set to join Dundee on loan until the end of the season, Tele Sport can exclusively reveal.The -year-old midfielder is a product of the Hibees academy set-up and has made  appearances for their first team.The Easter Road club are keen for him to get more game-time under his belt and hope a switch to Dens Park will offer that.The Dark Blues hope to have the deal sewn up this week in time for Saturday’s trip to Morton.Meanwhile, club-mate Sean Mackie has ed to Hibs after picking up an injury in his temporary spell on Tayside."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/07/5d1a2b73b20428.81132281-726x564.jpg ","title":"lack of leadership a worrying trait in dark blues current plight","story":"What is worrying me most about Dundee right now is the lack of leadership on show at the club, from top to bottom.Dark Blues boss James McPake even admitted himself in the aftermath of last Friday’s - loss to Dunfermline at East End Park that his experienced players didn’t step up to the plate.That is very concerning. They are not going well but you would at least expect them to be out there giving their all.Particularly with a young player like Lyall Cameron making his first start for the club – they have to protect him and dictate how things go on the pitch.I do still feel sorry for James in a way because there is only so much a manager can do once he’s picked a team and sent it out to play.If you have players giving you   every week then you are off to a good start but he is not getting that from even his most senior pros.Kane Hemmings, for example, played like he is getting frustrated. He isn’t getting the right service but he needs to lead by example and work his socks off even when it leads to nothing.James needs his leaders to find a voice and try to get a reaction when they are struggling in games.Too often this season they have gone down without a fight and it was the same down at East End Park.That can be down to a lack of confidence because they aren’t playing well or getting the desired results, but I still think when you are struggling it’s best to go back to basics.I’ve been saying this for weeks, even months, now but it’s the first step of getting back on track.I’ve got a lot of respect for James for sticking to his principles and trying to play possession football out from the back but it’s not getting them into the final third often enough. vw, px\"  They have got to be more direct. It may not be pretty but it can be effectiveit’s executed properly.I thought Ollie Crankshaw did that well when he came on in the second half.He played like he had more positivity in the short spell he was involved than most of the other players.One player they’ve been linked with who I feel is the type they need is Hearts centre-back Christophe Berra.He has not quite got legs anymore and he is getting on a bit but he has got the drive and would run through a brick wall for his team.He would be a massive signing for Dundeehe is fit and sharp."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/01/dundee-morton.jpg ","title":"pars not getting carried away as they close gap","story":"Dunfermline manager Stevie Crawford insists his side won’t be getting carried away as they closed the gap to Dundee and the promotion play-offs to one point.The Pars’ - win over the Dark Blues on Friday night moved them to within a point of James McPake’s men in fourth .The Fers dominated at East End Park as Ryan Dow and Kevin Nisbet goals gave them a vital three points after five games without a victory.However, Crawford said: “We’re not getting too carried away.“I keep saying it and, I don’t want to sound boring and repetitive, but you can win a couple of games in this league and be looking at the play-offs then lose a couple of games and you’re looking at relegation.“The boys have worked extremely hard, bought into it and, when questions are being asked about how our season is going to go, to a man they deserve an enormous amount of credit for the way they performed on Friday.”The Pars boss reserved special praise for striker Nisbet as he hit his nd goal of the season amid reports Rangers and others are monitoring his progress as the January transfer window draws to a close.Crawford added: “He’s playing with a lot of confidence, scoring goals and he will attract attention. vw, px\"  “It’s a good problem for us.

inspired after visiting the Friends of Turrf Cemetery and seeing all the good work that had been carried out.Now she wants a similar initiative in place for Ellon but first needs to find enough like-minded volunteers to help out.She said: “There is absolutely no reason why we can’t look after and improve our cemetery and set up a similar group with the same goals.“We often get complaints about issues like the grass not being mown, the grass cuttings not being picked up and the bins overflowing.“The problem is Aberdeenshire Council has no money to fix these issues which is why I am making this call to action for the residents of Ellon to come to our next meeting and get involved with the project to make the cemetery a nicer place.”The Friends of Turrf Cemetery group helps with the upkeep of the memorial space in Turrf and has been vital in its regeneration.Members were involved in creating a memorial garden for a neonatal bereavement charity.The group has also installed a new entrance and a memorial bench for the former group leader, the late farming editor of the Press and Journal, Joe Watson.Mrs Owen said: “The cemetery needs a bit more TLC and could do with sprucing up to make it more welcoming.“I want to organise a site visit so we can see what needs to be done and eventually we can be involved in shaping what the new cemetery planned for Ellon will look like.“But obviously our first priority is the one on Castle Road.”Anyone interested in the project should attend the meeting at Ellon Primary School gym hall at pm on

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert club on target for 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe first competition of the new year at Tarbert Gun Club also served as the January leg of the club#s winter league.A full house of  teams turned out on Sunday January , and the early shooters had to put up eith windy conditions which made the clays dance.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

Douglas and Sons of Lilliesleaf, on Christmas Eve when Graham Douglas died .The Douglas family business was started at the end of the First World War by William Douglas, who had three sons Willie, Dan and Jimmy, who on leaving school in turn all joined the family business. Through time Willie and Jimmy both retired early from the firm through ill health and when Dan retired in  the business was taken over by Williersquos son, William , and long time colleague, Bill Reid . Graham became the fourth generation Williamto work in the business after leaving school and in  took over the business when his father, Bill, retired.The Douglas family took over the building of the annual Border Union Show and Kelso Ram Sales in  and the Championship Dog Show since the first Show in , completing  years for the former and  years for the latter respectively in .It is interesting to note they succeeded Messrs. Bulman, builders Kelso who had been involved with BUAS since . To have had only two main Contractors in over  years is indicative of their skills and loyalties.Graham was very clever at school with a good practical brain and I heard from his le long friend, Andy Shortreed, that he was an expert at, among other things, technical drawing and would make all manner of things out of wood and other material.He was encouraged to study and utilise these skills while at High School in Hawick but Graham was stubborn! All he wanted to do was leave school and join his father, Bill, and be a fencer, which he duly did in .Countless number of farms and estates throughout the Borders have benefited from Grahamrsquos skill, as have the three core events at BUAS. His younger brother, Neil, was in partnership with Graham for a number of years before ing to utilising his skills with heavy plant machinery.I cannot have more regard and respect for Bill and Graham and how they nurtured me when I joined BUAS as Secretary in . I listened and I learnt from them all the ins and outs of both the Showground and preparing these massive annual Events and bringing them together in such a professional manner and with an uncanny calmness that sometimes was frustrating but one knew that come the day the target was reached. The Ram Sales have evolved over the last  years with many changes and updates and it was a pleasure working with someone who was always conscious of the huge responsibility he had to the many thousands of people, whose livelihoods were often very dependant on a good Ram Sales or a good Show, whether buying, selling, exhibiting, a Trade Stand, providing a service or a member of the public.Grahamrsquos other passion in le was his racing pigeons, which he has bred and raced for over  years - and for the last  with his friend and near neighbour in Lilliesleaf, Bob Spearman. They had many years of great fun and indeed numerous successes with their birds and it was always a great pleasure and exciting for those at the Showground when in the spring Graham would very often bring a crate of young birds when he came to work and released them as part of their early training. A master breeder even he did not understand how the young birds knew which direction was home!He had a great eye and would spend many long evenings just watching the birds to learn which would be potential race winners and which to keep as breeding stock. They had their fair share of success in UK races, whether from Edinburgh or the south coast of England but their biggest success was when one of their favourites ndash Bonnie Lad ndash finished th out , birds released from the South of France.

Christmas time had been dficult because it was the first Christmas without her granny, who had died earlier in the year. But now she was back at school and into the routine with her friends.Her parents had hoped this would help, but her sense of loss was still overwhelming for her. Perhaps at her age she didnrsquot understand exactly what was going on inside, but all she knew was that her granny shersquod loved was gone and she missed her.Then one evening during a bedtime story, Jessica started to cry and told her dad that her granny was melting like a snowman. At first he wasnrsquot sure what she meant, but then he understood.Jessicarsquos memory of her granny was fading. This was a second loss for her. The first loss was of her grannyrsquos physical presence, her actual hugs, her voice and care and love, even the smell of her perfume. Now Jessica was losing her memory of all this and she knew it. So she felt that something inside her was melting too, something that had been so much of her was vanishing.And this made Jessica fear that others in her le could disappear and then melt away as well, even her dad or mum. It was a terrying thought and it made her not just sad but scared and insecure inside.Her dad tried to reassure her that he or her mum werenrsquot going to die, but despite being only six years old, Jessica now knew that such promises couldnrsquot be kept forever.ldquoNana didnrsquot want to die either, but she did. And now shersquos melting.The next day at school was another dficult one for Jessica, and home time often didnrsquot make it better because in the past it had usually been her granny whorsquod picked her up.Her dad was waiting for her.ldquoWe are not going straight home today, he told her.ldquoWhere are we going ldquoTo Nanarsquos seat.A cloud suddenly came over Jessica. She didnrsquot say anything and just looked at the ground. This was a seat that overlooked the sea, where her gran had often taken her. They would sit together and look out to the Firth, spotting boats and looking for whales, while eating sweeties.Her dad had realised that Jessica hadnrsquot been there since the death of her grandmother.ldquoOnlyyou want to, he said.Jessica was silent and looked at the ground. Inside, her emotions were spinning. Then she looked up.ldquoI donrsquot want to, it will just make me sad, she said to her dad. So they didnrsquot go.But later that day, Jessica began to talk about Nanarsquos seat. ldquoShe always gave me sweeties and wersquod look for whales and pirates. She told me a story about how a pirate once landed here at Prestonpans, but he didnrsquot leave treasure, he just built the town.ldquoGreat story, said her dad.The next day, Jessica agreed to go to her nanarsquos seat. When they arrived, she hesitated to sit and had a wave of emotion.ldquoI miss Nana, she saidldquoSo do I. Shall we sit on her seat and miss her together.ldquoBut we have to eat sweeties.ldquoJust so happens Irsquove got some in my pocket, said the dad with a smile. His daughter smiled back and sat on the seat. Her dad joined her.ldquoNo, dad, that was Nanarsquos place, you sit this side instead.And so they sat, missing Nana together, being sad together, but also remembering her together.ldquoCan you tell me the story about the pirate  asked the dad.ldquoDonrsquot want to.ldquoOK, maybe next time.The next day, they ed to Nanarsquos seat. This time, Jessica told a bit of the pirate story. The dad remembered it from his childhood and realised that his own grief in losing his mother had closed him down to talking about her. It had felt too painful.He began to sit on lsquoNanarsquos seatrsquo by himself when Jessica was at school, even though he had never done it with his mother when she was alive he had always been lsquotoo busy to watch the sea with her. But his daughterrsquos anecdotes and stories about the seat made it feel like a place of remembrance for him too.The power of stories, to rekindle memory and ease the sense of loss, became very real for both Jessica and her dad. At home, they made a special box with drawings and photos of memories, and things that reminded Jessica of her gran. Theyrsquod take them out and tell stories and share memories. Her dad even began to tell funny stories about his mum from when before Jessica was born, when he was a boy.lsquoNanarsquos boxrsquo was put in a safe place, but where Jessica could take itshe wanted to. As time passed, she opened it less, but it was always in her room. Sometimes she would put things in it, such as shells from the beach, because her granny had loved beautul shells.The loss of a loved one can never be completely moved on from, so there were always going to be times of sadness.

It is going to get much more noticeable as more development takes place.I know many people will say there are many more things to think about, especially in late January, when the Christmas turkey is coming home to roost and all those bills have to be paid at a time when we are already financially drained from festive expenditure, and stressed out. Thank goodness for Burns suppers, a highlight of a month that often seems both the darkest and longest of the year.But this is all the more reason to pause. When was the last time you really had the opportunity to sit under a dark night sky full of visible stars  This is one of naturersquos free gts and stargazing has real benefits for our mental health and emotional wellbeing.I remember some years ago, when visiting a friend in a very rural part of Scotland, I went out to put something in the bin. My friend came out to seeI was OK, as I hadnrsquot ed after  minutes. I had been struck by the beauty and power of the starlit sky, unpolluted by city lights. Without noticing the time, I had sat just gazing at the universe above me.I can remember the sense of awe and peace it created. Sure, part of it was also the quiet and stillness in that area, but sitting under the canopy of stars is what overwhelmed me in that moment.Itrsquos an experience fewer of us can enjoy because of the increase in light pollution, but also noise and general busyness all around us. So we often donrsquot even realise what wersquore missing. Perhaps there is a cause and effect here: the less you notice the absence of something, the less you think itrsquos important or relevant.Our ancient ancestors understood its power. But I think we have lost the sense. I recently asked a group of young people how many of them had sat under the stars and just gazed and wondered at them. Sadly, none had done so, and some thought the idea ldquoweird. I think a lot of adults would share that opinion.But taking time to sit and really wonder at an unpolluted night sky can fill us with awe, as I experienced that evening at my friendrsquos house. It makes us feel small and in so doing it puts our worries and anxieties in perspective. It can promote inner peace and calm.For sure, the bills wonrsquot go away neither will the stress at work or whatever is dominating your thoughts most of the day. But in taking time to pause and wonder at the vast and almost timeless beauty of the stars, your soul gets time to catch up. It can help you see things dferently, in a more creative way. Itrsquos a form of meditation with something bigger than we can imagine, but also something incredibly beautul.And itrsquos fascinating, as you try to identy the dferent constellations, and perhaps realise how much you donrsquot know or have forgotten. Could you identy the northern star, and what constellations can you see  Sailors in days of old were experts at identying the stars to aid direction, but Irsquom sure they also marvelled at the unhindered beauty and mystery of them as well.There are still many places in our county where we can be wrapped in star-lit darkness. But as the lsquoupside down skyrsquo gets bigger and brighter, the real stars are fading in so many places.The real shame is, as the stars disappear from our sight, they may disappear from our consciousness as well.Letrsquos not let that happen. Let us gt our children, and ourselves, with the noticing and gazing at the real stars in our sky and somehow find the time, even briefly, to stargaze."},{"url":null,"title":"garry-oconnor-referees-haddington-amateur-teams-successful-charity-match","story":"Haddington Town FC took time out over the festive period for a special friendly in aid of Back Onside.Former Hibernian and Scotland striker Garry OrsquoConnor, who is an ambassador of the good cause, refereed the match, which saw members of the amateur teamrsquos squad come up against one another on January .Matt OrsquoConnell, chairman of the club, which was formed last year, said they were determined to help support the charity, which helps young people and adults who face mental health challenges.He said: ldquoWersquore a club that was founded on the idea of bringing local guys together into a positive social and active environment.ldquoItrsquos well documented that the highest proportion of suicide across Scotland is men aged - and thatrsquos something we hope to positively redress in our town by facilitating a great environment in which local guys can improve not only their physical but also their mental health.ldquoOur connection with the charity Back Onside was really born of their slogan, #SupportThroughSport, a powerful statement that really resonated with us.ldquoTheyrsquore a great charity who are doing a hell of a lot across the UK and so for us, a small amateur club barely nine months old, to play a small part in helping a charity who share our ethos was immensely rewarding.Haddington Town play on Sunday mornings in Division Two of the Lothian and Edinburgh Amateur Football Association , alongside fellow county side Meadowmill.The charity match, played at Knox Academy, finished - in favour of the lsquoawayrsquo Haddington Town team.Libby Emmerson, founder and CEO of Back Onside, said: ldquoWe are beyond grateful for the support received from Haddington Town Amateur Football Club and guest referee Garry OrsquoConnor.ldquoAs a small charity with a huge clientele, community events such as the Haddington Town AFC charity match are key to raising funds and awareness so that we can continue to support those facing mental health challenges.Mr OrsquoConnell thanked everyone for their support, with the match raising pound, ndash more than double the target.He said: ldquoHuge thanks to Libby Emmerson, FES FM and Garry OrsquoConnor.

They are able to catch and release Atlantic salmon, and they are able to catch and retain sea trout, should they catch them.ldquoBut at the moment, because of the way in which we grade the rivers and because of the grading of some of the rivers in that estuary, they are not able to retain the salmon.Mr Main made the comments while giving evidence to Holyroodrsquos Environment, Climate Change and Land Reform Committee.He was questioned on possible exemptions for the haaf netters by Scottish Labour MSP Claudia Beamish, who represents the South of Scotland region.She suggested the ancient technique kills less fish because it doesnrsquot use hooks, adding: ldquoTherefore, is it not possible that the haaf netters could keep fish  Is that something yoursquove looked into Dr John Armstrong, director of Marine Scotlandrsquos Freshwater Fisheries Laboratory, said he could ldquosee the logic to this.He told MSPs: ldquoThere wouldnrsquot necessarily be a need to take the fish out of the water, which is one of the key issues.ldquoBut anglers typically only catch in the order of  per cent of fish moving up-stream.ldquoAnd now, even of that % theyrsquore releasing %, in that order.ldquoSo therersquos very little damage from catch and release in angling, just by those numbers.ldquoIn terms of where we have rivers that are in poor conservation status, we really just donrsquot want fish killed Irsquom afraid.The Annan Haaf Net Project has been documenting those who still brave the icy waters with their nets, while the Devilrsquos Porridge Museum in Eastriggs, Dumfries and Galloway, is currently staging an exhibition on the practice.Haaf netter Barry Turner recently told the BBC: ldquoIt would be an act of vandalism, cultural and historic vandalism,this traditional activity which is unique to the inner Solway dies.ldquoPlease save us, wersquore desperate for protection.

Until the UK-EU free trade agreement, or no agreement, is known it is not possible to finalisea policy.However, contingency planning is sensible, and one possibility stands out ndash Scotland joining the European Free Trade Association .That guarantees access to the EU single market, but outwith its customs union and therefore able to exercise a great deal more sovereignty than is possible with EU membership.There is a big dference between asking the Scotsthey want the UK to remain within the EU, as in the  EU referendum, to asking them to vote for independence on the premise that an independent Scotland would re-join the EU whilst the rest of the UK remains out.The EU is a customs union.If Scotland joins that customs union whilst the rest of the UK remains out that would inevitably create a trade border at Gretna.At the very least, there would no longer be ldquofrictionless trade between Scotland and England. As with Northern Ireland, where a new border has been created between Ulster and mainland Britain on the Irish Sea, a parallel border arrangement would inevitably be required between Scotland and England in the event of an independent Scotland re-joiningthe EU.Depending on the outcome of the negotiations about to begin between the UK and EU on their future trading relationship, tarfs and quotas on trade may also be required between an independent Scotland and England to maintain the integrity of the EU customs union. By promising to re-join the EU after independence, the SNP would therefore be handing a gt to our Unionist opponents.They would weaponise the border issue in exactly the same way they did with the currency issue in the  Independence Referendum.The chances of winning the referendum would be unnecessarily and substantially weakened.These issues do not arisean independent Scotland is part of a free trade agreement but not in a customs union.

To turn the area over to commercial activities from November, with an unsightly and unpassable clear-up lasting from January to May, is to commandeer the place for more than half the year. Eight weeks would be acceptable  is not.Naturally, this eyesore wont be published on any VisitScotland website. Most sightseers wont ever catch a glimpse of this inglorious aftermath. Meanwhile, between now and the middle of May, those who live and work in Edinburgh must pass by and avert their gaze, wondering how their city became a mere pawn of the entertainment industry and not an illustrious capital of which they could once be proud. As one of many disgruntled locals tweeted, this is ruination \"in the name of greed\".I cannot think of a city of comparable elegance, venerability and wealth ndash a Unesco World Heritage Centre to boot ndash where the first thing you see as you emerge from the train station, or arrive from the airport is a wasteland. Welcome to Scotland! Here we dont roll out the red carpet, but ndash after an agonisingly long delay ndash we do renew the turf.Theres a palpable feeling at the moment that Edinburgh is undergoing seismic change, under our noses but without public consent. News last week that planning regulations could be relaxed to allow restaurants, cafes, and a host of other non-retail outfits to move into Princes Street is a fresh cause for concern. If approved, this new dispensation could mean that one of Europes most beguiling bouleds ndash the street that sells Scotland ndash could become home to a casino, cinema, or even a sports facility.Why should this concern us  Given the tawdry quality of some of the shops currently trading, wouldnt bright cafes or restaurants be a welcome improvement  After all, the array of tartan tat, cheap-as-chips fashion and even an emporium dedicated to sugary sweets ndash the smell alone could rot your teeth ndash is hardly in keeping with the magnicence of the venue.Yet given some of the poor decisions already taken by the councils planning committee, it is hard to feel confident that this incomparably lovely avenue is in safe hands. One member of the committee says the idea is to create a \"more authentic\" space. Im not sure what that means, but it sounds like double-speak for attracting lucrative footfall. And while pubs wont apparently be allowed onto the street, this relaxing of regulations extends to George Street, Hanover Street, Frederick Street and Castle Street. Like it or not, the face of the New Towns commercial district is set for a facelt.With the demise of House of Fraser at the West End, now transformed into a whisky experience, and towards the East End the once-beloved Jenners department store due shortly to close , the heart of the city is struggling to keep up with bewildering change. Fortunately, nothing so awful is in the pipeline as the notorious proposal some years ago to build an elevated shopping mall in the gardens. Perhaps the most worrying aspect of a less stringent commercial climate is the signal it sends, and the trend it looks set to deepen.Wherever you go, Edinburgh is turning into a visitor attraction, a living museum and gallery. Useful shops for locals are a rarity. In their place is a proleration of chic cafes, glitzy on-trend eateries and luxurious hotels, all pandering to the tourist market. Thanks to the make-over of old premises and investment in new, the capital has a superficial shine, a high-cost stylish patina. But as Dickenss Mr and Mrs Veneering showed, putting your faith in appearances is risky. Yes, it creates jobs, though mostly of a lowly-paid, transitory kind.

Punctuality and reliability problems continue to blight the network.Office of Rail and Road figures showed just  per cent of Northern trains arrived at stations within one minute of the timetable in the  months to January , compared with the average across Britain of  per cent.German-based Arriva was due to run Northern until March .The OLR already runs services on the East Coast Main Line under the LNER brand, following the failure of the Virgin Trains East Coast franchise.In a written statement to Parliament, Mr Shapps said: \"Its no surprise that passengers have lost trust in the Norths rail network. The service provided by the rail network in the North has failed to meet the needs of passengers.\"People across the North deserve better, their communities deserve better and I am determined to achieve that.\"He added: \"This is a new beginning for Northern but it is only a beginning.

Like many ScotRail trains, this improvement in service was long overdue.He paid tribute to ScotRail staff whose hard work, often under immense pressure, had made the dramatic improvement possible.ldquoThe years of falling service levels were due to chronic and deliberate understaffing, declared Mr Cortes. ldquoSadly, it seems Abellio have not learned the lessons from their mistakes as they now have plans on the table to cut staff in travel shops, which can only mean poorer services for customers once more.The union chief added: ldquoOf course, the best way to ensure ScotRail services continue to improve is to take it into public ownership right away and keep it there.ldquoIf the Tories can bring themselves to run Northern in public ownership itrsquos not a lot to ask for the SNP to do likewise and end the ScotRail misery story."},{"url":null,"title":"holyrood-votes-favour-second-independence-referendum","story":"MSPs backed the move by  votes to , with the Scottish Government proposing it should take place later this year.It comes despite Prime Minister Boris Johnson insisting he will not hand over the powers to hold a re-run of .Last night, Scottish Secretary Alister Jack said the latest Holyrood vote changed nothing.Conservative, Labour and Lib Dem amendments were all voted down by the pro-independence majority.Nicola Sturgeon insisted another vote is necessary to protect Scotland from the consequences of a Tory Government and Brexit.The First Minister said independence is now the only realistic way Scotland can be part of Europe.She accused UK ministers of being \"completely deaf to Scotlands interests, needs and voice\", and said their vision for the UK is \"driven on the part of some by jingoism and xenophobia\".She said: \"We stand just two days from losing our EU membership and all of the rights that go with it.\"In my view it is beyond doubt now that the only realistic way for Scotland toto the heart of Europe and to ensure we get the governments we vote for is to become an independent country.\"What should be beyond any democratic argument, in light of the material change in circumstances that Brexit represents, is that it must be Scotlands choice to make.\"And it must be for this Parliament, not Westminster, to determine when and on what basis an independence referendum should take place.\"Ms Sturgeon hit out at the Tories, Labour and the Liberal Democrats for their opposition to a second ballot, saying: \"It is hard to escape the conclusion that it is their fear of the choice Scotland would make on the substantive question that is driving the anti-democratic position of the opposition parties.\"It is only ever parties that know their arguments are bust that have to resort to blocking democracy.\"I know not everyone agrees with my position on independence, but I am happy to have that debate and let Scotland decide.\"Mr Johnson formally rejected Ms Sturgeons call for a second referendum earlier this month.The First Minister will set out her \"next steps\" on how to address this on Friday.It is not clear what route the SNP leader will take.

While HIAL has gone through the motions of consulting, having clearly failed to take on board any of the concerns raised, it is dficult to see what purpose this has served.“Since the announcement last week, I have been in discussions with local ATC staff who feel badly let down by HIAL.  Nobody disputes the need for modernisation, but even HIAL’s own consultants concluded that the remote tower model was the most costly and risky option. Alternatives were identied that could have delivered the improvements needed at a fraction of the cost.“While I welcome that HIAL is to carry out an island impact assessment, given its approach to consultation so far, there have to be questions over how robust or independent this assessment will be.#In the meantime, ministers must wake up to the scale of opposition and dissatisfaction amongst HIAL’s ATC staff. They should also recognise the clear threat this poses to delivery of leline air services in Orkney and across the Highlands  Islandsstaff choose to vote with their feet. That alone should give Ministers pause for thought and allow more time for alternative options to be explored”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

For those who campaigned and voted for Brexit, this will be a cause for celebration. For others, our departure from the EU after more than  years will be a matter of despair.I didn’t vote for Brexit in the  referendum, but as a democrat I believe that the outcome of referendums should be respected.If I feel any emotion at all on Friday night, it will probably be one of relief, that we are finally making some progress in getting Brexit sorted, and the country is at last moving forward after three-and-a-half years of stagnation.: Brian Monteith: It is my last week as an MEP, here is what I’ll do: Why Brexit means we could be  times more at risk from dodgy chemicals – Dr Richard DixonFor too long, Brexit has dominated our national discourse. The outcome of the General Election in December means that we now have a Government able to make progress on this and other fronts, and actually get on with the job of governing the country and making le better for all of its citizens.The narrowness of the referendum result means that triumphalism on the part of Brexiteers would be inappropriate.Ever since , the country has been ided, almost exactly down the middle, between Leavers and Remainers.It is now time to put that split behind us, abandon those identities, and come together as one country that is moving forward.Too much energy has been wasted in fighting each other on constitutional issues instead we should be using all our efforts to create a brighter future for the United Kingdom in our new situation in the world, as one team.

Perth’s River Tay is transformed into a winter wonderland for the Riverside Light Nights event, while in Edinburgh the BurnsBeyond festival has an East Asian feel to celebrate the confluence of Burns Night and the Chinese New Year.Yet these global spectacles are accompanied by a hint of poignancy: by the time they finish next month, Scotland will have been taken out of the European Union, an international community that is as much about exchanging cultural experiences as it is about trade and policy.Brexit threatens to be catastrophic for Scotland’s creative and cultural sector. Outside the EU we risk being deprived of vital funding for cultural projects, and of the international talent that makes our festivals the envy of the world.With EU exit now a certainty on Friday, and with a no-deal withdrawal still a real threat on  December, I want to outline the steps the Scottish Government is taking to protect this vital sector and ensure that Scotland remains a dynamic, open cultural nation.: Brexit: How Scotland will be in big troubleEU migrants stop coming – Steve Cardownie: Edinburgh Fringe reviews:  shows about BrexitLet’s start by looking at just some of the benefits of EU membership. Thanks to free movement, the EU gives us access to a market of  million people who can come here freely to write, act, perform, or contribute to our cultural le in other ways. Being in the customs union allows our world-class musicians, bands and ensembles to tour across Europe without the hindrance of customs checks between borders.Cross-border cultural exchangesAnd of course, there’s the funding: the Scottish culture sector received at least £ million from the EU between  and , supporting  projects. Many of these were supported through the Creative Europe programme, the EU’s principle funding initiative for the European culture sector. From a festival of string music featuring the Scottish Ensemble alongside musicians from Germany, Estonia and Norway, to a dance and theatre project involving young people from countries including Scotland, Belgium and Denmark, these were projects which facilitated collaboration and cultural exchanges across borders. Many of them simply couldn’t have happened without the support of the EU.With our access to these benefits set to come to an end, today I’m welcoming leading figures from Scotland’s creative and tourism sectors to a round-table discussion to consider the best way the Scottish Government can support them as they prepare for the many implications of leaving the EU.Thousands of talented performersAmong the organisations represented will be the Scottish Chamber Orchestra, National Galleries of Scotland and the Scottish Contemporary Arts Network. These organisations stand to be affected by Brexit in a iety of ways. A fth of the Scottish Chamber Orchestra’s players are from where in the EU, for example, and will be impacted by the UK Government’s new immigration rules. I’m pleased to have the chance to hear from them directly about their specic concerns. I will also be making the case for Britain to remain part of the Creative Europe programme after Brexit, retaining a crucial source of funding for our creative sectors.On Saturday I’ll be helping to promote Scotland’s creative industries to a global audience at the th anniversary celebrations of Showcase Scotland at Celtic Connections. This event introduces international producers, directors and other music industry professionals to emerging Scottish artists, with the aim of securing global touring opportunities. Every year it partners with a dferent country, and this year will be Finland’s turn. As well as offering six Finnish bands the opportunity to perform in Glasgow, this is a chance to build on Scotland’s links with our European neighbours – links we will continue to support and build on in the face of Brexit.As the year progresses, attention will turn inevitably to the Edinburgh Festivals. These world-famous events involve nearly , non-UK participants – a third of whom are from the European Economic Area – drawing audiences of about . million and generating more than £ million in cultural tourism value every year. After Brexit we risk losing access to thousands of talented performers who help to make the festivals so successful.Visa problemsConscious of the potential impact on all UK festivals from the loss of free movement, I have invited representatives from the UK Government and the Welsh and Northern Irish administrations to a summit in Edinburgh to explore the problems festivals face in relation to UK visa and immigration policy.The current process for non-EU citizens is y, complex and costly, with attendees or organisers sometimes spending thousands of pounds on visas and associated costs for a visit that often only lasts a few days. With European performers now facing a similarly dficult process to be able to perform here, summit participants will work together to develop practical solutions for visiting artists and performers in what is likely to be an increasingly restrictive immigration system.The initiatives I’ve outlined here are just some of the ways we are seeking to protect Scotland’s creative and cultural sector from the worst effects of Brexit. Scotland may be leaving the EU, but we will remain a proudly European nation, and the Scottish Government is working tirelessly to ensure we continue to play a central role in the continent’s cultural le.Fiona Hyslop is Secretary for Culture, Tourism and External Affairs and the SNP MSP for Linlithgow©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"lloyds bank closures 56 bank of scotland and halifax branches to close","story":"The banking giant has confirmed plans to shut  Lloyds,  Halax and  Bank of Scotland branches between April and October .The company said the closures are part of a store reduction programme in response to changing customer behaviour and the move towards online banking.Banking union Accord said the move is expected to see staff numbers cut by \"under \" as many employees are to be redeployed in other branches. - Two women in court after video apparently shows baby girl handed a drink from a wine bottleA Lloyds Banking Group spokeswoman said: \"We are committed to having the largest branch network in the UK and, in addition to our branches, all our customers can also use the PostOffice to access their banking locally, alongside our mobile branches which visit many rural communities.\"We have confirmed that a number of branches will close between April and October this year.\"This is in response to changing customer behaviours and the reduced number of transactions being made in branches.\"It comes as the bank continues its closure programme which affected Lloyds and Halax sites in . - Billionaire set to transform remote Scottish village into community hubIn a statement, Accord said: \"We fully appreciate that the demand for high street branch banking is diminishing as customers increasingly move to app-based banking but well be examining Lloyds Banking Groups plans to ensure that theyre properly thought through and robustly evidenced.\"So far, all branch closures have been managed without compulsory redundancies and Accord expects the same outcome here.\"Well be contacting our members who are impacted by the closures to offer support and representation.\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish parliament backs holding indyref2 vote this year","story":"The Scottish Parliament has tonight backed calls for a second referendum on independence to be held in keynote vote.MSPs voted - in favour of a Scottish Government motion stating that \"a referendum should be held so that the people of Scotland can decidethey wish to become an independent country.\"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon insisted that the case for independence is \"overwhelming\" as Scotland faces up to Brexitthis week after a majority of people voted Remain in the EU referendum.But pro-union leaders branded the vote a \"ridiculous charade\" and insisted Scots wanted to see their Government focusing on shortcomings in the NHS, education system and crime figures.The vote is largely symbolic as the Scottish Parliament does not have control over the constitution which is reserved to Westminster. Ms Sturgeon sought a transfer of power from the Prime Minister to allow a referendum to be staged in the aftermath of the SNPs landslide victory in last months election north of the border - but this was rejected Boris Johnson.But Ms Sturgeon told MSPs today: \"The democratic case for allowing the people of Scotland to decide whether or not to become an independent country is overwhelming.\"The First Minister will now set out the \"next steps\" in her campaign to stage a referendum on independence this year in a flagship speech on Friday, the same day as the UK formally departs the European Union.Ms Sturgeon branded opposition parties \"anti-democratic\" over their rejection of a referendum.\"It is only ever parties who know their arguments are bust who have to resort to blocking democracy,\" the First Minister added.\"The more contempt they show for the right of Scotland to choose its own future, the more they demonstrate the urgent need for us to become independent as the only way to protect our vital interests.\"Ms Sturgeon insisted she will continue to make the case for independence which would allow Scotland to become \"fairer and more prosperous.\"She added: \"I know not everyone agrees with my position on independence, but Im happy to have that debate and let Scotland decide.\"The vote saw the pro-independence SNP and Greens to back the motion, which was opposed by the pro-union Tories, labour and Liberal Democrats.Tory interim leader Jackson Carlaw claimed the SNP leader knows there willnot be a referendum next year after this was rejected.\"The reason weve been called here today is that she needs to convince the `Yes movement behind her and beyond that something is happening,\" he said.\"I dont see why the majority of the country has to play along with this ridiculous charade.\"He added: \"If only this Government spent the same amount of attention on police and schools as it does on polling and spin we might have safer streets and the best schools in Europe.\"And while the SNP debate among themselves, their favoured route to another referendum, what the timetable should be and whether or not they have the approval of Westminster, most people outside the political bubble just look on in either wearied resignation or abject fury.\"The debate people outside this chamber want to see is about how to drive up education standards and give their children the solid start in le they need and deserve.\"Instead, here we go again, more time devoted to this First Ministers personal obsession at the expense of the countrys real and present priorities.\"Labour leader Richard Leonard accused the SNP leader of \"playing game\" by staging the vote.\"Nobody in this chamber really believes that there will be a referendum this year,\" he said.\"So Members of this Parliament are being asked to vote for what they know to be a hood.

If a situation occurs outside anticipated parameters then electronic control can be useless. Aircraft have landed in the wrong place and landed unexpectedly at Sumburgh. In such circumstance everyone is safer when the situation is within view of a live controller in the airport tower. Such a lookout may also assist aircraft in dficulties, and react tovandalism and other hazardous outbreaks.They should do away with all that glass windows in the control tower as well as all the windows in control towers all over the world as they are clearly not needed. All can be done by looking at a computer screen.Any body with any sense knows there is no requirement to look in the sky, or on the runway or at the weather to see for yourself what is going on.If HIAL are determined to go ahead with this, perhaps there should be a #trial# period, of say at least a minimum of one year.Instead of just installing all the cameras and whatever other gubbins is supposed to make this work, feeding it down the phone line and hoping for the best. Why not pull down the blinds in the tower here and give the local controllers the same monitor screens to look at as they#re intending to use remotely to operate from instead. Meanwhile, also send the data to Inverness, and have them monitor and log on how many occasions and for what duration the data received is either interrupted or of inadequate quality.If the system is as resilient as HIAL claim, they have nothing to worry about or hide, the local controllers will have no complaints about using monitors instead of looking out the window, there will have been no data interruptions to Inverness, and any deterioration in data quality will have been minimal. However,serious shortcomings are evident, a controller only needs to raise the blind to regain actual vision and immediately rescue a situation.Bosses say their communications system has been affected, and that engineers are on the scene working to remedy the situation.# Well, that#s OK then.

No film-maker has documented UK society as forensically as Ken Loach. The desperation that comes from poverty, the bad choices that often seem like the only choices available, are his stock-in-trade. ‘Sorry We Missed You’ is another compelling exemplar of what the man is all about.Marriedparents Ricky and Abbie did all the right things. They followed the rules andworked hard and were on the brink of becoming homeowners when the Northern Rockbuilding society collapsed, taking their dreams with it. Now mired in debt, theyare shunted from one shabby rental to another along with surly son Seb andsmart daughter Liza Jane.Ricky’sskills are no longer in demand. Even though he is a “grafter” who has doneevery job under the sun, proper jobs – with set hours, agreeable conditions, anda decent wage – are like hen’s teeth. So he takes a punt, persuades his we tosell her car, and buys a nearly-new van. them. He doesn’t get a wage – he chargesfees. He is a self-employed knight of the road, free to make as much money ashis speed around Newcastle will allow.Theillusion is soon shattered. His boss at the depot is a bullet-headed bruiserwith all the empathy of a shark. That’s because he himself is trapped in jungleof competition with other depots.

He is in thehot seat this week, speaking to us about his love of music and choosing his top ten tracks - not an easy task by any means.Vincent enjoys a busy family le AND has five children and five grandchildren.He is a finance and property expert, and in his spare time helps out as a quiz master, which keeps him sharp!However music has always been a big part of his le, and he has had an interest in it since he was only a boy.“Music is a passion and something that has followed me since childhood,” explained Vincent.He confesses that his top  favourite songs are constantly changing, so when revealing his list, he decided to focus on a top  that brings back the strongest memories for him throughout his le.At number one is the Beach Boys with ‘God Only knows’.“This was released in  off the incredible Pet Sounds album. “Although I didn’t discover it until my teens, this is an enduring song of beauty.” Number two on his list is ‘The Long and Winding Road’ from The Beatles.He said: “It’s impossible not to have a Beatles track in here. This is just before my time but this song from the  ‘Let it Be’ album is my pick from many contenders.Number three is Love Affair – Everlasting Love. “This is my earliest memory from the  pop classic. “The remake of a ‘ hit for Robert Knight sung by the wonderful Steve Ellis.” The number four spot is reserved for ‘Bridge Over Troubled Water’.“Coming up to its th anniversary, my constant favourite song of all time by Simon and Garfunkelis Bridge Over Troubled Waters.” Number five goes to Sam Cooke with ‘Bring it On Home to Me’“What top  couldn’t contain this amazing singer and composer who contributed to the success of Aretha, Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder and Al Green.” Number six belongs to a Pink Floyd classic.“Probably in the mid ’s my favourite group was Pink Floyd. It was during this period that I began to collect albums.“Dark Side Of The Moon being my first Floyd purchase, however my pick is ‘Wish You Were Here’ off their ‘ album of the same name.”Seventh spot goes to The Eagles. “Sticking my mid ’s periodof music and my infatuation with The Eagles.“I rather quickly acquired their early albums ‘Desperado On The Border One Of These Nights’, however my selection is ‘The Last Resort’ off their th studio album Hotel Calornia.” For eighth spot, Vincent stays with The Eagles.“I’m still in my teenage years and sticking with the Eagles theme, although I’ve moved sideways to select an album I listened to nightly for a couple of years from Jackson Browne.“It was his fourth album and I’ve picked the title track, which is the wonderful ‘The Pretender’. As the list draws to a close, Vincent says: “Running out of room as I juggle with The Four Tops, The Jam, Steely Dan, Stevie, Wonder, Elvis Costello, Al Green, Spencer Davis, The Rolling Stones, George Harrison and OMD.“But I have to stick with my memory theme and at number nine I’ve gone with ‘Supertramp’ which I overplayed at university.“Mainly Crime Of The Century and Breakfast In America and Crisis What Crisis.“My selection is from the latter album and I’ve gone for A Soap Box Opera, it’s orchestral feel just does it to me.”For the last place on his top ten list, Vincent has included a track from the legendary Bruce Springsteen.“I needed Bruce Springsteen in here.“Although how do I pick just one track  Born To Run, The River Nebraska, Born In The USA, The Rising “Again sticking with nostalgia and being a romantic I’ve picked the  ‘Dancing In The Dark’ because it was the year I married Catherine and she’s had to put up with my music ever since!”It’s often hard to think of your favourite  tracks! Vincent admits these “are not necessarily my favourite ever songs as the list changes constantly, but they certainly contain my strongest and fondest memories from down through the years.

While he still enjoys the banter over the counter on a daily basis, hes made himself a local social media personality with his popular posts ranging from the daily headlines to his chatter sparking reminiscences about the confectionery of yesteryear. Editor Des Blackadder sat down with Eugene this week to hear just some of the stories he has to tell after four decades in his Broughshane Street shop.You could say that Eugene Diamond got his start in the newspaper industry and hes been associated with it for most of his adult le.Born in the late s in a long demolished row of mill workers cottages in James Street in Harryville, Eugene is one of nine children - three girls and six boys. Which must have been a tight fit in the James Street days.I was a baby when the family got a move to the houses in the Demesne Estate, just across the Braid River from Harryville. If you ask me I would say it was perfect place to grow up .. we had the ruins of a castle literally at the top of our estate and a forest pretty much on our doorstep!The neighbours were great people and there were lots of children growing up in the Demesne at the time. We used to have great fun making huts up in the woods - which we called the forest - just beside the old Intermediate School site. One of my best memories is making a hut under the pedestrian bridge over the Braid which led to the Ballykeel One estate - we could hear the people walking across above our heads and we thought we were some boys because they didnt know we were there! Innocent days indeed, laughs Eugene.There was no easy pocket money in those days so Eugene had to earn his by delivering newspapers around the sprawling Ballykeel Two estate which had been constructed in the late s.That was my first job in the newspaper business, recalls Eugene. I got the job with the late Tam Johnston who had premises at what used to be known as the Ballykeel One shops. He was a gentleman and his shop will be well remembered by the older generation around Ballykeel and Harryville.Having attended St Patricks High School, Eugenes first real job took him to the Murphys Bottling Plant which was sited just off Railway Street in Harryville.Always on the look out for an extra few quid, Eugene took on a weekend job serving in a clothes shop in the centre of Ballymena.That was me into the retail sector - and it was a great time to be in the clothing trade. A guy called Brian Close owned the shop which was called In-Gear. It was just at the corner of Bryan Street and Church Street - the same building occupied until recently by David Bellingham.Things went well and he offered me the post of manager so I left Murphys for good.It was an era of glam rock, outrageous stars and some outright fashion disasters.Top of the Pops more or less set the style. When the Bay City Rollers hit the heights their tartan striped half mast trousers and skinny college style jumpers were huge sellers especially with the girls.Most guys round Ballymena were pretty much content with a pair of jeans, a gingham shirt and a Shetland wool jumper. Younger lads wore a lot of Wrangler denim known locally as the Wrangler suit of jacket and skinner half mast jeans.I remember the night that David Essex appeared on Top of the Pops wearing a grandad shirt - the next day there was a huge demand for the style, we couldnt get enough of them!Bryan Ferry more or less brought the elegant suit back into fashion when he and Roxy Music made a comeback just after the punk era had faded. Guys all wanted the double-breasted suit with turn-up trousers at the time, he recalls.Eugene chuckles when I ask him about the fashion disasters he encountered.I sold an awful lot of velvet jackets at a time, he recalls. Black, blue, bottle green. They were very popular but I bet the guys who bought them wonder why when they look back.Then there was the parallel suit - I can remember the favourite colour was electric blue. Basically it was a sports coat worn with matching extra width trousers. You could have sailed the Atlantic with themyoud nailed them to a mast!But denim was, without doubt, the major seller in Ballymena and a controversial advert for one particular brand meant that Eugene found himself in the eye of a publicity storm which made headlines far and wide.In those days dferent shops were linked to a certain brand - for example Sam of Sams Boutique had what was effectively the Wrangler dealershipI remember. Edwin Maternaghan was another big name in fashion retailing locally and he had Brutus.By now the name of In-Gear had been changed to Bananas Boutique and we were selling Easy Jeans and a new product called Jesus Jeans.They had a full colour poster of a well-proportioned lady squeezed into a pair of Jesus Jeans with the slogan He who loves me, follows me. We put it up in the window and it was a marmite job - people either loved it or hated it! One religious group based out in the country started a petition about it so we started a counter petition in the shop.It was the time when Ballymena couldnt appear in a news story without the words Bible Belt being added on - around the same time you had the ELO showgrounds story making headlines too.While Eugene enjoyed the fun times at Bananas, he can well remember one of Ballymenas worst days of devastation during the troubles when Church Street was blown to smithereens by an IRA bomb.It was on Friday, May ,  and I remember I was chatting to a friend outside the shop when a police car raced up and an officer told us to clear the area because there was a bomb in a post office van parked in the street. I had got round to Wellington Street and was talking to my good friend journalist Lyle McMullan.I said to him theres a story for you and because there were so many bomb hoaxes in those days he replied onlyit goes off.With that the lower end of Church Street just lted. Ive never felt or seen anything like it before or since. It was a scene of utter devastation which people who lived through it will never forget. One of my vivid memories is how dficult it was to get re-opened - the shop had very distinctive rounded windows and it took a long time to get new glass  made by Pilkingtons. And of course a lot of people will remember the bomb damage sales which took place in the aftermath.When Bananas closed its doors in , Eugene reckoned it was time for a change of direction and when he came across a small shop for rent in Upper Broughshane Street he decided to take the plunge. It was called the First and last because it was the first shop on the way into town and, coversely, the last as you were going out!I had started off delivering papers as a wee boy and now I found myself in behind the counter of a paper shop, he said.”My first rent payment was pound a week.”Forty years later hes still loving the job - despite a horrying early .am start!Sure its only seven days a week, laughs Eugene.In those  years, Eugene has witnessed the high points of the newspaper market when titles like News of the World sold by the barrow load.You couldnt explain to todays generation just how huge the NOTW actually was. People might have bought the quality Sundays but they also bought the NOTW eventhey did tuck it inside the Sunday Times! Of course they were caught out in some abysmal practices and that cant be forgiven but they did break some enormously important stories too. I still have some NOTW publicity material on a side wall of the shop. It may well be the last such material still on display in Britain but I keep it there to remind of just how big the newspaper print industry was at the time.But selling papers was only part of Eugenes role and he was a past master at stirring up some publicity out of all proportion to the size of his tiny shop.Back in the early s I took a punt on getting my own Ballymena Rock made up by a firm in Newry. People thought I had lost the plot because everyone associated rock with seaside resorts and not a town like Ballymena. Thankfully local people loved the idea and I had a great sale on it. Quite a few bars were sent overseas too, he laughs.The ieties of sweets and chocolate bars Eugene has sold down through the years is staggering.In fact, Ive come to the conclusion that people here have the sweetest tooth in the world! If you want to start a debate in Ballymena all you have to do is ask someone what their favourite sweet of all time was.Im a diabetic so I dont do many sweets but I have a good knowledge of wnhat the public wants and to this day people will travel from all over the country to buy a certain brand of toffee or an old style boiled sweet which I stock. Sweets especially are memory jerkers and they have tremendous nostalgia value. If it gets people talking and laughing sure its a good thing. How many times have I heard stories about someone losing a filling to the old Rileys Toffee Rolls  And yet they still came back for more!And does he have a personal favourite Cinnamon Lozenges all the way, he says. As far as I know they are more or less an Irish-only sweet because people come in all the time and take away a few bags full to friends and family in other parts of the world.Talking about local flavours, Eugene says he still has regulars who come specically for the bottled minerals.You would not believe the number of people who still swear by Kali water! And the younger generation will have absolutely no idea wnat Kali Water is but older people will probably be remembering the day they took a drink of it by mistake.If digital technology is our pathway to the future then it is a time machine which works both ways and Eugenes nostalgia posts about old sweets on social media have been delighting the local public for the past few years.As one who was steeped in newspapers I was a latecomer to twitter and facebook but time waits for no man so I decided to embrace it. To be honest Ive had some great fun thanks to social media. People love the old pictures of products and just love to tell you their stories of why they loved a particular brand more than others, says Eugene.The recognition by the National Lottery reflects sales which have raised more than pound. million for good causes down through the years. As one of the last old style newsagents the award is well deserved and theextends its best wishes to Eugene as he embarks on his st year in the trade.

I’ll try where I can to find outanybody nearby owns the property. These places are almost always in a bad state of repair – broken windows, roofs and doors missing. “If it’s somewhere that’s been left open you’re not breaking and entering and you’re not going in to commit a crime so you can’t be prosecuted for that either. Michael likes to tell a story through the items that have been left behind“You’re going in at your own risk. If you can’t get in you write it off and move on. Like I say it’s a grey area so I prefer to keep a low profile and let my pictures speak for themselves.”Michael shares the photographs he takes via his Facebook and Instagram pages entitled Forgotten Places NI: “I respect people’s privacy andI’m ever asked to take any photos down I do it straight away.“I do it for the love of old buildings and their contents, it’s as simple as that. It’s a hobby and I don’t try to make any money from it. “I had been taking photos for my own pleasure to start with but when I showed them to other people they said I needed to share them online because they were so good. That’s why I started up Forgotten Places NI.”An old ambulance found at a derelict propertyMichael’s photographs are posted with a short description of the property but little detail about the location unless it’s somewhere that’s easily recognisable. He said he likes to keep his best finds to himself: “I know a couple of other guys who do this. There’s ones who take photographs and sell them. Mine is purely a hobby.“I’ll get messages from other people asking where I’ve been. I don’t always tell them. It’s dog eat dog. It sounds stupid because there’s nothing to gain from it. It’s one-upmanship to find somewhere that no one  has posted about.Masonic supports Charity work Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"“I don’t get why people would exchange locations. I don’t see the point. It’s finding the places and not knowing what’s going to be inside that does it for me. If you go somewhere that’s already been documented it takes the excitement out of it.”Most of the properties are in a bad state of repairHe said: “What I do I call it documenting. I go in take pictures and write a wee blurb about the place I’ve been. “Sometimes it’s a property that’s got a ‘for sale’ sign at it. You’ll come back in three months and it’s gone, it’s been flattened for redevelopment. It’s sad because when you’re in it you get a real sense of the character of the house, the essence of it.”Michael said he used to have a penchant for ghost hunting, but with his new pursuit he tries to steer clear of the paranormal: “I used to have a bit of a fascination with paranormal investigation, though I think it had more to do with the old buildings. I love walking round old places as you can pick up so much of the history from just walking around. “I used to do a few paranormal investigations so that gave me an appreciation of old buildings, the character of them, just how dferent they are to the ones now.“With Forgotten Places NI I don’t like to spook things up to be scarier than they are. That said, there’s a post I put up just this weekend about a house that I called the House of Ambivilence. It really did have mixed feeling about it. “It looked lovely from the outside, a nice farmhouse. Downstairs had a nice calm atmosphere, but when you went upstairs, honestly, you wanted to get out again, something just didn’t sit. I felt uneasy about the atmosphere. A well lived in room“That’s not generally the case, mostly you get a good feeling about the place because of the items you find in them – kids’ toys, religious pictures, birthday cards. It’s that connection I like.”Michael’s photos are largely focused on derelict properties in NI but he has also ventured into the Republic of Ireland: “Banbridge is a good location to have as a base. I can be in the south in  minutes, quicker than to get to Belfast.“For me it’s trying to find places that haven’t been documented. Everybody’s done Cairndhuand because of its popularity it has been subject to vandalism. Nevertheless it’s a fascinating place. It doesn’t matter what people do to it.” Michael, who has three children, said: “My daughter would come out with me from time to time for a wee spin. We’d trek up country roads to seewe can find any or maybe I’ll have some place marked to check out. “I’ll maybe read around online about an area to seethere’s any stories relating to old mills, old schools. You can look at satellite images before you go. We’ll maybe have eight or  places marked.“These places that I’m going into, people don’t even know they’re out there. There’s hundreds of them. I mark them on my Google Maps – there’s five or six hundred on there to explore.”Michael said he has a bank of photos stored on his phone that he hasn’t shared yet: “If I didn’t go out for another three months I’d have enough to keep posting. “Looking back at some of my older photos, they aren’t great. I think I’ve got better. “In July or August I had , likes on the page, by December it had doubled, now I’m pushing towards ,. “It’s amazing because I’m not doing anything with it, I’m just publishing photos with a small bit of a story, I’m not promoting it or trying to make money from it.”Michael is quick to point out that he is not the first person to find beauty in the Province’s derelict properties. He said Abandonned NI set the benchmark for this sort of photography.Michael said his obsession was a year-round one: “I’ll be out in winter as well as summer. In winter it’s good because the foilage dies back and you’re able to see things that would previously have been hidden. I remember once crawling through a hole and the hedge to find this property that you’d never know was there.” Asked what led him to begin searching for old houses Michael said: “It was my son who got me started, it must have been about three or four years ago. “He showed me this video on YouTube of a guy in America who was exploring this derelict mansion that used to belong to a drug dealer. “It looked fantastic, all the broken windows and doors hanging off and the stuff that was left inside. “My son said we should try to find something like that here. I said, ‘you’re not going to get something on that scale but we’ll have a look’. “What we did was we went to Cairndhu which is near Larne. It’s pretty much where everybody that does this starts. It’s so well known, it’s such a tragic story of how it fell into such disrepair. It’s so vast. As soon as I got in I was hooked.”Cairndhu which was built around  is the former home of Sir Thomas Dixon. It became a convalescent home before it was closed in .Michael said: “There are people on social media who tell me about a derelict house near to them, sometimes it can be just a shell. For me that’s not that interesting. “What I find interesting is somewhere that has personal possessions still inside. It could be furniture, it could be letters, there’s houses you go into and you’d think people had just walked out and left everything still in it.Michael said his passion was driven more by what people had left behind inside the properties rather than the buildings themselves.He commented: “Some people would look at a man in his forties out exploring the country like this as stupid, but for me it’s just that sense of adventure. “It’s good to be out and about. It’s a healthy interest and no one is harmed.“It’s like how you feel when you’re a kid when you go out exploring. “I’m not sure I was even this adventurous as a kid. Maybe I’m making up for it now.“It’s that excitement of the unknown, that danger of not knowing what you’re going to find. That’s why I do it. “It’s those wee unassuming houses that look like nothing and you go in and they’re just filled with stuff. You find out all about the owners, the le that they led.”Discussing some of the remnants of the past he has uncovered, Michael said: “You see so many of the old Singer sewing machines.“There was one house where I found the shell of a Mk II Jag. I found an old ambulance as well.“For me the best finds are the wee personal things like a Valentine’s card or a kid’s note that says ‘mummy has been mean to me and daddy’ – you’re hoping that was just a wee fleeting moment.”He continued: “I try to capture those items as they sit to tell the story of the house. “I take the photos on my phone, maybe I’ll upgrade to a fancy camera someday though photographers will tell you it doesn’t matter what you use, it’s your eye for a photo.“People say to me they can imagine a story around my posts. In my wee blurb I’ll not give the location away unless it’s a well known building. I’ll just describe it a wee bit as best I can and let the pictures tell the story.”Offering suggestions as to why houses end up derelict yet full of possessions, he said: “A lot of the time you’ll get an elderly person who will pass away, they may have nobody to leave it to or they may leave it to the family and they can’t agree what to do with it so it just sits.“Sometimes you get people who buy the property for the adjoining land but don’t knock down the original property.”Some of the items left behindThe scene in an abandonned kitchenBoots no longer made for walkingThis cupboard remains well stockedAn Evening Prayer"},{"url":null,"title":"new ulster hockey kirk cup sponsorship deal to help raise funds for ni children s hospice","story":"Ahead of the final, NI Law Firm of the Year, Millar McCall Wylie, has announced a sponsorship deal with Ulster Hockey to back the competition through to the end of .Chief Operating Officer, Christopher McCandless said: ldquoWe are thrilled to be sponsoring the Kirk Cup, both this season and next.

I want to be in a position to make robust decisions on key issues and I hope Casement will be one of those.”Another key decision for Minister Mallon will be on the York Street Interchange, which was specied as a commitment for the Executive in the New Deal, New Approach document.“There was a procurement process that was challenged. We now have to commence that procurement process again,” she explained.“It certainly is an issue that needs to be addressed. Anyone who travels in that part of the city will know it is hugely congested when it comes to traffic. It is also bad for emissions and the climate which is one of my priorities.“I want to try and progress that but also balance it around connecting people and doing what we can to tackle the climate emergency.“The project is stated as commitment for the Executive but it also features in the New Deal New Approach and I very much welcome that commitment is in there.“Infrastructure is central to the new document and it recogniseswe are serious about transforming lives and ensuring people have real opportunities in areas were people are really struggling then we need to be investing in infrastructure.”As for a possible Glider extending to link South and North Belfast, Nichola saidone of her priorities is “about increasing public transport and people’s access to it”.“I have asked officials for an urgent briefing to see where that is but encouraging people to use public transport and encourage people to walk and cycle are priorities for me.”After three years of no Stormont Executive, Nichola said she is under no illusions to the challenges facing her around Infrastructure, including a huge backlog of work to tackle street lighting, potholes and climate change.“The financial situation that I have inherited is extremely challenging. If you look from , there have been systemic signicant budget cuts to the department.“One of the areas which has been affected has been street lighting and it is something I am very aware of. It is on people’s front doors and gives people a sense of safety and confidence.“If we want to make a dference to people’s lives, we need to address issues like street lighting and pot holes.“I would be hopeful of working with Minister Conor Murphy in the Department for Finance to secure more money to address some of these issues.“Pot holes is a big issue across the North and mainly due to budget cuts to the department. I want to try and address it.“I think we could be doing so much more in Belfast, especially around cycling. We need to encourage and facilitate parents who want to be able to walk their children to school. It will involve safety mechanisms but it is something I want to have a big conversation about with not only my officials but people as well. It is beneficial for the climate but also for people’s physical and mental health.”Asked about many people’s negative attitudes at -hour bus lanes in the city, the Minister stressed she is keeping an open mind but called for better conversations around such controversial issues.“It is about a balancing act. It is about encouraging people to use public transport but in a way to promote local businesses as well.“I have an open-door policy here and I want to engage with everyone. When we all put our heads together, that is when you get to a better place for policies and decision-making.”As for rumours of potential water charges being introduced for residents, she was quick to spell out her position.“The SDLP is opposed to water charges and I have been very quick to say that it won’t be the case under my watch.“I also welcome the fact both the First and Deputy First Minister have come out as well to say it also. I view my role as important in helping struggling families and not to add to their burden.”On a personal level, Nichola is “excited” about her role over the next two years but stressed she will not forget about her local constituents in North Belfast who elected her to Stormont in the first place.“It’s very exciting. It is a very big department. I think a lot of people think it’s just about roads but in actual fact, the department impacts on everyone’s daily lives.“Infrastructure covers things like whether houses can be built or not which is important because we have a housing crisis and other things like waste and water.“When you turn on your water tap, how you travel to and from school and work, MOT to ensure your vehicle is safe, road gritting in winter – all fall within the Department for Infrastructure.“I haven’t forgotten I am here only because the people of North Belfast elected me. I am keen while I take up this role I don’t lose sight of that and continue to be focused also on my constituency and the service I provide.“I will still be a familiar face around North Belfast. The reason that I got into politics is to serve people who put their faith in me.“I won’t lose sight of that and I am very clear that I want to be in the constituency and welcome people to still come to me with their problems and their issues because my job is to try and help them.“I am a parent too and for all parents, it is important to balance your work and your le. I am very lucky I have a supportive family. I look forward to family time and spending time with my children is important but I will do my absolute best in this role.”As for her hopes for her two-year tenure at the helm of Infrastructure, Nichola concluded: “I really want to make the most of these two years. I understand I am coming into a position where we haven’t taken decisions for three years so there is a backlog.“There are huge financial restraints but I really want to make an impact. At the end, I want to look back and ask what did I do to improve people’s lives, better connect people, have a thriving and balanced economy and an improved climate.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"janines wedding day is captured on camera","story":"WELL-known local woman Janine Howard will feature in tonight#s edition of the popular BBCNI documentary series, True North.‘Saving Face’ follows the story of -year-old Janine and her preparations for her marriage to fiancé Matthew Light in October.Janine was just two years old when she was diagnosed with leukaemia.

He has alerted the relevant authorities. The site is just yards from the St Gall’s GAC clubrooms. Belfast City Council waste bags, household fridges, cemetery headstones, construction rubble, wood and huge amounts of other waste have een dumped on to the land and the massive mound is sliding close to the Ballymurphy Stream.The land is known as Milltown Glen and is situated between Maguire’s Garage, Milltown Cemetery and the Bog Meadows.Michael Culbert of St Gall’s GAC said that the issue of land ownership needs to be claried. “There is a gateway that runs from Milltown Cemetery, a lane, and it’s that land that is being dumped on,” he said. “We want a clean environment, we care about the environment. We have all age groups at St Gall’s, from six-year-olds up and have been in this area for approximately  years. We have never seen the like of this. This is a beautul glen, you have the Bog Meadows and here it’s the epitome of fly tipping. This is going on in the heart of West Belfast and it’s not on. We need someone with responsibility to hold whoever is doing this to account for the contamination of this area. We don’t want the river polluted.“It needs to stop and it needs to be cleared up and now our local councillor Steven Corr has taken up this issue.”Ulster Wildle Nature Reserve Officer Deborah McLaughlin told the Andersonstown News that the dumping has got worse since the start of the New Year.“This is an absolute eyesore and I have contact DAERAin relation to it as a lot of the rubbish will end up in the stream,” she said. “We are concerned at the level of fly tipping going on and concerned for health and safety. DAERA are aware of the issue and at the minute we are waiting to hear back from them.”Local Sinn Féin Councillor Steven Corr said the illegal dumping is “destroying the landscape”.“What we are seeing is a localised environmental nightmare,” he went on. “We are only a few feet away from this stream being contaminated. I can’t get my head around why somebody thinks it’s ok to do this. There are lorry loads of rubbish being dumped down a riverbank, killing wildle as it goes. I’ve never seen anything like this, on this scale, in West Belfast. This is fly tipping on an industrial scale, there is industrial waste on the site, glass, headstones. There is confusion as to who is responsible for the land but we would be calling on the Rivers Agency and the NIEAto work with us. Belfast City Council have offered support as their bags are also being dumped on the site. This land needs to be secured as a matter of urgency.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"mclaughlin pays tribute to reds second half hunger","story":"CLIFTONVILLE boss Paddy McLaughlin paid tribute to his side’s second-half effort in their dramatic injury-time County Antrim Shield comeback win against Ballymena. The Reds battled back from Leroy Millar’s early opener in the second half to stage a smash-and-grab - win and McLaughlin felt his side emptied everything into their search for a route back into the game. “I’m delighted,” reflected McLaughlin. “You saw how much effort that players put into the second half and you’ve got to give Ballymena credit – they were good on the break, got their lead with a soft goal we gave away and they defended their lead really well. But you saw how much our boys put into the second half, they emptied their heart on to the pitch and gave us everything.“To get the equaliser, we were happy with that and to go into extra time because I thought the momentum was with us. But to go and win it a minute later was an incredible finish to the game. It’s a sore one for Ballymenayou’re a Ballymena fan or player tonight. I’m sure they’re going back absolutely devastated at losing the game in the th minute. Unfortunately someone had to lose and you don’t want to see young players going off with their heads down but you can’t take it away from our boys. They gave it everything and they probably slightly deserved it in the end.” McLaughlin refused to take any credit for substitutes Thomas Maguire and Ryan Curran popping up with the late goals, but he praised the duo for putting their personal disappointment to one side for the good of the team. “The players on the pitch did the business,” he added. “The players on the pitch worked Ballymena really hard, they tried their best to work opportunities, Ballymena defended brilliantly well, you can’t deny them that, but when the seven minutes went up we looked like we had a goal in us. I was just hoping it wasn’t going to be one of those days where it would be a sad story – could we have done this and should we have done that “I felt we would get one chance in that seven minutes and take it to extra time, I felt we were finishing the game the stronger. For Thomas [Maguire] and Ryan [Curran] to pop up, fair play to them because I’m sure they were disappointed not to be starting the game. They put their own personal disappointment to one side to go and do a job for the team.”Such was the intensity of that seven minutes of madness, McLaughlin was unable to remember his feelings during the late drama but acknowledged the backing of the Red Army and paid tribute to their “incredible” support. “I pulled two hamstrings running on to the pitch celebrating and anything after that, I don’t know what happened,” admits McLaughlin. “Your emotions take over you because you can see what it means to the players and what it means to the supporters. You can’t go through any interview and not talk about the supporters tonight. “That was incredible support that Cltonville brought tonight in the County Antrim Shield on a Tuesday night. I think there is only one team in the ision that has that support and it’s Cltonville. You saw what it meant to the players and supporters from the goals went in.

What do those names mean to you minister ”Mr Murphy said the RHI episode was a “crisis” and in crisis situations all parties pull in a range of party figures to help co-ordinate the response.“That involves people who manage,” he said. “Now some people may draft in other people who are elected representatives, most parties have chief executives, they have people on their executive committees who aren’t elected representatives and you involve people who can manage negotiations as we have managed negotiations since the early s.”He added: “A party management team manages in the middle of a crisis and all of the inidual members of that team try to co-ordinate their activities.“That’s how we do business andthere was a crisis here tomorrow morning I don’t doubt we would draft in a team to try to manage our response to it, which would involve a range of people including elected and non-elected representatives.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  TUV leader Jim Allister claimed the appointment process for special advisers had been ‘watered down’ During his appearance before the committee Mr Murphy revealed that the Assembly budget would be struck before the Chancellor announced his budget on March .He said any additional money flowing to Northern Ireland as a result of Sajid Javid’s budget would then be factored into Stormont’s spending plans.The Finance Minister also reiterated his claim that the UK Government had failed to honour undertakings to finance the New Decade, New Approach powersharing deal.He said only £ million of the £ billion package announced by the Government was new money.He said £ billion was already pledged to the region as part of UK-wide spending commitments and £ million was previously contained in the  confidence and supply deal between the Conservatives and DUP.Mr Murphy said the £ million, which will be spread over five years, was well below what had been discussed during the negotiations ahead of the deal being published.“Those commitments that were given in that document weren’t a Santa Claus wish list,” he said.“They were carefully worked out through a series of discussions between all of the parties, senior officials from the department of finance, the head of the civil service hereand senior officials from the Northern Ireland Office.”Mr Murphy said his officials were continuing to engage with Treasury officials with the aim of securing more funds.The minister expressed frustration that the executive had to hand back £ million to the Treasury ahead of the next financial year at the same time as they were asked for more funding.But he pointed out that the £ million of unused Financial Transactions Capital could not have been erted to the powersharing deal.He said the FTC money could only be accessed in very specic circumstances – namely in the form of a loan to, or equity investment in, a capital project delivered by a private sector organisation.Mr Sterling, who appeared before the Executive Office Committee on Wednesday, was asked whether he expected the Government to provide more money.“You will know the Finance Minister had meetings in London last week, I think he was quite positive about how they went,” he told the committee.“It’s a matter of record that the Department of Finance is doing further work to identy the cost of the ious commitments, the challenges that are facing us and to go back to Treasury with a strong case for additional resources. I wouldn’t want to make a judgment on the likelihood of that leading to signicantly more money but I hope it will.”At the finance committee, TUV leader Jim Allister claimed a revised code for special advisers had “watered down” the appointment process by removing an obligation on ministers to canvas a pool of candidates and outline the reasoning for their choice.“Do you think that’s meeting the expectations of the public in terms of transparency ” he said.Mr Murphy said the priority was strengthening the code in respect of how special advisers operated when in post, not how they are appointed.“The question is are we more concerned with how they get there or what they do when they are there,” said the minister."},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic alerts latest updates","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthsundayleEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

place on a free trade agreement over an -month transition period.The Prime Minister has stated he will not contemplate an extension beyond the end of the year.There have been concerns expressed by Irish ministers around the tight timeframe to reach an agreement.Because of that timeline the UK effectively decided to put themselves in a straitjacket in terms of timeSimon CoveneyFollowing a Cabinet briefing on Wednesday morning, Mr Coveney said: “I think it is accepted now, and certainly I agree with this, that the UK are very unlikely to seek an extension of the transition period by mid-summer which is when they would have to do it.“Because of that timeline the UK effectively decided to put themselves in a straitjacket in terms of time.“The approach to the negotiations from the European Union will be tailored to that time and that will force choices, but it will also force a very intense negotiation very quickly.“The second point is that we are now moving very quickly in terms of the next stage of Brexit and we have been preparing for that for quite some time.”Mr Coveney went on to say that after the UK leaves the EU, discussions around the future will begin straight away.On Monday, the European Commission will publish their draft negotiating mandate which is set to be approved by EU leaders next month.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  A former smuggling route covering both sides of the Irish border Mr Coveney added: “I think what will become very clear is that we will have to make some very dficult choices before the summer and what I mean by that is, the European Union has already indicated that there is no way that a full future relationship agreement that involves free trade agreements can be completed by the end of the year, there was no chance.”The Irish electorate will go to the polls on February  and it is expected that Fine Gael will face a huge battle to remain the governing party.Mr Coveney added: “We are going to have a very demanding negotiation on fishing and so many other areas too, that links to how a future relationship will work from a commercial perspective, from a political perspective, from a data perspective, from a legal perspective and a transport perspective.“So I ask you the question and the public the question, who do you trust to manage all of that “Because it’s coming out, it’s like a freight train

The Western Trust has revealed that its final business case will be handed over to the Department of Healthfor approval in February. Last February, the Trust entered an “initial” twelve-month agreement with site owner the Department for Communitiesto enable the Trust to further develop the proposal of locating a new Cityside Health and Care Centre at Fort George. During that time no further marketing of Fort George took place. The DfC has however said that once it receives the complete business case it will consider the best way to “maximise” the site’s potential. googletag.cmd.push A Western Trust spokesperson commented: “The Western Health and Social Care Trust can confirm that as part of the business case development process for the provision of a major city side health and care centre, it has been engaged in the identication of a site suitable for the purposes of bringing together GP and associated healthcare services in an integrated model. “Fort George is likely to be the recommended site deemed suitable for future service provision within the city. “The Trust and Department for Communities have entered into a joint Memorandum of Understanding allowing the Trust to progress the completion of the business case and to secure the necessary Departmental approvals. googletag.cmd.push  The development of a Cityside hub is anticipated to bring up to  whole time equivalent permanent jobs, new and relocated, which will deliver mostly nursing, social work, allied health professional and administrative roles. It would enable both Trust and GP Medical Practices to work together to further expand and enhance local health and social care services currently spread across the city. If delivered, the hub is expected to support people in improving their health and well-being, particularly around the areas of physical activity, nutrition, smoking cessation, alcohol misuse and mental health. Once established, it would optimise the potential of communities to become more active in improving their own health and well-being. ‘No timescale’ At a Derry City  Strabane District Council meeting in November , a new project was put on the table for a poundm - poundm multi-purpose development at the Fort George site. This would comprise of a “world-class” Maritime and Emigration Museum, -star hotel, public realm development, office space incorporating a technology and research  development hub, plus two residential blocks with car parking at the former army base. Speaking at that meeting, well-known Derry businessman, Garvan O’Doherty said projects brought forward by the city lacked ambition and with central government support the museum could be the fourth major tourism pillar in Northern Ireland alongside Titanic Belfast, The Giants Causeway and the Wild Atlantic Way. He felt the health hub could be located at a dferent site, adding, it is imperative to look after both the economy and people of the city. A Department for Communities spokesperson explained that it is awaiting the Western Trust’s final business case before considering the best way forward for the site but could not put a timescale on that process. He said: “The Department is awaiting receipt of the final Business Case from the Western Health and Social Care Trust but officials have been regularly engaging with the Trust and signicant progress has been made. “Once the final Business Case has been received, consideration will have to be given to the optimum way to develop Fort George. At this stage we do not have a timescale for when that decision will be made.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

They faded and after a briefthey disappeared again. But now they are back, building from the foundations up. Club PRO Paddy McCann spoke to Michael McMullan, to trace their steps back into the world of club hurling. As a new decade turned earlier this month, Slaughtneil took the aristocrats of club hurling – Ballyhale Shamrocks – to the pin of their collar. Following the dramatic conclusion to an equally epic encounter, the Emmets narrowly missed out on qualication for Sundays All-Ireland final. But it was the subplot that struck an equally loud chord across Ulster. googletag.cmd.push After the game, Ballyhales players and their iconic manager Henry Shefflin were swamped by fans in search of autographs and selfies. A genuine outpouring of passion mixed with adoration. The glee etched across youngsters faces spoke volumes. In the recent past, its, perhaps, the biggest sign that the pockets of hurling across Ulster are alive and well. Bursting to get out. Witnessing it first hand was inspiring. Last November , another Kilkenny icon was in Ulster. It was a dferent brief entirely. Martin Fogarty coached many of the hurlings greatest. But in his role as hurlings National Development Manager, he was up in Drummullan to present medals to the underage players of St Finbarrs hurling club. googletag.cmd.push Two years after theirfrom the hurling wilderness, the clubs U team won the Ulster shield. They now unveil their plans for registration evenings later this month, giving Irelands national game another opportunity to spread its wings. And in the north of the county, Claudy are putting their roots down in search of another success story. For St Finbarrs, they have a heritage. In the late s hurling was played in the Loup area before the club was formed around the turn of the s. Of the three county finals they competed in the took the title in  and . They had quality players in brothers Liam and Colm Hinphey. John James McPeake, Sean and Francie Smith, M and Brian Mitchell. Patsy Donnelly. Joe McKee. S McGrogan. Henry McGlone. They also had Cork man Pat Russell in their ranks, who hailed from a club of the same name on Leeside. After the initial burst, St Finbarrs disappeared. It reformed later for a short time in the early eighties but ran out of steam before the newest dawn, when the wheels were set in motion for the club as it currently exists. Kilkenny man Brian Waldron, from Freshford, married Sheila Devlin and in recent years they settled in her native Loup. Their sons Odraacuten, Cian and Naoise hurled with Cuala and won Nicky Rackard Cup medals with Derry two years ago.   In Meadowbank, before we stopped before Christmas, we had two of the big pitches filled and two of the small pitches at the back. Paddy McCann  Brian, now the St Finbarrs Chairman, has hurling in his blood. He was involved with Kilkenny minors in the early noughties and, since histo Derry, has been coaching in seven of the local schools in the Loup area...spreading the gospel. The interest morphed into an informal meeting in January , that included Derrys Regional Hurling Development Officer Kevin Hinphey and Dunloy native Seamus Kane, who now resides in Loup. Kevins father Liam was part of the  St Finbarrs winning team. “Brian went around the local schools coaching and developed an appetite for hurling,” recalls St Finbarrs PRO Paddy McCann, one of the six at that initial meeting. “There was a group of us there at the start. Niall Lagan was there as well, his father also played on the  St Finbarrs team.” And so it began. Following Ogra Colmcilles withdrawal from the Derry junior league, they reached out to St Finbarrs, offering their premises base to help them build an identity. They are indebted to Ogra and to St Patricks PS Loup, where they host meetings. “The first night at Drummullan, it was like the build it and they will come sort of idea,” explains McCann of the new dawn in May . “We didnt really know who was going to turn up and when they called itthere was the guts of  youngsters...it was fantastic.” Now the club has over  members with  playing junior members. The players come from a iety of parishes in the South Derry and Loughshore area. The formation of the club has ensured access to hurling for all children in the area. It began with Us and earlier this month that cohort, mainly still Us, fielded the clubs first U team. “We would be expecting to field at U, U and at the younger ages. In Meadowbank, before we stopped before Christmas, we had two of the big pitches filled and two of the small pitches at the back,” McCann adds. “That would have been from Us, Us, Us, Us and down to Us.” Their growth has been helped by Brian Waldrons brainchild, the St Finbarrs Cup. A tournament played between the schools within their catchment area. Some field two teams, with eight or nine players in each. Its all about participation. “It is part of Brians work going around the schools, he organises it in Meadowbank and all the schools he was at would come in and play,” McCann explains. “It feeds into all the schools and for anyone showing promise and an interest, we can get them to play for St Finbarrs.” The Us and Us have had the privilege of playing at Croke Park in Go Games for the last two years. The youngsters are competing well and are going from strength to strength. The club achieved their first on field victory in October , when they won the Ulster U Regional Shield played against very competitive Letterkenny and Slaughtneil sides at Dungivens Kevin Lynch Park. At the presentation night, Martin Fogarty offered advice to carry on into this season, as they strive to grow. He emphasised the pride the club should take in passing on skills to the children and promoting hurling in the area. They had a blueprint for others to tap in to. “He spoke well about the club and he said he had heard about us,” McCann recalls of Fogartys address on the night. “Other clubs he goes to, that are struggling for numbers with one or two people doing the work and getting burned out, he was using us an example for other clubs.” Already this year, St Finbarr’s has made further strides with entry in the U North West indoor league. They have also entered teams into the U U Tain Oacuteg regional leagues run by Croke Park, as well as U league and Feacuteile. In their recent historic debut at U level, they gave a good account of themselves in a blitz that included Tyrone clubs Naomh Colmcille, Fintona, Belnaleck of Fermanagh and Dungloe. All with a  back-boned by Us. In any club, the people are the real assets. St Finbarrs are no dferent. Kevin Hinphey and Colm Dillon helped steer the coaching in the early days. The club described the input as immense but now the aim is to become self-sufficient. “Seamusand Brianare great for bringing people in. At our AGM, there were people volunteering that never played hurling to get doing coaching courses in it. “There is a lot of good will and parents are really buying into it. Some of the people are not really from GAA backgrounds.” It ensures that the future looks bright and their door is open to all new coaches and players, of all abilities. Everyone is welcome and there is always something to aspire to. Two years ago, three of the clubs U players represented Derry at half-time in their game with Down in the Christy Ring Cup. “They are holding their own. You would know they have started a few years later than other clubs but their skill levels are coming up,” McCann explains of how their oldest underage stars have progressed.   Other clubs he goes to, that are struggling for numbers with one or two people doing the work and getting burned out, he was using us an example. Paddy McCann  “There are a couple of guys and their skill levels are right up there with what other clubs have. We just dont have enough yet to be competing across the team but I can see them moving right up.” A club with championship tradition dating back to the s is back on the map. With continued efforts and promotion, maintaining their drive towards U and adult hurling is a target. As well as getting players through to Derrys Celtic Challenge team...and further. It would signy payback on a bigger scale and a chance for their club to grow further. For now, the Gaels in this corner of the county will continue to raise the bar.

He was always destined for success. His mother Catriona is an Ulster and All-Ireland champions camogie player, before moving into coaching where titles also streamed in her direction. Garys father Ronnie and grandfather George are steeped in motorbikes. On a dferent tangent, his sister Lara is both a champion gymnast and trampolinist. Sport simply runs in the family. For the  year-old St Patricks Maghera pupil, he has excelled in the world of motorsport despite only going into his third season in the saddle. Gary has competed on the Irish minibike circuit since its inception in , finishing second in the junior class, before graduating to the senior ranks last season. googletag.cmd.push In recent weeks, he was awarded the prestigious David Wood scholarship which the Motorcycle Union of Ireland awards to its most promising rider. It was won for the first time in  by Lee Johnston, winner of the last seasons Junior Isle of Man TT winner. He also took on the role of IMC Youth Ambassador – to act as a role-model for our younger members. “During this time Gary has shown maturity beyond his years, building up a great rapport with our Junior Members and his peers,” commented IMC Chairman Mark Boyd. “In addition to his abilities as a competitor, his positive attitude in success or defeat coupled with the clear commitment shown by both Gary and his family to his budding racing career bode well for his future. googletag.cmd.push “As Chairman of The Irish Minibike Championship I am privileged to recommend Gary for inclusion in the  BTC and wish him every success with the selection process.” His mothers reluctance stalled Garys career until just before his th birthday but she is now fully behind him since his early short circuit days. In , he progressed to the IMC Senior Open and Ulster Superbike Moto Championship. “Last year he was doing pit bikes with young kids but this year he went on to the short circuits and he was racing against adults, when he won the Moto championship,” Catriona said. “Now he is hoping to go to the British Superbikes on a Moto as well.” “As a rookie in the USBK Moto Championship, against some very experienced and older riders I came away with the title USBK Moto Champion ,” Gary outlined in his CV, which has been compiled with the view to attracting sponsorship for this season and a shot at the Moto class. The costings for next season could amount to over poundk, including a pound, Honda NSFR bike, entry fees and travel. “At the end of next year my aim is to make a wildcard into the Spanish Championship with my future dream to ride in the World Championships,” Gary added. He grew up watching and supporting both his father and grandfather in action on both the circuits and roads. It was no surprise to see him emerge from their shadows. His family helped him raise the funds for a trip to Donnington to compete in a round of the British Superbikes to help gather invaluable experience and a taste of what  could bring. MCUI Trainer and respected journalist and photographer Baylon McCaughey was full of praise for Gary. “Despite the cold and wet weather Gary, despite having only one season of tarmac racing under his belt in Pit Bike Racing, showed great enthusiasm and certainly was not afraid to ask questions,” he said. “After each session, he would enquire,he was doing the correct thing or not, and listened to advice given. “With plans to compete in the British Championships, I know this lad has the correct approach to his racing, his manners off the track, and competitiveness on the track, will certainly help him to achieve his goals.” Talent, with an attitude to match. Perhaps the greatest combination. If the next two years follow his meteoric rise since , Gary Scott is destined for greatness. Remember the name.

The Convent, winners in , failed to win a game in the group stages but a late pressure kick from Ronan McKenna forced Wednesdays tie to extra-time. Seconds before the Ballinascreen mans dramatic equaliser, Monaghan had a chance to win the game. Leading by a point, Tiernan Kierans opted to go for goal but goalkeeper Peter McKinneys wonder save kept Magherafelt in the the game. googletag.cmd.push It was the last of three saves, all at vital times, from the Kilrea stopper in a man of the match performance. In injury time, Magherafelt went on to control the game. Conhuir Johnston put them ahead for the first time since the th minute, followed by a McKenna free to open a two point gap that St Macartans couldnt break.After unselfish work from Dan Higgins, he put substitute Callum Ormsby in for a goal to clinch game. Lochlainn Power was now back at full-forward and the Sem reverted back to their long ball approach but with Johnny McErlain back as sweeper and Matthew McNeill defending strongly, Magherafelt prevailed to a meeting with St Patricks Dungannon, who had scouts in the stand watching. googletag.cmd.push Monaghan had the slight breeze early in the game and went route one but found Magherafelts defence dficult to crack. Two Niall McKenna points put the home side ahead before Eunan McElhennons sliced effort eased Magherafelt into the game. Conor Mallon, who handled a lot of ball over the match, levelled before a Dan Higgins goal put Magherafelt into a th minute lead. Monaghan finished the half with a flourish and led - to - at the break, thanks to points from McKenna, Michael Hamill and Dylan Balantine. St Marys rode their luck and needed a save from McKinneys trailing leg to prevent a certain Niall McKenna goal. Magherafelt battled well in the second-half, with Aidan McCloskey and sweeper Eoin McEvoy dictating the game. Points from Kevin McNicholl and Aidan McCloskey levelled the game in the th minute, - to - Conor McCooey and Michael Hamill put the Farney side back into the lead and they looked home and dry. But Magherafelt refused to budge. Aidan McCluskey cut the gap to a single point before McKinneys wonder save and McKennas late free brought the game to extra-time. The Magherafelt control was the hallmark of the additional  minutes before Ormsby hammered to the roof of the net to seal the deal.

The Convent, winners in , failed to win a game in the group stages but a late pressure kick from Ronan McKenna forced Wednesdays tie to extra-time. Seconds before the Ballinascreen mans dramatic equaliser, Monaghan had a chance to win the game. Leading by a point, Tiernan Kierans opted to go for goal but goalkeeper Peter McKinneys wonder save kept Magherafelt in the the game. googletag.cmd.push It was the last of three saves, all at vital times, from the Kilrea stopper in a man of the match performance. In injury time, Magherafelt went on to control the game. Conhuir Johnston put them ahead for the first time since the th minute, followed by a McKenna free to open a two point gap that St Macartans couldnt break.After unselfish work from Dan Higgins, he put substitute Callum Ormsby in for a goal to clinch game. Lochlainn Power was now back at full-forward and the Sem reverted back to their long ball approach but with Johnny McErlain back as sweeper and Matthew McNeill defending strongly, Magherafelt prevailed to a meeting with St Patricks Dungannon, who had scouts in the stand watching. googletag.cmd.push Monaghan had the slight breeze early in the game and went route one but found Magherafelts defence dficult to crack. Two Niall McKenna points put the home side ahead before Eunan McElhennons sliced effort eased Magherafelt into the game. Conor Mallon, who handled a lot of ball over the match, levelled before a Dan Higgins goal put Magherafelt into a th minute lead. Monaghan finished the half with a flourish and led - to - at the break, thanks to points from McKenna, Michael Hamill and Dylan Balantine. St Marys rode their luck and needed a save from McKinneys trailing leg to prevent a certain Niall McKenna goal. Magherafelt battled well in the second-half, with Aidan McCloskey and sweeper Eoin McEvoy dictating the game. Points from Kevin McNicholl and Aidan McCloskey levelled the game in the th minute, - to - Conor McCooey and Michael Hamill put the Farney side back into the lead and they looked home and dry. But Magherafelt refused to budge. Aidan McCluskey cut the gap to a single point before McKinneys wonder save and McKennas late free brought the game to extra-time. The Magherafelt control was the hallmark of the additional  minutes before Ormsby hammered to the roof of the net to seal the deal.

Following the meeting with representatives the utility said the main towns of Cookstown, Dungannon and Magherafelt have been identied as a focus for population and economic growth to promote sustainable development and to support the efficient use of public services, facilities and infrastructure.But NI Water has warned that it can only spend within its annual public expenditure budget and plans for water and wastewater can only happenthey are funded.Steve Blockwell, Head of Investment at NI Water said:“Since the presentation was given to Mid Ulster Council, I would like to welcome the New Decade, New Approach Deal and the Executive’s commitment to invest urgently in wastewater infrastructure which is at or nearing capacity in many places across Northern Ireland, including Belfast. “Providing safe, clean, drinking water supplied to houses and business is always the top priority for NI Water. While we have been able to maintain safe clean drinking water, the huge constraints on our capital budget has meant that Wastewater issues have largely been left unaddressed as highlighted in our PC Business Plan our PC business planning process has identied ninety-nine areas where new housing and businesses may be unable to get connected to our sewerage system throughout the province.”“The funding made available in PCby NI Government to date for water and wastewater infrastructure is not keeping pace with what Northern Ireland needs.“Signicant investment is needed for wastewater and water infrastructure. NI Water knows Northern Ireland’s growth ambitions, we know what needs done and we have the plan and the skills to deliver it. However,funding continues at current levels there will be signicant constraints on economic growth, damage to the environment and risk to people’s health.” googletag.cmd.pushIf you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I’m now working full time with Errigal and it’s been great.”From, - February, a series of events are being held across the Derry City and Strabane District Council area promoting the opportunities available for apprentices locally.North West Regional College will host two events to celebrate Apprenticeship Week.The Construction Futures event will be held at the Student Zone at Strand Road campus on Tuesday, February  from - p.m. An information evening on Higher Level Apprenticeships , will be held at the Strand Road campus the following nightat .pm.

A lot of people would have seen him on Wednesday night, but the work was done well before that and it didnt matter how he did, because we wanted to bring him to the club, he said.Hes a proven player, a proven number nine, that has played at a very high level and from our point of view as staff we think hell only enhance the group moving forward,” he stated.Centre-forwards are like hens teeth at the minute, they are very dficult to get no matter what level you are at. “There are absolutely none in Ireland that are at Tims level.For us we had to make sure that we brought a number nine to the club that was a top level player and we are delighted today because we feel that we have done that by bringing in a top, top level player and I think moving forward Tim will be a fantastic signing for us.”Devine admitted that the club had been working hard to get the deal for Nilsson over the line, and the manager was at pains to keep the strikers name out of the headlines to avoid other clubs becoming aware of their interest.We have been looking at Tim for about four weeks but things only started moving about  days ago,” he explained. “First of all, when these things happen, you have to find outthe willingness from the player is there. Thankfully it was. “You then have to deal with dferent types of people in terms of trying to make the deal work and when we showed him about, he was very positive.We were very, very keen to get him to the football club and we had to do our business kind of quietly becauseTim Nilsen was out there in terms being available I think there would have been a lot of other clubs other than Derry City also tracking his movement, so thankfully we got our business done really quickly.” googletag.cmd.push Next appearanceNilsson gave City fans a glimpse of what he will bring on Wednesday past and is sure to be involved against Institute, with the striker keen to get minutes under his belt.He wanted to take part in half the game,” Devine stated. “It was probably more so for him to see the way that we went about our business and the style of players we have, but it was irrelevant whether his performance was of a good level, because for us it was all about getting him into the number nine jersey and thankfully hes in it now and hopefully hell stay in it for a long time. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Greg Hutley also came in at out-half and took on the kicking duties.The home side started superbly, snapping into tackles and looking dangerous with ball in hand. Aaron Cairns continued his excellent try-scoring form, running a superb line and cutting through under the posts for Hutley to convert.Ryan Wilson then finished a superb counter attack led by Hutley and full back Paddy Wright to take the locals into a - lead after  minutes and it looked like a very comfortable victory was on the cards.However, Dungannon had clearly not read theand upped their physicality, carrying hard from deep and attacking the fringes of the rucks.Passive Ballynahinch defence allowed their hooker to cruise in untouched under the posts after taking a fine offload from his second row.Worse was to come when more missed tackles sent Dungannon into the break with a - lead following a second converted try.Ballynahinch visibly upped the tempo in the third quarter and put the game to bed with an -point scoring burst.They went through the phases in the Dungannon  and Bradley Luney capped a fine display by bursting through for a score to take his side into the lead.Two Hutley penalties followed as Dungannon infringed under severe pressure to make the score - and when replacement winger Ronan Patterson ran a beautul line to score in the opposite corner Ballynahinch looked home and dry at -.They allowed Dungannon a glimpse of a comeback by taking their foot off the pedal again and Dungannon scored a breakout try and conversion to take them within nine points, but the result was never in question.The Ballynahinch faithful can look forward to another trip to Kingspan for the final against familiar foes City of Armagh on Friday, March .Ballynahinch : Ben Cullen, Conor Piper, Jonny Blair, Bradley Luney, John Donnan, Tom Martin, Olly Loughead, Callum Irvine, Rhys OrsquoDonnell, Greg Hutley, Aaron Cairns, Ryan Wilson, Robin Harte, George Pringle, Paddy Wright, David Cooper, Nacho Caldera, Kelvin Hamilton, Ronan Patterson, Ben McMullan.Ballynahinch Dungannon SENIOR CUP SEMI-FINAL.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020 Outstanding.jpg","title":"‘Outstanding’ school report for Cumran  ","story":"CUMRAN Primary School in Clough has received top marks in its latest inspection report.The school was deemed to be ldquooutstanding in the three areas that the Education and Training Inspectorate assess for mdash outcomes for learners, quality of provision and leadership.The schoolrsquos social communication unit mdash which educates  children on the Autism spectrum who have a iety of needs mdash was also rated as outstanding.The school currently has  pupils with  of them on the Special Educational Needsregister.Eight of the pupils have statements of educational need.The inspection report praised the pupils in its key findings for their achievements and learning and said: ldquoIn this school, the children lead the learning. The children work effectively and take personal responsibility for working collaboratively with their peers.ldquoThey seek and respect fully the views and opinions of each other, and take great pride in sharing their learning with others.The report also said that the childrenrsquos behaviour was ldquoexemplary and described the outcomes for children in literary, numeracy and ICT and the schoolrsquos leadership as ldquooutstanding.Cumran PS was also praised for achieving ICT awards, which included the Digital School of Distinction Award, the Capital Excellence Award and two National Association of Advisors for Computers in Education.It has also been accredited as a lsquoThinking Schoolrsquo, a rights respecting school at silver level and an ambassador Eco School, holding an eighth green flag.School principal, Mrs Rhonda Moles, said she and the staff were delighted.ldquoCumran has yet again achieved the lsquooutstandingrsquo category in every area mdash the quality of education provided,quality of the childrenrsquos achievements and standards, the provision for learning, leadership and management and pastoral care.Mrs Moles said Cumran Primary is committed to providing the best possible education for children, with the inspection report recognising that the children are at the heart of all decision making in school and that they lead the learning.She added: ldquoThis is a great affirmation for all in the school community and identies Cumran as being at the forefront of primary education.ldquoI would like to thank the hard working and committed staff, the supportive governors and parents and highly motivated children for making our school the success it is.Cumran opened as a new school in May  following the amalgamation of Clough and Downshire Primary Schools..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020 Charity.jpg","title":"Charity encouraging children to walk or take bike to school  ","story":"A LOCAL politician is encouraging more children to walk or cycle to school mdashit is safe to do so.Rowallane politician Billy Walker is supportive of the drive by Sustrans to reduce the number of children travelling to school by car, but warns that for many who attend primary schools in rural areas especially, walking or cycling to school could place them in danger.Sustrans mdash which is a walking and cycling charity mdash said recent figures published by the Department for Infrastructure show that increasing numbers of children travel to school by car.Anne Madden from Sustrans described the increasing number as ldquotruly woeful and said the fact that the number of primary children being driven to school has risen from % to % since   shows ldquosociety has a lot more to do.She says it is known from surveys that road safety is the main reason why parents drive their children to school, but the charity official said it is these parents who are adding to congestion and air pollution at the school gates.Ms Madden says there needs to be improvements in infrastructure such as footpaths and traffic crossings to enable more active travel.The latest government figures have revealed that as many as % of primary school pupils who are being driven to school live less than a mile away, which Ms Madden describes as a ldquovery walkable distance.She added: ldquoWalking or cycling to school is a simple way of incorporating more exercise into a childrsquos daily routine. This can help tackle both the obesity epidemic and improve childrenrsquos overall health and well-being.The Active School Travelprogramme which Sustrans delivers has successfully increased the number of pupils walking, cycling and scooting to school, with the charity explaining that it takes on  new schools each year.However, it says the programme needs to expand and provide more long-term support to school communities in order to turn around these statistics.In the   period, the number of children walking, cycling and scooting to school in the AST programme increased from % to % while, at the same time, the number of pupils being driven to school fell from % to %.Cllr Walker says he is ldquoall for getting more children to walk to school, but explained that in some parts of Down District, this simply isnrsquot possible as in many rural areas there are no footpaths. In addition, he said there are no dedicated cycle paths.ldquoI fully support the work of Sustrans and have worked with the charity on a number of schemes in my own area, he revealed.ldquoI recognise that the more children who walk to school, the less congestion there will be and fewer cars sitting in traffic queues pumping dangerous fumes into the atmosphere.Cllr Walker said mph zones have been introduced outside some local schools, calling for such schemes to be rolled out across all council areas.He added: ldquoWith the emphasis now on people taking more responsibility for their own health and getting fitter, encouraging children to walk to school when it is safe to do so will sew the seed of keeping healthy from an early age and this will stay with them for the rest of their lives..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020 Delay.jpg","title":"Delay for development meeting on Irish Street  ","story":"AN event designed to provide business owners in Downpatrick with an input into plans to redevelop the former Irish Street police station site and a number of adjacent empty buildings has been delayed.Originally scheduled to take place before Christmas the meeting was delayed in the wake of the snap Westminster election, with hopes that it would go ahead this month.Now it has emerged that it could be February or March before what is being viewed as one of the most signicant town centre regeneration meetings ever to take place in the district takes place.A number of Downpatrick councillors were recently given the opportunity to view the inside of the former police base and the expansive grounds to the rear which will feature heavily in the proposed redevelopment scheme.The old police base enjoys protected status and therefore cannot be razed to the ground to pave the way for any new development. As a result, innovative ways will have to be found to include the building in the new retail scheme which could also include new housing.There are also some who believe that a multi-storey car park mdash with retail outlets on the ground floor mdash should be considered in the new development and built on top of the existing Irish Street car park footprint.Newry, Mourne and Down Council officials have this week reaffirmed their commitment to work with the Downpatrick business community, residents and other stakeholders on the redevelopment of the Irish Street site, with the project being spearheaded by the Department of Communities.Council officials say that working alongside local people on the redevelopment proposal will provide consultants charged with coming up with a design on the way forward with an understanding of what local people would like to see and what would work at this particular site.Officials insist that there is little point developing options which they think might work, with the forthcoming meeting with all stakeholders designed to secure by-in from them and develop a project that is likely to succeed.The planned meeting with all stakeholders will help shape a development brief inviting potential developers to come forward to transform the site and kick-start a signicant town centre economic regeneration initiative.In addition, the development brief will outline what all those involved in the process would like to see happen in Irish Street to maximise the potential of every square inch of available space.Leading High Street brands including Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains have expressed an interest in the location which is the last large scale development site remaining in Downpatrick town centre.It is over two years since it was revealed that the former police station site had been earmarked for a major economic regeneration initiative, with local council officials confirming recently that ious pockets of land which make-up the Irish Street site have now been purchased.Local councillor Dermot Curran said the recent visit to the proposed Irish Street development site provided an insight into its size and development potential.He is backing the move to involve businesses and residents in helping shape the development brief for the site and hopes that the planned meeting at which they will be asked for their input can take place soon.ldquoWhat we are talking about is the biggest ever investment in Downpatrick town centre. We have to get this right as it has the potential to not only regenerate Irish Street, but the wider town centre by attracting increased footfall which will boost existing businesses, many of them locally owned, said Cllr Curran.ldquoIt is clear that having viewed the Irish Street site that it offers massive potential and can transform Downpatrick town centre and provide a major boost for existing businesses.Cllr Curran said he has spoken to a number of business people who are keen to have the date of the meeting with consultants confirmed so they can attend to help play their part in shaping the future development of a prominent town centre site.He added: ldquoPeople want to see progress on this crucially important development. Redeveloping the expansive Irish Street site can act as a catalyst for additional town centre investment and will provide a boost for existing businesses..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020 Down.jpg","title":"Down senior footballers face tough opener  ","story":"DOWNrsquoS senior footballers head for Clonmel on Sunday more in hope than optimism to open their Division  Allianz League campaign against Tipperary.Paddy Tallyrsquos charges face a tough opening game as the Premier County, who were relegated from Division  last season, will be like a wounded animal and determined to bounce back into the leaguersquos second tier.The sides met last June at Pairc Esler when Down won an All-Ireland Qualier - to -. Pat Havern, Corey Quinn and Donal OrsquoHare did most of the scoring that day, but Tipperary will be a dferent proposition at the weekend.New Tipp manager David Power, who famously led the county minors to an All-Ireland title in , has an abundance of talent at his disposal, but he will have to without star player Michael Quinlivan.The Clonmel Commercials man has decided to go travelling for a year and his absence is a huge loss to Tipperaryrsquos attack and the countyrsquos bid to regain their status in the top flight ahead of next seasonrsquos championship changes.Promotion is also a must for Down as well, as they too have huge aspirations of avoiding competing in the All-Ireland second tier competition.Down have just emerged from an indferent McKenna Cup campaign.Wins over Fermanagh and Antrim were cast aside when Tallyrsquos team were given a reality check by Tyrone in the semi-finals.Mickey Hartersquos experimental side simply over-powered Down and had too much physicality all over the park.Hopefully, Down will have learned from that game, but second guessing Tallyrsquos team selection ahead of Sunday is a dficult job.Definitely missing Sundayrsquos game will be vice-captain Caolan Mooney, the one player in the camp who has the ability to stand out from the rest. His unavailability through injury is a severe blow to Tallyrsquos aspirationsJohn OrsquoHare and Marc Hynes shared the goalkeeping duties in the two McKenna Cup games, but Castlewellanrsquos Rory Burns is still considered as the county number one.Downpatrickrsquos Gerard Collins, Burrenrsquos Kevin McKernan and Warrenpointrsquos Ryan McAleenan could well man the full back berths with Annaclonersquos Brendan McArdle also in the frame.A knee injury for Saulrsquos Pierce Laverty, picked up against Tyrone, could rule him out of action, but Daniel Guinness could well fill in for him at right half back. Captain Darren OrsquoHagan seems to be favourite to start at centre half back with a mixture of Ross Carr, McArdle, Mayobridgersquos Shane Annett and Guinness flanking him.Midfield has been a bit of a problem for Down, but Loughinislandrsquos Jonny Flynn should start in this sector with either Liatroimrsquos Liam Middleton, Castlewellanrsquos Sean Dornan, Carryduffrsquos Owen McCabe or Longstonersquos Conor Poland most likely to get the nod.The set of six forwards will come from Poland, McCabe, Corey Quinn, Barry OrsquoHagan, Conor Maginn, Pat Havern, Donal OrsquoHare, Brendan Gallen, Ciaran Harney, Liam Kerr and Ross McGarry.Regardless of who Tally starts with, Tipperary will be no pushovers and now under Powerrsquos management, they will be keen to impress.Michael OrsquoReilly, Liam Fahey, Bill Maher, Robbie Kiely, Jack Kennedy, Conor Sweeney and Liam Treacy all showed up well in Tipperaryrsquos recent McGrath Cup campaign and did enough, even without Quinlivan, to suggest that they will be a tough nut to crack..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C January 22%2C 1980  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK mdash Rumours were re this week that it could be another ten years before the adoption of the poundm-plus scheme to provide a lsquoring roadrsquo in Downpatrick.Work on the scheme first started in the late sixties and, ironically, the Department of Environment is preparing to make a public announcement within the next two weeks on the route they want the road to take.But on Monday Downpatrick councillor Mr Eddie McGrady told a meeting of Down councillors that there were local rumours of another ten-year delay.Within the past  hours it has become obvious that the warning could take on realistic proportions.It seems clear that a wall of objections will be raised of the scheme and it could particularly take years to smooth out negotiations and pare the way for a pubic inquiry, which now looks inevitable.Mr McGradyrsquos warning came during a council discussion on a planning decision to refuse alterations and extensions to a dwelling in Saul Street, which is expected to be in the path of the new road.He drew the councilrsquos attention to a planning approval for squash courts in St Patrickrsquos Avenue mdash also likely to be in the path of the road mdash offering one explanation for the conflicting decisions.ldquoThere are rumours that planning permissions might be given in certain circumstances because it might be ten years before the road is implemented, he said.CROSSGAR mdash The st Crossgar Boys Brigade will represent Down Battalion in the Northern Ireland district finals of the squad drill competition in Omagh on Saturday.The Lissara boys qualied for the finals by wining the annual Down Battalion competition held at Banbridge on Monday night. Second was st Ballyroney, with st Raffrey finishing third.This is the most prestigious event in the Battalion calendar and a very high standard of drill was set by the locals, who have been practicing the movements for the past four months.Apart from the squad competition, there was also a squad commandant cup presented at Banbridge and Sgt M Cuffey, of Crossgar, was the winner.The overall competition was chaired by Mr D Partridge, Battalion president, assisted by Mr R Dickson, Battalion secretary.

Apart from a travelling scholarship he once won to study design, this is undoubtedly Mr Wilkinsonrsquos first big success.ldquoIt was one occasion when I believed designers should make a real effort to present a project. I entered it, wanting to do the best I could. Naturally I aimed to win itpossible, Mr Mr Wilkinson.He received pound from the Environment Minister Mr Philip Goodhart on Tuesday.

They say they are simply removing mercury out of the rotating lens system and putting in a new ldquoinnovative mechanical bearing solution, insisting that the changes are not being driven by any directive to make savings.In addition, CIL argues that plans to replace the existing filament light with a modern LED will not result in major changes to the sweeping beam.They contend that the

Johnrsquos Point Lighthouse continuing to provide an essential safety service for mariners as it has done since a light was first established in Killough in .During a public meeting last year to

geopark bid  ","story":"A NEW management team has been established to oversee three stunning areas of outstanding natural beauty which are at the heart of the districtrsquos bid to secure a world renowned tourism designation.Strangford and Lecale, the Mournes and Ring of Gullion feature heavily in Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos bid for prestigious UNESCO geopark status which has the potential to generate millions of pounds in tourism revenue.Typical activities in geoparks include the development of walking and cycling trails, training local people to act as guides, the provision of information signs and the development of visitor centres.Northern Irelandrsquos only other current geopark mdash the Marble Arch Caves which inhabits the rugged mountainous uplands and gentle rolling lowlands of counties Cavan and Fermanagh mdash contributes just over poundm to the economy in this area.Local council officials, who confirmed a pre-Christmas Recorder story that the formal bid for geopark status had been submitted, have revealed that an Area of Outstanding Natural Beautymanagement team for the three local areas has been created.Council officials say that they are continuing to work secure geopark status which is primarily about environmental sustainability and trying to increase economic revenue in a part of the world already revered for its stunning beauty.Geoparks are based around signicant areas of geology and are set up to support sustainable economic development of an area, primarily through geological and eco-tourism.But they are not just about geology and include sites that are of interest for their history, archaeology, bioersity, folklore, cultural and local heritage.Securing the prestigious geopark designation is one of the key planks of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos tourism strategy, with those behind the bid confident that it has the potential to deliver high quality tourism in the area, increasing the number of international visitors in particular.But securing geopark status is not just about delivering financial benefit.Geoparks in other areas have empowered local communities, providing them with opportunities to develop cohesive partnerships with the common goal of promoting the arearsquos signicant geological and other heritage.If the local bid for geopark status for a huge swathe of land covering Strangford and Lecale, the Mournes and Ring of Gullion is successful, the international designation is expected to play a key role in helping transform the local economy.The geopark brand will use the geological heritage of the three areas to develop sustainable tourism that generates economic benefits, while providing recreational opportunities and increased awareness of the arearsquos natural assets, working with landowners, businesses and communities.The ultimate aim of a geopark is to enhance the economy and develop employment opportunities for the people who live there, but the global brand does not impose any restrictions on farming practices, planning or development.There are currently  geoparks found in  countries across the world, all of which have been developed using a so-called bottom-up approach with local communities playing a signicant role in this process..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020

The tourism season in Newcastle is now all-year long and we want to keep the car-park open.Cllr Devlin said that the council was ldquoa victim of its own success in being able to attract the numbers of visitors to the town.She questioned the proposalrsquos contention that Newcastlersquos parking demand ldquosignicantly decreases during the winter months.ldquoIt used to be that we would have parking problems during particular times such as the Festival of Flight and bank holidays. But now as long as its dry, Newcastle is busy and parking is a necessary part of the town centre, she said.ldquoWhen the overflow car park is not being used, itrsquos complete chaos and parking can create issues for residents in nearby folds.She asked council officers when the new overflow car-park would be open for business andthe current overflow area could be kept open in the interim to help with parking demand.Michael Lipsett, the councilrsquos director of active and healthy communities, said he envisaged the work lasting three months and promised that once the necessary planning approval was gained, his department would be preparing to tender for a contractor as soon as possible.Slieve Croob Cllr Andrew McMurray queried whether the car-park would be a ldquoblanket tarmac covering andit would encroach on the green space.He was told that the proposal was to use a synthetic grid which would allow grass to show through so it would look green but would also indicate the car spaces available and one-way traffic system planned.Mournes Cllr Harold McKee welcomed the development as a ldquogreat idea and said parking in Newcastle was ldquoan absolute nightmare at any time of the year.Cllr Devlin suggested that the current overflow parking area should be in continuous use until the new facility is opened.However, Mr Lipsett said he currently did not have the budget available to cover this but would investigate and report back..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020 Philip.jpg","title":"Philip and Helen in tandem at Kildare  ","story":"ON a bitterly cold Saturday morning Phillip and Helen Vint were at the start line for the latest in the East of Ireland Marathon series, at Staplestown, in North Kildare, which also provides half marathon and k alternatives, mostly for partners, like Helen who feel itrsquos nice to be there to support your other half, but who feel that running a marathon with them is pushing things a bit too far, . miles too far to be exact.The temperature was -C when they began running and a sultry +C when they finished and underfoot conditions were slippery by virtue of the frozen ice around the route.So, well done to both on completing what they describe as steady runs for their firsts of , Phillip in .. and fth place and Helen in .. and third place respectively.BornRunSaturday saw a big turnout,  in fact, for the sixth of the BornRun Run Forest Run Series.This week the venue was Gosford Country Park which will also host the NI  Ulster Intermediate and Masters Cross Country Championships next weekend.The only distance on offer this week was k and the route headed out in a loop around the start and continued towards the outer boundaries of the forest.The first k was quite level and took everyone into the scenic forest for k where there were a few small inclines, but overall it was a flat, fast course with a good run in the last k down to the finish line.No-one made better use of the terrain than East Downrsquos Jimmy Sloan, who fairly flew round the course in a superb ., which was almost two minutesahead of the second-placed Thomas Carson . with third place filled by Barry McAuley in ..I believe this is Jimmyrsquos first win in club colours and it certainly wonrsquot be his last, given his present form and continuing improvement, which in spite of hearing later that the distance was allegedly  metres short, nevertheless represents a great effort and time.

This year they donated a fantastic amount for the charities, said Raphael. ldquoI am delighted to see young people come on board to help others. They are a credit to their school and their families.Raphaelrsquos chance meeting with Martin, a homeless man living on the streets of Dublin whom he met during a visit to family members a number of years ago, was the catalyst for him to launch his annual appeal which has enjoyed tremendous community support.The photographerrsquos meeting with Martin underneath a railway bridge close to Pearse Street railway station had a profound impact on him, moving him to organise an appeal as soon as he ed home.ldquoThe sight of seeing Martin on Pearse Street back in  will be with me forever. To see homelessness on the rise across Ireland,north and south, means something is badly wrong. There doesnrsquot appear to be any political will to cure the problem. It there was, we would not have homelessness in a modern society. More needs to be done, immediately, said Raphael.Year on year the response to his appeal has increased and this year he will be looking for anyone interested in helping to get in touch to help with the collection, storage and distribution of donations.Raphael confirmed that he plans to launch his appeal for volunteers to join forces with him this October.ldquoI cannot begin to praise every single person who responded to my Christmas appeal. It was so overwhelming, he explained.ldquoAll I do is put the word out about my appeal and people come forward in great numbers to help. The response to the latest appeal was the biggest to date and I cannot thank people enough for their generosity and support.ldquoThe response from the public was truly unbelievable. I am particularly indebted to everyone, in particular, the staff and students at St Colmcillersquos High School.The annual appeal is particularly time-consuming for someone who runs his own business and that is why Raphael is hoping people will volunteer to help him in .ldquoEvery item that is donated has to be unpacked and checked to make sure it is okay to pass on. Then it has to be sorted, re-packed and stored until the time to deliver it comes. This takes up a lot of time and there is only so much one person can do, he explained.Raphael has also singled out the management and staff at Peter Fitzpatrick and Sons Estate Agents in Downpatrick for particular praise for allowing their Irish Street base to be used as a -off point for his appeal.ldquoThe business has been so supportive over the past number of years. I cannot thank them enough for all their help, he said.ldquoDePaul was over the moon with the items people donated and the fact that a signicant number of people took time out at Christmas to think of and help others is very humbling. If more people come forward to help me this year, together, we could do even more.In future Raphael hopes to deliver the majority of donations to more local charities and organisations. He said it only seems right that items collected are distributed locally so in future most of what he receives will go to local charities.He added: ldquoThe generosity and community spirit across the district is something to behold. All I do is announce details of the appeal and people across the community then donate in numbers.ldquoOnce the message gets out there, people are quick to respond and I am so grateful as are the organisations they are supporting.

Plans for these pubic toilets will be outlined in a draft strategy mapping the way forward when it is presented to councillors.While a lot of work has been carried out to prepare the strategy, local politicians will be told at tonightrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Neighbourhood Services Committee that then document is not yet complete.However, council officials have revealed that several key principles have emerged from work carried out to date which surprisingly includes a suggestion to review the strategic and legal case for continuing to provide provide public toilets across the district.Other feedback provided includes queries on whether the current number of toilets are sufficient, the potential removal of inidual toilets due to what has been described as a ldquounderuse or over provision and is the condition of the existing public toilets adequate The strategy will review the findings of structural and usage surveys which have already been undertaken and examine how often public toilets are cleaned.In addition, the strategy will consider whether the local authorityrsquos public toilet service should be restricted to its  stand alone facilities, or extended to include those in council and other public buildings.A so-called lsquocommunity toilet schemersquo has also been suggested that would involve a partnership arrangement between the local authority and commercial operators who would allow toilets on their premises to be used by the public.The strategy will also propose capital investment to replace so-called stand alone units identied as beyond repair.Most signicantly, the strategy will recommend that when new capital works are proposed or signicant refurbishment works to existing toilets are undertaken, the design brief must take into account the needs of less abled users and cater for the needs of the severely disabled and those with Autism or dementia.As part of the major overhaul of public conveniences, council officials are working alongside the British Toilet Association, while ratepayers have been asked for their views via the districtrsquos seven electoral forum groups.Council chiefs aim to upgrade toilets with the proposed pound.m spend coming after concerns about toilet provision across the district in a number of areas, especially Newcastle and Saintfield.Politicians say they recognise that a major capital programme is required to upgrade existing toilets and implement planned improvements, designed to ensure the facilities meet the needs of a wider range of people.Mournes councillor Willie Clarke has welcomed the ious recommendations arising out of the strategic review of public convenience provision, subject to approval at tonightrsquos council committee meeting.He said officers will proceed to develop business cases concerning the refurbishment of public toilets at Newcastlersquos Castle Park and a new public convenience in Killough.Cllr Clarke said that he has been contacted on numerous occasions about the cleanliness of toilets in Newcastle.ldquoI have also voiced my concern in relation to the closure of two Newcastle town centre public toilets during the summer season when those at both Castle Park and the Islands Park were closed, he added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/17333834.the-buzz-of-the-farmers-mart/resources/images/9653973.jpg","title":"unions suspend strike action consider offer","story":"Newly appointed Chair of the Health Committee, Sinn Feacuteins Colm Gildernew MLA, has welcomed todayrsquos announcement by health unions that they will suspending their industrial action.Speaking following the announcement, Colm Gildernew said: ldquoI welcome the decision by health unions to suspend planned health strikes and industrial action.Mr. Gildernew said there must be an inclusive approach to drafting the safe staffing plan which recognises and includes the important contribution of health unions and workers.\"I commend the fortitude of the health workers and their representatives during the industrial action and I welcome their decision to suspend the strike having secured pay parity and a commitment to safe staffing levels.ldquoThe workers were left no other option and took the decision to strike in the best interests of staff and patients alike.ldquoIt is vitally important that moving forward both the British and Irish Governments deliver on their financial commitments in the lsquoNew Decade, New Approachrsquo deal to allow for the proper resourcing of the health and social care service, education and other public services.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This year, she will celebrate her ninety second birthday and she discusses a letime of activism across Europe.Veganuary is an annual event which encourages people to go vegan for a month. In last yearrsquos campaign, a quarter of a million people pledged to try a vegan diet.More NewsVale school pals brave the shave for animal charityPenarth father of four is recognised in New Year Honour list for services to cricketHouse prices increased in the Vale of Glamorgan, latest figures showOnce a fringe movement, veganism is quickly gaining a vast appeal, especially amongst the young, as the environmental benefits of a plant-based diet become clearer.According to a study by the Vegan Society, , people in the UK were vegan in  ndash  and a half times higher than in . Almost half of these were people aged below .Veganism has brought with it a lucrative trade in plant-based produce as businesses move to accommodate the concerns of their customers and promote ethical alternatives to meat.Long before veganism became a dietary and commercial trendsetter, however, June Holder, a -year-old woman from Penarth, had her eyes opened to the costly effects of meat consumption. After eating a vegan breakfast at a local cafeacute, she settled down to tell me her story.ldquoIrsquove been vegan for  years, she said. ldquoMy daughter had a stall at Camden Market, and she used to collect masses of money for animal rights there. It was her who first introduced me to the cause.ldquoLater on, I organized a charity coffee morning and sent the money I raised to Compassion in World Farming. In , they sent me a magazine which showed what happened to the animals. Well, I sat down that morning and read what theyrsquod sent me ndash and I was vegan!Whilst the public has become more receptive to veganism, June still encounters hostility: ldquoPeoplersquos reactions y when I tell them Irsquom vegan. They become hostile because theyrsquore guilty, I suppose.ldquoI remember that a vegan group had a stall in the market a few years ago. They were advertising parts of Alsatians to eat. People were horried. So, when they were angry, I had a chance to talk to them. lsquoYou accept that any animal can be treated like this except when it comes to your dogsrsquo, I told them. Well, they had to accept it. How could they not Originally from Penarth, June moved to Dinas Powys from Barry after her husband, Derrick, passed away  years ago.Derrick was the owner of Holders Menswear, a menrsquos fashion store which was once renowned throughout the Vale of Glamorgan and beyond.Junersquos decision to become vegan sparked  years of dedication to activism. She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her. One poem describes the day of protest in Brussels. It reflects Junersquos unceasing dedication to animal welfare but also her frustration at the pace of change:ldquoThe writer of these verses was, quite some time ago, in Brussels with a poster which now rings yet more true. lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo is what the message said.ldquoThen round it went to young and old for everyone to read. From countries all round Europe, but the farmers paid no heed. Live transport, a huge issue then, continues just the same.Another poem read:ldquoChristmas is a time to spend, but why not save instead  In sheds around the country to sate the publicrsquos lust for something huge to set their feast. The turkeys just exist.ldquoTen million in this country at Christmas time alone. Is this the way to talk of peace and teach our children love Veganuary runs throughout January.

I started the week as usual by walking Isaac to school, enjoying a father-son chat about the day ahead. has seen a rocky start with wildfires ravaging through Australia and tensions rising in the Middle East but this cannot set the tone for what is to come.As someone who has family in Australia, I am truly appalled to see the spread and devastation of the fires, but also the initial response from senior Australian politicians.Their denial of the link between the climate emergency which we face globally and the disaster which has swept across their nation is completely incomprehensible.Moving forward we must accept that we are in a state of emergency and must take drastic action to limit as much of the impact as practicably possible.We certainly have an interesting year,not decade ahead. The UKrsquos withdrawal from the EU will begin later this month and we have a Conservative Government in Westminster until at least .Regardless of the numbers in the Commons, the Labour Party still has to stand up for those we represent. I am confident that my colleague, Stephen Doughty MP will continue to do that.The Labour Party will now move to elect a new Leader and Deputy Leader, a chance to reunite the Party and hold the Prime Minister to account for his actions.I am truly glad to see that several MPs from across the Party have put their names forward to stand for both positions. This offers the membership and the country a broader choice.I am yet to decide who I will back in the forthcoming election but I know that I want to see a vision from each of the candidates. For me, that vision needs to be a realistic reflection of our last decade out of government in Westminster, but also a strategy for reconnecting with our voters and securing a Labour government which can deliver for those who need us most.Finally, I want to thank the staff across the NHS and wider public services for their hard work under increasing pressures, particularly during the winter period.Our public services work hard all year round and many take the sacrice of working over the Christmas and New Year period for which I, and many others, are extremely grateful.As everyou would like to speak with me, you can call my office on    or write to me at Vaughan.Gething@assembly.wales or Office of Vaughan Gething AM, Room C, National Assembly for Wales, CF NA. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Itrsquos better than shoving a drumstick up your arse on stage, he said.Originally from Cardf, Pritchard studied cooking at college but dedicated himself to professional skating when he was sponsored at .ldquoDirty Sanchez was great.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

January , : pm\"\"Parents are dipping into their kids savings to supplement day-to-day living costs, a study has found.Researchers polled , mums and dads and found one fth have borrowed money from their childrens piggy banks and accounts in order to pay their living expenses.Nearly half of those have taken cash out of their little ones savings to pay household bills, with  per cent borrowing money to cover the cost of groceries.And, ironically, more than one sixth have done so in order to cover childcare.The research was commissioned by comparethemarket as part of their latest Parentdex report on pocket moneyJody Coughlan, Money Manager, at comparethemarket said: \"Fortunately for kids, the wider squeeze on the household budget seems to have had little impact on the generous amounts parents wants to give their children.\"That said, parents do need to ensure that they are able to give their kids this pocket money, without needing to dip into it to cover wider household bills.\"The report uncovers the spending habits of British children who receive an average of £ a month, totalling £ every year and giving them the equivalent of £.billion to spend collectively.Research also found kids savings accounts are relatively healthy, with the average child having a signicant £. stashed away.In fact, one fth of children have £, sitting in their savings.It also emerged children are generating a second source of income, with four in five parents giving their offspring extra money to cover unforeseen requests such as new clothing or nights out with friends.These ad hoc requests see one fth of parents topping up pocket money once a fortnight, and more than a quarter giving these extra handouts once a month.Meanwhile, the Bank of Gran and Grandad appears to be another fruitful source of income for kids.One quarter of grandparents find themselves contributing to kids income, with two thirds giving their grandkids generous handouts as and when they see them.Unsurprisingly, children in the capital are the recipients of the highest amount of pocket money compared to anywhere  in the UK, with the average parent in London giving £ to their child each month.In contrast, children in the east of England are given £ a month while those in the south west who are given £.Fortunately, the poll also shows mums and dads are confident in their childrens ability to manage their finances effectively, with almost three quarters believing the youngsters will be well equipped to handle money as they approach adulthood.In the absence of financial education at schools, this could be down to discussions at home, with nine in  stating they have talked about money management with their children.However, parents clearly feel their children would benefit from additional teaching in schools, with four fths of those polled believing schools should do more to teach financial education.Jody Coughlan added: \"Its incredibly encouraging to see the number of parents who are willing to talk to their children about financial management from such an early age.\"Not only will this do more to prepare them for financial responsibility in the long run, but it should also help to lessen their long-term dependence on the Bank of Mum and Dad as a result!\"\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\"

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/234234343334.jpg","title":"stormont deal business back new assembly","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Julian Smith and Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney. Pic Kelvin Boyes Northern Ireland’s business community has given its support for a deal which has seen the Assembly up-and-running after a three year stasis. The Northern Ireland Assembly couldon Fridaypolitical parties back a deal tabled by the UK and Irish Governments. DUP leader Arlene Foster has indicated that her party will back the deal, while Sinn Fein said its leadership will meet to discuss it on Friday. The UUP has said they will consider the deal, but are willing to attend the Assemblyit sits. In a joint statement urging politicians to accept the ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal, NI Chamber president John Healy, vice president Ian Henry, and chief executive Ann McGregor, said: “After three years of paralysis, we now have a workable deal that will allow an Executive to start addressing the problems within our health service and education system. They will also be able to take action to grow our economy and support the community and voluntary sector. “We therefore encourage the five main political parties to progress it urgently. Business, health and education cannot wait any longer - failure is not an option. “Now is the time for our politicians to show mature leadership and help navigate a path to the future by accepting this deal.” Secretary of State Julian Smith and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney published the New Decade, New Approach deal on Thursday evening and urged parties to back it andto Stormont on Friday. Reacting to the news, Trade NI – the alliance of Retail NI, Manufacturing NI and Hospitality Ulster – said: “We welcome the draft deal published by the British and Irish Governments in the final round of talks to restore devolution. We strongly encourage all the main parties of Northern Ireland to sign the deal today and get the Assembly back up and running.” “As our three organisations represent the majority of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland, we are cautiously hopeful that the deal and aof the Assembly will see the development of policies and legislation at devolved level and the kick start that our economy desperately needs. The clear prioritisation of the Northern Ireland economy highlights the many challenges that businesses have faced over the past three years and our message to the parties is that we support you in your endeavours to secure this deal.” “While this is a good start, improvements are still needed to drive the economy forward and support the growth of business across Northern Ireland. As stated in our Vision  document, Northern Ireland’s potential is signicant but reform and growth is needed to create the modern economy we are capable of and deserve.” FSB NI policy chair, Tina McKenzie, said: “Businesses will welcome the agreement published last night as a step forward towards restoring devolved government, something for which FSB has been calling since the collapse of the institutions three years ago. “The draft agreement contains some positive commitments to bolster the local economy, on issues like skills, infrastructure and Brexit. However, theof devolution is by no means a panacea it just means that at long last we have elected representatives in place to tackle a very dficult task. “The next Executive must move quickly to deliver on the myriad issues which have been left unaddressed for far too long. While the health service will be high on the agenda, we must not lose sight of the need to bolster our SME economy, which is the absolute bedrock on which the first-class public services to which we all aspire are built. “Ministers must move swtly to support our economy at one of the most turbulent times for many decades, starting by lowering the rates burden on small businesses, whilst also moving forward rapidly with key infrastructure projects which have stalled and ensuring that our schools, colleges, and universities are providing students with the skills they need for the jobs of the future. “In order to begin to address these issues, the parties must put pragmatism first and get back round the Executive table.” Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster, said: “We encourage all parties to seize this opportunity and sign up to the deal published late last night to get the Assembly and Executive back as quickly as possible.” “This is the best chance to bring the devolved government back to le. Our message to the party leaders is clear, we support you in your endeavours and encourage you to get the New Decade, New Approach agreement over the line today. Redmond McFadden, president of the Londonderry Chamber of Commerce said: “The Londonderry Chamber as well as other representatives of business, education, health, trade unions and civic organisations, held a meeting with the five main political parties at Stormont last night. “At that meeting we pressed the urgent need for the parties to agree the draft deal which was published by the British and Irish Governments. Three years without Ministers making local decisions has had an enormous impact on our economy and wider society. A lack of effective and meaningful representation here is curtailing investment in our region, stling job creation and driving our young people away. Simon Hamilton, chief executive of Belfast Chamber, said: “Belfast Chamber welcomes progress towards the restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive and encourages the local political parties to reach agreement. For the last three years, our members have seen how an absence of decision making has stunted growth and stled investment. The proposed priorities for the Executive contain some issues which Belfast Chamber has been supportive of for some time. “Other policies which could boost our economy are noticeably missing but we look forward to joining with our colleagues across the business community to ensure that the new Executive pursues an agenda that grows jobs and boosts our economy.” Northern Ireland Local Government Association chief executive, Derek McCallan said: “I am very pleased that the British and Irish governments have tabled a draft deal on restoring the NI Executive. I hope that an agreement can be reached quickly to get the Stormont institutions back up and running immediately. For three years, our eleven local councils have been the only ing form of democratically elected government in Northern Ireland. Local government has been a vital democratic anchor during this period and ensured the provision of crucial public services for local citizens. “It’s time to bridge the democratic deficit and unlock the potential of local government in Northern Ireland by investing in our local councils. An Executive commitment to a devolution bill and greater financial powers and resources will drive a transformation in Northern Ireland’s democratic governance and help create a more sustainable democracy, environment and economy for Northern Ireland.” Kirsty McManus, national director, IoD NI, said: “The ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal is to be welcomed, filled with ambition that,fulfilled, can deliver real improvements for the people and businesses of Northern Ireland. “We would therefore urge all parties to get behind the deal to enable the speedy restoration of the Executive. “Commitments from the British and Irish governments for some crucial pieces of infrastructure such as the York Street Interchange, upgrades to the A and A road and Northern Ireland’s wastewater network are particularly pleasing. “The expansion of university provision at the Magee campus in Derry meanwhile will go some way to rebalancing the regional economy. “Plans for multi-year budgets and increased civic engagement will also improve overall governance. “From a business perspective however, we would have liked to have seen more around a new skills agenda, which urgently require focus alongside a renewed look at the Apprenticeship Levy which is not included in this deal. “On behalf of our members, we will also monitor closely commitments to bring forward legislation that will allow unfettered access to the Great Britain market for local business following Brexit.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/edel1.jpg","title":"leaders in business edel doherty beyond business travel","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster BusinessEdel Doherty’s grand ambitions for her business travel firm probably should come as no surprise to those who know her – it’s a sector which she has worked in her entire le.A decade ago she founded Beyond Business Travel, a business with a £m turnover and around  staff. Now, the aim is to grow that to £m, which includes a new office in Dublin to expand its market reach right across Ireland.“We are hoping to take that to £m in the next four years and we have opened an office in Dublin,” she told Ulster Business.“It’s an ambitious target, but we have grown year-on-year for the past nine years and have brought a lot of technology into the business and to our clients.”The client list reads like a who’s who of the giants of Northern Ireland industry, including poultry processor Moy Park, Almac and Devenish Nutrition. The firm has also looked after those on the Game of Thrones crew.“We have a strong track record of getting and maintaining good clients,” she says. “We are a new breed of travel management company. We want to make a dference in client businesses. “People, the human capital, is what the business is and making sure they are looked after while they travel is a big thing for us – doing it effectively, making sure they have the support,  .“I’ve been in travel for more than  years and I’m passionate about it. It has changed dramatically, with the rise of the smartphone.”That includes the development of booking tools for clients, but also looking ahead and building more advanced technology, incorporating articial intelligence and being able to personalise the experience for each traveller. Born in Belfast, Edel’s initial career trajectory looked set for university, but instead she wanted to go in to the world of work, and tackle the travel sector.“I went straight into the industry and I’m a great believer in le-long learning. I want to be the best version of me and to reach my potential,” she says. That includes working across dferent areas of the travel industry. But Edel says business travel “was always my love”.Edel is involved with the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and Women in Business, as well as sitting on the CBI’s SME Council in London. She’s also just been named Businesswoman of the Year by Women in Business.And like many company founders, Edel hit the ground running with her own business as the world entered its worst recession in a generation. She was previously a director with a company for  years, before deciding to make the move and go it alone.“I made a business plan – I said to myself, I can do this, I know I can. I built a brilliant team around me, and almost  years later, here we are. It’s been hard work, but it’s enjoyable and I’m passionate about the Northern Ireland economy. I’m passionate about buying local.”As for Brexit, Edel says setting up the Dublin office was one was in which the firm was mitigating against any business concerns arising from Brexit.“It’s hard to plan when you don’t know.
