Superstar Brad still doesn\u0027t have a chance...Share this articleStudents for Fair Admissions relied on an analysis from Peter Arcidiacono, a Duke University economist who says he found evidence of bias against Asian-Americans.Arcidiacono\u0027s study concluded that if Harvard relied only on the academic scores it assigns to each applicant, more than half of admitted students would have been Asian-American in the six years in question. Instead, they made up just 22 percent.To blame, he wrote, are subjective rating categories for which Asian-American applicants consistently received lower scores than their white peers.Asian-Americans, for example, received lower scores than any other racial group in a category for \u0027personal qualities,\u0027 and they fared worse than whites in an overall rating category that isn\u0027t based on any particular formula.Yet Harvard alumni who interview applicants and provide their own ratings generally scored Asian-Americans higher than whites, a contrast that Arcidiacono says suggests bias.          They quoted figures stating that an Asian-American male applicant with a 25 percent chance of admission would have a 35 percent chance if he was white, 75 percent if he were Hiic and a 95 percent chance if he were black. File photo The university attacked his analysis, saying it\u0027s flawed because it excludes applicants believed to have an advantage regardless of race, including relatives of alumni and athletes recruited by the school.Instead, Harvard sought its own study from David Card, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, who found no evidence of discrimination against Asian-Americans.Looking at a wider pool of applicants and admissions factors, Card found that the effect of being Asian-American was \u0027statistically indistinguishable from zero.\u0027Both sides also are sparring over a 2013 internal study at Harvard exploring the racial makeup of the admitted class. The inquiry, uncovered by Blum\u0027s group, was conducted amid earlier allegations of discrimination against Harvard.The study found that even considering factors like legacy status and extracurricular activities, 26 percent of the admitted class would have been expected to be Asian-American. Instead, 19 percent were.Blum\u0027s group says the report is proof of intentional discrimination and that Harvard \u0027killed the study and quietly buried the reports.\u0027Harvard counters that the study was never intended to evaluate possible discrimination and that it was \u0027incomplete, preliminary and based on limited inputs.\u0027University officials have painted the lawsuit as an attack on their ability to consider race in admissions, which they say is necessary to ensure ersity on campus.In 2016, the Supreme Court examined the topic and upheld race-conscious admissions at the University of Texas, but the justices warned that other colleges still must be able to prove affirmative action is the only way to meet ersity goals.Blum also was a driving force behind that case, helping Texas student Abigail Fisher sue the university. Fisher is also an executive in Students for Fair Admissions, according to the group\u0027s tax filings.Friday\u0027s court filings followed a recent battle over a trove of Harvard data reviewed by lawyers during the discovery process.Harvard argued that its records initially should be filed confidentially to protect students and the admissions process. Blum\u0027s group said the public should have access to the records, and the U.S. Education Department - which is also looking into Harvard\u0027s use of race in admissions - weighed in to agree.The judge ultimately sided with Harvard, but Blum said Friday that he believes the rest of the records will be released \u0027in the next few weeks.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/16/21/4D5073A400000578-5852201-image-a-45_1529182710569.jpg","title":"Luxury new build house dubbed Beggars Lodge royals new home","story":"    Situated on the 3,800-acre estate of Great Tew in Gloucestershire, where Harry and Meghan are currently renting a country bolthole, the planned property is set to replace an existing set of dilapidated farm buildingsDepicted here in computer-generated drawings by a local designer, it certainly fits the bill for Meghan and Harry’s future family home.The stone-built manor, at the end of a 150-yard-long tree-lined drive, will feature a high-tech ‘media room’, a massive walk-in wardrobe, a ‘family room’, and ancillary accommodation perfect for security staff, drivers and a nanny.At the rear of the house will be a flagstone terrace, ornamental flower beds and a 150ft lawn lined with yew topiary.

Superstar Brad still doesn\u0027t have a chance...Share this articleStudents for Fair Admissions relied on an analysis from Peter Arcidiacono, a Duke University economist who says he found evidence of bias against Asian-Americans.Arcidiacono\u0027s study concluded that if Harvard relied only on the academic scores it assigns to each applicant, more than half of admitted students would have been Asian-American in the six years in question. Instead, they made up just 22 percent.To blame, he wrote, are subjective rating categories for which Asian-American applicants consistently received lower scores than their white peers.Asian-Americans, for example, received lower scores than any other racial group in a category for \u0027personal qualities,\u0027 and they fared worse than whites in an overall rating category that isn\u0027t based on any particular formula.Yet Harvard alumni who interview applicants and provide their own ratings generally scored Asian-Americans higher than whites, a contrast that Arcidiacono says suggests bias.          They quoted figures stating that an Asian-American male applicant with a 25 percent chance of admission would have a 35 percent chance if he was white, 75 percent if he were Hiic and a 95 percent chance if he were black. File photo The university attacked his analysis, saying it\u0027s flawed because it excludes applicants believed to have an advantage regardless of race, including relatives of alumni and athletes recruited by the school.Instead, Harvard sought its own study from David Card, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, who found no evidence of discrimination against Asian-Americans.Looking at a wider pool of applicants and admissions factors, Card found that the effect of being Asian-American was \u0027statistically indistinguishable from zero.\u0027Both sides also are sparring over a 2013 internal study at Harvard exploring the racial makeup of the admitted class. The inquiry, uncovered by Blum\u0027s group, was conducted amid earlier allegations of discrimination against Harvard.The study found that even considering factors like legacy status and extracurricular activities, 26 percent of the admitted class would have been expected to be Asian-American. Instead, 19 percent were.Blum\u0027s group says the report is proof of intentional discrimination and that Harvard \u0027killed the study and quietly buried the reports.\u0027Harvard counters that the study was never intended to evaluate possible discrimination and that it was \u0027incomplete, preliminary and based on limited inputs.\u0027University officials have painted the lawsuit as an attack on their ability to consider race in admissions, which they say is necessary to ensure ersity on campus.In 2016, the Supreme Court examined the topic and upheld race-conscious admissions at the University of Texas, but the justices warned that other colleges still must be able to prove affirmative action is the only way to meet ersity goals.Blum also was a driving force behind that case, helping Texas student Abigail Fisher sue the university. Fisher is also an executive in Students for Fair Admissions, according to the group\u0027s tax filings.Friday\u0027s court filings followed a recent battle over a trove of Harvard data reviewed by lawyers during the discovery process.Harvard argued that its records initially should be filed confidentially to protect students and the admissions process. Blum\u0027s group said the public should have access to the records, and the U.S. Education Department - which is also looking into Harvard\u0027s use of race in admissions - weighed in to agree.The judge ultimately sided with Harvard, but Blum said Friday that he believes the rest of the records will be released \u0027in the next few weeks.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/16/02/4D494C6700000578-0-image-m-8_1529110832670.jpg","title":"Farmers picking ethically produced roses sold Sainsburys paid just 48p hour","story":"    The packhouse floor at the Oserian, a rose growers in Naivasha, in the Great Rift Valley,KenyaThe Fairtrade Foundation, which campaigns against exploitation of growers, yesterday launched an investigation of its own after being presented with The Mail on Sunday’s findings.‘Fairtrade takes all allegations of exploitative working conditions very seriously and are shocked and saddened by these claims,’ said Michael Gidney, chief executive of the Fairtrade Foundation.Kesha claims she has not been paid album royalties due to Dr...Till debt do us part: Bride dumps fiance on the morning of...Share this articleIts logo is a familiar sight to shoppers, indicating that goods on display from developing nations have been produced ethically.Fairtrade-certified flower farms receive a minimum price from supermarkets and workers receive a ‘Fairtrade Premium’ – money that is invested in projects to improve their livelihoods.

Dagmar Hochová took photographs that captured all of the hopes and fears of the long postwar struggle for freedom in her country, which culminated in the Velvet Revolution of 1989.Hochová was born in 1926 and lived most of her life in Prague until her death in 2012. Though her pictures were sometimes overtly political – the young, ostracised Václav Havel, at home the “march of silence” against the Russian invasion – Hochová became best known as a photographer of children. This was partly a question of expedience. Childhood was one of the few aspects of the city’s life that was effectively beyond the censor’s control. Hochová’s camera sought out the mischief and spirit of Czech kids playing in the streets. The exuberance she was drawn to was no doubt a statement of subversive intent at a time when freedom of expression was outlawed – there was also plenty of pure innocent joy.This picture, part of the first UK retrospective of Hochová’s work, captures all of that youthful Bohemian spirit. It was taken on a bridge over the Vltava River in 1959. After the Russian coup in 1948 there had been long years of Stalinist purges of artists and agitators, and the creation of all the grey apparatus of a police state, but that world seems far removed from these two girls. They lean into Hochová’s lens with freckled and dimpled devilment, challenging the viewer not to share their grins, infant fists clenched in an innocent echo of a wider defiance.The Power of Sympathy: The Photography of Dagmar Hochová, organised by the Czech Centre, runs from Wednesday until 29 June at the 12 Star Gallery, Europe House, London\u0026nbspSW1"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a149f83bad08686d7e62f5ffeef2631ec2da45d3/0_716_6943_4166/master/6943.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c9923ede7e01621e50161a13223b76d","title":"field day festival drawings in pictures","story":"Earlier this month, London-based artist Joey Yu headed to Field Day, a two-day music festival held in south London’s Brockwell Park, to record the action with crayons, pencils and paper.

So I broke the other one to even up the pain’You think you know me. You don’t know me at all. The me you see in the SAS TV reality show Who Dares Wins is the me I want you to see. Only I know the real me. That’s what makes me a leader. A winner.Let’s start with The Question. The one everyone wants to ask but daren’t. Because they do not know me. In case you’d forgotten, no one knows me but me. So look me in the eyes and say it. You can’t, can you? Very few people can look in the eyes of a killer. A killer and a leader. That’s me. So yes, I have killed. More people than I could possibly name. I’ll never forget the first one. In Afghan. A Taliban rushing towards me with an AK-47. I had a choice. I chose to kill. Two gentle squeezes on the trigger. Two shots through the mouth. His head exploded. I felt nothing. It was easy. Job done. A job I’d do again. And again. You don’t know me. Only I know me.My childhood. My father died when I was young. The next day, my mother had taken down all his photos and married someone else. That’s all you need to know. You don’t know me. Only I know me. My stepfather was a hard bastard. When I was having a tough time in school, he told me to hit the bully. So I broke his jaw. It felt good. The bully didn’t bother me again.Don’t let anyone else define who you are. When I first joined the army, I felt I had to be part of the alpha male culture. But I didn’t. I could be just me. You need to be you. Don’t try to be me. No one but me can be me. But you can be you. Look inside yourself and get to know who the real you is. And then be that person. The best version of you. Even if the real you is basically a bit shit, it’s better than not being you.Basic training was hard. But I made it. Because I wanted to be the best me. Sometimes you have to learn that being the best you is being the second best you. I learned the hard way that the army doesn’t want people who always come first. Otherwise there would be only one person in the army. And there wouldn’t be enough men to deploy in Afghan. The army needs people who can come second, third, fourth and last. Know yourself and be that person. Leaders understand that.After a while, I realised 9 Para wasn’t for me. There was too much macho shit in the regiment. The reality was they weren’t nearly as hard as they thought they were. That’s because they didn’t know themselves. Like you don’t know yourself. I know myself. I know my demons. We all have demons. You may not think you have demons. But I can guarantee you do. And your demons have to be confronted.My demons took me to some dark places. My first marriage failed. I drank too much. I went to prison. Though technically it wasn’t my fault. All I was trying to do was break up a fight by assaulting a police officer. But I took the rap and did the time. Because that is how you confront your demons. In prison, one of the inmates tried to push me around on the first day. I grabbed him by the throat. “Don’t fuck with my demons,” I said. “Or else my demons will fuck with you.” He backed off and no one bothered me again. I joined the police for a bit. But they were pussies. And I got kicked out. So I joined the Royal Marines. The training was tough. Brutal. But I survived. Because I knew my demons. I got my demons to work for me rather than against me. That’s what leaders do. On a 60-mile trek with a 200kg bergen on my back. I felt my ankle break. Some might have given up. I broke my other ankle to even up the pain. And carried on. I never give in to my demons.Afghan was hard. I was lead man in an area where there was a 5050 chance of one of my squad getting killed. My mission was to make sure none of my men died. “The only people who get killed in Afghan are those who don’t know their demons,” I said. I saw that one of my blokes was shitting himself. I asked him what he thought we were doing here. “Killing the cunts,” he yelled. I knew then he was going to be OK.At some point I got married again. This time it was for food. Because there were three people in the marriage. Me, Emilie and my demons. I also trained for the Special Boat Service. But that’s something for me and my demons. Since leaving the SBS, I’ve done a lot of TV work. Helping people confront their demons. Helping people to be the real them by sailing across the Pacific in a shit boat. We did that. Now they are the real them. Not the real you. Because only you can be the real you."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/efbe32adfef67c83a46f7b434976fe7e44eab8c7/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=59254393d1c0634d0167c3b8581613da","title":"the guardian view on yemen our complicity lies bare","story":"So they are doing it. They are conducting this war with British-, American- and French-made arms. They are conducting it with western military training and advice British and US officers have been in the command room for airstrikes, and this weekend Le Figaro alleged that there are French special forces on the ground in Yemen. They are conducting it with diplomatic shelter from the west. On Friday, the UK and US blocked a Swedish drive for a UN security council statement demanding a ceasefire: “Britain, as the ‘penholder’ on Yemen at the UN security council, nevertheless takes a nakedly pro-Saudi approach to the conflict,” the former international development secretary Andrew Mitchell notes. Arms\u0026nbspsales and security interests dictate.The war has already claimed tens of thousands of lives, the oft-cited toll of 10,000 being highly conservative when reached and now hopelessly out of date. Many more stand in peril. International law obliges the rapid and unimpeded passage of humanitarian aid, but both the coalition and the Houthi rebels have an atrocious record on observing the rules of war. Relief groups have had to flee Hodeidah. Twenty-two million Yemenis need aid. Eight million are at risk of starvation.The assault appears to be an attempt to pre-empt the presentation of a peace plan by the UN envoy Martin Griffiths, who had previously warned that an attack on Hodeidah could “take peace off the table in a single stroke”. He is due to brief the security council on Monday, following emergency talks, and the UN’s humanitarian coordinator, Lise Grande, has said that talks on the UN taking over the port’s administration are at an advanced stage. But even if Mr Griffiths can manage an agreement against the odds, the chances of it sticking are poor, given both sides’ record of acting in bad faith. The complexities of a handover are immense.The coalition backs the internationally recognised president, Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi, driven out by the Iran-backed Houthis. But the campaign appears largely driven by two forces. First, rivalry with Iran, and other strategic interests. Second, the prestige of its leaders – notably Mohammed bin Salman, who led the charge to war and is now Saudi Arabia’s de facto leader. The coalition has calculated that after a lengthy stalemate it may be in its best position since the war began more than three years ago it hopes to change the facts on the ground and appears to have convinced itself that Hodeidah will be a relatively easy win, if far from painless for civilians. This is familiar stuff, as an International Crisis Group report pointed out this week: “The warring factions are overconfident in their military prospects, almost always press for military advantage when there is an opportunity for negotiation, and are all too often starkly indifferent to the humanitarian impact of their actions and the plight of ordinary citizens.”Riyadh and Abu Dhabi may be of one mind in their loathing for Tehran, but the crowded and increasingly complex field is exposing ergence in their interests. A few months ago, Emirati-backed forces were fighting and killing Saudi-backed forces in Aden. The south is moving towards outright autonomy. But which Saudi and Emirati officials will dare to tell their superiors that Tehran enmeshed them in a costly, apparently endless war at relatively little cost to itself? The entrenchment of a war economy is another significant obstacle to peace.So it goes on, the suffering mounting, further unsettling this unstable region and breeding cynicism and rage towards the west and its talk of human rights and international law. If the complicity ever looked deniable, events of recent days have laid it bare."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f30c0855ac50610925335f99a4544c2c2b1deaa/37_4_4859_2916/master/4859.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e0e69966f5b1e6ad59405fff6ca0b28","title":"from scandi fika to jamaican jerk how to travel the world without leaving the uk","story":"From Cantonese cuisine in Manchester to Italian gardens in Wales, soak up the UK’s rich culture and you can feel like a globetrotter wherever you areAs an island nation, the UK has never been short of visiting adventurers and settlers seeking a different place to call home. Over the years different communities have established homes away from home around the country – Little Italys, Chinatowns, Balti Triangles and more. Stay in an Airbnb at the heart of these communities, get local tips from your host, and experience interesting slices of world culture, without leaving the UK. Here’s where to kick off your tour of some of the little nations on the UK’s doorstep.Channel your inner ScandiIkea, Noma and Pernille Teisbaek all have their part to play in the UK’s obsession with Scandi-inspired interiors, food, fashion and, well, just about everything – and our love affair shows no sign of waning. Whether you’re in Manchester’s Northern Quarter or Bristol’s up-and-coming Montpelier neighbourhood, it is possible to find little pockets of Copenhagen or Stockholm in a growing number of UK cities. The Scandinavian population of London is also on the up, with favourite Scandi hangouts clustered around the Marylebone area, near to the Swedish church. Here, you can unwind over fika – a coffee and bun break – at the Nordic Bakery, where you can also pick up rye bread and other treats. Head to Totally Swedish for food and other knick-knacks, which are, yes, totally Swedish. Or try Scandi Kitchen to buy sweets and snacks or ingredients to prepare back in your Airbnb.Search for homes on Airbnb near stylish Marylebone, LondonTravel to Belgium via FifeFife, on the east coast of Scotland has long been known for its beauty, but very few people are aware that it is home to Flemish architectural gems – some of which you can stay in. Stand beside the 17th-century houses in Pittenweem harbour and it will look like you’re in Belgium – the steeped gables and pantile roofs will give your photos a feel that is not typically Scottish. At the end of your architecture trawl, head to the village of Crail where boats will be bringing in their catch of crabs and lobster – at the Lobster Hut you can buy them cooked and dressed and eat alfresco on the harbour wall. Get there early if you don’t want to miss out on the lobster or crab rolls.Search for homes on Airbnb in Flemish-inspired FifeFall in love with the City of LightsBlackpool Tower, built between 1891 and 1894, was originally inspired by the Eiffel Tower in Paris, but these days it is more famously known as the place where the television show Strictly Come Dancing comes to put on a grand display. Get a snap of yourself holding the tower in the palm of your hand by posing farther down the promenade and then return to the famous ballroom to try out your waltz, paso doble and cha-cha-cha. Cap it all off with some kitsch souvenirs – a kiss-me-quick hat or a stick of Blackpool rock. And as the sun goes down – and if you are visiting between 31 August and 4 November – walk along the beachfront during the Blackpool Illumination, for a dazzling display of lights.Search for homes on Airbnb near the bright lights of BlackpoolGo back in time to Roman EnglandEngland’s most famous wall, dating back to the 2nd century, once marked the distinction between north and south. Now a Unesco world heritage site, and one of England’s greatest landmarks, Hadrian’s Wall threads along almost 80 miles from coast to coast, running from the river Tyne to the Solway Firth. It is the best-preserved frontier of the Roman empire, which ruled much of England for almost 400 years. Along the wall you will find the Roman town of Corbridge, and Roman temples and forts – as well as some incredible homes to stay in.Search for homes on Airbnb in historic NorthumberlandFind Little JamaicaWant to get your jerk on? Then look no farther than London’s Brixton, with a thriving Jamaican community, who’ve been in the area for seven decades. It’s here that you can get that hit of herbs and spices on the barbecue, as long-marinated chicken, pork and goat sizzle on the grill. You’ll find music all around you as you wander between boutiques and food emporiums, with Jamaican flags at every turn. Head to Bamboula or Negril for authentic saltfish with ackee (a buttery tasting fruit), or festival (cornmeal dumplings), and later after a night on the tiles, Refill serves up everything from stew made from cow foot and beans, to callaloo dumplings (made with a leafy vegetable) until the early hours.Search for homes on Airbnb near London’s cool BrixtonExperience Manchester’s ChinatownStand under the famous arch in Chinatown, Manchester, and you could almost be in any major city in China. It’s been there for more than 30 years and is adorned with dragons and phoenixes that will make your pictures look like you have travelled much farther than the north of England. You’ll find amazing Cantonese roast meats – hung in windows to tempt you in – dim sum and traditional Chinese food, as well as shops selling all kinds of Asian ingredients, cookware, decorations and fantastic fish and seafood.

Head to south London’s Stockwell area, where you will find cafes and restaurants serving Portuguese food. There is a huge Portuguese community in this part of London – the largest outside the country itself. Check out Madeira cafe, which sells cakes and pastries, and has a bakery that makes 20,000 pastéis de nata per day, to be sent out across London. Or head to Sintra delicatessen, which sells everything from Portuguese sweets to cheeses and chorizo sausages. Here, and in O Cantinho de Portugal bar over the road, you’ll also find Portuguese newspapers and screenings of Benfica and Sporting Lisbon games, to make you feel you’ve just walked into a sunny corner of the Iberian Peninsula.Search for homes on Airbnb in Stockwell, London’s very own Little PortugalSwap the long-haul flight for BanglatownBrick Lane is one of the funkiest parts of London, with street art, curry and great markets, making it feel like you are on the Asian subcontinent.

Sofia Genders, co-founder of End of the Road Festival and Sheffield insider, has your ultimate 48-hour guide to the cityDay one – yoga, shopping and arty hangoutsExplore what Sheffield’s buzzing neighbourhoods have to offer. Spend the morning getting to know the hip, leafy suburb of Nether Edge – start with a yoga class at Hot Yoga Sheffield on Edgedale Road, then grab a healthy smoothie at the Wild Leaf cafe next door. Yoga was such a great stress-buster when I was running End of the Road festival, and it never fails to put me in a great frame of mind, whether I’m working or enjoying a day off.Next, take a stroll to nearby Abbeydale Road, also known as the antiques quarter. On the first Sunday of the month this vintage wonderland of a street also hosts a flea market at the Abbeydale Picture House – a gorgeous old venue that regularly screens black-and-white early cinema and hosts various cultural events. Spend some time wandering around the Vaults to find something special among the weird and wonderful retro items, or try the eclectic Rileys \u0026amp Co for vintage furniture, kitsch collectables and local crafts. I also love finding bargains in charity shops – there are quite a few along Abbeydale Road. Sticking with the retro theme, a visit to Jameson’s Cafe \u0026amp Tea Rooms is my all-time favourite afternoon tea spot, with great service and a live pianist. Two minutes walk down the road, there’s a great secondhand record store called Below. Also close by on Nether Edge Road, is the intimate and laid back Cafe #9 – perfect for a pick-me-up, plus they host live music now and again.As the afternoon rolls on, head to the villagey Sharrow Vale Road, where you can browse independent shops, delis and boutiques – such as the Front Parlour or Porter Book Shop – before grabbing an artisan doughnut and coffee from Eve Kitchen.If you need something more substantial, you could grab a late lunch from Porter Pizza on Sharrow Vale Road, probably the best pizza in town. It’s takeaway-only but the gorgeous Endcliffe Park is just around the corner, and is a top spot for a pizza picnic and a quick post-lunch stroll around the beautiful woodland.Alternatively, hop in a cab to Chesterfield Road in the up-and-coming Meersbrook area. Here, vegans are in luck: Make No Bones restaurant on Chesterfield Road is a true local’s favourite, or Just Falafs, on the same street, is a great fallback. That’s not to say that carnivores aren’t also well catered for in the area. I also really love the Tramshed Bar \u0026amp Kitchen – they’ve got a brilliant Asian menu, or you could just pop into the bar for a drink or two.Speaking of drinks, in the evening, Takk bar on Queens Road, Heeley, right on the edge of Sheffield city centre, is a great place for a dance and a cocktail in a fairy lit garden. You’ll find it in Hagglers Corner, a creative courtyard community of artists and independent makers, which doubles as an arts venue. If pubs are more your thing, the Brothers Arms and the Sheaf View are both nearby and have a reputation for top quality real ale.If you’re after a gig, try the Audacious Art Experiment, the eponymous venue of the local record label, on Harwood Street. Alternatively, head back to Abbeydale Road and check out Picture House Social, for an eclectic line-up of music events, with great cocktails, craft beer, Italian-inspired street food and a games room, too. I’m a big fan of small, independent venues with creative programming as they’re vital to a healthy music industry – both are destinations for the in-the-know crowd and have some great shows on.Day two – coffee, cake and creative curationThe second day is when you’ll find out what the city centre has to offer, plus a visit to Kelham Island, a riverside area that was once the central hub of Sheffield’s industry, and one of the oldest sites of its kind in the city.Start your day with a good coffee. There are so many great places to choose from, depending on where you are based. Tamper is a New Zealand coffee place with an industrial feel – its main outpost is housed in a 19th-century former silversmith workshop on Arundel Street. On the same street is the Holt, a true hidden gem of a coffee place, while tucked away on Aberdeen Court is Steam Yard, with a cosy feel and amazing cakes.Spend the rest of your morning checking out some of the best shops the city has to offer – in particular stroll along Division Street and the surrounding roads. Syd and Mallory sells the best handmade clothing and reworked fashion. La Biblioteka is a great little bookshop stocking a massive range of magazines and books from independent publishers, plus stationery. When I’m looking for good music, I often discover something new and fresh at Bear Tree Records – a lovely shop that sells both new and secondhand vinyl.While you wander, keep your eyes peeled. Sheffield is full of great street art, sculpture, graffiti and wall murals by local artists such as Jo Peel, Faunagraphic, Phlegm and more. Street Art Sheffield lists many of the sites if you’d like to plan ahead. One of my favourite sculptures is the Women of Steel by Martin Jennings outside City Hall. It commemorates the women who worked in the city’s steel industry during the first and second world wars.After a morning stroll, stop for lunch at Dina Diner, a vegetarian and vegan cafe attached to a music, comedy, poetry and theatre venue that is a social enterprise and platform for emerging artists. Dina is an example of what I like about most of Sheffield’s creative spaces: the really thoughtful curation. Similarly, Gloam Gallery is another great space dedicated to creativity. Gloam’s Instagram is exciting and exhibitions here are fresh and unusual. In September, the Site Gallery will also be re-opening – another great creative space to check out.For dinner head to Kelham Island and the cosy, neighbourhood restaurant Stew and Oyster. Later in the evening, check out the Delicious Clam – a record label and an unmissable DIY venue where you’re guaranteed to hear something interesting and underground. A lot of bands start out there and it’s worth catching a show if you can. Something entirely different is Public, a recently-opened cocktail bar in a converted old public toilet – it’s another small venue, and really worth it.Last but not least, be sure to check out what is one of the best railway station pubs in the country – the Sheffield Tap, a place where my husband and I love to sit and watch the world go by.

In fact, with its fixie bikes, cobbled streets, Noma-ish foraged cuisine and design-first ethos, it almost feels like a pocket of Copenhagen that just happens to be a 90-minute train ride from London. Throw in the refurbished 1920s theme park Dreamland and it all adds up to an irresistible artist’s enclave for a weekend city. Armed with effusive recommendations from my Airbnb host Clare – a trend-forecaster and trainee florist ­– I set about experiencing the best of the Kentish coast’s new capital of cool. Here’s my guide to getting the best out of a trip to this unique seaside town.Follow the foodie trailThe seafront chippies are still drawing crowds (and e-bombing seagulls) but in recent years, Margate’s culinary scene has evolved. Open since 2015, Hantverk \u0026amp Found is a seafood cafe and gallery that exemplifies that uptick in quality, whether you’re after a big last-night-of-the-trip dinner or a casual lunch slurping local rock oysters spiked with yuzu (a citrus fruit) in the suntrap garden. The food is unfussy and brightly flavoured – think clams in a spicy Korean broth and bream with a heady brown shrimp butter. The dinky emerald-tiled room adds a lively, squashed-in thrum to proceedings.For a legendary cheese toastie, and great rooftop views for sunset, head to Cheesy Tiger on the jutting Harbour Arm, my Airbnb host advises. There’s also friendly little Fez bar, a quirky, eclectic boozer close by. Or for an array of beachfront eating and drinking options, then the The Bus Cafe – with its crammed and zingy salad wraps – and the adjacent Sun Deck, are the places to head to. “There’s a really good juice bar, Po’ Boy that does great Creole-style food, and a cool tiki bar,” says Ed Warren, local and co-founder of Cliffs record shop and cafe.Sound out local musicThere aren’t many cafes where you can watch an experimental radio show broadcasting to the world and have a flat white made by a double Mercury Music prize-winning nominee. A labour of love for musician Obara Ejimiwe (aka Ghostpoet) and his creative director wife Kate, Radio Margate is a hybrid coffee shop, late-night venue and internet radio station launched in 2017 following their move from London. This sea-view space – all calming jazz and tasteful mid-century furniture – is, according to the Ejimiwes, a direct result of Margate’s contagious creative energy. “It’s totally infectious and there’s more room here to develop strong, independent ideas,” Obara says.Housed in a lovingly restored former 1920s tearoom in Cliftonville, Cliffs is a record shop that also encompasses a fitness studio, coffee roastery, hair salon, gig venue and an exceptional cafe (try the harissa oil and avocado toast). “I just wanted to sell Motown records but we got caught up in it all, like a lot of people here do,” says owner Ed Warren, explaining how he and his interior designer partner Kier Muddiman found themselves presiding over this artfully-distressed cultural fiefdom. “All these interesting little places in Margate are from the heart, basically.”Hit refreshWalpole Bay tidal pool is a must for lovers of outdoor swimming. It is the UK’s largest saltwater bathing pool, covering 4 acres (1.6 hectares), and was built in 1937. A group of locals swear by a regular swim in this beautiful coastal location, which fills up at high tide each day. “The first time I jumped in I squealed with excitement as the cold water engulfed me,” says Kathryn Ferguson, Margate resident and director of Taking the Waters, a short film about the pool. “But it felt exhilarating and from that moment I was totally hooked. A full moon swim is something I’d recommend everyone to try once.”Sticking with the theme of wellness, it’s worth stopping by natural fragrance and skincare company Haeckels to pick up a few restorative products to take home. One of the town’s most famous success stories, it was founded by Dom Bridges, a former film director who turned a hobby making soap from foraged Margate seaweed into a brand stocked in Harvey Nichols. Still, little can prepare you for the surprise of its flagship laboratory, shop and sea-based thalassotherapy spa, high up on a blustery Cliftonville parade. “It’s an example of the fact that each business has an amazing story of its own,” says Shelly Keeys, owner of shrewdly curated local fashion store Ruskin.Shop independent art and designThose that know their parlour palms from their succulents will feel at home in the jungle interior of Mar Mar, a cafe, gift shop and houseplant emporium on Northdown Road. Bolstering the town’s roster of design boutiques (homewares store Môr is worth a look too), it grew from Central St Martins graduate Boe Holder’s bold, Memphis Group-influenced creations. “She used to do pot painting and sell these great plant pots online,” says Margate-based photographer Harriet Bentley. “Now they’re selling plants, coffee, magazines and other great little things. It’s so cool.”Other interiors shops worth seeking out include: Clayspace Studios, a social enterprise and ceramics store Danish Collectables for curated Scandinavian vintage pieces Papillon Interiors for vibrant indoor and outdoor furniture and Imagineican Store, a tiny design and lifestyle studio. If you hire a bike during your trip, Westgate-on-sea is about a 15-minute cycle from Margate’s seafront, and is home to Eighty Two Westgate.Of course, one of the biggest draws in town for art is the Turner Contemporary, which opened in 2011 and sowed the first seeds for the current regenerative flowering. Smaller venues, such as Pie Factory in the Old Town, also a studio complex and, yes, former pie shop, are increasingly offering a platform to Margate’s thriving ecosystem of emerging visual artists and Turner-exhibited stars of tomorrow. “There’s such a strong creative network here,” notes Dan Chilcott, co-founder of nearby Resort Studios, who put together a June show at the Pie Factory. “As an artist, it’s right where you want to be.”Jimi Famurewa is a London-based freelance writer and editor.

The five-times world champions were in control thanks to a Philippe Coutinho screamer and the first step of the mission to avenge the trauma from the previous finals looked set to be sure-footed.Brazil swaggered about for much of the first half with Neymar – looking every inch the A-lister with his meticulously coiffured blond crop – the performer-in-chief. He repeatedly slowed to a halt in a flashy attempt to trick his marker into a rash move. Yet they were stunned when Steven Zuber headed the equaliser early in the second half and, despite a late onslaught, Brazil could not dig themselves out of the hole.It was self-inflicted. Brazil complained bitterly that Zuber’s goal ought to have been disallowed for a push on Miranda but the referee, César Ramos, was correct to ignore them. Yes, there was an element of levering for position but it was not enough to throw the centre-half off-balance. The bigger problem for Miranda was that he misread the flight of Xherdan Shaqiri’s corner and lost his man.It was weak defending and with a priceless result within their grasp, Switzerland were in no mood to relinquish it. They dug deeper, their resolve hardening, although they rode their luck during a frenetic finale. By then, Brazil had dropped the swagger and belatedly, turned up the intensity. They created a flurry of chances but the ball would not go in.Coutinho sliced wide when well-placed on 69 minutes before Neymar and the substitute Roberto Firmino headed too close to Yann Sommer. Miranda also dragged off target when gloriously placed and another substitute, Renato Augusto, had a close-range shot cleared to safety by Fabian Schär.The other controversy came in the 74th minute when Gabriel Jesus felt Manuel Akanji put his arms around him as he ran on to a pass in the area. Jesus went down but the penalty appeal was waved away. The fall looked exaggerated but the contact was there. It was risky from Akanji although even Tite, the Brazil manager, did not complain too long about it. His grievance was all about the equaliser.Brazil have cast themselves as avenging angels, even if the trauma of the 2014 World Cup – when they were humiliated 7-1 by Germany – might never truly leave them and they have not run from their status of favourites. Far from it. Neymar had posted a message on the eve of the game in which he declared himself unafraid of dreaming big. “Let’s go Brazil – for the sixth!” he wrote.They started brightly and the breakthrough goal was a peach. Neymar popped the ball off to Marcelo and his cross was headed out by Zuber but only as far as Coutinho. The midfielder took a touch before shaping a right-foot curler into the far corner. Sommer ed at full stretch but there was nothing he could do.Tite had started Coutinho on the left of a midfield three, which had Paulinho on the right and Casemiro at the base, but he had scope to roam. So did Neymar. In fact Neymar was pretty much allowed to do whatever he wanted and that included a few bursts of dramatics. Switzerland’s Valon Behrami could be seen to laugh after one first-half tumble.On the other hand there were plenty of times when his quicksilver movement was too much for Switzerland and rather than let him pass, they fouled him. The statistics showed that Neymar was fouled 10 times and, if there was nothing dangerous in the treatment, there was certainly a cynical edge to it. Stephan Lichtsteiner, Schär and Behrami were all booked for challenges on Neymar.Brazil might have led earlier. Neymar combined with Coutinho to cross low and, when Schär got himself into a tangle, Paulinho sniffed out the close-range shooting chance. He went for the far corner, scuffing it slightly, only for Sommer to make a finger-tip save. The goalkeeper did not get the credit at the time, with Ramos awarding a goal-kick rather than a corner.Blerim Dzemaili had lifted an early half-chance high from Shaqiri’s pass but the Swiss did nothing further as an attacking force in the first half. Brazil’s lead at the interval might have been greater. Thiago Silva glanced over from Neymar’s corner at the end of the period while moments earlier Akanji had snuffed out Jesus in a one-on-one last man duel.It was all Brazil and yet the game would turn sharply at the beginning of the second half. It was a soft way for Brazil to surrender the initiative and some of their players demanded Ramos refer the incident to VAR. Already such pleas are becoming a feature of the tournament. The referee did not do so and nor, presumably, was he advised to by the team of video officialsThe setback shook Brazil and for 15 minutes or so they were gripped by opening-night nerves. Tite said he and the players felt the pressure and he used the word “anxiety”. They regrouped for the final push in which Neymar was prominent, although it was noted that he appeared to be feeling his right foot. He has only just returned from ankle and metatarsal damage.On the balance of play Brazil deserved to win. They had 21 shots to Switzerland’s six but Tite could lament the lack of cutting edge. The Swiss celebrated the point. For Brazil it rang hollow."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6967b576937ba99e96ccd48b11e155df6a8b210/803_183_1787_1072/master/1787.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3db75282cb19492fa743414cc546c437","title":"costa rica serbia world cup match report","story":"In a World Cup that had already been illuminated by exquisite free-kicks, Aleksandar Kolarov provided a masterpiece of his own. This was not a performance to dispel doubts over Serbia’s ability to fully harness their array of talent but the deciding goal should be taken for what it was: a strike worthy of winning any match on this exalted stage and one that, given the taker’s identity, came as no huge surprise.There are few players who can hit a dead ball with the whip and accuracy of Kolarov and the latest example, which left Keylor Navas grasping at thin air 11 minutes into the second half, has given Serbia a fighting chance of improving their woeful record in this competition.Until Kolarov’s intervention Serbia had looked like a side falling into bad old habits. Their first-half showing had, bar a series of flourishes from the gifted Sergej Milinkovic-Savic, largely been tepid but they shifted through the gears after the interval.Kolarov was given his chance after Francisco Calvo, the otherwise impressive Costa Rica left wing-back, grappled illegally with Aleksandar Mitrovic. The position, 25 yards out and angled a little to the right of centre, was to the Roma player what the penalty spot might be to others he duly sent the ball up, down and into the one spot Navas could not reach and it was as if a lead weight had been removed from Serbian shoulders.“Frankly speaking there was a great deal of pressure on the players,” their manager, Mladen Krstajic, said. “I felt some pressure, too. But I’m very happy and proud of them for their team effort.”The tension was understandable: including games under the banner of Serbia \u0026amp Montenegro in 2006, Serbia had lost five of their previous six World Cup assignments. They began as if paralysed and should have been behind within 12 minutes. A lively start from Costa Rica had already brought a couple of half-chances when their centre-back Giancarlo González found himself free in front of the posts after a well-worked short corner. All González had to do was nod David Guzmán’s floated delivery back past Vladimir Stojkovic but his bearings went awry and, perhaps appropriately in a city that proudly wears its status as the vanguard of the Soviet space industry, sent the ball into orbit.“I get the impression that in the first 20 or 25 minutes we were very close to achieving something,” the Costa Rica manager, Óscar Ramírez, said. In his post-match press conference Ramírez was taken to task by his country’s media for, apparently, setting up too negatively. The charge is not a new one but this time it seemed harsh: they committed men forward in decent numbers when possible but were bereft of genuine creativity, a fact that became starkly evident when their pursuit of a late equaliser degenerated into a series of balls tossed aimlessly into the Serbia box.What Costa Rica really lacked was someone who could break the lines like Milinkovic-Savic, an outstanding player whose ability to emerge with the ball from seemingly lost causes prompted several double takes. As he grew into the game so did Serbia, and moments before Kolarov settled the issue he played in Mitrovic with a perfectly weighted through pass only for the forward to shoot too close to Navas. There is, presumably, more to come from a playmaker who was only winning his fifth cap and is still bedding in. Serbia looked capable of enjoying themselves when spaces opened up, Filip Kostic missing one gilt-edged chance after a fine move, but they will need to be more efficient when they face Switzerland in a match that will probably decide both teams’ group stage fortunes.“For the first time in a long time there are no clans or cliques in the squad,” Krstajic said. That, by common consent, is the difference between this Serbia side and previous generations. They were certainly quick to assist Nemanja Matic when, in the dying minutes, a minor scuffle broke out over a Costa Rica staff member’s refusal to hand him the ball. The incident was referred to VAR, as was an even later stray arm flung out by the substitute Aleksandar Prijovic. No red cards were brandished and, mercifully, Kolarov’s stroke of genius remained the abiding memory."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02a40baf2c0f9444fc6ef6f5c47a4299bdec8eed/0_102_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c0f6c297202f6b16ea2676a3edcf279","title":"gareth southgate england transfer energy world stage","story":"Coach believes his players are ready to be a bold, attacking presence in Russia starting in their opener against TunisiaIt was France 98 on the last occasion England faced Tunisia in a World Cup. That one kicked off in the middle of the day and a 2-0 win, as always with England, sent the giddy-meter spinning. The lingering memory, however, is still the line with which Des Lynam opened the television coverage. “Good afternoon,” he greeted the viewers. “Shouldn’t you be at work?”This year, it will be 9pm local time when the two sides renew acquaintances in the Volgograd Arena. Nothing changes, though, when it comes to the raised expectations surrounding England on the eve of another World Cup adventure. Or, indeed, the diminished reputation of the nation’s footballers in the wake of more disappointments than they would probably care to remember.One Russian journalist was impudent enough to ask Harry Kane in the pre-match news conference whether it was true, as he had read on social media, that the welcome gift he received in Repino earlier in the week – a golden teapot – was the first trophy he had picked up in his career. Kane took that one on the chin and pointed out that maybe he could lift the “big gold one” on 15 July.Except, of course, we have been here before, falling into the trap. Roy Hodgson’s team went into the last World Cup on the back of an unbeaten qualifying programme and with everyone noting how immaculately prepared they seemed to be behind the scenes.The training ground just beneath Sugarloaf Mountain in Rio de Janeiro was pristine. Scientists had designed specially tailored recovery drinks for each player, depending on their sweat output. Turf specialists had been brought in to make the sure the grass was the same length, to the millimetre, of the pitch of their opening game. All that was left was for England to show they could take care of a football and the standing joke, four years on, is the team were on their way home before they had even finished their anti-malaria tablets. Seven days, to be precise.England’s qualifying results for Euro 2016 were even more impressive, with an immaculate record of 10 successive wins. Then it came to the now-infamous game against Iceland – a nation ranked 133rd in the world, between Burundi and Turkmenistan, four years earlier – and the din from thousands of England supporters chanting “you’re not fit to wear the shirt” at their own players.If all this sounds slightly downbeat it should also be pointed out that speaking to Southgate here in Volgograd on Sunday was to be in the company of a man who seems entirely comfortable in his own skin. Southgate talked of his pride to be leading out his national team. “My family are incredibly patriotic,” he said. “My grandad was a marine. I’ve always been brought up with England being a core part of what we stood for and my life.”But there wasn’t even a flicker of tension and when it came to the inevitable questions about how the current side would do better than the last one – and the one before that, and so on – he made it clear that he and his players were “looking at things a different way”. What good would it do, he seemed to be saying, to keep looking back all the time? “You can learn from the past. But this team shouldn’t be burdened with it. They’re a fresh group. Most of them have very few caps. The future is all ahead of them, so they have to be thinking about what’s possible. The players, and opportunities, of the past have gone now.”That doesn’t change the fact that, psychologically, England have choked on the big stage too many times. “The first thing is to have a really clear understanding of how we want to play,” Southgate said. “When you are in tense moments of games it’s important everyone knows their inidual roles and the team is still connected on the pitch. Stick to your principles, whatever the state of the game. You have to stick to your beliefs. Look at Spain versus Portugal: whatever the stage of the game, they stuck to what they did well. You have to have the character to do that.”For England, that will mean Kieran Trippier and Ashley Young showing the confidence to advance from their wing-back positions and provide the team’s width. The three central defenders – Kyle Walker, John Stones and Harry Maguire – will be encouraged to play out from the back. Jordan Henderson will have to curtail his forward runs, as the holding midfielder, but Southgate wants Dele Alli and Jesse Lingard to make it their business to get into the Tunisia penalty area in support of Harry Kane and Raheem Sterling. It is a quick, exciting and attack-minded operation.More than anything, Southgate said he wanted his players to transfer the energetic performances he had seen in training on to a bigger platform. He said this more than once and it left the impression he was encouraged, to say the least, by what he had seen in England’s closed sessions. “They have a hunger to press, win the ball back and play brave football. They want to be a bold and attacking team. That’s how I wanted them to play.”In which case his players should not expect Southgate to try anything special with his team talk. Indeed, he is not planning to say too much just before his team, in a 3-3-2-2 formation, run out. His players, he said, were pumped up enough – and impatient to get going bearing in mind six of the eight groups are under way."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ce6e43f8bd827bf7350ca305e54de123e2404e0/0_94_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9299a073b7772c8693015889f777631c","title":"joachim low germany haphazard mexico","story":"• Holders suffer first opening World Cup defeat since 1982• Löw: ‘The next game is vital for us, We have to win it’Joachim Löw accepted his defending champions had been “negligent” and “haphazard” after Germany’s Group F defeat against Mexico in Moscow.“The next game is vital for us, we have to win it,” Löw said of a team who had lost their opening game at a World Cup for the first time since 1982.Not that the omens are too bad: West Germany reached the final on that occasion. But at the Luzhniki Stadium Löw faced an unexpectedly hostile post-match reception.Questions were asked about a selection that looked unbalanced in the first half, and about the performance of Joshua Kimmich, who was overrun at times on the German right. One local journalist even suggested Löw should have brought along the young team that had come to Moscow last year and played with such verve in a Confederations Cup semi-final victory against the same opponents.The contrast with the Mexico manager, Juan Carlos Osorio, was profound after what must rank as one of the country’s finest victories. “We try to give joy,” Osorio said. And this was a supremely entertaining show of counterattacking football, deliriously received by a strong Mexican support.“In the first half we managed today to hit them on the counter many times. We could have scored earlier. With all due respect we were superior to them. In the second half they attacked more and they made the substitutions they tend to make. We had prepared for the use of Mario Gomez in attack. We practised defending with four defenders and three players up front and that was how we almost scored a second goal. I’m very satisfied with what we did.“For the players today the phrase was to play for the love of winning not the fear of losing. And that is exactly what they did. They played with real bravery.”Löw, whose side now face Sweden on Saturday, was naturally gloomier, denying he had underestimated Mexico and insisting his players are in good physical shape. “It’s very disappointing and very usual,” he said. “In so many tournaments before we won the first game. But we have to deal with that. In the next match we have to be much better.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/04f74b1e1abe1df8cea8d62c72df47b579b72165/0_170_2835_1701/master/2835.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9386db2e535beb26fa9eaaaa3ab574c2","title":"mexico germany world cup 2018 juan carlos osorio","story":"Juan Carlos Osorio has been pilloried in the Mexican media for his constant tinkering but he masterminded a huge shock over world champions GermanyThe Mexico coach, Juan Carlos Osorio, is known for carrying a spiral notebook, in which he jots down observations and scribbles his thoughts during games. It has become a symbol of the Colombian’s meticulous planning for his team, one of the strongest line-ups Mexico has ever brought to the World Cup.All the prep work paid off on Sunday, when Mexico opened their tournament with a stunning 1-0 defeat of Germany, the reigning world champions. It was the first time the Europeans had lost their World Cup opener since 1982.The win will no doubt go down as one of Mexican football’s greatest moments. Following a run of stinging defeats that booted Mexico from six consecutive World Cups in the last 16, the team has slowly been building a stable of victories. First there was the under-17 world championship title in 2005, which was repeated in 2011 and then, of course, the gold medal for Mexico at the 2012 Olympics when they beat a Brazil team featuring Neymar.The entire country is now hoping the triumph over Germany will be the opening salvo to its best performance yet in a World Cup, and the improvements start at the top.Osorio, who paced back and forth throughout the game, while his German counterpart Joachim Löw spent most of the time hanging back on the bench, has been harshly criticized in Mexico for his coaching style. One recurrent complaint has been his constant tinkering with the squad: he has named 48 different line-ups in the 48 games he has coached so far. But the naysayers were proved wrong on Sunday after he found the perfect formula – a 4-4-2 that did a lot of damage to Germany from the wings.The win was not improvised. Osorio is a fastidious coach who studied how he could hurt Germany with surprise attacks and speedy transitions, techniques that are not typical for Mexico but are evidence of the coach’s influence over the players. “We had designed a plan,” Osorio said at the press conference following the match. “But the idea always was to have two fast players on the sides. In the first-half we defended well in the middle third of the field and went out fast.”Andrés Guardado and Héctor Herrera illustrated Mexico’s ability to outsmart Germany’s top players. They pressed forward in midfield when they had to and managed to overwhelm Sami Khedira, who was part of the team that won the World Cup four years ago. Khedira had no one to help him neutralize Mexico after Toni Kroos, who is a natural passer, proved he was not up to the task of defending Mexico’s breaks through the centre of the field. The result was Hirving “Chucky” Lozano’s goal, a perfect portrait of the entire game: Mexico cut through the German defence with an economy of movement and Lozano’s shot was too good for Manuel Neuer.In the second-half Mexico were able to hold on due to Osorio’s decision to mount a line of strong defenders, by introducing Edson Álvarez and the veteran Rafael Márquez, who became only the third player in history to participate in five consecutive World Cups. (This despite his recent brush with scandal after the US Treasury Department named him as an associate of a wanted drug trafficker, allegations he denies.) Mexico’s technique, speed and concentration then held them over for the remainder of the game.The win was also a demonstration of the talents of a new generation of Mexican stars, nine of whom have played on top European teams. The former Arsenal player Carlos Vela, for example, gave Mexico the touch of creativity they needed during his 60 minutes on the field. Vela played like a False 9, moving between the lines and providing incisive passes for the forwards. Indeed, one of those passes helped set-up Lozano’s winner. But it wasn’t just the players with European experience who shone. The entire team operated like a living organism, one that knew how to read the game quickly and adapt to outmaneuver the Germans.Now Mexico and Osorio will be looking towards their remaining group games, against South Korea and Sweden. The key will be to see if Osorio’s meticulous planning results in sustained success rather than one-off results like the Germany victory.After months of constant criticism from the Mexican media, Osorio received praise on Sunday on social media as elated fans cheered the victory. He has tried to instill in his troops not just attention to detail but self-confidence that can carry them forward on the world stage. To emphasize the point he wore a t-shirt to the pre-game press conference with an inspirational message for El Tri: “Play for the love of winning, not for the fear of losing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91531a87d7f28b93954a766e945d15e004ea859f/69_399_4766_2860/master/4766.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6fa1bcd1ff61fdd023de38bfb3bdb608","title":"pananma world cup finals god ballboys","story":"“When the goal went in, I could have gone out and got so drunk I wouldn’t have remembered a thing the next day.” You and the rest of the country,\u0026nbspHernán.The Panama manager, Hernán Darío “Bolillo” Gómez, says he is a “believer” and insists he “knew” there was a way back but time was running out and so was hope. Looking across at his players he saw “a ghost” appear before them. In the final minutes of the final game last October, they found themselves outside the qualifying places – the dream of a first World Cup denied at the last, as it had been four years earlier. Drawing with Costa Rica, Panama desperately needed a goal from somewhere, anywhere.What came next was, says Édgar Carvajal, the assistant manager, “like something handed down by God”. A long ball, headed on by Luis Tejada, and there, steaming in, was Román Torres – the centre‑back, a huge, dreadlocked figure. “I still get goosebumps,” Carvajal says. The ball crashed into the net. Torres turned, whipped off his shirt, leapt the advertisement boards and raced along the running track, fans clambering on to fences, drinks thrown into the air.“We had visualised it, dreamed, longed for that moment,” says Gabriel Gómez, the country’s most capped player, gazing at the goal where the ball went in. He turns, looks the other way. “We’d been knocked out at this other end four years before and that hurt. This time it all came off: the result from Trinidad where the USA unexpectedly lost and our goal, which came just at the right moment.” Panama – yes, Panama – were going to the World Cup.Not quite. It was the 88th minute, two minutes plus stoppage time to hang on and never, ever let go. An injury-time goal had cost them the chance of going to Brazil 2014 and they could not let that happen again. Crying ballboys kicked balls into the stands, never to be returned. A\u0026nbspsubstitute leapt from the bench, ran over and booted another as far away as he could. A few more seconds spent. Then someone turned the lights out.From the office under the stand where she works, Elida de\u0026nbspMitchel appeared on the pitch, walking straight past the referee, and pretended to faint. It was a policeman’s idea. Anything to stop the game, run down the clock. Three minutes she was there before eventually Gabriel Gómez and the substitute goalkeeper José Calderón “helped” her off, asking what was happening in the other game as they went. The USA were still losing, she said. “Sure?” “Yes, you’re in the World Cup!” When the whistle at last went Bollillo slipped to his knees, gripping a ball. As he and Torres rolled round together the goalscorer shouted: “You deserve this!”One of the photos Bolillo is fondest of shows Torres embracing a fan who is on the track, not in the stands as he should be. A policeman arrives and hugs both. Beyond the Rommel Fernández stadium in Panama City, there was pandemonium, people flooding the streets. The players paraded on the back of a fire engine. Alcohol sold out and the party ran all night. The president declared the next day a national holiday. “The emotion, the satisfaction, the belief,” Bolillo says. “In life you can dream and dreams can come true.”On Monday they face Belgium in Sochi. “It will be emotional,” says the striker Blas Pérez, whose international career goes back 17 years. “It was always a dream and when I’m standing there listening to the anthem at the World Cup, I don’t know how I’ll react.” Felipe Baloy also began his international journey in 2001. “I’ve had a long career, lots of falls, lots of sadness this is a reward for many of us,” he says. “I feel lucky to be involved the whole country will enjoy this.”The journey had been hard. “Ooooh, very hard,” Bolillo says. There were defeats, tension, even death, the midfielder Amílcar Henríquez gunned down outside his home. After one game in Mexico there had been a fight in the dressing room, encouraged by the manager, shouting: “Go on then, hit each other! Do it!” “Cathartic,” he calls it.The Colombian, who had taken his country and Ecuador to the World Cup, arrived on a mission to do the same with Panama. Only two squad members play in Panama but only five are in Europe – two in Belgium, plus Romania, Slovakia and Spain – and while the rest play in the Americas that does not include Brazil, Argentina or Uruguay. Torres plays for Seattle Sounders. Traditionally, baseball and boxing are bigger than football, although that is changing.“We worked in central America and had seen Panama,” Carvajal says. “We always thought: ‘This team has to go to the World Cup,’ but it’s difficult football is underdeveloped here. Bolillo is perfect for groups like this, giving them the professionalism they lack. Physically, Panamanian players are very good and have belief: they see Germany and think they can take them on mano a mano but we had to develop other aspects. This is the Profe’s fifth World Cup he had a lot to teach them.”“The principal thing is not the pitch it’s how you live,” Bolillo says. “You have to build good people, a family. When I arrived there were countless off-field problems. It’s more important to be a good leader than a good coach, someone to say: ‘I know what this is, how this works.’”Discipline was vital, just as it had been for the previous manager, Julio Dely Valdés. Bolillo talks about how football makes you pay for “poor living”. He says: “Last time Panama weren’t a family, they didn’t behave well and football said ‘no’. This time, ‘luck’ fell differently. Why? Because we deserved it to.”Yet while Valdés imposed discipline, Bolillo delegated, trusting in the veterans to lead. There is loyalty to them, then? “And gratitude,” he says. “I slept easy.”As the game progressed, it really was. “We were never out of the World Cup … until then,” Bollillo says. By half-time, the USA were 2-0 down but Panama trailed 1-0 to Costa Rica. “You’re doing things you haven’t done for three years,” Bolillo shouted in the dressing room. “There’s no bollocks, nothing! If you’re scared, turn out the lights, we’ll go home. No talking now, show it. Show it!”Pérez equalised soon after, scoring a goal that did not go over the line. The news from Trinidad was that the USA had pulled one back, too.“It’s inevitable you look to the bench, wondering about that score, thinking: ‘They haven’t said anything,’” Gómez says. “And we kept going forward, bravely.” They had to. A first World Cup was at stake.As they went out for the second half, Torres shouted, the expletive in English: “There are 45 fucking minutes left!” By the time he went forward for the last time, it was down to three."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b673c0f0a31778ba6041ba638e2d433788e81598/381_380_2031_1219/master/2031.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=20615ec333e4b88526e06e282ffb6dcf","title":"sir matt busby airbrushed from liverpool fc history","story":"Once the law is eventually passed to class upskirting as the criminal offence it clearly is (Upskirting bill is blocked by single Tory objection, 16 June), can the powers that be take this opportunity to give it a more appropriate name?

These are days on which I prefer to start cooking early, before the sun turns the kitchen into a furnace, and for which I need good-natured recipes that appreciate being taken from the oven and left to rest a while. I’m looking for dishes just as good served warm or even cold as they are straight from the oven.With this in mind, I did a lamb roast this week – a boned breast or two, stuffed with spinach, spring onions and feta cheese – that was as pleasing served warm as it was hot. The flavours reminded me of something I had eaten long ago, on holiday in Greece one very hot summer. The next day we carved it very, very thinly and ate it with a salad of lamb’s lettuce and green-shouldered tomatoes with a dressing of olive oil and enough white-wine vinegar to make our lips tingle.A second roast, of crisp-skinned duck and oranges, seemed all the better for being made an hour or so before we ate it. We folded the roast breast and leg meat, torn in fat chunks from its bones, through a bowl of stock-swollen couscous, then used the fat from the duck and juice from the roasted oranges as a dressing. It crossed my mind that this would be good with roast pork, too, or any meat with a generous amount of fat that can become part of the dressing.Whichever meat you choose, the result is a leisurely roast-cum-salad, which this time I folded through with a crisp tangle of sweet green pea shoots. (I could have used watercress or wild rocket crisped up in iced water.)Relaxed food for a great summer.Ask your butcher for breasts of lamb with the bones removed. It will speed up the process and save you an unnecessary half-hour of home butchery. When you add the cooked and drained peas to the roasting tin, turn them over in the pan juices from the roast – it will add much savour.Set the oven at 200Cgas mark 6. Remove the stalks from the spinach and wash the leaves thoroughly under cold running water. The leaves still wet, pile them into a deep pan over a moderate heat then cover tightly with a lid. Let the leaves cook for 2 or 3 minutes in their own steam, shaking the pan so they soften evenly. As soon as they are bright green and wilted, remove from the heat and plunge into iced water. Squeeze the leaves to remove the water, then chop them roughly and set them aside in a bowl.Roughly chop the mint leaves, then add them to the spinach, together with a generous seasoning of black pepper.Roughly chop the spring onions, then let them soften in the olive oil in a shallow pan over a medium heat. Add the spring onions to the spinach, crumble in the feta cheese in small lumps, then mix lightly.Lay the breasts of lamb flat on a work surface and spread the spinach filling over them, leaving a small rim of meat around the edges, then roll them up and secure with butcher’s string. Place the rolled breasts in a roasting tin, rub them lightly with olive oil and crumbled sea salt, then roast them for one hour. Remove them from the oven and leave them to rest, covered with foil.Cook the peas in boiling, lightly salted water for a few minutes until tender, then drain them and tip them into the tin around the lamb. Carve the lamb into thick slices and serve.I see no reason why this recipe wouldn’t work perfectly neatly with chicken, but the point of using duck is to harness all the glorious fat that assembles in the roasting tin, spiked with the juices of the warm orange.Set the oven at 200Cgas mark 6. Put the pieces of duck in a roasting tin and slash them, just deep enough to go through the skin and fat, every 3 or 4 cm. Peel and halve the shallots lengthways, then add them to the tin, together with the orange cut in half, and leave them to roast in the preheated oven for about an hour. They are ready when the skin is lightly crisp. Remove and set aside.Bring the stock to the boil. Put the couscous in a large mixing bowl then pour over the boiled stock, cover with a lid and set aside for about 15 minutes until the water has been absorbed by the grains of couscous. Squeeze the roast orange halves over the couscous. Break up the shallots and stir them into the couscous, then check the seasoning, adding salt and black pepper.Tear the duck to pieces – torn pieces look better than chopped – then fold them into the couscous. Wash and shake dry the pea shoots then toss them with the parsley and coriander leaves. Fold the herbs and shoots into the couscous and serve."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a15915999a90cc714357e54fdc9c1c54294b6c3/220_302_5139_6420/master/5139.jpg?w=1200\u0026amp;h=630\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;crop=faces%2Centropy\u0026amp;bm=normal\u0026amp;ba=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxOC8wMS8zMS9mYWNlYm9va19vcGluaW9ucy5wbmc\u0026amp;s=a5c429861ca66bb6cb8858a851a9bd0f","title":"this years bikinis are built for love island not center  parcs","story":"You really have to have the body of someone built for nothing but bikini wearing not to feel ridiculous in this summer’s garments, writes Eva WisemanLast weekend, I saw hell in a Topshop mirror. Hours I spent, whole ironed-out hours – time would go very slowly and then very fast and suddenly it was 5pm – in the changing rooms of a selection of high-street shops, trying on swimming costumes. I was going to Center Parcs on the Monday you see (by the time this is published I will have enjoyed a week with three generations of my partner’s family under its magical dome), and had been wearing the same bikini since I was 18. I needed something that would not slide off on a slide.So I started by strolling among the racks with my usual meditative glee at being among so many possibilities of transformation, many of them neon, and entered the changing rooms feeling good, feeling fine, feeling like a person, with a body, who might take it swimming on Monday. That feeling lasted until I stepped into the first swimsuit and yes, saw hell. A waterproof apocalypse.If I might take a moment to talk about my body? It’s a sort of meaty trunk of flesh, with everything, I thought, largely where it should be, ie 1 x belly, 2 x nipples, 2 x legs, 2 x arms, etc, the former in the middle, the latter closer to the edge. If there were a size 11, it would be that, neither obese nor emaciated, sturdy, effective, and yet, it turns out, entirely the wrong shape for a swimming costume. To begin with, the gussets. Usually there’s a selection of bottoms, from shorts to thongs, but this year, the fashion is for a very narrow chocolate eclair sort of shape that extends between the legs and up towards the belly button, requiring even the blondest of women to depilate almost an acre of flesh. So that’s the gussets.But I was prepared for that, and indeed had taken it into consideration when selecting swimsuits, leaving behind a number of costumes that, rather than offer a covering for one’s genitals, instead provided a sort of will-this-do mental floss, like a hastily erected crucifix to show where one has buried the cat. But even the kinder gussets provided only a suggestion of arse coverage, the designer perhaps having never seen a human bottom, instead having only studied medical charts about digestion.I’ve always enjoyed a bikini. No longer. Today’s bikinis are created only for people such as Love Island contestants, for whom the ability to wear a bikini with confidence is the basis of their career. Purchasing one is as ridiculous as, say, a chef buying a chisel – it is the wrong tool for the job. Haters are going to say, “Didn’t she have a baby? Isn’t she in her mid to late-30s with a largely sedentary lifestyle? Isn’t that why she can’t find a flattering bikini?” To them I’d say, yes yes, but surely even the most Hobnobbed of us should be encouraged to swim? Should expect that, at the very least, a bikini should contain the rudest parts of our body, rather than, as these ones did, offer the merest suggestion of coverage, and that’s standing up. Lying down in one of these fabric panic rooms made of three Doritos threaded together with a kind of lurid vine would cause a whole body to puddle beneath the sun lounger.Bikinis though – bikinis, we’ve all held a women’s magazine in June, we all know that we must protect the world from the sight of women in bikinis after the age of 28, what was I thinking? Twist! After a day’s research I can confirm that this season’s all-in-one swimsuits are by far the more obscene choice. They are cut narrowly, to expose the erotic “side-boob”, but if you are larger than a B cup, then they offer a whole teapot of tit to your neighbouring bather. Nothing is adjustable nothing is safe. At any point you might look to your left and greet an entire breast or buttock that has escaped and has been enjoying your conversation with the waiter for some time, just so so pleased with itself.There is a trend, this year, for “cut-outs”. These are shapes hacked out of swimsuits in unlikely places to add interest and mystery – is it a swimming costume, is it a bikini? Who knows! The result, apart from inevitable tanning complications, is a costume with built-in landmines – step carefully, women of 2018, for these cut-outs are liable to take a whole breast off. While also creating little pouches of excitable flesh that will burst through the nylon like summer hernias, hello! Hello, I love you!I travelled home gingerly, in this body that had been exposed to me as trouble, resigned to a holiday sat by the side, cheering the children on. Waving with a hand now revealed to me as a swollen meat puppet, balanced on the end of something wobbly, attached to a machine so complicated and mottled that it should not be driven in public, and certainly not in water. Thanks to this season’s swimwear, Center Parcs slides will be safe from the groaning problem of my body, for this year at least.After I wrote about migraines, hundreds wrote in suggesting cures, including coffee, magnesium, therapy and fasting.

His tenure comes to an end with a final broadcast on 13 December 2018.His decision to leave the high-profile Thursday night discussion show will open up a fierce competition among candidates who hope to replace him. Leading internal candidates include the Newsnight presenters Emily Maitlis and Kirsty Wark, the Today programme hosts Nick Robinson and Mishal Husain, and Desert Island Discs’ Kirsty Young.The BBC could choose to go for a more leftfield choice such as Victoria Derbyshire, whose morning news show has won a series of awards, or the 5Live presenter Emma Barnett, who received plaudits after standing in for Andrew Marr on his Sunday programme earlier this year.Dimbleby is one of only three presenters to have hosted Question Time since it was first broadcast in 1979. The others were Robin Day and Peter Sissons. There is likely to be pressure for the programme’s new chair to be a woman.The current host has gained a cult following during his time on the programme, attracting parody Twitter accounts and even dancing competitions. “I do know there’s a Dimblebot and there’s a Dimbledance and I can do it too,” he said on the show in 2011. Dimbleby has only ever missed one episode of the show, when he was admitted to hospital after being kicked by a cow at his rural Sussex home in 2009.The presenter has also anchored the BBC’s election night coverage since 1979. Four years ago the broadcaster announced that he would be replaced in this role by the News at Ten host Huw Edwards but Dimbleby has managed to cling on, leading television coverage of the EU referendum and last year’s general election. Dimbleby is from a broadcasting family. His father was the pioneering BBC journalist Richard Dimbleby, who provided commentary on the Queen’s coronation and hosted Panorama. His brother is Jonathan Dimbleby, who has hosted Question Time’s sister programme Any Questions? on BBC Radio 4 since 1987."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37a64c8e0a5a540fa47b6591bc98d040c53bc34f/0_44_6428_3857/master/6428.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24339d70ebd948b305cfbabd13cfa95a","title":"credit debit cards fees costs rules","story":"Rules designed to protect the consumer from extra credit and debit card charges seem to have backfiredIt was meant to be the end of the rip-off that cost consumers hundreds of millions of pounds a year. In January, all extra charges for using a credit or debit card to pay for goods and services were banned to prevent nasty surprises at the checkout. However, five months on, increases in the cost of transactions by Visa and Mastercard mean consumers now face the prospect of paying more for goods and services.UK traders have to pay £1bn extra a year to Visa alone, after the US-owned giant doubled its fees for every card payment. This means smaller retailers are, in turn, being forced to increase their prices to cover the extra charges, thus undermining January’s surcharge ban.Every time a customer uses a credit or debit card to make a purchase, the trader has to pay a proportion to the bank – known as the “acquirer” – that processes the payment. Part of this, called the “merchant service charge”, is an “interchange” fee, which the bank then passes on to the card issuer – usually the customer’s bank.Other parts are a charge levied by the “acquiring bank” to cover the cost of processing the transaction, and a “card scheme fee” that goes to Visa or Mastercard. The fees fluctuate.In 2015, the EU introduced rules to cap increasingly high interchange fees. It was on the back of these reforms that UK traders have been banned from charging customers a levy at the checkout.Before the ban, customers could see the extra charge for using a card and had the option of choosing a cheaper payment method, whereas now everyone has to shoulder the cost, whether they use cash or card.“It’s a classic example of the unintended consequences of regulation,” says James Daley, managing director of campaign group Fairer Finance. “All the regulator has done is squeeze one end of the balloon, and made the other end bigger.”Some traders may be forced to stop accepting cards or close, according to the British Retail Consortium (BRC), which represents UK shops. “As consumers do not pay to use their cards, there is little awareness of increasing fees, but they – like any other cost – are ultimately paid for by the consumer,” it says. “As card fees have increased, retailers are faced with a choice of raising prices or absorbing costs to remain competitive.”According to CMSPI, a payments consultancy that advises traders, the fees are likely to rise further. As its chief economist, Callum Godwin, explains, it’s the smaller businesses that are likely to be hit hardest. “The latest increases have been targeted at those with a low average transaction value, such as local cafes and corner shops, hitting the weakest when the high street is already suffering,” he says.“Visa and Mastercard are forcing up the cost of accepting cards without justification in order to boost their profits and they know that their cards are so widely used it has become near-impossible for merchants to refuse to accept them.”So far, however, the PSR has dragged its heels. It says that at the launch of its annual plan in March, “we outlined that a variety of observations had been raised about different aspects of card payments and that, in the year ahead, we will be taking a deeper look at how this market works”. It adds that details of the investigation have yet to be finalised.Visa and Mastercard deny profiteering at the expense of retailers, but both refuse to disclose card scheme fees. “The figures quoted are misleading and overinflated,” Visa says. “Our pricing means we can invest in world-leading cyber security and consumer protection, in innovation such as contactless and mobile payments, and in providing a global network which enables billions to make purchases safely, securely and reliably.”Mastercard tells the Observer that its services increase custom for businesses and its fees represent the smallest percentage of the merchant service charge. “As with any payment method there are associated costs,” it says. “Our fees reflect the clear value of accepting Mastercard and the significant investment we have made in payment technology and security.”Customers have embraced the convenience of plastic without realising the hidden costs. Before the surcharge ban, they could see how much extra they would have to pay to use a credit or debit card at the checkout and opt to use a different method to avoid the charge. Now, as the costs are fed into high street prices, they are undetectable and unavoidable and affect cash as well as card payers.Earlier this month the government finished a consultation on the future of digital payments including the cost of card payments. Meanwhile, the European commission is reviewing the effects of the interchange fee regulations on costs, and CMSPI has launched a Europe-wide petition for it to include scheme fees.However, campaigners are calling on the UK regulator to take immediate action to protect the high street. “There has been shocking regulatory failure,” says Mark Falcon, former director of regulation and strategy with the PSR and founder of the financial consultancy Zephyre.“Instead, the money has been erted to scheme fees, which go to Visa and Mastercard as profit, and the regulator should take action.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/792c9e65dc3080ed46e054742a2fc13f0f2da990/0_0_4581_3052/master/4581.jpg?w=1010\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=3cba81f1507bb79fd4189e64ee786e5b 2020w","title":"mod may duck decision on army numbers in review","story":"Final draft of Modernising Defence Programme looks likely to be messy compromiseThe Ministry of Defence is struggling to complete a review aimed at modernising British forces in the face of a renewed threat from Russia and new threats such as cyber and electronic warfare.The review was supposed to be finished in time for Theresa May to brief Nato allies including Donald Trump at what is shaping up to be a potentially fractious summit in Brussels on 11 and 12 July. The MoD has failed to resolve many of the nitty-gritty issues involved in its review, stymied by black holes in its budget and threats of Tory backbench revolts if too many traditional capabilities are abandoned. The final draft of the Modernising Defence Programme (MDP) looks likely to be a messy compromise, setting out the threat posed by Russia while ducking politically and financially difficult decisions about the size of the army, equipment orders and other issues until later this year or beyond. The MoD, the Cabinet Office and the Treasury are still working on the review.One of the most vocal of Conservative MPs on the issue, Johnny Mercer, a former army captain, said: “It is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to define what a modern UK defence force should look like.”He said he and service personnel were looking for an end to speculation about cuts. Asked what his response would be if the review fails to provide detailed proposals, he said: “That would be unacceptable. I will not accept a fudge.”Conservative backbenchers expressed concern when it was leaked that two amphibious landing ships, HMS Albion and HMS Bulwark, were to be taken out of service, and the army and Royal Marines cut.The review is unlikely to go into such detail when published in the next few weeks, but it is understood that, given the two ships have become totemic for Tory backbenchers, at least one and perhaps both of them will be saved. HMS Albion is at present part of a flotilla enforcing sanctions on North Korea. The defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, is scheduled to meet the chancellor, Philip Hammond, this week to press for more money for the MoD. Given the demands for increased spending from other departments such as health, it will be an uphill task.Williamson can argue, however, that the UK will come under pressure from Trump, alongside other European members of Nato, to raise defence spending. A government source said: “The US wants to see greater commitment from the likes of Britain, France and other countries.”The US is having to send marines to Norway, viewed by Nato as vulnerable to Russian pressure, to fill a gap after the UK stopped sending Royal Marines there for training exercises as a money saving measure.“The strategic environment has changed for the worse, and this defence review must reflect this. The UK needs to be in a position to deter and challenge peer adversaries equipped with a full range of modern military technologies who seek to use them in way that confuse our traditional conceptions of warfare,” the report says.“The likelihood of operating in contested environments across all five domains – maritime, land, air, cyber and space – should be reflected in this force structure.”An MoD spokesperson said they would not speculate on the outcome of the programme.The UK defence budget has been skewed by the nuclear programme – £31bn on four new nuclear missile-delivering submarines, which excludes work on new warheads – and two new aircraft carriers, due to be operational by 2023. A cost-cutting option would be to reduce the number of American F-35s planned to operate from the carriers. Other cost-cutting proposals include buying ships off the shelf rather than the long delays and expense involved in building them to order. The kind of details backbenchers and allies are looking for is whether the army will be cut from its present 77,000 to create a more mobile force that can be deployed at speed. One analyst said that although a tank invasion of eastern Europe by Russia was highly unlikely, a feasible scenario would be an incursion of Russian special forces into Norway or the unexpected arrival of a team of Russian advisers in a disputed part of the Balkans, and that would require a quick deployment.The review began last summer as part of a look at UK security and defence as a whole, taking in the intelligence agencies as well as the MoD. In January, however, as concern grew that the defence spending problems were proving to be too big a headache, the MoD was hived off for separate review.Prof Malcolm Chalmers, the deputy director general of the defence thinktank the Royal United Services Institute, who wrote a report in February on the review, said: “I don’t think we are going to see an end to the MDP review process before the Nato summit. We will, it appears, see some announcement of the principles around which the government is reviewing defence. But will we see the end to speculation on army numbers and marine support or other capabilities? I think that is most unlikely.”He said that unless there was significantly more money from the Treasury, there would be more minuses than pluses from the review. “I don’t see an appetite from the government at present to conclude a review on that basis,” he said.

It’s fair to say the casual visitor might wonder why they are so excited by the scruffy frame containing a few cobwebby grey-brown wisps, discovered during a £4.1m redevelopment of the museum.However, the scientists are convinced the battered label, which reads “Feathers of Moa”, is correct and the wisps are the remains of huge flightless birds, some standing three metres tall, that were hunted to extinction more than 600 years ago after Polynesian people settled in New Zealand.The museum’s collection holds about two million objects – “nobody is quite sure, there really are an awful lot of very small insects,” said museum manager Jack Ashby – all of which had to be moved to temporary storage, their condition checked, and returned to the displays or the gleaming new stores. Stuart Turner, a technician, found the feathers at the back of an old cupboard, read the faded label, and took them to the curators. If a DNA test confirms the feathers are indeed of the moa, they will be a major addition to the fossil bone evidence for the unfortunate creatures, which, like the dodo, proved disastrously edible.The museum’s new entrance hall is dominated by the 21 metre (69ft) skeleton of a fin whale, a creature Ashby knows well. When he studied in the same building as an undergraduate, the whale was suspended from the concrete roof over an open air piazza, where it survived as a pigeon roost for 45 years. Every inch was cleaned before it could be moved indoors, and it is in remarkably good condition considering its eventful afterlife. The whale was beached at Pevensey in 1865 and bought by a showman, who somehow moved it to the cricket ground at Hastings and let the public in for sixpence a head (children half price). As Ashby points out, the visitors must have had strong stomachs: an archive photograph clearly shows that the huge carcass had started to bloat and decompose.The displays include many other extinct creatures, including a sloth that stood as tall as a giraffe. One of Ashby’s favourites is the diprotodon, a cousin of the wombat as big as a rhinoceros. It too is believed to have been hunted to extinction: with its enormous body carried on tree-trunk sized legs, one diprotodon was a lot of meat.Coiled up in a jar there is a small octopus, believed to have been kept as a pet by Charles Darwin on HMS Beagle. He wrote excitedly to London about watching it changing colour, thinking it a new discovery. His mentor John Stevens Henslow replied kindly that he had reported the phenomenon himself, “but not in such perfection as you seem to have done”.Hundreds of the objects are on display for the first time, but many marvels remain in the stores, including an antique wooden crate neatly labelled “a selection of dried hearts and stomachs etc”.Attenborough has described the museum as of the highest importance – “a place where the public can come to see, study and wonder”.Prof Paul Brakefield, director of the museum, which is still a teaching collection as well as a free public resource, said he would be excited to open the doors on 23 June. “Museums like ours play such an important role in inspiring awe and excitement in the natural world, as well as helping to answer genuinely world-changing challenges like climate change and bioersity loss.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4afa9e6e04d007c9b1d34a4772fa69bb8ef68c54/70_263_2837_1703/master/2837.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e94b568022253ee07fd16313384941f9","title":"brooks koepka history tommy fleetwood retain us open","story":"• Floridian becomes third man since the war to win back to back• Fleetwood shoots a record-equalling 63 and loses by a shotThe only problem with Tommy Fleetwood’s making of history was Brooks Koepka’s eagerness to do likewise. On a Long Island Sunday when Fleetwood joined the elite group who have shot 63 in the US Open, the Englishman’s bid for a maiden major title came up agonisingly short. Koepka is just the third man since the second world war and the seventh in history to defend the US Open title successfully.Koepka’s triumph came by one shot, at one over par, from the inspired Fleetwood. Koepka was even afforded the luxury of a bogey at the last before signing for a 68. The Florida native will not be in the ever-growing queue for those looking to criticise the United States Golf Association. It has, after all, bestowed $4m worth of cheques on him over back-to-back Junes.Koepka had not foreseen this scenario even two months ago. He had fallen victim to a long-term wrist injury so serious that the lifting of a coffee cup was problematic. After a doctor remedied the problem, he set his sights on defending the trophy claimed at Erin Hills 12 months earlier. It was, at that stage, a long shot.Koepka’s versatility was demonstrated here. Whereas a year ago he indulged in a scoring blitz to win at 16 under par, Shinnecock Hills required a battle-hardened approach. Koepka had been unflappable when reaching the turn in 33 and notching a birdie at the 10th. Thereafter came the key moments the 28-year-old rattled home a bogey putt at the 11th when a far higher score had looked probable. He also saved par from tricky situations at the 12th and 13th before a wonderful approach to the par-five 16th gave him the two-shot cushion that was to prove crucial.For so long, this looked like being Fleetwood’s major. The Southport man was six shots adrift of the lead after 54 holes, meaning his final round was over by 4pm. What a final round it was, though Fleetwood made eight birdies and one bogey, at the 9th. There was a bittersweet element, too, as he missed birdie chances at the 16th and 18th – the latter from nine feet – when seeking to become the first player to post 62 in the US Open.“I knew I had chances for the record but it is something very special to shoot 63 in the final round of the US Open,” he said. “It feels strange to feel a little disappointed not to have shot 62 but it’s been a great day and to equal the record is very special. There’s not many people who have done it, so it’s very special and one of the best days I’ve ever had on a golf course.“The crowds were amazing. They are always great with me and I am very grateful for the support I get over here. When I went on that run on the back nine I was just loving getting everybody going and roaring for me. It was very cool. That walk down 18 will live with me for a long time.”Indeed, by the time he took to the 72nd green the American galleries were chanting the name of Fleetwood. Such a scenario is almost unheard of for a European player when the leaderboard is laden with stars and stripes.Dustin Johnson, one of four co-leaders at the start of the day, delivered the kind of wasteful putting performance which also undermined his US Open dream at Chambers Bay in 2015. The world No\u0026nbsp1 finished third at plus-three on account of a 70.Patrick Reed’s charge had fuelled prospects of victory at the Masters and US Open in the same season. He played his first seven holes in five under par. The brakes were soon applied, however, Reed dropping shots at the 9th, 11th and 12th. His 68 meant fourth place, one ahead of Tony Finau.The USGA, so wounded by fierce criticism of the course set-up on day three, loosened the shackles for the closing day. That, of course, suggests the tournament organisers are unclear as to what precisely they want from the US Open. The dramatic shift in scoring patterns between rounds three and four hardly pointed towards a planning masterclass.Rickie Fowler’s 65 was 19 shots better than he had produced on Saturday. Fleetwood improved 16 strokes from day three. Hideki Matsuyama signed for a 13-shot swing to the good. Phil Mickelson, the man at the centre of epic controversy, turned an 81 into a 69 before beating a hasty retreat to avoid post-round interviews.Justin Rose left himself with too much ground to make up having produced sixes at the 4th and 5th. A 73 and plus-seven total meant a share of 10th. His fellow Englishman, Tyrell Hatton, was a shot better off and tied sixth. Yet this was Koepka’s day, again. What a lucrative habit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9bc2ad07df9a67db1f536e261338b84247ce69f2/0_112_3053_1832/master/3053.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ee2109c4ae125925426ad6f183d238c5","title":"johanna konta ashleigh barty final","story":"Johanna Konta, who blew a 4-1 lead in the deciding set, was furious with the chair umpire over a poor line call and stormed off court to cool down before returning to congratulate Ashleigh Barty for winning the Nature Valley Open in Nottingham on Sunday.“This is an absolute joke.

You are making decisions that affect all our lives,” Konta shouted at the umpire before completing the final, which Barty won 6-3, 3-6, 6-4 in a tense, see-sawing match that lasted just over two hours.

Has the problem gone away – or is it getting worse?In November of last year, I read an article in the New York Times about disturbing videos targeted at children that were being distributed via YouTube. Parents reported that their children were encountering knock-off editions of their favourite cartoon characters in situations of violence and death: Peppa Pig drinking bleach, or Mickey Mouse being run over by a car. A brief Google of some of the terms mentioned in the article brought up not only many more accounts of inappropriate content, in Facebook posts, newsgroup threads, and other newspapers, but also disturbing accounts of their effects. Previously happy and well-adjusted children became frightened of the dark, prone to fits of crying, or displayed violent behaviour and talked about self-harm – all classic symptoms of abuse. But despite these reports, YouTube and its parent company, Google, had done little to address them. Moreover, there seemed to be little understanding of where these videos were coming from, how they were produced – or even why they existed in the first place.I’m a writer and artist, with a focus on the broad cultural and societal effects of new technologies, and this is how most of my obsessions start: getting increasingly curious about something and digging deeper, with an eye for concealed infrastructures and hidden processes. It’s an approach that has previously led me to investigate Britain’s system of deportation flights or its sophisticated road surveillance network, and this time it took me into the weird, surreal, and often disturbing hinterland of YouTube’s children’s videos. And these videos are worrying on several levels. As I spent more and more time with them, I became perturbed not just by their content, but by the way the system itself seemed to reproduce and exacerbate their most unsavoury excesses, preying on children’s worst fears and bundling them up into nightmare playlists, while blindly rewarding their creators for increasing their view counts even as the videos themselves descended into meaningless parodies and nonsensical stories.For adults, it’s the sheer weirdness of many of the videos that seems almost more disturbing than their violence. This is the part that’s harder to explain – and harder for people to understand – if you don’t immerse yourself in the videos, which I’d hardly recommend. Beyond the simple knock-offs and the provocations exists an entire class of nonsensical, algorithm-generated content millions and millions of videos that serve merely to attract views and produce income, cobbled together from nursery rhymes, toy reviews, and cultural misunderstandings. Some seem to be the product of random title generators, others – so many others – involve real humans, including young children, distributed across the globe, acting out endlessly the insane demands of YouTube’s recommendation algorithms, even if it makes no sense, even if you have to debase yourself utterly to do it.When I wrote an essay about the videos online, the public reaction largely mirrored my own. On the one hand, people were horrified to find out that these videos existed, and on the other, completely weirded out by the sheer scale and strangeness of what they found. The combination sent the article viral: it was shared and read online millions of times, picked up by websites and newspapers around the world, and even resulted in questions being asked in the European parliament. Finally, YouTube started to respond, although its efforts, and the results, have been mixed.YouTube’s initial proposal was to restrict advertising on disturbing content aimed at children – but its proposals failed to engage honestly with its own platform. It’s estimated that 400 hours of content are uploaded to the site every minute. Policing it by hand is impossible instead, YouTube relies on flagging by viewers to drive official review – which is hardly suitable when the first people to view this stuff are small children, and the damage is already done. YouTube has also touted the technological cure-all of machine learning as its preferred solution – but in April, it finally agreed that the dedicated YouTube Kids app would switch to entirely human moderation, effectively admitting that the approach didn’t work.As a result, while many videos have since been removed from the website, uncountable numbers still remain. In March, Wired catalogued a slew of violent accounts and demonstrated that it was possible to go from a popular children’s alphabet video to a Minnie Mouse snuff film in 14 steps, just by following YouTube’s own recommendations. As of last week, Googling the title of one of the now-removed videos mentioned in the New York Times article (“PAW Patrol Babies Pretend to Die Suicide by Annabelle Hypnotized”) results in a link to a near-identical video still hosted on the site (“PAW PATROL Babies Pretend To Die MONSTER HANDS From MIRROR! Paw Patrol Animation Pups Save For Kids”), in which the adorable pups don a freakish clip-art monster mask to terrify one another before being lured off a rooftop by a haunted doll. Is “Save For Kids” supposed to read “Safe For Kids”? Either way, it is not, and it’s obvious that just playing whack-a-mole with search terms and banned accounts is never going to solve entangled problems of copyright infringement, algorithmic recommendation, and ad-driven monetary incentives on a billion-view platform with no meaningful human oversight.Whether these videos are deliberately malicious, “merely” trolling, or the emergent effect of complex systems, isn’t the point. What’s new is that the system in which such violence proliferates is right in front of us, and visibly complicit, if we choose to see it for what it is. I titled that original essay “Something is wrong on the internet” because it seemed and still seems to me that the issues made glaringly obvious by the scandal are not limited to children’s content, nor to YouTube. First among these is how systems of algorithmic governance, rather than leading us towards the sunny uplands of equality and empowerment, continually re-enact and reinforce our existing prejudices, while oppressing those with the least understanding of, and thus power over, the systems they’re enmeshed in.Take YouTube’s recommendation system for starters, which doesn’t differentiate between Disney movies and a grainy animation cooked up by a bot farm in China. Essentially what the seemingly benign “if you like that, you’ll like this” mechanism is doing is training young children – practically from birth – to click on the first thing that comes along, regardless of the source. This is the same mechanism that sees Facebook slide fake political ads and conspiracy theories into the feeds of millions of disaffected voters, and the outcome – ever more extreme content and ided viewpoints – is much the same. Add the sheer impossibility of working out where these videos come from (most are anonymous accounts with thousands of barely differentiated uploads) and the viewer is adrift in a sea of existential uncertainty, which starts to feel worryingly familiar in a world where opaque and unaccountable systems increasingly control critical aspects of our everyday lives.In the months since first writing about YouTube’s weird video problem, I’ve met a few people from the company, as well as from other platforms that have been caught up in similar vortices. While most are well-meaning, few seem to have much of a grasp of the wider structural issues in society which their systems both profit from and exacerbate. Like most people who work at big tech companies, they think that these problems can be solved by the application of more technology: by better algorithms, more moderation, heavier engineering. Many outside the tech bubble – particularly in the west and in higher income brackets – are simply appalled that anyone would let their kids use YouTube in the first place. But we won’t fix these issues by blaming the companies, or urging them do better, just as we won’t solve the obesity crisis by demonising fast food but by lifting people out of poverty. If YouTube is bridging a gap in childcare, the answer is more funding for childcare and education in general, not fixing YouTube.What’s happening to kids on YouTube, to defendants in algorithmically enhanced court trials, and to poor debtors in Australia, is coming for all of us. All of our jobs, life support systems, and social contracts are vulnerable to automation – which doesn’t have to mean actually being replaced by robots, but merely being at their mercy. YouTube provides another salutary lesson here: only last week it was reported that YouTube’s most successful young stars – the “YouTubers” followed and admired by millions of their peers – are burning out and breaking down en masse. Polygon magazine cited, among many others, the examples of Rubén “El Rubius” Gundersen, the third most popular YouTuber in the world with just under 30 million subscribers, who recently went live to talk to his viewers about fears of an impending breakdown and his decision to take a break from YouTube, and Elle Mills, a popular YouTuber with 1.2 million followers, who posted footage of herself mid-anxiety attack in a video entitled Burn Out at 19.It would be easy to scoff at these young celebrities, were it not for the fact that their experience is merely the most charismatic example of the kind of algorithmic employment under which many others already labour. The characteristics, after all, are the same: long hours without holidays, benefits, or institutional support, and the pressure to work at the pace of the machine in a system whose goals and mechanisms are unclear and ever-changing, and to which its subjects have no appeal. (In a depressing twist, many of these same YouTubers have been hit by declines in revenue caused directly by YouTube’s attempts to demonetise “inappropriate” content for children – solving one problem in the system only exacerbates others.)The weirdness of YouTube videos, the extremism of Facebook and Twitter mobs, the latent biases of algorithmic systems: all of these have one thing in common with the internet itself, which is that – with a few dirty exceptions – nobody intentionally designed them this way. This is perhaps the strangest and most salutary lesson we can learn from these examples, if we choose to learn at all. The weirdness and violence they produce seems to be in direct correlation to how little we understand their workings – and how much is hidden from us, deliberately or otherwise, by the demands of efficiency and ease of use, corporate and national secrecy, and sheer, planet-ning scale. We live in an age characterised by the violence and breakdown of such systems, from global capitalism to the balance of the climate. If there is any hope for those exposed to its excesses from the cradle, it might be that they will be the first generation capable of thinking about global complexity in ways that increase, rather than reduce, the agency of all of us.James Bridle is the author of New Dark Age, (Verso, £16.99).

For everything is to change! For while Nampara and its surroundings may be bathed in dappled sunlight, a gloomy shadow do loom over Ross and Demelza now that he has sold his soul, become a politician and moved to the ends of the earth (ie London). This was the result of an extraordinary contest modern political parties could only dream of, one where you seemed to require a total of nine votes to become an MP. (Sign me up now for several constituencies!) Ross thinks he is a force for good who will fight for the poor and abolish slavery. We shall see about that. After the exposition and back story of last week’s outing, this was quite the eventful episode, setting things up nicely – and pleasingly precariously – for the rest of the series. The terrifying pirate man who once led Ross on an ill-advised sortie to France set up a wrestling match. Or, as far as Tom “Giant Haystacks” Harry seemed to think, an eye-gouging contest. The main point of this match was (a) to raise funds for the local hospital (thanks, Evil George!), (b) to bring in a love interest for Sam “But I mostly love God” Carne and (c) to provide a rehearsal match with Ross that would lead to a “let me tend to your wounds” bare-chest bathing scene. All worthy aims in life, I think we can agree. Viewers needed a strong stomach for the fight scenes, but an even more robust constitution to handle the prognosis of Dr Death, who had abandoned his laboratory of doom to attend to Armitage. “We will proceed first with blistering and thereafter with purging, vomiting, poulticing and bleeding.” Ye gads. I never was a fan of Armitage but I wouldn’t wish this kind of bedside manner on my worst enemy. Apart from Evil George, of course. If only someone would cover his substantial up-thrusting chin in some thirsty leeches. Thankfully, good sense prevailed. And, despite the intervention of Dr Enys’s benign powders, ding dong, the boring poet is dead. I’m sorry to dance on Armitage’s grave. But here was a man who had been bled, flogged, virtually lobotomised while conscious and left with a body resembling a pepperoni pizza, but he still had time to write yet another terrible poem. “It was no small treasure to have once possessed you, body and soul.” Now, the hypochondriac scribbler has gone to the great library in the sky. Cue dramatic grief scenes between Ross and Demelza where she tried to convince her husband that she was really weeping not so much for her pathetic fancy man, but for the loss of her daughter, Julia, and “all that’s broken and lost and wasted in this world”. Yeah, right.  It was a great joy to witness signs of Sindy doll’s irreverent approach to motherhood. Radiant in deep violet, she proudly announced: “I cannot bear babies. Wrinkled, red-faced, greedy little tyrants.” Sensible woman! And, yes indeed, who wants to be “ambushed by possets”? The scenes with Sindy doll and Demelza wrapping the lordly electoral types around their little fingers were delightful – “More brandy, gentlemen?” – although I did have a terrible flashback to that party Demelza went to when she got off with that one with the dodgy whiskers and the even dodgier Scottish accent.  In other news, the greasy vicar was back where he belongs: licking a tart’s toes. Morwenna’s canny sister made a tantalising reappearance. And Ross won the election against Evil George, even though his proposer gave the worst party political broadcast in the history of the world. “New to governance. But known to all as a brave and distinguished soldier.” Was he trying to fit it into 140 characters? No matter. Ross wins. “Why, when you have the pick of the county to choose from … choose me?” blubbed our hero. Oh, Ross, you know anyone would choose you in pretty much any circumstances. The pewter tankard goes this week to a man who is himself in fact never seen far away from a pewter tankard: Tom Harry. Evil George’s gamekeeper and henchman is played by Turlough Convery, who handles this part with a wonderful gruff humour. All credit to Convery, especially for his fine angry spitting and disturbingly realistic belching. This week, Evil George seemed to sack Tom, much to Elizabeth’s delight, doubtless to set up a revenge narrative for later in the series. “We thank you for that service and from now on we no longer require it.” Come on, Tom ‘Arry, if anyone can do away with Evil George in the night, it’s you.“Is it true that swans mate for life?” “I believe so. Or at least until a more handsome swan appears.” Of the several lines of “we both know we are talking about Armitage” code that passed between Ross and Dwight, this was the best.“Demelza, I must ask you. Are you afraid of what we agreed today?” “More than afraid. Yet I know it must be so.” “Do not fear it. George will win. And I will stay. And Hugh will live.” None of these things came true! None of them! George did not win! And Hugh is dead!“If you came to our meetings, we could pray together.” Oh dear. I seem to have developed a sudden interest in Methodist prayer gatherings.“I wanted to tell ‘e … A man’s never had me.” A likely tale from virtually any female character in this programme.Clearly the instructions from Aidan Turner’s agent (“Nothing below the nipple”) prevailed in this episode, resulting in a two-second bare-shoulder bathing scene concluded by the immortal line: “Sometimes they come at me, unannounced.” There was also some wrestling in hessian shirts. (“Stay rooted!”) To be fair, Armitage’s chest featured copiously throughout. But that is not to be counted because it was covered in disgusting red welts from the medieval cupping procedure. (For anyone who doesn’t know what this is: it involves creating a vacuum over the skin, usually using glass cups, to treat respiratory conditions.)More foot fetishism for the pig’s-tail-buttocked vicar as Morwenna’s sister cons him out of the only income he has not already spent on pedicures for prostitutes. Ross falls prey to the charms of the city. Dr Enys attends a home birth close to home. And Demelza becomes estranged from her husband. Again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3658d13e26b65e4a93e73c6405e05d0457d675fc/144_0_3473_2085/master/3473.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=00bbc18e248d86e4170fb7f4fbba0a55","title":"my love island excuses ring as hollow as its stars heads at least im not alone","story":"Millions of us have been seduced by the show, despite its vapidity. TV has never just been about what we’re watching, but who we’re watching it withI’ll cut to it, I’ve been watching Love Island. Sorry about that, but it’s for intellectuals too, you know. It’s a special time of the year, like the day ants grow wings. Many of my most cultured acquaintances, people who read Barthelme and have opinions on Shostakovich, have started talking like teenagers in Westfield and wearing white jeans. Curious, emboldened by the reduced stigma, and having Googled “is Caroline Flack a gateway drug to the Kardashians?”, I gave the first episode a watch. Like morphine, it took quick hold.We’re a special breed, people who need to rationalise watching popular programmes. “Crucial to stay in touch with the demotic idiom,” I think to myself, to justify the fact I am going to spend 100 hours this summer watching men with 88 abs ask each other where their head’s at. “It’s actually interesting from a sociological perspective,” I say, to explain why I’m interested in whether a shy A\u0026ampE doctor can hook up with a glamour model from Southend-on-Sea. My excuses ring as hollow as some of the contestants’ heads. The fact is, I just enjoy it.I do think the show teaches us something about human nature but I’m not sure it’s something I want to know. What’s that zombie saying – you never understand the appeal of being undead until you’re bitten? Despite my inner conflict about the show’s heteronormative, body-fascist vapidity, I’ve been seduced by it. Or rather, something around it: the fact I’m watching what everyone else is watching.It’s frequently said we’re living through a golden age of television. (The people who say this always sound so smug, as if they had anything to do with it.) And that’s true. Scripted dramas from the Sopranos to Patrick Melrose have hit new heights of world-building, thematic complexity and acting ability. Content-wise, no one should be watching Love Island, or Real Housewives, or America’s Next Top Arsehole, or Keeping Up with the Kardashians or Fucking Off With the Beckhams or whatever’s on now. But TV has never just been about what we’re watching it’s about who we’re watching it with.Thirty million people watched EastEnders on Christmas Day, 1986. These days, 30 million people don’t do anything together, apart from protest against Donald Trump. When I was young, there were four channels. All my friends watched … well, Friends. Next day, we’d talk about the best bits, from the one with the blackout, to the ones with Bruce Willis, to the one where they discover Ross’s monkey is a military bioweapon, and Dustin Hoffman has to stop him being blown up. Actually, that’s the film Outbreak. This was a long time ago, and that monkey worked a lot.My new hobby has recaptured some of that epic intimacy. It shortcuts friendship, lets me strike up conversations with strangers. Speaking the lingua franca is new to me, yet the natives have been kind. Watching week by week, rather than bingeing, means no one knows more than anyone else, and we can speculate together. People don’t suggest a superior series by the same writers you should be watching instead, or lecture you on why the show is important. They just have a gossip, a crucial part of the social glue. The value of connection is connection itself, as Hayley from Love Island would say.It’s a dangerous slope for me, though – self-styled maverick and outsider, discovering the comfort of conformity, and needing to belong. Thank God there isn’t a major sports tournament on at the same time, enabling me to finally win the approval of men I don’t know in the pub.Hey drinkers, there’s a new spot in town you should think about. I’m not saying you should go I’m saying you should think about it. Moonshine Saloon is an immersive, pop-up cocktail joint on London’s King’s Road, themed like a wild west saloon.I was unfortunate enough to visit the creator’s former venture, Alcotraz, an east London bar with a prison theme. I remember changing into an orange jumpsuit and being led to a cell, where we were smuggled cocktails by other “inmates”, while avoiding actors pretending to be guards. Lol. We were given ID numbers, lined against a wall and “strip searched”. Pure bants.Don’t get me wrong, it’s novel to take a thrill ride inside systemic inequality that doesn’t affect you but it’s not something I can relax into. Sam Shearman, the founder of the company that runs the bars, defended his misery safari, claiming it “gently opens the door to fiction and TV showing Alcatraz”. A door gently opening seems like an ironic metaphor.On the face of it, Moonshine Saloon sounds safer. It is “inspired by the captivating tales of the wild west and its covert operations”. Which operations would those be? President Jackson’s Indian removal policy, with its inhumane forced marches? Or the stealing and selling of land belonging to those native Americans who remained? Probably not. They mean the familiar caricature of rugged gunslingers from TV movies, pardner, duelling outside bars.On my visit to Alcotraz, the other inmates all felt unbothered by the environment. Was I overreacting? It made me pause, to see my friends and I through their eyes, as caricatures ourselves: snowflake liberals who only want to stop other people having a good time. There we sat, in our separate cells, drinking together and apart.Luckily, I can denounce these bars in non-political terms. A night of drinking should feel improvisatory, unscripted, pure potential. Alcotraz and Moonshine Saloon are the opposite. As immersive theatre they’re bobbins, having no drama or a believable world. Entry to Moonshine Saloon costs £34, per person, for less than two hours inside. And you have to provide your own alcohol, in unopened bottles. Now that, we can all agree, is offensive."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8926b5e097eb335097d70b8df46487fa65e206d1/0_19_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f4b28e57946e8122ec1875bc4e0eb30","title":"bruce springsteen asbury park new jersey","story":"The Boss will play a hometown show in Asbury Park on Monday, but as luxury apartments spring up around the seaside resort, not everyone is pleasedInside Asbury Park’s showy new music venue Asbury Lanes, locals stare open-mouthed at what used to be a retro bowling alley played by local bands and burlesque acts. Where just a few years ago there was an orange drop ceiling, some old lanes and a bar with $4 grilled cheese, there are now sleek liquor cages struck by cool blue lights.Kurt Vile and the Violators are on stage, the mostly acoustic band formed by the War on Drugs former lead guitarist, in front of a neon and strobe backdrop flashing in sync with the low-key indie rockers’ vibey tunes.“It’s good to be back,” Vile told the crowd. “I live just over the river in Philly,” he said, and traded out another guitar before sinking back into the music. The stage was flanked by stacks of old guitar amps (they’re just for decoration), and an after-work crowd nodded along.Asbury Park is a seaside town, part of Jersey shore, where working-class surfers, artists, musicians, gay men and women and African American culture mixed for decades. It’s bordered on the east by a kitsch-filled stretch of boardwalk along the Atlantic.Even on a cloudy day in the middle of the week, the air smells vaguely of hotdogs and funnel cake (a calorie bomb of fried dough covered in icing sugar). Sea myst floats off the Atlantic, toward attractions like the pinball museum and its life-sized fiberglass Elvis.Asbury Park’s long history of false starts at redevelopment, in many ways, allowed these groups to continue to live in the 1.5 sq mile town, bordered by more affluent and conservative stretches of beach.This town is best known for fostering the state’s most beloved export: Bruce Springsteen. His 1973 debut album Greetings from Asbury Park thrust the town – and its pushers, peddlers and conmen – into rock’n’roll imagination. It’s only an hour from New York, but feels a world away.“The Turnpike (an inter-state highway) goes from New York to Philly,” said Vini “Mad Dog” Lopez, the former drummer for Springsteen’s E Street Band. “It don’t stop in Asbury Park. Even though people might think it’s a mecca, it’s got a long way to go.”Vile, whose bandmate described him as “Bruce-obsessed”, closed with the Born in the USA deep cut Downbound Train.Asbury Lanes is just one piece of an enormous waterfront redevelopment. The long-awaited, and now hotly contested, changes to the seaside have already started to arrive: the boutique Asbury Hotel recently opened, blocks of new luxury condos sell for $800,000, rooftop restaurants and a bandshell are being built.The centerpiece of these changes is a 16-storey, still-under-construction block of luxury apartments and hotel rooms, built just steps from the low-income residents who moved to the shore when Asbury was down and out. Developers believe the apartments will start at $1m.The site sat half-finished for the better part of 40 years, as one developer after another went bankrupt. Undoubtedly, locals are relieved to see it gone. But, in a town where most buildings are no more than four storeys high, its replacement looms over the town like a giant.“Do we really need a 16-storey structure? No,” said Trish Zanetello, 60. “Do we really need condos starting at $1m? No.” Even so, she said, she is happy to see the “cement science experiment” gone.Prosperity, however, has come with contention.“They turned something really cool into the Hard Rock Café,” said Dale W Miller, a musician whose former band, AtlanticPacific, played the old Asbury Lanes. Its quirks – bands played on a stage over the lanes and people bowled in either side – were what many locals felt made it great. About the new venue, Miller said, “I’m not feeling it.One patron to the Vile show acknowledged, “all places close” and looked up into the high ceilings of the new Asbury Lanes, “processing”. Others described the venue as “over the top” or “Vegas”. One said simply: “It’s really different.” Springsteen will play a show here next week as part of the Asbury Lane’s grand re-opening. Tickets are nearly impossible to come by. Springsteen was paid $125,000 for the show (he will donate proceeds to the Boys \u0026amp Girls Club of Monmouth County, a charity which provides after-school programs for children).Since Springsteen’s debut put the town on the map, Asbury Park has been plagued by blight, corruption and crime. As one resident told the New York Times in 2003: “I can’t even walk my dog without 18 people asking me if I want to buy coke.” Now, as the town experiences an economic boom, long-time residents are ambivalent about the lopsided change.“When I came here in 2000, all there was was art galleries,” said Amy Quinn, the deputy mayor. When people walked the streets, they’d be “met with drug dealers or prostitutes or whatever”.“Was it a bad time for quality of life? Yea. But people took it on themselves to get on a planning board or zoning board,” and improve the town, she said. “As a result, we have corporations coming in and developing.” Asked about Asbury Lanes, Quinn winced, “There’d be no new Asbury Lanes without the old Asbury Lanes.”In addition to Asbury Lanes, developers now own many of the venues most closely associated with the brand of New Jersey quirk that brought Asbury back. For example, the Stone Pony, made famous by Springsteen, is also owned by developers.“It’s much more expensive than it used to be,” said John Lyon, best known by his stage name Southside Johnny. “But it was also dangerous in Asbury Park.” His band, the Asbury Jukes, played around the same time Springsteen was penning songs for the E Street Band and living above a surfboard factory in early 1970s Asbury. “It’s not so dangerous anymore,” Lyon said, and added, “Artists always find a place to live, even if its five people in an apartment.” The depths of Asbury Park’s nadir can hardly be overstated. The seaside resort was relatively wealthy, though segregated, in the 1930s. Two grand structures, the Casino and Convention Hall, still bookend either side of Asbury’s boardwalk, are now owned by developers.But as the decades went on, it slid into decline. Frank Sinatra, a Jersey native himself, derisively compared Asbury Park to failed romance in his 1962 song At Long Last Love (“Is it Granada I see, or only Asbury Park?”). But the town was already sailing toward what was likely the most cataclysmic event in recent history. After years of segregated beaches, schools, and housing, race riots rocked the town in 1970. Businesses were looted and burned.“It started when Dr King was killed”, said Freddie Richardson Jr. “It was chaos.” He was 17 when the riots started. Richardson, a black man and a Muslim, now lives in Florida. People, he said, were “unbelievable distraught”. There was, “a lot of injustice – blatant injustice.” People, he said, “kind of threw up their hands.”This was around this time Springsteen and other musicians played around Asbury Park, trying to convince booking agents audiences wanted to hear original music – not top 40 covers.“I got in a band, and we started listening to all the other bands,” said Lopez. Today, Asbury Park is one of the hippest spots on the Jersey Shore. Business has been “incredibly busy”, said Glen Jones, who works in the Silverball Museum pinball arcade. “I’ve watched the progress since I moved here,” in 2008, he said. Another resident said he rented his loft for the summer to a couple for $20,000 (one half of whom worked for Goldman Sachs).“It’s definitely changed,” said Bichone Syphax, a lifelong Asbury resident, about the town. Even today though, he said, prosperity is uneven. “I would just like to see more unification, instead of being ided by the tracks.”In large part, Asbury Park was shaped by the people the rest of the Jersey Shore pushed out – working-class musicians, gay men and women, African Americans. Today, the city remains a liberal bastion among fiercely conservative Jersey shore towns.For musicians, locally owned venues still act as a proving ground. Asbury Lanes, now booking national acts, has to fill a 760-person hall. The Saint, on Main Street, caps out at 150.The bar is a dimly lit box, cluttered with posters and layers of graffiti that evidence a well loved venue.A ceiling fan helplessly attempted to cool the packed house, as the house music went down. Broadly, Saint owner Scott Stamper said, Asbury Lanes could be a positive development for Asbury’s music scene.“We will lose some here and there,” Stamper about shows, as the Asbury Park-based band Parlor Mob prepares to go on. Moments later, Parlor Mob unleashed a fretboard climbing, ear-ringing basher that picked up where Led Zeppelin and the White Stripes left off. People lifted drinks to the sky and pushed to the front as the band builds a blues tune.“These guys,” said Stamper, as he picks up his phone to stream video, “I think they have a chance to tour the world.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0ed198ede103f3ced4b5f79bc4b858672ea6d90/0_44_2912_1748/master/2912.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3318d6aba55eaa98ff1cbc2d7dff34db","title":"us immigration family separations beto orourke texas","story":"First Lady calls on ‘both sides’ to come together on immigration reform as Democrats press for changes on controversial policyMelania Trump’s spokeswoman has said the first lady “hates to see children separated from their families”, in a rare public statement at odds with her husband’s policy of separating children from their parents at the Mexico border.Stephanie Grisham said the first lady believed “we need to be a country that follows all laws”, but also one “that governs with heart”. She added: “Mrs Trump ... hopes both sides of the aisle can finally come together to achieve successful immigration reform.”The intervention came as reports emerged of children being held in cages at a warehouse in Texas after being separated from their parents. One cage had 20 children inside.Those conditions were reported by media briefly allowed into the facility by US Border Patrol. But Donald Trump’s secretary of homeland security, Kirstjen Neilsen, criticised what she called “misreporting” by politicians and the press. Elaborating on her statement that “we do not have a policy of separating families at the border”, she tweeted: “DHS takes very seriously its duty to protect minors in our temporary custody from gangs, traffickers, criminals and abuse. We have continued the policy from previous administrations and will only separate if the child is in danger, there is no custodial relationship between ‘family’ members, or if the adult has broken a law.”According to DHS figures, since the announcement of the “zero tolerance” policy by attorney general Jeff Sessions, almost 2,000 children have been separated from their families. There is no law mandating separation of families. But White House policy is to maximize criminal prosecutions of people caught trying to enter the US illegally. That means more adults are jailed, pending trial, so children are removed from them. Before the Trump policy, many without a criminal record were referred for civil deportation, which generally did not break up families.Amidst outcry, Donald Trump has stuck to the untrue claim that Democrats are to blame. On Saturday, the president tweeted: “Democrats can fix their forced family breakup at the Border by working with Republicans on new legislation, for a change! This is why we need more Republicans elected in November ... ”Trump has repeatedly referred to a Democratic law. He appears to be referring to one enacted in 2008 that was signed by a Republican president, George W Bush. It was focused on freeing and helping children who come to the border without a parent or  and did not call for family separation.In April 2018, the US attorney general, Jeff Sessions, announced a “zero tolerance” policy under which anyone who crossed the border without legal status would be prosecuted by the justice department. This includes some, but not all, asylum seekers. Because children can’t be held in adult detention facilities, they are being separated from their parents.Immigrant advocacy groups, however, say hundreds of families have been separated since at least July 2017.\u0026nbspMore than 200 child welfare groups, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the United Nations, said they opposed the practice.\u0026nbspThey are supposed to enter the system for processing “unaccompanied alien children”, which exists primarily to serve children who voluntarily arrive at the border on their own. Unaccompanied alien children are placed in health department custody within 72 hours of being apprehended by border agents. They then wait in shelters for weeks or months at a time as the government searches for parents, relatives or family friends to place them with in the US.This already overstretched system has been thrown into chaos by the new influx of children.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspOn the other side, advocates for children have said they do not know how to find parents, who are more likely to have important information about why the family is fleeing its home country. And if, for instance, a parent is deported, there is no clear way for them to ensure their child is deported with them.When an influx of families and unaccompanied children fleeing Central America arrived at the border in 2014, Barack Obama’s administration detained families.This was harshly criticized and a federal court in 2015 stopped the government from holding families for months without explanation. Instead, they were released while they waited for their immigration cases to be heard in court. Not everyone shows up for those court dates, leading the Trump administration to condemn what it calls a “catch and release” program.The president of the American Academy of Pediatrics warned this week that forcibly separating children from their parents is a traumatic experience that will cause “irreparable harm”. On Sunday, senior White House adviser Kellyanne Conway told NBC’s Meet the Press: “As a mother, as a Catholic, as somebody who has a conscience ... I will tell you that nobody likes this policy.”Conway echoed Trump in saying Democrats must negotiate over immigration reform and border security. But when NBC host Chuck Todd said it “sounds like you’re holding the kids hostage to get the Democrats to the table”, Conway objected “very forcefully” and said: “I certainly don’t want anybody to use these kids as leverage.”That was not what an unnamed White House official told the Washington Post this week, saying: “The thinking in the building is to force people to the table.”The New York Times reported on Saturday that Stephen Miller, a hardliner who wrote the original travel ban on a list of Muslim-majority countries, is the chief driver of the separation policy. As the president headed to his golf club on Sunday, Democrats staged protests at detention facilities. One party rising star, from Texas, said events at the border were the responsibility of all Americans.“I’d like to say it’s un-American but it’s happening right now in America,” Beto O’Rourke, a US representative who in November will challenge Ted Cruz for his Senate seat, told CNN’s State of the Union. “It is on all of us, not just the Trump administration. This is on all of us.”O’Rourke organized a march to Tornillo, Texas, and what has been described as a “tent structure” for 16- and 17-year-olds. Some had crossed the border on their own, O’Rourke told CNN. Others made the journey with their parents and then were forcibly taken away.Those minors were now in Tornillo, he said, “with no idea no idea when or if they will see their mothers or their fathers, on this father’s day, again. This is inhumane. We will we be judged for what we do or what we fail to do now.”The Oregon senator Jeff Merkley led a group to the border near McAllen and Brownsville, Texas. On the other side of the country, seven members of Congress visited an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) facility in Elizabeth, New Jersey.The group was denied entry for “over an hour”, they said, and police officers were called before they were allowed inside. At one point, New Jersey Democrat Bill Pascrell wrote, he and another member of Congress were “literally banging on the door to gain entry to the jail to see separated families”.New York’s Jerry Nadler told press and protesters people inside were “like the majority of migrants traveling from Central America, who are fleeing violence that has been well documented. Parents fleeing such unspeakable violence will do almost anything they can to protect their children from that violence. Instead they are being welcomed by more terror.”Earlier this week O’Rourke’s midterm opponent, Cruz, defended the Trump policy: “When you see reporters, when you see Democrats saying, ‘Don’t separate kids from their parents,’ what they’re really saying is don’t arrest illegal aliens.”On Sunday, Cruz tweeted: “My dad has been my hero my whole life. Here’s to wishing a very happy #FathersDay to all the dads out there!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4dbf938b8ef22490460dda43bc34d9c0afeba58/0_152_4380_2627/master/4380.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=150b26462c2740d2aec27aba3a6e8a04","title":"fathers day gift jay z","story":"For boys trying to learn to be men, the rapper and businessman’s autobiography can provide a guideCan growing up without a father be a gift? That’s how Jay-Z counterintuitively described it, in his autobiography. “We were kids without fathers … and in a way, that was a gift,” the rapper and businessman writes in Decoded. “We got to pick and choose the ancestors who would inspire the world we were going to make for ourselves.”If you choose the right inspirations, growing up without a dad can be a gift. But, as the title of Jay-Z’s album Blueprint 2: The Gift and the Curse suggests, there’s a flip side. Many of us who spend Father’s Day wishing we had somebody to celebrate with haven’t chosen the right influences as substitutes. We might not be making many choices at all.I grew up without a father regularly in my life. I would leave my mom’s house every morning searching for what was missing at home – the role models who could show me how to be a man. Like many kids in the same situation – and many of my peers were fatherless – I found those role models on television and in music.Jay-Z was one of them: the pre-Beyoncé Jay-Z of the late 1990s and early 2000s, big pimpin’ and trading disses with fellow New York rapper Nas. His tough-guy bravado, glorification of crime, flashy jewelry and videos full of dancing women captivated me. I tried my best to emulate him and other rappers. My friends and I wanted to use drugs and thought selling them was cool we got into fights, skipped classes and in some cases dropped out altogether. Studying seemed boring when compared to the gangster fairytales we shared. Delayed gratification, which is vital to living life with long-term benefits in mind, was a foreign concept.I have no interest in blaming Jay-Z – or any other man – for playing a role in my life he didn’t ask for. My father uniquely carried the responsibility of setting an example for me. But he, too, had fallen to the curse of fatherlessness. Born an orphan in Kenya, he was re-orphaned at 14 when his adoptive parents passed away. He persevered, working his way from an apprentice at the Hilton Hotel in Nairobi to a chef at the Hilton Hotel in London by the time he was 21. When the time came for him to have a family of his own, however, the curse caught up with him. He didn’t know how to be a husband to my mom or a dad to me. He had no examples from his past or his present to provide guidance. Unlike the years my father spent training with other chefs to learn how to succeed in the kitchen, he had no role models to show him how to be a family man. It didn’t take long for my father to give up and disappear.Evidently, it’s not easy to fill the void – but even easier to find the wrong influences. Kids today are exposed to a much broader range of media technologies than I was in the 1990s through which to find examples for what a “man” is. Online communities formed through social media and discussion boards can exert their own kind of masculine peer pressure: incel (“involuntarily celibate”) culture, which became the subject of international media coverage after this year’s mass murders in Parkland, Florida and my hometown, Toronto, is an example of how young men can develop resentful, angry and self-victimizing masculine identities while having these identities reinforced by an online peer group.As president, Barack Obama made it a priority to deliberately and strategically steer vulnerable young men away from the negative influences that affect fatherless kids. His initiative My Brother’s Keeper (MBK) galvanized foundations, businesses, local governments and community groups to promote a milestones-based example for young men to follow, including reading at grade level by grade three, attending postsecondary education and staying out of the criminal justice system. MBK offered a way to identify healthy role models at different stages of a young man’s life without being overly exclusive in defining who and what a man can be. MBK was renamed just before Obama left the White House and seems to have gone quiet as a federal government initiative. It continues as a nongovernmental organization.My search for role models wasn’t as deliberate or strategic as Obama advocates for, but after years of trial and error I was able to find positive role models in community college and then university. In particular, professors showed me how learn to read and write effectively, built my self-esteem and encouraged me to find new peer groups. Professors also connected me with role models in books, such as Martin Luther King Jr, Malcolm X, Booker T Washington, Marcus Garvey and WEB Du Bois, who demonstrated the ersity of ways men can and do exist in the world. With the right support, not having a dad became an opportunity for me to choose positive inspirations.A few weeks into my first semester at Yale law school, Jay-Z published his autobiography. It turned out he had transformed over the same period of time I had. In an interview about his book, he recalled the lyrics to one of his songs that I loved as a kid (Big Pimpin’) and confessed: “I can’t believe I said that. And kept saying it. What kind of animal would say this sort of thing?”Today, Jay-Z’s example as a husband and father, detailed in last year’s album 4:44, helps me when thinking about how to be a good partner to my girlfriend and a good father figure to her son, responsibilities for which I often feel deeply unprepared. Knowing that others are fighting a legacy of fatherlessness in their own lives motivates me to continue believing, trying and learning. For those of us lucky enough to eventually see growing up without a dad as a positive opportunity, the challenge remains for us to help more fatherless kids find life’s gifts and escape its curses."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ad1d7cd622d0acf49954391ce75adcec0704367/0_79_5040_3024/master/5040.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d55f60f8577074dc57704fa229a63d86","title":"why dutch bring up worlds happiest teenagers","story":"Teens in Netherlands regularly top life satisfaction tables, with schooling playing a big roleIn a biology class at a secondary school near Rotterdam, Gerrit the skeleton is not the only one with a permanent grin.The Groen van Prinstererlyceum, which first trialled happiness lessons a decade ago, teaches some of the least troubled teens in the world.In report after report, the Netherlands tops OECD countries for high life satisfaction among its young people. Researchers compiling this year’s Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) study, a four-yearly analysis on 48 countries, say Dutch children’s happiness scores are up again.It contrasts starkly with the picture in countries like Britain, where depression and anxiety are on the rise among teenagers, and the US, where the number of young people taking their own lives has risen sharply.So why is this flat, damp country of 17 million people with its history of Calvinism and colonialism so good at giving young people an optimistic outlook?Dr Simone de Roos, a researcher at the Netherlands Institute for Social Research (SCP), says initial findings from the 90-question HBSC survey of a representative 7,000 teenagers, to be published later this year, suggest life satisfaction has risen since 2013.“I think Dutch children have generally positive interactions in all their social surroundings,” says De Roos. “They have a supportive environment at home, with friends and also at school. Dutch parents give a lot of support and have mild control. There’s an egalitarian climate, teachers are not authoritarian but accept the feelings of pupils, and pupils trust teachers.”News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theAccording to that report, young people in the Netherlands were also in the top five for eating breakfast on weekdays, watching more than two hours of weekday television, having kind and helpful classmates – and in the bottom five for being overweight, having sex before 15, and feeling pressure from schoolwork. They were less likely than average to experience bullying and generally found it easy to talk to parents.The results chime with a 2016 Dutch Statistics Office study of 4,000 people from 12 to 25, who ranked their happiness at 8.4 out of 10, and a PISA report in 2015 noting that the country – alongside Finland and Switzerland – seemed “able to combine good learning outcomes with highly satisfied students”.Of course, the general state of the nation helps. There is little unemployment in the Netherlands, relatively low inequality and a healthy economy. Five months ago the SCP compared the Netherlands favourably with 25 years ago, while another study showed people were more optimistic than last year. “At some point there’s a critical mass of optimistic voices, and then it gets its own dynamic,” says Prof Paul Dekker, the SCP programme leader in values and meaning.The director of the World Database of Happiness, Prof Ruut Veenhoven, also believes young people are less burdened by an expectation to “be good”.“If you look across Europe, the Dutch and the Danes are the most lenient and focus more on developing autonomy than giving priority to obedience – and that fits the society,” he says. “Children are more free to do what they want, and in doing what they want, develop an idea of what they really like and social skills. A happy boy may be sometimes not a very good boy.”In Dutch, there is no phrase that means literally “you are a good boy” or “good girl”, says 14-year-old Tjalling Appelhof, from Amsterdam. “You say ‘bravo, lad’ or ‘well done’ or ‘thank you’,” he says. Like most Dutch teenagers, he cycles to school and feels he has a good level of self-determination. “I can say how late I come home – not at 3am, I mean, but some time before bedtime!” he says. “I think I have enough freedom.”Despite the country’s reputation for cannabis smoking, the Trimbos Institute reports a downward trend for using alcohol and drugs and smoking in Dutch children aged 12 to 16. Such activities are described by HBSC experts as “risk behaviours” that impact happiness.Other negatives are bullying and fighting. At Groen van Prinstererlyceum, Dani Karremans, a 16-year-old majoring in sciences, believes such pressures are not extreme in the Netherlands.“If I compare things with other countries and especially other schools, you hear that people are bullied, often seriously,” he says. “Here, you don’t really see that. If people try to bully me, I just ignore it. I’ve got my own friends who I get on with. I don’t have a social ‘image’ or think that everyone has to like me – it’s not realistic.”Dani, whose mother is Indonesian and Polish and whose father is Moroccan, says his father spends more time on Facebook than he does.Saffron Jones, also 16, and majoring in social sciences, is half-English and half-Dutch. She says that from when her parents split up 11 years ago, her friendship group has always been supportive. “I could always stay with my friends at primary school. Now, if I’m stressed about school, mostly one of my friends is good in that subject, so I’ll call them and they help. It calms me down.”The Dutch school system – almost entirely public –incorporates major exams at about the age of 12 and three levels of secondary education from practical to the most academic. But it is possible to progress from one to the other or repeat a year and, despite concerns about dropping standards and increasing segregation, such flexibility could make for less stress.There are social problems such as differences between minority ethnic and native Dutch achievement, while one in nine children grows up in poverty. But Jacqueline Boerefijn, a biology teacher at the Groen van Prinstererlyceum, says even if a school wants to expel a child, it must find another school for them, so there are incentives to deal with issues.But Boerefijn, who developed happiness classes at the school a decade ago, and also gives positive psychology lessons to educators, is worried that Dutch children are under threat from new pressures around educational achievement.“Please stop putting the bar higher, because we have happy children,” she says. “We already have so many highly educated people, and at the moment there are not enough people to do the plumbing and carpentry jobs.”For Tjalling, it is pretty simple. “In the Netherlands we are rich, most things around children are well organised, like school and healthcare, and if people are poor, we try to help them. That’s maybe why children are happy.“It rains a lot. But you get used to it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c7d28b4bbf0e52b80e9a21abdde5b26911f55ba/85_37_2563_1538/master/2563.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d8975712fe67d2844ec0a1f1823c212","title":"woman swallowed giant python indonesia","story":"Seven-metre snake found during search for woman who had gone to do some gardeningAn Indonesian woman has been found in the belly of a giant python after the swollen snake was captured near where she vanished while tending her vegetable garden, police said on Saturday.The body of 54-year-old Wa Tiba was found on Friday when villagers cut open the seven-metre (23ft) python which was found bloated in the village of Persiapan Lawela on the island of Muna, off Sulawesi.“Residents were suspicious the snake swallowed the victim, so they killed it, then carried it out of the garden,” said local police chief Hamka. “The snake’s belly was cut open and the body of the victim was found inside.”About 100 residents and relatives launched a search for the woman after she failed to return from her garden on Thursday night. Hamka said villagers found the giant serpent lying about 30 metres from Tiba’s sandals and machete, adding she was swallowed head first and her body was found intact.The garden in which she disappeared was at the base of a rocky cliff, pockmarked by caves, and known to be home to snakes, Hamka added.Giant pythons, which regularly top six metres, are commonly found in Indonesia and the Philippines.While they have been known to attack small animals, attempts to eat people are rare.In March last year, a farmer was killed by a python in the village of Salubiro on Sulawesi island."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31f8aab7aa823a12840adcdd18159f34d611b07d/0_81_4168_2500/master/4168.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1971ef2ffd057826c6c5bab9d0de74be","title":"ivan duque wins election to become colombias president","story":"Conservative opponent of Farc peace process wins long and isive campaignColombia has chosen Iván Duque, a conservative neophyte, to be its next president after a long and isive campaign that often centred on a controversial peace process with leftist rebels the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc).Colombia has experienced one of the longest internal conflicts in history. It started in the 1960s following a turbulent period known as \u0027la violencia\u0027.\u0026nbspOn the one hand, the Colombian government fought to maintain order and stability, seeking to protect the interests of its citizens and the legitimacy of the state.\u0026nbspOn the other, there were guerilla groups – like Farc and ELN – who said they were fighting for the poor and social justice.And then paramilitary groups emerged, claiming they were reacting to the threats from the guerillas while taking justice into their own hands.More than seven million people were uprooted from their homes and driven to cities fearing for their lives.\u0026nbspAt least two hundred thousand people lost their lives.Numerous human rights violations were committed. Hundreds of people were forcibly recruited and taken far into the Colombian jungle to fight. More than 8,000 cases of child recruitment were recorded.Overall, there have been more than eight million victims, due to the conflict. One out of every five Colombians has been directly affected.After talks lasting more than four years, a peace treaty was signed with Farc in November 2016 effectively bringing the conflict to an end. Key to the agreement are deals on rural development, political participation, illicit drugs and reparations for victims.Farc has given up all of their weapons (verified by the UN) and transitioned into a political party with a voice in the political process.With less money tied up in defence, the country\u0027s spending priorities should now be switching to education, health, infrastructure, the economy and the environment.\u0026nbspBut some are yet to experience \u0027peace\u0027. Scars are deep. Reconciliation, reintegration and access to opportunities take time. President Juan Manuel Santos is due to stand down in 2018 and some election campaigning has stoked concerns over the peace deal.Many now worry about the fate of the fragile peace deal signed with the Farc in 2016, which formally ended 52 years of civil war that left 220,000 dead and seven million displaced. That deal initially failed to pass a referendum with voters outraged by its guarantees of softer sentencing for rebel leaders and guaranteed seats in congress. It was later amended and ratified by lawmakers, a move some viewed as undemocratic. Sunday gave them another chance to voice their disquiet.Farc’s wartime leader, Rodrigo Londoño, tweeted after the result: “We have lived the quietest elections of the last decades, the peace process bears fruit. It is a moment of greatness and reconciliation, we respect the decision of the majorities and we congratulate the new president. Now to work, the roads of hope are open.”Duque promised on the campaign trail to modify the deal’s most contentious components, something that resonated with voters.On a clear Sunday morning in Bogotá’s central Ciudad Jardín neighbourhood, voters filed into a school repurposed as a voting station when polls opened at 8am. “I am voting for Ívan Duque,” said Marcelo Rodríguez, dressed in a Colombian football shirt. “I want peace but we can’t have it without justice.”Others at the poll station were less convinced. “Amending a deal is the same as tearing it up,” said Andrea Gómez, a student. “Some people in Colombia won’t be happy without war.”Duque – who will turn 42 just before taking office on 8 August – will be Colombia’s youngest ever president, though his party, Democratic Center, has a coalition in Congress. He also has the backing of several industry leaders and, perhaps most importantly, ex-president Alvaro Uribe, still an immensely powerful – if isive – figure in Colombian politics.Uribe, who dealt severe military blows to the Farc during his tenure from 2002 to 2010, led the campaign against the peace deal in 2016’s referendum. He was Duque’s earliest champion for president, having persuaded his protege to leave a job at the Inter-American Development Bank in Washington DC to fill a party senate seat in 2014.Duque’s opponents say is little more to than Uribe’s puppet, a charge particularly worrying given the hardline svengali’s authoritarian tendencies. While president, a state intelligence agency was shut down after Uribe used it to spy on the opposition, journalists and members of the supreme court. His military campaign against the rebels was marked by grave human rights abuses: thousands of civilians were murdered in order to falsely inflate combat statistics.Both men denied the charge, and accused Petro of being the real threat to democracy. Uribe, after voting in Bogotá’s historic Plaza de Bolívar, said that Duque was the only bulwark against Petro’s “destructive socialism” – the same force he said has mired neighbouring Venezuela in economic and political turmoil.Petro was reluctant on the campaign trail to distance himself from Venezuela’s late president Hugo Chávez, and with 1 million Venezuelans having fled to Colombia, many here worry that Petro could bring a similar fate.Duque’s market-friendly economic policies appealed to voters near the Venezuelan border, though younger and more moderate voters worry about his conservative social policies from drug policy and crime to abortion.The campaign was long and ugly, with stark polarisation revealed in the first round when Duque and Petro eliminated a handful of more moderate rivals. Now, Duque’s job will be build bridges between Colombians ided on ideology and the peace process, with the worst outcome being another flare up of civil war.“Polarisation is common in politics around the world,” Pedro Piedrahita Bustamente, a political science professor at the University of Medellín previously told the . “But here, where there is a history of internal armed conflict, it could be a dangerous thing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ac2afad2071758b36844bfb3824fe32f7e37161/0_126_4000_2399/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c86028b021c021d04e78e2dbd39b0147","title":"philippines lawyer gay marriage duterte church","story":"Jesus Falcis has taken his battle to the supreme court, backed by a president who regularly clashes with the Catholic churchIn the Philippines, where Catholicism is dominant and orce is still illegal, a young atheist, openly gay lawyer is leading a historic fight for same-sex marriage.Jesus Falcis, 31, will face the supreme court on Tuesday to argue that a law limiting marriage to a man and a woman violates the 1987 Philippine Constitution, which he said doesn’t make gender specifications on who can be married.“I took up law to change the law. As a gay person, as a member of the minority I want to challenge laws that discriminate against LGBT people and advocate for laws that would help us,” said Falcis.Falcis has found an unlikely ally in his fight in the Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte. Falcis has been a vocal critic of Duterte’s bloody anti-drug campaign and the ousting of supreme court chief justice Maria Lourdes Sereno. But on this issue, he and Duterte agree.“I support same-sex marriage,” Duterte said in a speech at an LGBT event in his hometown Davao City last December. “The problem is we’ll have to change the law. But we can change the law.”It is thought Duterte’s support for gay marriage is in part inspired by his antagonistic relationship with the church. He habitually attacks the bishops in his speeches and likes to distributes a book exposing sexual abuse and corruption in the church.Falcis filed his petition in 2015 arguing for same sex couples to be granted legal rights including visitation and custody rights, property and rights of inheritance. It is difficult to predict which way the supreme court will rule on the petition, but attention for the cause is a big win for the LGBT community, said University of the Philippines constitutional law professor Antonio La Viña.La Viña said the supreme court could have easily dismissed the petition procedurally because is no urgency in the situation of Falcis, who doesn’t have a partner he wants to marry.“The court is intrigued by the questions being raised in this case. They want to listen,” said La Viña. “I actually thought they would have dismissed the petition on procedural grounds. It means they are open to the substance of the case.”.Oral arguments are held only for high-profile issues. La Viña said it should be seen as an opportunity to change minds and present an option for a more inclusive meaning of marriage.“It’s historic. They actually get the chance to be heard. Change always starts with you getting a seat at the table. The oral arguments is akin to a seat at the table. They are given a chance to defend their position,” La Viña said.A number of gay couples who attempted but failed to get marriage licenses have also filed a supreme court petition to bolster Falcis’ petition.“It’s natural law. Families may only be formed by a man and a woman. What is the purpose of marriage? It’s openness to life and procreation,” said Manila Auxillary Bishop Broderick Pabillo, echoing a pastoral letter the church released in 2015 shortly after the petition was filed.Falcis said the church position is irrelevant to his petition, arguing that the country’s family code doesn’t require married iniduals to procreate and that there is no law prohibiting gay couples from adopting.“I want to emphasise, we are talking about civil or legal marriage. Churches all over the country will still be able to perform their own religious marriages according to their own doctrines,” Falcis said.Hundreds of LGBT people are planning to gather outside the supreme court, when Falcis argues the case next week.“There will be a short program outside the supreme court. There will be performances and statements from allies and supporters. We’re hoping for around 500 to 1,000 people or even more,” said Vince Liban of U.P. Babaylan, the largest LGBT student organisation based in the University of the Philippines.“To be honest, I’m not sure what to expect. But hope is what keeps the struggle alive. We will try to reason with them,” said Liban."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee8a9825b997c209622fc3b6e1583fd3c1859c17/0_0_5358_3216/master/5358.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ff832ca1f70d0573d92a4814394aaf49","title":"state of emergency declared in papua new guinea after riots","story":"Prime minister Peter O’Neill declares nine-month state of emergency and suspends a provincial government after riots in Southern Highlands last weekPapua New Guinea has declared a state of emergency, suspended a provincial government and is sending armed forces to its rugged highlands to restore order after rioters went on a rampage of looting and burning, the government said.Violence has often ravaged the remote interior of the resource-rich Pacific nation, where tribal and land disputes overlay regional politics.Armed crowds angered over the failure of a court challenge to a regional governor’s election burned an airplane, looted a warehouse and torched buildings in Mendi, the capital of the Southern Highlands province, last week.“It’s a big, big disruption,” policeman Naring Bongi told Reuters by telephone from Mendi, the capital of the Southern Highlands province, about 500 km (310 miles) northwest of the national capital Port Moresby. Between 100 and 200 men armed with sticks and guns arrived from surrounding villages in flatbed trucks when they heard of the failure of the court challenge to last September’s election of a political opponent as governor, Bongi said. They set fire to the plane before moving into the township, setting ablaze houses and two court buildings, he said. Nobody was hurt or killed and the men left by nightfall. “They had firearms,” he said. “We were confronting them but we didn’t stop it because these men are really mad. If we shot them they would kill us. Whether they will carry this on again tomorrow, or onwards, I don’t know.” Papua New Guinea has declared a nine-month state of emergency in the province, and suspended its government for the duration, prime minister Peter O’Neill said on Friday.“The actions of reckless iniduals damaging property in Mendi has disgusted the nation,” O’Neill said on his website.“Police will investigate every agitator, and every person who was involved in the unrest.”Thomas Eluh, a former policeman and acting administrator in the province, has been given constitutional emergency powers.Police, including a mobile squad, were immediately deployed, along with criminal investigators, O’Neill added.More than 200 PNG defence force troops are to be flown to the city of Mount Hagen on Saturday before making their way to Mendi, media outlet Loop PNG said.Reuters was unable to independently confirm the report of troop movements.Looters ransacked a warehouse of earthquake relief supplies during the Mendi rioting, said Barclay Tenza, a spokesman for the provincial disaster.“They took all the foodstuffs,” he said by telephone from Port Moresby.Many communities are still receiving aid after February’s 7.5-magnitude earthquake killed 100 people, testing the finances and capacity of one of the world’s poorest countries."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3534102.1529269256!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ul makes settlements of up to 150 000 with whistleblowers","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMore than €1.7 million has been spent on severance packages for eight former employees between 2008 and 2015.The University of Limerick (UL) has made financial settlements in the region of €150,000 with three key whistleblowers who highlighted a series of allegations over the misspending of taxpayers’ money.The move followed mediation talks and the publication of an independent report which vindicated some of their allegations regarding the university’s finance, human resources and governance policies.Among its findings were that more than €1.7 million has been spent on severance packages for eight former employees between 2008 and 2015.UL president Dr Des Fitzgerald has confirmed that settlements have been made in the cases of the three woman who formerly worked in the college’s finance section.A spokesman for the university declined to say how much they were paid beyond saying the financial element was “similar in each case and is not excessive”.One of the settlements is understood to be the region of €50,000-€60,000, so an overall package is likely to be in the region of €150,000.Dr Fitzgerald, who took over as president a year ago, said it has been his priority to get to the bottom of the allegations and put in place checks to ensure mistakes are not repeated.He has accepted the university made serious mistakes in the past and apologised for hurt caused to all those affected.Leona O’Callaghan, one of the whistle-blowers whose allegations were vindicated, said she felt satisfied the university had now taken steps to tackle the issues, although she felt disappointed there had been no “inidual accountability”.Two other whistleblowers, known as ‘B’ and ‘C’ in an investigation, were suspended on full pay for 2½ years. Their suspensions were lifted as part of the settlement.Meanwhile, The  understands that the Comptroller and Auditor General is finalising an investigation into severance payments by UL to former staff.It is understood that education authorities were kept in the dark over some of the payments, which may have breached pay policy guidelines. Some of these staff were later rehired on lucrative contracts.If the university is found to have formally breached pay guidelines, UL may face financial penalties from the Higher Education Authority.This is under new a new funding model adopted by the authority which came into force recently.The move to introduce penalties for governance issues follows a number of controversies involving higher education institutions over recent years.This penalty-based system may be used for “clear and unambiguous breaches of governance”.The authority is understood to have discussed the possibility recently, though officials are mindful that any penalty could end up depriving funds to support vulnerable students.In an interview, Dr Fitzgerald said underfunding of the higher education sector was putting strain on teaching and learning across the sector. It was also contributing to one in five students dropping out of college at UL.“It . . . affects our ability to deliver new programmes and impacts on our ability to provide problem-based learning and experiential learning . . . there’s one class with over 700 students.” He said he did not support the introduction of a loan scheme for students."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3534020.1529262774!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"university of limerick seeks to rebuild trust after controversies","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDr Des Fitzgerald, president of University of Limerick, says his priority has been to deal with damaging revelations involving the college. Photograph: Alan PlaceThe walls of the University of Limerick (UL) president’s office are plastered with Post-It notes, maps, flow charts and lists of faculty members.Dr Des Fitzgerald has no shortage of plans for the university, but much of his time has been spent mired in a swamp of allegations over misspending and poor human resources practices.The first year of his presidency has involved trying to get to the bottom of murky practices such as excessive payouts for former staff members, a VIP-style expenses system for senior staff and attempts to silence or “manage out” whistle-blowers.In total, the university spent more than €1.7 million on severance packages for eight former employees between 2008 and 2015.Some of these former staff were subsequently rehired on lucrative contracts. Education authorities were kept in the dark over the payments, which breached pay policy guidelines.The details shook confidence not just in UL, but in the wider third-level system at a time when the sector needed an urgent injection of State funding.Dr Fitzgerald, previously a senior academic at UCD and one of the country’s top researchers, says his focus has been on dealing with all the issues in an open and transparent way.“My priority was to try to find out what happened, begin the process of fixing it and making sure we dealt with people who had grievances in a systematic way,” he says.There have been sweeping changes to the college’s management and governance structures this year with expertise in audit and risk. There has also been mediation and financial settlements with whistle-blowers, who first drew attention to many of these issues.“All those changes have been aimed at bringing in oversight to ensure that it never happens again,” he says.Rebuilding trust for UL, and the wider third-level sector, will be crucial if higher education is to secure extra State funding.There is little doubt that it is hurting. Core State funding since the financial crisis is down by close to 30 per cent, while students numbers have grown significantly.While the idea of a student loan scheme has been floated as one way of helping to bridge the funding gap for higher education, Fitzgerald is opposed to such as move.He feels a publicly-funded system – as is the norm across most of Europe – is the best way forward.“I think loans could be barrier for students . . . just 27 per cent of school leavers in Limerick city go to university that’s one of worst statistics in terms of access nationally.”Instead, he says higher levels of State funding, along with tight spending rules, are required. At the same time, colleges should be given greater autonomy to hire additional staff if they can demonstrate they are performing well.The consequences of underfunding for higher education, he says, are plain to see in terms of students falling through the cracks.“We’re not providing the sort of services and student experience that we would like to . . . that can affect the number of people who are progressing and completing their courses. Our non-completion rate is 20 per cent. We could do a lot more on the student experience and engagement,” he says.“It also affects our ability to deliver new programmes and impacts on our ability to provide problem-based learning and experiential learning . . . there’s one class with over 700 students – it’s impossible for anyone to learn properly in that environment.”Student numbers at the university, perched on the edge of Limerick city, are projected to grow by 30 per cent over the next decade, up from 15,000 to 20,000.Yet State funding for capital projects has been virtually non-existent for the past decade.Notwithstanding that, there are ambitious plans for the expansion of UL into the heart of the city and in a new “university town” on the ClareLimerick border.Dr Fitzgerald says the university is in discussions with Clare County Council about a special development zone.“The idea is to create a university town: a space where people would move in to work, live go to school and participate in all the things that a university can offer: sports, arts, education and so on.”It would require a new norther distributor road, off the N7, to open up the land for development.Despite the challenges, he is defiantly upbeat for the future of the university and its students.He says they have some of the best employability rates, with 74 per cent of graduates securing work and 20 per cent going on to do post-grads.In addition, he sees a growing role for the university in providing upskilling and lifelong learning for employees in the workplace."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3534025.1529263026!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"almost 16 of areas surveyed litter free report","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe National Litter Pollution Report, by the Department of the Environment’s Litter Monitoring Body, looks at the extent, causes and composition of litter across the State.

Its main findings show that cigarette-related refuse accounts for more than 56 per cent of litter in the Republic, with most of that made up of cigarette butts.At 17 per cent, packaging items such as cardboard, paper, bottles and caps, glass and cans are the second-largest litter component, while food-related items including chewing gum, at 9 per cent, make up the third most common litter cause. Sweets-related items such as wrappers finished in fourth position, at just under 8 per cent.Passing pedestrians were found to be the main causes of litter, accounting for 42 per cent, substantially ahead of passing motorists, who were the second largest cause, accounting for 19 per cent in 2017.Retail outlets, places of leisure or entertainment, fast-food outlets and schools and schoolchildren were other factors identified.“I would like to commend the local authorities, who work closely with the communities they serve, and are continuing to make progress in the ongoing battle against litter pollution across the country,” Mr Naughten said.“Each of us has personal responsibility and a role to play in keeping the towns, villages and cities we live in litter-free. Smokers in particular can bring about a significant improvement in the litter situation through relatively minor behavioural changes.“Everyone must accept that, ultimately, it is their own actions that will ensure whether or not we live in a litter-free environment.”He said that while he was “pleased with some of the results”, there was a need to “focus our efforts to maintain the improving standards being achieved across the country.

Video: Enda O\u0027Dowd\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFifty years on from the housing protest  by former MP  Austin Currie, the vast majority of Catholics and Protestants continue to live apart.  Photo Enda O’Dowd Fifty years after the beginning of the civil rights protests, segregation has not been seriously tackled in the North, the chair of the NI Community Relations Council has said. Peter Osborne was speaking at a housing conference in Dungannon, Co Tyrone, to mark the 50th anniversary since the so-called Caledon Protest. The Nationalist MP, Austin Currie - who was among those who spoke at Housing: Then and Now - and two others squatted in house in the village to protest at discrimination in the allocation of social housing. Their action - which was followed two months later by the first protest march - is usually regarded as marking the starting point of the civil rights movement in Northern Ireland. “Fifty years on from civil rights, 20 years on from the Good Friday Agreement, we simply have not tackled segregation this society,” Mr Osborne told the conference. “Policies do not reflect a desire to do that, and until we do we’ll be having this conversation in 50 years’ time.” While Mr Osborne stressed that life in Northern Ireland was “immeasurably better” than it was when he was growing up in the 1960s and 70s - and gave credit to the politicians from all sides who had worked towards peace, in particular since the signing of the Belfast Agreement in 1998 - he said sectarianism continues to dictate everything in Northern Ireland. “That brings us back all the time, unable to recover from the addiction to conflict,” he said. “We’ve got to address that issue.” Mr Osborne described the continued existence of segregation in housing and education as “scandalous”. “In 10 years our policy is to build 487 shared housing units, in the same ten-year period in Northern Ireland in which about 60,000 houses will be built in total. “The extent of our ambition on shared housing is fewer than 1 per cent of total builds, is that the best we can do? Ninety-four per cent of social housing in Belfast is still segregated,” he said. Referring to the erection of UVF-linked flags and banners in a shared housing scheme in Cantrell Close and Global Crescent in East Belfast, Mr Osborne said it demonstrated the “utter failure” of public and other agencies to deal with challenges to their policies. “It needs to be addressed, otherwise what’s the point of having a shared housing policy,” he said. Eileen Patterson, director of communities with housing association Radius Housing - which is responsible for the East Belfast scheme - said residents in those areas were fearful and frustrated, and the problem was a lack of housing policy in Northern Ireland. “We don’t have a policy on anything. We have a strategy, we have a notion, and housing tries to react to all of this,” she said. “Shared housing in isolation will not work, it cannot work. Shared education is absolutely essential. “Too long we’ve thought, we live in Northern Ireland and we have Catholics and Protestants, we’ll never solve it. “We need to look at other areas who’ve had just as challenging segregation and we need to learn from that,” she said. Paddy Grey, Professor Emeritus at Ulster University, said that while the initial objectives of the civil rights movement in regard to housing - the removal of discrimination in the allocation of social housing - had been met with the formation of the Northern Ireland Housing Executive in 1971, about 90 per cent of public housing in Northern Ireland remained segregated. “We haven’t had discrimination, but indirectly we’ve had people remaining in their same areas and there’s been no real drive to bring people together other than in the token new estates that have been built. “These are mainly in non-contentious areas, not exclusively so because some are now being built in Belfast, but I think there has to be an active approach.” He suggested choice-based letting, a system already in use in the Republic of Ireland and the UK whereby prospective tenants bid for houses, might help remedy this, though his colleague Joe Frey, Visiting Professor at Ulster University, voiced concerns over accessibility and said that ingrained concerns might be difficult to overcome. “I think it may well work in areas of lower demand particularly in rural areas such as Ballycastle, Limavady, even Portadown, where there’s actually still quite bit of mixing on religious terms in housing executive estates, but I think in areas such as Belfast where you have the peace walls that would be more difficult to overcome. “Certainly, in terms of the allocation scheme the original objectives of the civil rights movement have been more than achieved in terms of fairness and equality, but I think the circumstances have changed.” Among these, according to Prof Frey, are lack of public money, the growing complexity of social problems such as mental health issues and drug dependency, and the lack of a minister at Stormont which is preventing decisions being made on changes to the allocations system and other housing policies. “In that sense it is a showstopper for anything significant,” he said.

The report on the views of those living on both sides of the border was completed by researchers at Queen’s University Belfast. It indicated that half of residents are against a technological solution to custom checks.The government has been criticised for not allowing time to debate the Irish border during a series of key Brexit votes at Westminster. Only 15 minutes was set aside for debating changes to devolved powers proposed by the Lords in the EU Withdrawal bill.SNP MPs walked out of the House of Commons chamber during PMQs on 13 June 2018, after their Westminster leader Ian Blackford was removed by the Speaker.Not giving Blackford the opportunity to speak?Not true. The SNP was about to be granted a debate on how the devolution aspects of the EU Withdrawal Bill.Disappointing that they chose not to take this opportunity to take this forward.Will their debate be granted?Understand a debate under SO24 has been granted. Entirely a matter for the Speaker of the House.Almost no debate yesterday on the important issue of the role devolved administrations will play in the Brexit process?The House agreed to the Programme Motion which allocated enough time to discuss devolved matters in the Bill. However, due to the number of isions pushed to a vote this time was restricted. This was not a decision or choice by the Government.On further engagement with DAs:Our amendment respects the devolution settlement – as agreed with the Welsh Government.We spent the last year negotiating with the Welsh and Scottish Governments and the amendment we have put forward sees the vast majority of EU powers with devolved responsibilities automatically flow to Belfast, Cardiff and Edinburgh. We look forward to continuing to work closely with the Scottish Government to create the UK-wide legal frameworks we need to protect the UK internal market – a market which is vital for business and jobs in Scotland. Digital Registration and the electoral consultation responseContext: Electoral digital registration which has been available in GB since 2014 is being rolled out to NI on Monday 18th by the Chief Electoral Officer. Digital registration is not replacing the paper application system which remains in place for those that wish to use it but we expect that as in the rest of the UK the majority of people will chose to use the new online system to register. All the parties have welcomed the introduction of the system.The consultation response, although containing no decisions, will be more controversial. It will be interpreted as opening the door to the closure of regional electoral offices. It is important to be clear that decisions on the future structure of the Electoral Office are and operational matter for the CEO not matters for ministers. I would like to take this opportunity welcome today’s launch of digital registration. This is an exciting step forward for NI. People will be able to register to vote quickly and easily on their phone, tablet or computer anywhere that is convenient for them. It provides for NI the same element of choice that is already available to the rest of the UK.  I am aware that the response to the consultation on the future of electoral delivery in NI has been published today. It will now be for the Chief Electoral Officer to consider how she wishes to move forward. The Electoral Office is independent. Decisions on the structure and makeup of the Electoral Office are operational matters for the CEO. Digital registration will be an additional option to paper registration – it won’t replace it, so those who wish to continue to register by post in person can do so.Further delay in MLA payContext: The News Letter’s Sam McBride wrote on 15 June 2018 that the Secretary of State has “declined to explain what has cause months of delay in cutting the pay of MLAs while Stormont lies empty”.The Secretary of State has made clear that she is minded to reduce MLA pay in line with the recommendations of Trevor Reaney. This remains her position. Context: A 12-year-old boy from County Tyrone has suffered an epileptic seizure hours after cannabis oil brought from Canada was confiscated at Heathrow Airport, his mother has said. Charlotte Caldwell said her son Billy had suffered a “small 30 second seizure”, the first in almost a year, on Tuesday morning. The cannabis oil was removed from Ms Caldwell at the airport on Monday. She has called on Home Office minister Nick Hurd to return the medication. Ms Caldwell posted a video of her son having the seizure on social media. Nick Hurd met Ms Caldwell on Monday and advised her that despite these extremely difficult circumstances, it is unlawful to possess Schedule 1 drugs such as those seized at the border on Monday morning, without a licence. The Minister urged the family to explore licensing options with the Department of Health Northern Ireland. This is a Home Office lead, but we can provide the following lines should we be asked for comment: Any parent will want to do whatever they can to alleviate the symptoms of their child when suffering from a debilitating illness. Nevertheless, it is important that medicines are thoroughly tested to ensure they meet rigorous standards so that doctors and patients are assured of their efficacy, quality and safety. In Northern Ireland licensing decisions are devolved and any applications would be considered by the Department of Health Northern Ireland. In the case of import or export licensing, the Home Office discharges this function for Northern Ireland and is the appropriate issuing authority for the UK. Whilst we recognise that people with debilitating illnesses are looking to alleviate their symptoms, it is important that medicines are thoroughly tested to ensure they meet rigorous standards so that doctors and patients are assured of their efficacy, quality and safety. Cannabis is listed as a Schedule 1 drug as in its raw form it is not recognised in the UK as having any medicinal benefit and is therefore subject to strict control restrictions. It is unlawful to import, possess, supply or produce products containing, or consisting of, cannabis except under licence.Context: One year on from the Grenfell Towerblock tragedy, sixty people, many of them elderly and vulnerable, have been told they must leave their homes in Block B, Russell Court, on Belfast’s Lisburn Road. The tower block is owned by Radius Housing who took the decision to close it after a group of experts reported a significant shortfall in fire safety measures at the building. All of the residents will be moved out within four weeks. In the meantime, marshals are on duty 24 hours per day to ensure that everyone remains safe. The fire alarm system in the building has been enhanced and water services and emergency procedures have been checked. Nothing is more important than ensuring people are safe in their homes.  The safety of residents is absolutely paramount but this will undoubtedly cause huge disruption and concern for residents in Russell Court. Fire safety marshals will be on alert around the clock while residents move out over the next four weeks The NI Department for Communities is working closely with Radius Housing and the Northern Ireland Housing Executive to ensure that affected iniduals are rehoused. My Department will continue to keep close contact with officials from the Northern Ireland Civil Service on how residents are being rehoused and supported through this process.DUP ‘fines politicians for media interviews’Context: The DUP has declined to comment on claims it fines its politicians if they talk to the media without permission. A DUP insider told the BBC’s Nolan Show politicians are forced to pay as much as £1,000 if they break internal protocol on dealing with the press. The DUP said it operated under a constitution and a code of conduct, passed by its executive. The BBC has seen a letter signed by the DUP’s chief executive imposing a fine on an elected representative. While the politician was asked to pay a £100 fine, the BBC understands repeat offenders might face higher charges of £500 or £1,000. The other main Stormont parties all told the BBC they do not impose similar penalties. This is unlikely to be something that you will wish to comment on beyond noting that it is a matter for the DUP.Restoration of an Executive The Government’s top priority remains the restoration of devolved government in Northern Ireland.  My focus remains on redoubling efforts to restore a locally elected, democratically accountable devolved government in Northern Ireland. Engaging closely with the political parties, and the Irish Government as appropriate, to encourage and support work towards an accommodation to restore the Executive. The UK Government also has a responsibility to ensure good governance and the continued delivery of public services. That’s why, with great reluctance, we intervened to set budget allocations for NI departments for 2018-19. I continue to keep available a range of options for supporting the process and encouraging the parties to achieve the positive outcome we all deeply want. I continue to keep under review my statutory obligation to call an Assembly Election.  We will take those decisions which are necessary to provide good governance and political stability for Northern Ireland - consistent always with restoring the Executive and local decision-making at the earliest possible opportunity. We will continue to implement our obligations under the Agreement and its successors where possible - always working for the good of the community as a whole. We will continue to work with all the Northern Ireland parties - and with the Irish Government as appropriate - to remove the barriers to restoring the Executive and a fully functioning Assembly. As we have made repeatedly clear, we continue to believe that a majority in Northern Ireland are committed to the Union, and therefore the tests for a border poll have not been met. On this basis, UKG has no plans to hold a border poll. As the Taoiseach himself acknowledged, continued discussion about a border poll at this time is unhelpful and unnecessary. Considering the importance of this judgment and the questions of law involved, I understand and welcome the NICS decision to appeal. It will be valuable to have these issues fully tested by the Courts so that there is clarity about the implications of the judgment. As these legal proceedings are ongoing it would not be appropriate to comment further at this time. I recognise, however, that in the ongoing absence of locally appointed Ministers from the elected NI political parties, the civil servants in Northern Ireland have been left with the responsibility of ensuring governance in Northern Ireland. Since January last year, the NI Civil Service has continued to manage and maintain the delivery of vital public services in Northern Ireland in very difficult circumstances. The NICS and are to be commended for the work they have and continue to do in the public interest. But, I remain firm in my view that it is absolutely crucial that we secure the return of a functioning, effective, devolved government in Northern Ireland, to get back to the business of governing and to take the strategic decisions that affect the long-term future of Northern Ireland and its people. We welcome the progress we made at March European Council, including progress on the Withdrawal Agreement and agreeing the Implementation Period. We want to get onto the future relationship as quickly as possible - both on the economic and the security partnership. We recognise the need to address the remaining areas on the withdrawal. On Northern Ireland  Ireland, we need to come up with a solution which works for communities on both sides, recognising the unique social, political and economic circumstances of the border. We are clear in our objectives of protecting the Belfast Agreement, avoiding a hard border (with no physical infrastructure or related checks and controls) and protecting the economic and constitutional integrity of the UK. We have been undertaking an intensive work programme with the Commission and Irish on solutions since the March Council. We have engaged in a detailed process and schedule of meetings that look at the issues and solutions covering the areas in their draft protocol (with solutions going no further than the PM’s Mansion House speech). This covers a range of issues from customs and SPS through to citizenship rights under the Belfast Agreement. As the PM set out in her letter to Donald Tusk, we are committed to translating plan C into legal text in the Withdrawal Agreement. In our view, we need to address the border through discussions on our future trading relationship with the EU - that’s why we’re keen to get on with discussing the future. The UK is seeking the broadest and deepest possible agreement that covers more sectors and co-operates more fully than any other Free Trade Agreement. We want an economic partnership that delivers the maximum benefits for our economies while respecting the integrity of each other’s institutions. We start from a unique position - on day one we will have exactly the same rules and regulations. A new trading agreement should reflect this starting point. The UK has been clear that we are committed to turning all of the commitments made under the Joint Report into legally binding text. There are some aspects of the Commission’s proposals which we agree with, particularly the preservation of the Common Travel Area. However, the PM has made our position on the other elements of the draft text clear, and said that we could never accept this. That remains our position, and that is why those parts are marked as not agreed in the Withdrawal treaty text. While the UK believes that these commitments can be fulfilled through the overall UK-EU future partnership, it is also necessary to ensure there is a backstop solution for the Northern Ireland border that both avoids a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland and protects the constitutional integrity of the UK internal market. We have agreed that, at least, the so called ‘backstop’ option should be translated in legally binding form in to the Withdrawal Agreement. The UK’s proposal on the customs elements of a temporary backstop is that a Temporary Customs Arrangement should exist between the UK and the EU. This will ensure that if a customs arrangement with the EU is not in place by the end of the Implementation Period there will be no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, or between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. We are clear this would only be used in very specific circumstances and that it will be strictly time-limited. It is not our preferred option. The Prime Minister set out, on 7 June, that we are committed to making sure that the future arrangements are in place by the end of December 2021 at the very latest. She also set out that we will not sign up for anything which means the EU can hold the UK in this temporary backstop against its will. At the point that the new customs arrangement is ready the backstop will end. We look forward to discussing this further with the EU.Abortion in Northern IrelandContext: On 12 June 2018, Amnesty International criticised Karen Bradley’s claim that parliament was not qualified to change Northern Ireland’s abortion regime and her further contention that people in Northern Ireland did not want Westminster to take responsibility for the issue. The Government is facing mounting pressure to reform the strict abortion laws in Northern Ireland after Supreme Court judges expressed the view that the law is incompatible with human rights legislation insofar as it prohibits abortion on the grounds of fatal fetal abnormality rape and incest (though no formal declaration of incompatibility was made by the Court, given the standing issues of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission) The Government believes this is a matter for the people of Northern Ireland and Northern Ireland politicians. Abortion is an extremely sensitive issue, and we recognise the strongly held views on all sides of the debate in Northern Ireland. The Government thinks it is absolutely essential that a devolved government in Northern Ireland is restored, so that locally elected, democratically accountable politicians can debate fundamental changes to policy on abortion, and the people of Northern Ireland have a direct say in the process. Our key priority is to redouble our efforts to restore power-sharing, so that the people of Northern Ireland can decide what is right for Northern Ireland, rather than Westminster speaking on their behalf. .If asked about the Supreme Court judgment The Government is carefully considering the full judgment. This is clearly a complex area of law, and an extremely sensitive subject matter, which raises a number of different issues to consider.Does the abortion referendum result in Ireland not change things? The referendum in Ireland has not changed the UK Government’s successive approach to how abortion is dealt with in Northern Ireland. It is important to be clear. The referendum was not a vote on how the law should be reformed. In Ireland, a change of constitution requires a referendum before introducing new legislation. The Irish Government and Dail will now debate and pass the legislation to put in place in Ireland.What will the UK Government do to recognise the fact that Northern Ireland will soon have the most restrictive abortion law of any part of the British Isles? We are committed to restoring locally elected, democratically accountable devolved government in Northern Ireland, so that fundamental changes can be made in Northern Ireland. And action has already been taken in this area. We have put in place arrangements that mean women from Northern Ireland will not be charged for termination of pregnancy services in England, with travel support available for those women who find themselves in a financial hardship situation. We believe this approach strikes an appropriate balance between the devolved position of abortion in Northern Ireland, and allowing women normally resident in Northern Ireland to have access to abortion services in England within the bounds of the law.If the Irish Government extends provision of abortion services to women normally resident in Northern Ireland, won’t this increase pressure for Northern Ireland to update its abortion law? It would not be appropriate to speculate on what approach may or may not be adopted following the referendum. That is a matter for the Irish Government and the Irish Parliament.  The UK Government has already put in place arrangements to allow women normally resident in Northern Ireland to have access to safe abortion services in England within the bounds of the law. Since the 29th June last year no Northern Irish women have been charged for abortion procedures performed in England. But this decision does not change the fact that abortion is a devolved issue, and therefore rightly one for the Northern Ireland Assembly to debate.If asked whether the Government agrees that abortion is a human rights issue: The UK has a longstanding tradition of ensuring our rights and liberties are protected domestically and of fulfilling our international human rights obligations. Rights are protected domestically through the Human Rights Act 1998 – and through the devolution statutes, as well as other key pieces of legislation and the common law. Abortion raises complex human rights issues, as has been recognised by the courts when considering these matters. The Government is carefully considering the recent Supreme Court full judgment.If asked why the Government will not just repeal sections 58 and 59 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 to legalise abortion in NI We have no plans to amend the law on abortion in either England and Wales or Northern Ireland. This is a devolved matter in Northern Ireland, and ultimately this is an issue for a restored Assembly to consider, where the decision can be taken by locally elected, locally accountable politicians.Is the Government against extending abortion rights to Northern Ireland? We are very clear that abortion is a devolved issue and the Assembly is the proper place for such legislation for Northern Ireland to be considered. The Government therefore has no plans to introduce legislation changing Northern Ireland’s abortion law. We are committed to restoring locally elected, democratically accountable devolved government in Northern Ireland.But that does not prevent others from introducing such legislation if they so wish. In such circumstances, it is worth reiterating two important considerations: One, the power of Westminster, as the sovereign Parliament, to legislate remains and Two, the Government’s policy is to allow a free vote on matters of conscience such as abortion. Building on the good progress made on proposals to address the legacy of the past, this Government believes that now is the time to seek wider views. That is why on 11 May, the Secretary of State launched a consultation to provide everyone who has an interest, with the opportunity to see the proposed way forward and contribute to the discussion on the issues.  This is an open consultation and we want everyone to have their say on how the new legacy institutions would work in practice. There is broad agreement amongst victims and survivors that the legacy institutions as they are currently set up are not working well for anyone. As our Northern Ireland manifesto at the last Election made clear the Government remains committed to the implementation of the legacy institutions in the 2014 Stormont House Agreement. We believe that the legacy institutions have the potential to provide better outcomes for victims and survivors and for all those affected by the Troubles. The new institutions will be under legal obligations to operate in ways that are fair, balanced and proportionate. The HIU will deal with deaths in chronological order and ensure that unresolved deaths - including hundreds of murders caused by terrorists - are investigated. A number of terrorist murders from the Troubles are actively under investigation by the Police Service of Northern Ireland and other police forces. I am clear that under current mechanisms for investigating the past there is a disproportionate focus on former members of the armed forces and the Police. The Government is committed to ensuring that all outstanding deaths in Northern Ireland should be investigated in ways that are fair, balanced and proportionate The point the Prime Minister was making was that we want to see all outstanding deaths in Northern Ireland investigated in a fair, balanced and proportionate way to ensure the system does not focus disproportionately on the security forces. We want the HIU set up to look at all outstanding cases, and to investigate in chronological order, so that there is no unfair focus.Statute of Limitations Our Northern Ireland manifesto made clear, any approach to the past must be consistent with the rule of law. Any amnesty or statute of limitations would need to apply to all those involved in Troubles-related incidents, including former terrorists, if the UK is to comply with international law. To imply otherwise would be to mislead veterans. A statute of limitations does not remove the need to have Article 2 compliant investigation where iniduals have been killed as a result of the use of force by the state. We must remember that in Northern Ireland, our soldiers put their lives on the line to uphold the rule of law. Many people in Northern Ireland still cling to the hope that the law will see justice done for the many terrible crimes that took place during the Troubles. For that reason, we need to be aware that within Northern Ireland there is widespread opposition to any form of statute of limitations - from victims and survivors from all parts of the community from political parties from many veterans who live in Northern Ireland and from former and serving police officers. It is better to have the HIU, a carefully designed Article 2 compliant mechanism which would only re-investigate in specific circumstances set out in the legislation. The HIU will have a duty to act in a manner which is fair, balanced and proportionate. The current mechanisms for investigating the past are not delivering for victims. Right now too many cases are not being investigated, including hundreds of murders by terrorists. Implementing the consultation proposals will create the Historical Investigations Unit (HIU) which will be under a statutory duty to aim to complete its work within 5 years and to deal with deaths in chronological order. The HIU will be under a legal duty to be fair, balanced and proportionate, to ensure that our veterans are not unfairly treated or disproportionately investigated. The HIU cannot unnecessarily duplicate any investigation or part of it. It will look at more deaths of security forces than deaths by security forces.Support for veterans Where veterans face allegations in connection with events arising from their duties, they receive full legal support and representation (including the services of a barrister, where this is appropriate) for as long as is necessary. This applies regardless of how long the veteran served, the duration of any proceedings, or how long ago the events occurred. In addition to legal support, a range of welfare and pastoral support is available, depending on the needs of the inidual veteran. Sometimes this is delivered through the MOD’s ‘Veterans UK’, and the Regimental Association or equivalent organisation can also be involved, as can appropriate charities, depending on circumstances. Inquest reform is essential if the inquest system is to work effectively. The Government continues to support reform of the legacy inquest system. However, this is a devolved matter and it will be for the devolved administration to make a decision on inquest funding. I have been deeply moved listening to the victims and survivors I have met in recent months, including those living with severe injuries as a result of the Troubles. Work on a pension is properly for the Executive to take forward. It is one of the many reasons why it is so important to have an Executive restored. However, the Government is aware of how deeply upsetting and frustrating this delay is for those who suffered so much during the Troubles.  That is why I have commissioned advice from the Victims Commissioner in Northern Ireland on a victims’ pension. This is an important issue for the UK Government and we want to ensure that progress is made. The Government believes that once updated advice is received, consideration must be given to agrees how a pension could be brought forward in a way that has the support of, and meets the needs of, victims and survivors in Northern Ireland. In the continued absence of an Executive, I set out a NI Budget for the 2018-19 financial year in a Statement to Parliament on 8 March. I am planning now to take forward a Budget Bill to put this budget position on a legal footing, providing certainty on finances, in order to protect delivery of public services and ensure good governance. The Government is committed to a comprehensive and ambitious set of city deals across Northern Ireland to boost investment and help unlock Northern Ireland’s full potential. I understand that the Belfast City Regions has now presented its initial proposals to officials from the NICS and UK Government, and that work is ongoing to refine projects and develop the appropriate business cases.  I welcome this progress, and officials from UKG will continue to support the development of a set of city deal. There remains more work to be done, but it is important that progress continues. I understand your calls for a review of local government services, however, you will understand that this is a devolved matter and not one for the UK Government. This is one of many areas which show just how important it is to have a restored Executive back in place and making the strategic decisions required in the interests of the whole community. And that is why restoring devolution remains our overriding priority."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3533831.1529256193!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ni civil rights we did get a letter get out or be burned out","story":"50 years after he ignited the civil rights movement in Northern Ireland, MP Austin Currie goes back to the place where it all began.

The family were eventually given a house outside Dungannon, where they have lived for the past 48 years. Photograph: Freya McClementsIn the 50 years since she and her family were evicted from a house in Caledon, Co Tyrone, Mary Teresa Goodfellow has watched the moment on television many times since.“We were dragged out. There’s the baby in my arms and we’re being trailed out.”The Goodfellows’ eviction – on June 18th, 1968 – was the last straw for Austin Currie, a Nationalist Party MP. Two days later, he and two others – Ms Goodfellow’s brother Patsy Gildernew, and a local farmer, Joe Campbell – broke into the house next door, which had been allocated to an unmarried Protestant woman, 19-year-old Emily Beattie. Regarded as marking the beginning of the North’s civil rights protests, their action at Caledon was followed two months later by the first civil rights march. Among the demands of the civil rights movement was an end to discrimination in the allocation of housing by removing it from the hands of local councils, which tended to be unionist-dominated.By October 1967, the Goodfellows had been living with Ms Goodfellow’s mother for two years. But they were hopeful a chance might come their way of one of 15 houses under construction in Kinnard Park in Caledon.Instead, only one was given to a Catholic family.So Ms Goodfellow, her husband, Francis, and their two children decided they would squat in No 11 Kinnard Park another family, the McKennas, did the same in No 9.The Goodfellows walked right in – “the door was open”, recalls Ms Goodfellow – and they were sitting on the floor, their children on their knees, when workmen arrived the following morning.“Then the police came,” says Mr Goodfellow, “and they inspected the house and said they could do nothing because there was no damage.”He was taken to court and an eviction order was issued, though it was suspended for six months.The Goodfellows stayed Ms Goodfellow, who had been pregnant when they moved in, gave birth to a girl.In No 9, the McKennas had become too frightened and had left.“At the time we did get a letter, get out or be burned out,” says Mr Goodfellow.“You were always sort of scared, in case somebody would come in the night and you were there,” adds Ms Goodfellow.“We wanted to tell people exactly what was happening but at the same time I was scared. And I was scared for my baby.”Next door, the McKennas’ house had been allocated – to Emily Beattie.“Can you imagine that could happen?” asks Ms Goodfellow.“A family with three young children were there and they handed it to an unmarried girl. It just shows you what they could do in those days. It was such an injustice – there’s no two ways about it.”The morning the police and bailiffs arrived Ms Goodfellow was given time to feed her children before being dragged outside, her seven-week-old daughter in her arms inside the house their furniture and crockery were broken.The family were eventually given a house outside Dungannon, where they have lived for the past 48 years.“I think we’ve come on a long way,” says Ms Goodfellow. “Our children have all got jobs, they didn’t have to emigrate and they can all get homes, which we couldn’t. We’re glad that we were part of it. We feel that we did do something.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3534096.1529268751!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"northern secretary s briefing notes sent to media in blunder","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Northern Secretary Karen Bradley arrives for a Cabinet meeting chaired by British prime minister Theresa May at No 10 Downing Street earlier this month in London. File photograph: Jack TaylorGetty ImagesThe Northern Ireland Office has issued a press notice to journalists which included the Secretary of State’s briefing notes on a range of key issues including Brexit and abortion, and legacy and economic issues. The document, sent to outlets on Sunday night about a media opportunity with Karen Bradley on Monday, outlined the British government’s position on a number of key issues impacting on the North.On abortion, the document said: “Our key priority is to redouble our efforts to restore power-sharing, so that the people of Northern Ireland can decide what is right for Northern Ireland, rather than Westminster speaking on their behalf.”On what the government intended to do to recognise the fact that Northern Ireland will soon have the most restrictive abortion law of any part of the British Isles, it noted a commitment to restoring Stormont and that it provided the option for women to travel to England for a free abortion. “We believe this approach strikes an appropriate balance between the devolved position of abortion in Northern Ireland, and allowing women normally resident in Northern Ireland to have access to abortion services in England within the bounds of the law.”On Brexit, the notes said the British government wanted to get to the future relationship with the EU as quickly as possible – in terms of both the economic and security partnership.“In our view, we need to address the border through discussions on our future trading relationship with the EU – that’s why we’re keen to get on with discussing the future.”On the UK’s future economic partnership with the EU, it is seeking “the broadest and deepest possible agreement that covers more sectors and co-operates more fully than any other Free Trade Agreement”.

A group of up to 20 holidaymakers were involved in the unruly drink-fuelled disturbance, and three passengers were removed and detained by French police on arrival at Paris Beauvais on Saturday morning.The captain of the return flight from the party island to Dublin on Saturday afternoon – delayed by 2hrs 40m as a result of the disturbance – apologised for the delay and explained the outward flight had had to ert due to the disturbance.The captain said there had been children onboard the earlier flight, which was erted over safety concerns for all the passengers.The captain said the unruly passengers had been drinking at Dublin Airport prior to take-off.The Ibiza-bound flight’s scheduled take-off had been 8.50am on Saturday. Speaking of the episode, Ryanair spokesman Robin Kiely said: “This flight from Dublin to Ibiza erted to Paris Beauvais after three passengers became disruptive inflight.“The aircraft landed normally and the passengers were removed and detained by police upon arrival, before the aircraft continued to Ibiza.”Mr Kiely said: “We will not tolerate unruly or disruptive behaviour at any time and the safety and comfort of our customers, crew and aircraft is our number one priority.”Mr Kiely was not able to comment on the costs to Ryanair of the ersion or the legal fate of the three passengers who were taken off the plane.He said: “This is now a matter for local police.”He said the incident “is exactly why we are calling for significant changes to prohibit the sale of alcohol at airports, such as a two-drink limit per passenger and no alcohol sales before 10am”. He said: “It’s incumbent on the airports to introduce these preventative measures to curb excessive drinking and the problems it creates, rather than allowing passengers to drink to excess before their flights.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3534071.1529266562!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"vague assurances on post brexit nuclear safety not worth much","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDenis Naughten said Britain’s exit from Euratom was discussed at a recent gathering in Dublin Castle of the UK-Ireland Contact Group, which meets twice a year. Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsBritain’s energy minister has written personally to Minister for Environment Denis Naughten offering “significant assurances” there would be no threat to Ireland from any changes in nuclear safety standards after Brexit. The UK is planning to pull out of Euratom, the body which regulates the nuclear industry across Europe, including the safe transport of radioactive materials across borders, after it leaves the EU next March. Although the watchdog is legally separate from the bloc, membership requires being subject to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, which British prime minister Theresa May’s government is opposed to. Leaked documents last month show Britain is missing deadlines for putting post-Brexit nuclear safeguards in place, including the delivery of an IT system to track nuclear material and the recruitment of qualified inspectors. The UK’s Office for Nuclear Regulation has identified five “high-level risks” – categorised as “red” on a red, amber, green alert scale – that remain outstanding. Mr Naughten said Greg Clark, Britain’s Minister for Energy and Industry, wrote to him about planned future arrangements on civil nuclear power. “This letter provided significant assurances in relation to nuclear safety standards,” he said in response to a parliamentary question.“I have welcomed this information from my UK counterpart which is indicative of the constructive relationship Ireland enjoys with the UK in this area.”“There are currently no safety or security concerns for Ireland arising from the UK withdrawal from the Euratom Treaty. “In the first instance, the UK remains a member of Euratom, and the UK nuclear industry remains subject to oversight by the EU institutions, until such time as their withdrawal from the EU is finalised.”However, Timmy Dooley, Fianna Fail’s environment spokesman, said Mr Naughten should not be satisfied with “vague assurances” from London. “I have grave concerns about the capacity of the British administration to maintain standards, absent from a European context. “This is something we should be concerned about. “In light of everything that is now happening, in terms of the Brexit negotiations, the minister needs to engage much more comprehensively on the issue and not be guided by vague assurances that he is getting from his British counterpart. “They are not really worth very much.” Mr Naughten said the exit from Euratom was discussed at a recent gathering in Dublin Castle of the UK-Ireland Contact Group, which meets twice a year, to deal with radiological matters of mutual interest to both countries. “The on-going Brexit negotiations, including matters relating to the UK’s decision to leave the Euratom Treaty, are being conducted bilaterally between the European Union, represented by the European Commission, and the UK,” he added. “Ireland contributes to the process through its representation at the European Council Article 50 Working Party which meets regularly to discuss Brexit related issues, including Euratom.” Earlier this year, Environmental Pillar, a coalition of 26 environmental organisations in Ireland, warned of “alarming deficiencies” in the UK’s approach to assessing impacts of plans to expand its nuclear power programme.

Money Expert, said: Clearly the way we shop and pay for services is changing but for millions of people in the UK cash still plays an essential role in their everyday lives. With bank branch closures on the rise and the UK\u0027s free-to-use ATM network under threat, it\u0027s vital these people are still able to access the cash they need.Banks and FinanceTransport for London (TfL)Please review our commenting policyColombian election: Ivan Duque vows to \u0026#39correct\u0026#39 peace accord after comfortable winChildren separated from parents at US border held in cages in Texas warehouseMillennials on track to have worse health problems than their parents by middle age, new study findsWorld Cup 2018: \u0026#39Safe space\u0026#39 for LGBT football fans in Russia forced to move after \u0026#39political attack\u0026#39Shoppers offered cash for old unwanted John Lewis clothes even if they are damaged\u0026#39Windrush Day\u0026#39 announced by government to \u0026#39celebrate\u0026#39 the arrival of Caribbean migrants 70 years ago Donald Trump UK visit: Everything you need to know, from when he will arrive to who he is expected to meetStealth tax to pay for NHS boost, with personal tax thresholds expected to be frozen after 2020Comment: NHS funding boost comes dangerously close to being a magic money treeDavid Dimbleby to leave Question Time after 25 yearsPoldark, series 4 episode 2 review -

Meanwhile, funding pressures have made it harder for schools and local authorities to provide specialist provision to the most vulnerable learners.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspMore than 2,000 children with complex needs have “no education provision at all” due to inadequate\u0026nbspfunding, according to the new letter – which is backed by some Conservative-led councils.\u0026nbspJo-Ann D’Costa Manuel, director of charity Autism Parent Empower, said she knows of parents whose children have been at home for two years while they wait for the right specialist school place.“When they are left at home on a waiting list, even if they are provided some help, they become wasted years,” she said. “It is hugely wasted time and opportunity for them to progress.”Ms D’Costa Manuel, who has a nine-year-old son with autism, told The Independent that some parents have resorted to home schooling their children because they feel “failed by the system”.“A lot of parents are not equipped to homeschool their children. They cannot suddenly become teachers or teaching assistants and know what to do,” she warned.\u0026nbspSome parents have been put in an “impossible position” and have been forced to quit their jobs to look after their children, according to Andrew Baisley, from the National Education Union (NEU).\u0026nbspAnd in other cases, parents have seen their children with SEND repeatedly being passed between mainstream schools because of funding and accountability pressures on staff, he added.\u0026nbsp“I think it is harder to get kids into mainstream schools because there is a massive financial disincentive and there is an enormous accountability disincentive,” Mr Baisley said.\u0026nbspLast month, schools minister Nick Gibb said judging schools on the education outcomes of students they have moved on could help tackle the rising number of schoolchildren being excluded.\u0026nbspIt came after special educational needs experts called for excluded children and parents to be protected by a “bill of rights”, giving them better scrutiny of a school’s decision to get rid of them.Nancy Gedge, a coordinator of special needs provision in a\u0026nbspschool in Oxfordshire, told The Independent that she thinks increasing funding alone will not solve the problems in the sector.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspUK news in picturesFire fighters attend the scene of a second fire at Glasgow\u0027s School of Art four years after part of the Charles Rennie Mackintosh designed building was destroyed by fire.

Flat desert on either side, a few lights.\u0026nbspThe Moroccan traveller Ibn Battuta passed this way on camel back in 1326, and wrote of its emphatic wilderness: “He who enters it is lost and he who leaves it is born.”Before mass tourism ruined them for a second time, I’d travelled to the so-called “lost” cities of Petra, Machu Picchu and Angkor Wat.\u0026nbspMy destination tonight was the isolated sandstone valley eulogised by Charles Doughty, the first European to enter it\u0026nbspin 1876, as “the fabulous Mada’in Saleh\u0026nbspwhich I was come from far countries to seek in Arabia”.The prospect of following in Doughty’s flapping shadow gave me a jolt of anticipation that I hadn’t experienced since my twenties.\u0026nbspDoughty’s classic book Arabia Deserta was championed by his friend TE\u0026nbspLawrence, who later used it as a military textbook, as the greatest record of adventure and travel in our language.It begins with Doughty trying to smuggle himself into Mada’in Saleh in the guise of a poor Syrian pilgrim.\u0026nbspEven up until recently few Europeans have visited this cradle of forgotten civilisations, which, though designated a World Heritage Site in 2008, remains a blank page on the archaeological record, closed off by geography, politics, religion.“Visitors last year from abroad?

My advance visit is aimed at providing an amuse-bouche, as it were.In the bright morning sunlight, Ahmed escorts me through locked gates, past the German-built railway-line linking Damascus with Medina, which Lawrence bombed (“there are still local tribes which call their sons Al-Orans”), to the celebrated Nabatean rock tombs.Doughty first heard about these in Petra, 300 miles north. Fifty years earlier, an awe-struck British naval commander had gazed in disbelief at Petra’s imperishable Treasury, murmuring, as many continue to do: “There is nothing in the world that resembles it.” He was wrong.If a little less rosier than her sister city, Mada’in Saleh shares her capacity to stagger.\u0026nbspOut of the flat desert, one after another, the ornate facades rise into sight, 111 of them, carved into perpendicular cliffs up to four storeys high, their low doorways decorated by Alexandrian masons in the first century AD, with Greek triangles, Roman pilasters, Persian flowers, Egyptian sphinxes, birds.“This is a twin to Petra,” Ahmed says. Except that in Petra we would be bobbing among crowds.Ahmed\u0026nbspis descended from a long line of imamsStanding in reverent silence, with the valley to ourselves, I recall how the Victorian artist who supplied the first images of Petra to the world, David Roberts, responded to that other city. “I turned from it at length with an impression which will be effaced only by death.”These tombs were carved for the Nabatean tribes who ruled this region for 300 years until the Romans annexed them in 106AD. Nomads who had settled and grown wealthy, the Nabateans controlled the lucrative spice route from the Mediterranean to the Red Sea.Then, like the civilisations they’d replaced, the Dedanites, the Lihyanites, the Thamuds, they galloped off into obscurity. Their tombs were looted: the acacia doors plundered for firewood, the marble statues melted to make lime for plaster, the porphyry urns smashed.All that survives of their caravan city, Hegra, is a flat expanse behind a wire fence: “her clay-built streets are again the blown dust in the wilderness,” Doughty wrote.The same desolation holds true for the still more ancient Biblical city of Dedan, situated on the lip of an oasis a few minutes drive way. To visit both sites is to gain the sense of a narrative even now being worked out.\u0026nbspUntil the 20th\u0026nbspcentury the story of these civilisations was scrawled on the rocks in Nabatean or Thamudic script. Ahmed leads me between two steep cliffs to the oldest inscription, written 6,000 years ago.Tombs in Mada\u0027in Saleh were decorated by Alexandrian masons in the first century with Greek, Roman and Persian symbolsThe ancient Biblical city of Dedan is situated on the lip of an oasisCliffs formed out of red and black sandstone have eroded into crazy, hallucinatory shapes such as elephants, mushrooms, and sealsAncient Dedan inscriptions.

Ahmed could be speaking of the cavity in the historical record when he says, “They were making sacrifices to one god, Dhu-Ghaibat, which means ‘the one who is absent’.”Out in the desert, the wind has chiselled its own mysterious deities and hieroglyphs. The scene is stunning. In Petra, which forms part of the same massif, David Roberts threw away his pencil in despair at being able to convey it, believing that the ruins “sink into insignificance when compared with these stupendous rocks”.It’s hard to disagree. Cliffs formed out of red and black sandstone have eroded into crazy, hallucinatory shapes: elephants, mushrooms, braying seals. If they were transcribed into music, it would be Wagnerian.They make you believe in mountain gods, I tell Ahmed, who smiles. “I never try smoking weed, but when I hear someone react, I feel like that. It makes you high, naturally.”For sheer high spirits, no one yields to the British archaeologist I meet that night. Jamie Quartermain is part of an international team employed since March to survey these sites.A surveyor who pioneered the use of drones, Quartermain says: “We’ve been wanting to get involved here, but Saudi has been a closed shop, a completely untapped reserve.The perception is that it’s big, open desert. When I tried to find out anything about it, there was essentially one book. The discovery that there are so many archaeological sites is a big shock for most people. It was a big shock for me.”Advised by the Royal Commission to expect 450 unexcavated sites, Quartermain estimates the truer number between 6,000-10,000.\u0026nbsp“The survival of the archaeology is remarkable, some of the best condition remains I’ve ever seen. We’re not finding it close to the surface, it’s above surface, well and truly visible.”Dedan\u0026nbspinscriptions. Holes in the rock floor denote a sacrificial spot from the time of the DedanitesDeploying a drone, he has begun creating a three-dimensional textural surface of the area. Already, what he has found is ground-breaking. “You can see all the archaeology jumping out and biting you on the bottom.”When, aged 20, I visited Petra, sleeping in one of the caves, I talked to the head of the Bdoul tribe, allegedly descendants of the Nabateans, who told me: “We have a saying that the more wealth you have, the more brain cells you need to be able to cope with it.What impresses about MBS’s plan for Mada’in Saleh is his determination to use his nation’s resources to avoid the pitfalls of Petra.“Wadi Rum is pretty disastrous,” says Chris Tuttle, an American archaeologist seconded to the project. Tuttle spent many years excavating in Petra. He saw at first hand the ruinous impact of tourism, both on the ruins and the local community.By contrast, in Al-Ula, the local town for Mada’in Saleh, there has been a concerted drive to educate the locals, giving scholarships to 150 children, but also to attract experts armed with the latest methodolOne reason for the blankness on Saudi Arabia’s archaeological map, says Tuttle, has been the resistance of conservative religious leaders to question their history. “You don’t need to study the past when you’ve been given a manual from God.”Suddenly, a multi-thousand-year-old story has become an open book, not a closed one, and the revelation it contains could be a complex of sites more significant even than Petra.\u0026nbspMy guide Ahmed Alimam is a perfect representative of Al-Ula’s past and future. He comes from a long line of imams descended from a grand tribal judge who arrived c1400 in Al Ula’s “old town”Abandoned in 1983, the year of Ahmed’s birth, this haunting labyrinth of mud houses and twisting streets replaced Dedan and Hegra. It was built using stones from those cities. They can be seen fortifying the occasional doorway.Ahmed leads the way down an empty street to the house where his parents used to live – collapsed beams, upturned crates. He shows me the mosque, erected over the spot where the Prophet Mohammed stopped in 630AD, and with a goat bone drew in the sand the direction of Medina Ahmed’s uncle was the last imam.Iranians are angry with Israel and Saudi Arabia, not just TrumpSaudi Arabia to build giant $9bn oil complex with French company TotalSaudis \u0027to cut off Qatar\u0027 with canal, nuclear dump and military baseSaudi Arabian Prince toured Hollywood and Harvard on trip to USAnd a modern inscription: the name “Charles”, scratched on the oat-coloured mud wall not, as momentarily I’d hoped, by Charles Doughty, but by Prince Charles (in 2015, with his key), and below it the Islamic translation.During the Islamic period, Al-Ula, or El-Ally as Doughty knew it, became an important station on the haj road south, and marked the last place where Christians were permitted to travel.\u0026nbspIbn Battuta described how pilgrim caravans paused here for four days to resupply and wash, and to leave any excess baggage with the townspeople “who are known for their trustworthiness”.“I hope we are still doing our best to be like that,” Ahmed says. “You can try, if you want, to leave something.”The only thing I left behind after my four days here was an urge to come back.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Perhaps they’re fed up with being tarred with the same brush as all those proper racist, right-wing fanatics who’ve coopted the British flag for their own endsClick to followThe Independent OnlineSome homes do beg the question: patriotism or jingoism?If you’re of a flag-waving bent, you’ll be enjoying an almost unparalleled summer right now. From the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, through the Queen’s official birthday, to the World Cup, which segues nicely into the annual patriorgasm of The Proms, 2018 is the year for you.But… where are you? As the globe’s finest football tournament gets underway in Russia, there is a definite dearth of flags draped from bedroom windows, flying from car roofs, clattering against poles erected in gardens. Whither John Bull, Britannia, and Captain Britain?We in Britain have a curious relationship with the Union Jack, and in England an even more uneasy affair with the cross of St George. We often opine that other countries have a far more relaxed approach to waving their national flag, and wonder why we can’t be the same here.It’s a vexing question, or perhaps more a question of vexillology (the study of flags, don’t you know). But the simple answer is that being overly fond of the English or British flags these days marks you out as a certain type of person.You fly the flag, you’re a close-our-borders, take-back-control, I’m-not-racist-but Brexiteer who brushes away a tear at the first strains of the national anthem. You fly the flag and you’re a gammon-faced Middle Englander one heart-pump away from a coronary as you spit bile from the fourth row of the Question Time audience. You fly the flag, you’re a bulldog-tattooed, shaven headed, there’s-no-black-in-the-Union-Jack sports casual yomping around London fuelled by cheap lager and steak bakes, demanding the release of the English Defence League’s jailed founder Tommy Robinson.The Union Jack and the St George cross have been tainted by association with the far right. Nobody seems surprised any more to see some bull-headed idiot draped in the flag and performing a Nazi salute. Which is a quite remarkable state of affairs.We’ll recall, of course, that back when the Nazi salute was even more popular than it was now, the red, white and blue of the Union Flag (it’s often said that the flag should only be called the Union Jack when flown from a royal navy ship, though this is apparently a relatively recent cause for debate) was the symbol under which the free world rallied. This flag kills Nazis, we said, back in the 1940s. Even Dad’s Army in the 1970s had in its opening credits the Union Jack pointedly and relentlessly pushing swastikas back into the depths of Europe.These colours don’t run, people used to say. Back in the Second World War, they didn’t, but that’s not what they meant when they said it. They meant that anyone wearing the English flag on foreign soil, for the purposes of supporting the national football team, would not be backing down from a fight with fans of other nations.English football fans abroad earned such a foul reputation that ahead of the World Cup, England’s head of football policing, Mark Roberts, urged fans to leave the flags at home, warning they could “come across as imperialistic and cause antagonism”.It may not surprise you to learn that there is a Flag Institute in the UK, which describes itself as the country’s national flag charity and which has members “in all six continents” (not quite sure how that works). They have produced a guide entitled Flying Flags in the United Kingdom (which is downloadable free from their site at flaginstitute.org) and they want the British flag to be a symbol of unity not ision.In the guide’s introduction, written by Flag Institute president Malcolm Farrow and co-signed by MP Andrew Rosindell, chair of the Flags and Heraldry committee, it says:\u0026nbsp“For too long our flag has been taken for granted and largely ignored.“Few children are taught about it in school, few people know its history or even the correct way to fly it. It is time that this changed and we became familiar with our flag, because all of us have the right to fly the flag and may use it on land wherever and whenever we wish. It is the people’s flag as well as the state flag.”But… is it, though, really? The origins of flags lie in military roots. Roman troops used to have a standard bearer carrying, say, the eagle of the Ninth Legion to let you know that trouble was on its way.

And by the turn of the 17th century, the forerunner of the Union Jack was created by royal decree so that both English and Scottish ships could fly the same banner and be easily identifiable at sea.Flags have without question proved vital during times of war and strife. Look, here we come to kick your arse. Oh dear, we’re getting our arses kicked, send help. That ship’s not flying our flag, let’s go and kick its arse.Had Britain not planted its flag in large amounts of the world during the days of empire, perhaps the Union Jack might not have the imperialist, unwelcome connotations it has\u0026nbspacross the world. Imagine, if you will, the Second World War having gone in a different direction. Imagine the Nazis had won. Then consider how people would have felt, 20 years later, when the German team came over to Britain for the 1966 World Cup, their fans draped in swastika flags.Flying the British or English flags on home turf is necessarily an act of nationalism. What else can it be? Patriotism? Isn’t that just the same thing? If you fly the Union Jack from a flagpole in your garden, what’s the purpose? To tell your neighbours that you’re English? They probably know that. They live next door. They are, too.However, to voice criticism of flag-flying is to invite a host of problems to your door. Ask Huw Thomas, who was standing in the Welsh ward of Ceredigion for Labour in the 2015 General Election, and who wrote a blog (almost 10\u0026nbspyears earlier) saying the number of England flags he saw flying in Wales “sickened” him and were the signs of a “simpleton or casual racist”.Ask Emily Thornberry, the Labour MP who resigned as shadow attorney general in 2014 after being attacked for posting to social media a picture of a house in Rochester draped with three England flags. Her tweet was deemed to be snobby and disrespectful, especially to the working class that Labour was desperately trying to court back to the fold.And class must raise its head in this debate. Where are you most likely to see flags being flown? On the council estates, in the working-class enclaves. Not so much in Ilkley and Mayfair, perhaps. Save for the almost cartoonish pomp of the Proms, grassroots patriotism is seen as a salt of the earth sort of thing. Why, is another matter. Maybe it’s a classic authoritarian bread and circuses sort of thing as a government, if you can keep the masses distracted with flag-waving fervour, they’re not going to spend as much time worrying that you’re stripping the NHS down to the bone, scrapping all their benefits and mothballing the places where they work.Maybe that’s why there aren’t as many flags flying as normal this summer. Perhaps people are fed up with being distracted. Perhaps they’re fed up with being tarred with the same brush as all those proper racist, right-wing fanatics who’ve coopted the British flag for their own ends.Still, we must remember that there was a brief period in recent history when the Union Jack seemed to shed its negative connotations. It was the 1990s, of course, those middle years of the decade when Britpop held sway, when football was coming home for Euro 96. Three Lions on a Shirt. Spice Girl Geri Halliwell’s Union Jack dress.

Can we ever return to the days of the 1990s when Britain was out, loud and proud?Perhaps this year, with its much-rumoured reunion of The Spice Girls, is when we finally find out.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

House of Lords scrapped: Will the role of peers be scrapped in June?                Tory rebels could trigger ELECTION with vote for Lords Brexit changesERS analysis of the composition of the House of Lords found 54 percent of the 564 peers whose residence is known live either in Greater London, the south east or the east of England.Just five percent of peers say they live in the north west of England, despite 11 percent of the populating residing there, the research discovered.The study found those peers who said they lived in the Midlands or north west did not reflect the demographic makeup of either region.Mr Hughes said: These figures reveal the appalling centralisation of Parliament\u0027s second chamber. This London-dominated house totally fails to represent huge swathes of the UK.Many peers are former MPs, political staffers or civil servantsWhat\u0027s the purpose of the House of Lords? How do you become a Lord? What are the House of Lords traditions? All these answers explained.1 of 25Regions including the north west and the Midlands are not only under-represented, but those peers who say they live there do not represent each region\u0027s ersity, whether in terms of their politics or otherwise.The Lords is looking increasingly like just another Westminster private members\u0027 club, and it\u0027s not hard to see why when the system is so unbalanced.The analysis also revealed out of 816 peers, 235 are former politicians, 68 worked as political staffers and 13 were civil servants.Mr Hughes said: Adding to the detachment between the House of Lords and UK citizens is the fact that so many peers are former politicians.More than half of peers say they live in London, the east or south east, the ERS saidWhen the PM can stuff a so-called scrutiny chamber with whoever they want, the result is that it fails to reflect the nation.That won\u0027t be solved by bunging in a few more unelected cronies. Instead, a fairly elected chamber of the regions would ensure guaranteed, proportional representation and a strong voice for all parts of the UK.A House of Lords spokesperson said: Members of the House of Lords come from across the UK, but are not representatives of geographical areas.Members are appointed by virtue of their experience and represent nearly every profession including law, nursing, teaching, defence, engineering, music, television, and politics.No other senate in the world has such erse members, or as broad a range of expertise. All members use their wealth of experience to debate crucial issues, and hold the Government to account.The House of Lords should be reformed to better reflect British society, the ERS saidMPs are today due to discuss the possibility of holding a referendum to do away with the House of Lords after an online petition gathered more than 169,000 signatures.Just 10,000 are required to warrant a Government response.In addition to reforming the House of Lords, the ERS is also pushing to replace Britain\u0026rsquos traditional first-past-the-post voting system with proportional representation.It backed changing the way elections are held in a 2011 referendum in which the UK had the chance to switch to the alternative vote method championed by the Liberal Democrats.The electorate voted by 67.9 percent to 32.1 percent in favour of sticking with first-past-the-post."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/590x/brexit-news-uk-passport-queue-home-office-blue-passports-sajid-javid-975614.jpg","title":"brexit news uk passport queue home office blue passports sajid javid","story":"PABrexit news: Sajid Javid has scrapped plans for UK-only passport lanes at airportsBritons will queue alongside visitors from the European Union amid fears separate lines would be too expensive to operate and could lead to longer wait times.The move comes despite an admission by Home Secretary Sajid Javid that British citizens would be forced to wait in slower, non-EU lanes when travelling to the bloc.Research by the Home Office concluded that while UK-only lines would go down well with voters, they would come at \u0026ldquoconsiderable additional cost as extra border staff would be needed to check passports.The study found special lanes for Brits would be \u0026ldquoattractive because they would provide a \u0026ldquovisible demonstration of Brexit.

Working mothers are often the most motivated and dynamic workers in the room.And yet working mothers still get seriously bad press.The comments by Kelly Brook this week are a case in point.She said on TV’s Loose Women some working mothers use their children as an “excuse” to skip deadlines or miss work.She also said it’s unprofessional for women to talk about children in the workplace and that “professional” women never do so.Kelly — who doesn’t have any children — made the remarks during a discussion about whether it is a mother’s job to look after her sick children.I honestly wonder what her views are founded on.Since she started modelling when she was still a teenager, it’s hard to imagine she has ever worked any kind of nine-to-five job in an office.And has she ever employed any working mums? I don’t know for sure but I somehow doubt it.I think Kelly’s comments are just founded on prejudice.I also wonder why she didn’t include men in her evaluation of working ­parents.Funnily enough men, in my experience, are way more comfortable than many women about citing ­childcare or a sick child as the reason for their absence or lateness.And most working women I know would go to extraordinary lengths to avoid “blaming” their absence on their children.Either way, Kelly’s suggestion that it’s more professional for women not to mention their children is crazy.But with views like that flying around — from other women — is it any surprise that some women worry that if they mention their children at work they will be discriminated against?I certainly know women who go to work and feel like they have to “present” as being someone without children — for fear of losing out on promotion.But if we all pretend we don’t have kids we will never change people’s opinion.So the more women talk about the fact they are working mothers — and proud — the more perceptions will change.It’s important people realise there IS pressure on a working parent — and particularly on working mums.But that’s very different to assuming the pressure makes them unreliable.No doubt when Kelly Brook has children herself, she will realise all this.And I really hope she does have kids.Unlike Luisa Zissman, who said in retaliation to her comments that Kelly will “never have children” because of her “track record with men”.That’s mean-spirited and unfair.I am sure motherhood will be the making of Kelly, just as it is for so many other women.Having said all of the above though, I will say this: There is a difference between acknowledging that you are a working mother and banging on about your kids and their achievements to anyone who will listen.Don’t get me wrong.I often talk to other working mums whose kids are at the same stage as mine about whatever issues we are particularly grappling with.But no matter how wonderful your kids are, there is nothing more boring to most people than being shown pictures of kids they’ve never met and don’t know.In other words, it’s one thing being proud to be a working mother — but we should all avoid being baby bores.The fact is, breastfeeding is not for everyone. Nor does it necessarily come down to choice – sometimes it just ain’t going to happen, for a variety of reasons.If that’s the case women should be supported, not vilified and pressured.For what it’s worth, I tried breastfeeding – for about five minutes. It didn’t work for me and, having just given birth to another human being, I didn’t feel bad about that one little bit.After all, it’s my body and I’ll do what I like, thanks very much. No one was going to tell me I was letting my kids down by giving them formula and – guess what – they’ve turned out fine. ONE of the highlights of my year was attending a private lunch with the Queen at Buckingham Palace last Wednesday.I left feeling bowled over by how incredible she is, so engaging and knowledgeable on so many subjects, from working mothers to football.The other thing that struck me is how very human and down to earth she is.When we were comparing notes about our various family members and how quickly they grow up, I realised we were just talking woman to woman.It really was an extraordinary lunch with an extraordinary person. IN the wake of the allegations against Harvey Weinstein it is no surprise that large companies – especially those in the film industry – are absolutely terrified their staff might behave inappropriately.But the news that Netflix has banned flirting is pretty unbelievable.It has issued a series of guidelines for employees about how to behave at work.That includes a ban on film crews looking at anyone for more than five seconds and the suggestion that anyone who feels pestered at work yells: “Stop! Don’t do that again!”Employees are also not allowed to touch or hug people for too long.It’s not that I disagree with those guidelines – try locking eyes with someone for five seconds and you’ll realise it’s creepy.It’s the fact that Netflix feels the need to issue them.I guess the company executives think their employees are in need of guidance.But the rules they have set out look, to any right-minded person, like common sense.After all, most of us know if our attention is unwanted or if someone feels uncomfortable – we stop whatever is causing the issue.And if you need a set of rules like this to tell you how to behave then there is a problem.The fact Netflix has decided it needs to do this is, frankly, a terrible state of affairs.It’s also a bit ironic given how many of the shows it makes and airs are about rape, murder and other violence against women.I guess there’s an element here of Netflix wanting to be seen to be doing the right thing.But to my mind it’s a bit holier than thou – and the company has taken it too far.CAN it really be true that Niall Aslam quit Love Island because he is insecure about his ears?If so, that is so sad. What is wrong with our young people? Actually, I know the answer to that.I can honestly say that I was never worried about body issues and none of my friends were either – it simply wouldn’t have occurred to us to compare ourselves unfavourably to everyone else.I’m pretty sure this kind of insecurity, which is rife among our young people and getting worse, is a direct result of reality TV and social media. IN the same week it was revealed that a young girl wet herself rather than interrupt her gaming, new research has proved that video games are addictive in the same way as drugs and alcohol.So what can we do about this new epidemic?There is usually an age limit for these games – and that is often ignored.But the fact is, you can’t expect the Government to sort this out: It is a parenting issue.Technology has given us many positives over the years – but it’s also caused problems that didn’t exist a decade or two ago.And this is one of them.Parents, listen up.If you want to avoid children getting addicted to games, don’t buy them.Limit the time your children have on technology.Get involved with what they are doing online and don’t just turn a blind eye.The best thing you can do is get kids out of the house – active, busy and involved in sport.Also bear in mind that if you are lazy, they will be lazy.And if you spend all day, every day, looking at your phone, so will they.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We were then told over the tannoy that the flight had been cancelled. We were escorted out of the departure lounge by the police.“There were only two members of staff dealing with everybody from the flight. There were children on the floor crying, we didn’t know what to do.“Two of our friends went down to the customer service desk and that’s when we found out that it was because the staff had worked too long. They had been working for 11 hours and couldn’t work any longer. But we booked in September, they should have been prepared.”Abi said the group felt like “criminals” as police then escorted them and other passengers out of the departure lounge.However, a spokeswoman for easyJet said if police escorted passengers away from the lounge, the decision would have been made by the airport or the police force.Abi added: “They told us there were no flights for the next week. The bride thought the hen do was going to be cancelled.“One of the members of staff even turned around and said ‘I hope you’ve got your coats because it’s raining outside’. That isn’t what people want to hear when their flight has just been cancelled.“We were basically told to leave the departure lounge, get our suitcases and leave the airport.”“In the end, we managed to get new flights through our travel agent but we had to pay £6,000 for the new flights.

Two months have passed [since the election] so it would be very strange \u0085 to say that what I told voters during the whole election campaign doesnt stand anymore.She has vowed to do everything to ensure that this country is well led through these difficult weeks.However Merkel is also facing a revolt within her own party, according to one MP.Kai Whittaker, a CDU Bundestag member, said: “We are in a serious situation because the question of the migration crisis evolved into a power question.“The question is who is leading the Government? Is it Angela Merkel or is it (CDU member) Horst Seehofer?“Everybody seems to be standing firm and that’s the problem.”He added: “This [...] has the potential to diminish the authority of her and Horts Seehofer and it could well be that at the end of next week we have a new situation.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT0004138588511-e1529248189990.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"jeremy corbyn signs sun reporters chest while being chased around by crazed fans at bonkers jezfest event","story":"It may sound like a scene from Monty Python’s Life of Brian but today is no laughing matter.I morph into a rugby player and shoulder barge my way through the scrum.In the middle, J.C. is posing for selfies and grinning from ear to ear.“Jeremy, can you sign my t-shirt?” I scream, batting off all the hysterical superfans.He is flanked by three burly security guards. “He doesn’t do autographs,” one booms, pushing me to the side.But Jezza steps in to save the day. Like a true rockstar he takes the pen from my hand and begins to sign my top.“Your pen isn’t working,” he informs me, smiling. “Hang on,” he adds, dipping his hand into his shirt pocket.What a charmer.After, Corbynites pursue me for a selfie.“He’s touched you,” says an awed super-fan, taking his camera out for a pic.I am the chosen one.“He left a sandal over there,” I tell them, pointing in the other direction before making my escape.Around the corner, a young Lenin - I mean Lennon - lookalike approaches, breathless. “Don’t speak to him,” he warns, pointing at a smartly dressed journalist who is politely asking revellers for their picture.Lennon’s wild, curly hair is flying in the wind and he pushes his vintage round glasses up, his nose twitching. “He’s from a right wing paper we don’t like,” he continues, excitedly. “My boss has told me to follow him and warn everyone about him. Got to go, he’s getting away.”With that, he begins to run after him in a zigzag pattern to avoid getting caught.This is North London, not North Korea. Where’s the solidarity?Not in the Solidarity Tent, apparently. Right now it is looking more like the Solitary Tent with a lone tumbleweed blowing through the dancefloor.It is 4pm. And I’m at White Hart Recreation Ground in Wood Green, London, for Labour Live - aka Jezfest.For one day only, I am living as a Corbynite and already the experience has been enlightening.After the positive reception at Glastonbury last year, Jezza fancied himself as Jay-C and decided to headline his own festival.But with a 4,000 turnout filling the 20,000 venue, it feels more like a summer fete on speed.Things could have been so different had Labour not balked at the £100,000 price tag for grime act Stormzy.Turns out the singer preferred to do it for the many (pounds) rather than the few.Which is a shame. He might have saved the day by appealing to the youths and performing his hit single “you’re getting way too big for your boots”. Which by the looks of things, Jezza could do with listening to. On repeat.Instead, privately-educated electronic band Clean Bandit were parachuted in at the last minute and tickets were slashed by 70 per cent from £35 to £10 to save the day, while one batch was given to Unite to give out for free.All in the name of equality.Which has not gone unnoticed by even Jeremy’s biggest fans today - who are still irked about this.“Jez fest?” commented one guy sporting harem pants. “More jizz-fest, I want a refund.”“I’m going to Twitter-bomb Jeremy,” moans a 56 year old dad, from Portsmouth, as he queues for food. “I came up with my wife and son and it’s cost us a bloomin’ fortune. We had to pay for trains, full price entry and it’s £5 a pint in here so it’s not cheap. I want a refund on the price difference, it’s not fair.“What’s Jeremy thinking holding this?” he goes on, as his young son looks away bored. “I’m here because I want some clarity on Brexit, and I’m hoping we’ll get some today.”Talking of which, a 30-something mum wearing a black t-shirt with the word “love and peace” shimmies past. Her adorable toddlers waddle behind like ducklings, both wearing fluorescent yellow “b*****ks to Brexit” stickers.And it is not the only obscene message. A flurry of “f**k the Tories” swamp the event. A bit much for a family event?Suddenly, a woman with brown cropped hair thrusts a leaflet into my hand. It reads: Marxism Festival 2018.“Don’t miss it next month,” she tells me, but it feels more like an order than a friendly message. “We’ve also got two Labour MPs going but they don’t want to reveal their names yet as they fear the press will call them ‘Reds under the bed’.“But it’s a very scary time at the moment,” she continues, shaking her head. “Last week 15,000 Nazis marched for Tommy Robinson. Horrible, violent lot.”Later, I look up the festival on their website, one of the workshops at the event is called Do we need violence to get real social change?Meanwhile, UB40 are speaking live via a video link on the big screens surrounding the main stage. “We wish we could be there today,” they fib, to a lacklustre crowd.The video goes down like a lead balloon and leaves everyone feeling more awkward than watching Jezza try to high five.But if I thought it could not get any worse I was wrong.Now,  columnist Owen Jones is walking onto the main stage and clarifying that he won’t be taking part in a prat battle - I mean rap battle.Instead, he breaks into an impassioned speech where he compares the Labour party to the suffragettes.After all the excitement, I’m feeling peckish so I decide to check out the award-winning street food.But I’m confused. Are they referring to the four miserable-looking stands? There’s a better selection next to the taxi rank on the high street at 2am on a Saturday.And I’m not the only one annoyed.“I’ve been queuing for 45 minutes,” explains one woman with pink hair and facial piercings. “What on earth would Jeremy have done if 20,000 had turned up? He can’t even feed the 5,000 and I don’t even think there’s that many people here.”Another pipes up, “I just paid £7 for a halloumi burger, overpriced and not worth the wait.”And my experience is not much better.After queing for over an hour for £4 cheesy nachos I’m served a stingy portion of eight tortilla chips with a sliver of plastic cheese. I’d find more cheese on the crusty lefties here than on my plate.I sneak a peek of the packet and see the tortilla chips are from Lidl, and cost 46p a packet. Not bad money if you can get it.Capitalist endeavours are rife here. Corbyn has his own stall at the entrance - where you can buy anything from Labour’s £6 manifesto to a £15 t-shirt with Jezza’s face on.But it is stalls which shock the most. The Bakers Food and Allied Workers Union are charging £10 for a t-shirt.“It’s really important the workers are looked after,” says one. I have a sneak peek at the inside label and am horrified to see it has been made in Nicaragua. Not a place known for its high standards of workplace ethics.And it is not the only stall. Love Music Hate Racism also offer a t-shirt made in Nicaragua, while the People’s Assembly are selling a t-shirt made in Honduras. All of them are made by Gildan, a low-cost producer who have been slammed in the past for using sweatshops in Central America.The outright hypocrisy is astonishing and what’s more, none of them can make the link.After listening to the Magic Numbers - a pop band who were famous 15 years ago, not one of Diane Abbott’s methods of police funding, I fancy a drink.I make my way to the bar for a “worker’s beer” - although most of the “staff” are volunteers and not getting paid.But it’s all gone Pete Tong.The card machine is down and people are moaning and groaning about having to walk to the other side of the venue to withdraw cash.Nearby, a disabled woman in a wheelchair is growing increasingly frustrated that her wheels don’t work on the grass. She does not want to sit in the segregated area for disabled people, she wants to be at the front of the stage, in the mix with everyone else.At long last, Jezza takes to the main stage, and his 4,000 disciples flock to see him. To the chants of “Oh, Jeremy Corbyn”, it seems like he is poised to break out into song. “Lenin Be”, perhaps?After JC’s latest sermon, the party’s over, and the Corbynites file out.It’s 8pm. As I make my escape, I notice one woman caught short evacuating her bowels behind a bin, just a stone’s throw from the portaloos. Part of me wonders whether her coiled offering is some sort of protest at this ramshackle event.It seems Labour would struggle to organise a piss-up in a brewery - let alone run a country.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The captain performed a routine landing in accordance with standard operating procedures.“Passengers returned to the terminal whilst a replacement aircraft was sent from Berlin to operate the flight from Copenhagen to Manchester as engineers were investigating the original aircraft.“The safety of its passengers and crew is easyJets highest priority.”According to Aviation Herald, the flight was delayed by seven hours as passengers waited for another Airbus plane.The damaged aircraft remained on the ground at Copenhagen for around 23 hours before it was taken to London Gatwick for servicing.Once fixed and inspected, the Airbus was returned to service 12 hours later.Bird strikes on aircrafts are an ongoing threat but it is rare for them to cause a major aviation accident or disaster.One bird sucked into an engine can even go unnoticed until the aircraft has landed and is inspected by ground staff.However, if a flock of birds were to fly into an engine, it could cause an explosion that could throw the aircraft off balance and the pilot could potentially lose control.There are more than 13,000 bird strikes in the United States every year, but fatal bird strikes are extremely rare – occurring possibly once in every billion flying hours."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000005062407.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"spending on defence should be boosted by a third mps urge","story":"Currently the UK spends two per cent of GDP on defending the nation and its overseas interests - roughly £36bn a year.But now the Defence Committee has suggested spending should be upped to three per cent to meet multiple new threats posed by Russia, North Korea and terror groups.Dr Julian Lewis, Defence Committee chairman, said: “The Government now needs to look beyond the two per cent minimum on Defence spending, and begin moving towards a figure of three per cent, to place our defence policy on a sustainable basis to meet new threats and fill existing financial ‘black holes’.“Defence is constantly described as the first duty of government. The Modernising Defence Programme is the government’s opportunity to show that it means what it says.”Their latest report suggested defence had to go back to post Cold War spending levels so Top Brass are properly funded.Members of the NATO military alliance set the two per cent benchmark as minimum spend target for all member nations.But just a handful actually meet it – including the UK.Later this month the MoD will publish the results of the Modernising Defence Programme which aims to reset the priorities of the Armed Forces and how they should be shaped to meet them.At one stage the MoD was set to be sucked into a complete Government wide security review but on the provision no new money would be available.It raised the prospect of cash going away from frontline war gear – like jets and subs – to spooks.But the MoD wrestled control back and now Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson is hoping for an increased budget.Dr Lewis, added: “We hope that our report will assist in sparking debate and focusing minds on priorities that should be considered by the Modernising Defence Programme.“The Secretary of State was right to remove Defence from the National Security Capability Review which would otherwise have resulted in further disastrous cuts to the Armed Forces, and we endorse his efforts to obtain a better settlement for Defence.”The report, titled Beyond 2 per cent, has been produced ahead of the anticipated release of ‘high-level findings’ by the MDP, later this month.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

These things matter when you are 92.You have your favourite chair, tea cup and biscuits, and routine is important.Both of these women will have bonded during the overnight journey in the royal train to carry out engagements in ­Cheshire, with the Queen dispensing the solid, common sense advice she has learned the hard way after 66 years on the throne.They might be from ­completely different backgrounds and ­cultures but the Queen and Meghan do have a ­surprising amount in common.Obviously first and foremost they both share a deep love for Prince Harry, but they also have a real sense of duty and a desire to serve.Meghan has a lot more substance than the majority of self-centred young American actresses and, from an early age she has wanted to change the world for the better.This week she became an official partner in The Royal Foundation, joining William and Kate and husband Harry — all dubbed the “Fab Four” ­— to help charities close to their hearts.Meghan wants to make a difference. She doesn’t want to be just a clothes horse or to merely cut ribbons and unveil plaques, and I don’t believe she’d be ­content with just being a mum and virtual stay-at-home housewife like most upper-class wives. She wants to roll up her sleeves and get stuck in.Those who snarkily accuse her of self-promotion are missing the point.Meghan is canny enough to realise her new position in life means she will ­constantly be photographed and written and talked about.She knows that a new hairstyle or frock will steal the headlines but will hope people will also listen to what she has to say on poverty in Africa, equal rights for women and saving elephants.Meanwhile, her old life could be luring Meghan back to La La Land with news that her performance in Suits has been submitted for an Emmy award.A submission is a long way from a nomination, but it will be interesting to see if those in charge fast-track her into the awards category for best actress. ­Personally, I don’t think it will happen.Even Meghan would admit she wasn’t by any stretch of the imagination the best actor in Suits.If Meghan was nominated and ended up winning, it would be nothing more than a stunt to get some sort of seal of royal approval.Surely even the US entertainment industry wouldn’t be that cynical.Since Meghan met Harry, she has been compared to Grace Kelly, the Hollywood star who gave up her career to marry Prince Rainier III of Monaco.Unlike Grace Kelly, who wanted to go back into movies, I don’t see Meghan being in any way tempted back to her old life after landing the best role of all.That’s not a criticism because I admire her work ethic and single-mindedness — and I think her desire to be a force for good is genuine.The Queen is nobody’s fool and if she thinks Meghan is worth cultivating and training, the new ­American Duchess should have our approval, too.THE two new judges being wooed to join The X Factor could very well save this show’s rather tired-looking format.Robbie Williams is an inspired choice, bringing his own brand of cheeky humour but also a real empathy for all those seeking fame and fortune.I reckon, however, his wife Ayda could prove to be the real star.She’s funny, feisty and has proved to be a TV favourite during her appearances on Loose Women.Ayda won’t take any nonsense from the formidable Simon Cowell and, much as she loves Robbie, you can expect some straight-talking spats between them.Of course there are those who will say she’s only getting a seat on the judges’ panel because of her husband’s fame, but I reckon Ayda , left with Robbie, is more than up to the job and will be a much needed breath of fresh air on a panel that was looking increasingly bored and out of touch.ON World Blood Donor Day this week I repaid my debt to the NHS when my fantastic TV show team donated their very own blood (having already given their sweat and tears on a daily basis).I had to have a life-saving three pints of blood after a serious accident and, like every other patient who is given a transfusion, I am no longer allowed to donate my own.Where can I give blood? Here’s how to find a donation centre and how often you’re able to donateIt’s something that has made me feel very guilty, so I cannot thank my team enough – although there would have been even more of the precious life-saving blood if some of the boys who work with me and happen to be gay had not been banned from donating.Gay men who have had recent sex are not allowed to be donors, which surely is an edict that needs to be changed.There has to be a way to ensure safety without making gay men feel like pariahs.IN Hollywood, money talks and the box office dictates trends.So It’s good news that the all-female Ocean’s 8 has trounced the other male-dominated movies in the franchise, because it clearly shows moviegoers WILL happily pay to see films starring women in leading roles.Ocean’s 8 is a rather silly but hugely enjoyable spin on the heist movie with a satisfying end twist and decent parts for women – who are all too often usually “the wife” or “the best friend”.It shows that the appallingly bad all-girl version of Ghostbusters, a real stinker that bombed horribly, was just a blip.Hopefully, this will be the start of more big- budget films with kick-ass roles for women that aren’t twee or patronising.ALL my fellow Holby City fans know that surgeon Jac Naylor would make a polar bear shiver if she gave it one of her “looks”.She’s the ultimate ice maiden, although we have seen a little bit of a thaw in recent weeks on her return to our screens.In fact, Jac showed her human side when the character had a breakdown on screen, something that Rosie Marcel, who has played the character for 13 years, knows all about.Rosie told me that she suffered her own mental health problems after having a real-life breakdown on set.She suffered from depression and had to seek medical help.Rosie walked out of her house in her pyjamas and bare feet and even had the dark thought that her family would be better off without her.Luckily, she was given treatment and was able to get back to work, but it was a frightening time and demonstrates once again that mental health problems can hit anyone.I salute Rosie for being so open and brave about her struggle.FASTEN your seatbelts, it’s going to be a bumpy ride in Poldark when the admirable Rebecca Front sails into Truro harbour like a magnificent galleon as the formidable Lady Whitworth.This ghastly harridan is the mother of the monstrous Ossie Whitworth, who has made his reluctant wife Morwenna suffer the torments of hell and even had his wicked way with her sister.If you wondered how Ossie could be so self-centred, heartless and cruel, then all will be explained when his mother heaves into view.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Say it. Sorted.”Endless repetition probably cost her a million votes in last year’s catastrophic snap election and earned her the label “MayBot”.She did it again while hailing her long-overdue £380million-a-week Brexit boost for the health service.Her NHS treatment for diabetes helped her “get on with my job”, she said.Except, it didn’t. Her Type 1 diabetes deserves sympathy and understanding, but it has nothing to do with her job as PM.To lead is to choose. Mrs May chose to lead but suffers paralysis by analysis.Since achieving her dream of leading this country, Mrs May has failed to make the right choices at a pivotal moment in British history.As a sceptical Remainer, she was perfectly placed to steer Britain through the complex task of leaving the European Union.Her first act should have been to summon her Cabinet and tell them “Brexit means Brexit”, which means every minister and Whitehall mandarin must work their socks off to make it a success.And while staring Chancellor Phil Hammond in the eye, invite anyone who felt otherwise to find another job.Instead, she boxed herself in by triggering a rigid Brexit timetable, slapping £39BILLION cash on the table and inviting Brussels’ biggest bullies to do their worst.And they did. Any idea this would be a friendly divorce has turned to ashes. We are at war with Europe, if only by another name.This week we are likely to see their Commons cats’-paws, the increasingly triumphant Remoaners, take Mrs May and the UK to the brink of abject surrender.We are being forced to repeal the verdict of our biggest ever single-issue vote by screeching siren Anna “Suck it up” Soubry and hypocrite Tory lawyer Dominic Grieve, who yesterday said he and fellow rebels were prepared to bring down the Government if they are not granted a “meaningful vote” on the final Brexit deal.Obnoxious Soubry gives even Remainers a bad name, resorting to reckless slurs of “racism” even as her precious European Union is being torn apart by rows over uncontrolled mass immigration.She shrugs off the real grounds for scepticism about Brussels — its sneering contempt for democracy and the misbegotten euro, which has destroyed the job hopes of a generation of young Europeans.These were the failures which actually led to Brexit, long before Tony Blair flung open the door to 4million foreign migrants and German Chancellor Angela Merkel raised the stakes with a million more.It was Merkel, as much as Blair and David Cameron, who soured the public view of Europe’s Grand Project years before Brexit ever became a possibility.But while it is easy to condemn defeated Remoaners as sore losers, it is hard not to be impressed by their organisational zeal, which would do credit to Jeremy Corbyn’s Marxist militia.By stark contrast, all of those who voted Out — and won — are entitled to be outraged by the performance of the Cabinet’s victorious Brexiteers.What the hell have they been doing for the past 18 months?They have been caught flat-footed, ambushed in the night, bound and gagged by a richly funded, highly motivated mob of undemocratic contemptibles. They should be shot for sleeping on the job.Boris trumpets the occasional bugle call. David Davis threatens to quit once a month. Michael Gove is busy elsewhere. And Liam Fox?They never talk to each other, prepare strategy or organise tactics, let alone mobilise financial backing or communicate with 17.4million supporters. Do they too think we are all thick and racistNow we risk the horrifying prospect of remaining half-in, half-out of the EU, robbed of our vote, our hard-won rebate and £39billion in hard cash.The game may be lost by default to the dark forces of organised bureaucracy: The Civil Service, the BBC, EU pensioners such as Peter Mandelson and those faceless Eurocrats.We shot their fox in The Glorious Referendum, only to let them regroup and return as a pack of wolves with a scent of blood.They had to suck it up or risk choking on the toxic fumes.But I think it sounds more like the punchline to a particularly revolting joke which is unsuitable for a family newspaper like this.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

What all cyclists have in common though is the need to stay safe on the road. That starts with the equipment you use and ends with a well-maintained bike. So let\u0027s take a look at some tips for being as safe as possible when you take to the roads this summer. Helmets save heads   From a topple when your youngest is learning to ride a balance bike through to dad wanting to protect himself on his cycle to work - everyone needs a helmet and Halfords has a range of helmets suitable for all ages and cycling abilities. Mums and Dads are covered with the Ridge All Terrain Pro for \u0026pound15. Kids can chose polka dots , princesses , stars or even an absolutely awesome skull design . Let everyone chose the helmet they love and they\u0027ll be excited to wear it when they next go for a bike ride. Be seen   Bike lights aren\u0027t just about finding your way in the dark. Increasingly people are using them like running lights on a car - for visibility. Using flashing lights means that other road users can see you more easily - and when the sun does set you can switch to constant illumination. As a rule the brighter your bike lights the better. During the day they will need to be more than 400 lumens to be easily seen, so get the brightest lights you can - like the Halfords Superbright LED bike light set, \u0026pound15. It\u0027s also worth considering high visibility jackets for big and little riders alike. Halfords has a family pack of these that contains two adult and two childrens vests. You can, of course, buy these individually too. These are especially important as the light fades in the evening and when dark winter nights eventually roll around. Adjust and maintain   It\u0027s important to make sure that you kids bikes are well adjusted to their size. Make sure that the saddle is high enough for them to be able to pedal comfortably, but also still reach the ground with the ball of their foot. Make sure that lights all work, and get recharged or new batteries as they dim. You should also make sure the bikes reflectors are in the right place and are not broken. You can get replacement reflects and other fun light accessories - like spoke lights - at Halfords. Brakes, gears and tyre pressures should all be regularly checked too. If you kids are out on their own then encourage them to tell you if anything doesn\u0027t feel right on the bike - say, brakes getting less effective. Encourage them to check the tyre pressures but back that up with monthly checks of your own. For smaller kids who cycle less you can check all these things before you go on a ride, but remember punctures can vary in size and worsen if you continue to use the bike without fixing them. Likewise, brake cables stretch over time and need adjustment to stay efficient and safe. If there are any problems pop in to Halfords for a free check on your bike, giving you complete confidence without having to get your hands dirty. In-store experts will check tyre pressure, brakes and gears. Consider a new bike for little riders   A child\u0027s bike should last at least two years before they outgrow it. But obviously everyone grows at different speeds and growth spurts make this sort of thing hard to predict. So make sure that your kids bikes are the right size for them. Halfords has a video that guides you through finding the right size bike. You can also pop into a store with your little ones to get some help and advice on the correct size. When sitting one the saddle a child should be able to reach the floor with the ball of their foot. They should also be able to stand over the top tube which runs horizontally from the handlebars to the saddle. There are also size guides on all the Halfords bike pages which help explain what height they are designed for. If you find you need a new bike consider the sort of cycling your child will be doing. If it\u0027s mostly on-road, perhaps for older children who ride to school or out with friends, then consider a hybrid like the Apollo Vortice Junior Hybrid Bike for \u0026pound104 (save \u0026pound26) . If your kids are younger or only want to ride off-road then a mountain bike is a good choice - consider the Carrera Blast Junior for \u0026pound232 (save \u0026pound58) .

Mrs May promised to distance herself from Moscow-linked donors when she took office. But in the 23 months since then her party has pocketed \u0026pound201,000 from Alexander Temerko, an ex-chairman of an agency in the Russian Defence Ministry who later ran an arms company. The revelation, the latest from our investigation into Russia and the Tories, was branded “staggering” by MPs. Mrs May will tomorrow face pressure to return the cash in the wake of the attempted poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury.  We have already found evidence the Tories took \u0026pound50,000 from the wife of the ex-Russian deputy finance minister and two Tory peers are earning thousands a year from firms with Kremlin links. Mr Temerko, 52, donated \u0026pound16,300 to the Tories on July 13, 2016, the day Mrs May was officially appointed Prime Minister by the Queen. Documents show that just 24 hours later he gave \u0026pound3,750. And his most recent donation of \u0026pound3,000 last March 22 came just a fortnight after the Skripal murder bid.  The donation was uncovered after a Mirror analysis of a cache of data published by the Electoral Commission. Mr Temerko, who was born in Ukraine when it was part of the USSR, is now a London-based businessman and British citizen. He insisted to the Mirror he has been a “vocal critic” of President Vladimir Putin.

People around the world tuned in to see her dress, and the dramatic ivory silk taffeta gown by British fashion designers David and Elizabeth Emanuel inspired women for years. Like most other royal brides, she also wore a stunning tiana. And this weekend another bride said her vows wearing Diana\u0027s diamond tiara - even though she\u0027s not a member of the royal family.  Celia McCorquodale married George Woodhouse in a country wedding in the small village of Stoke Rochford, Lincolnshire, on Saturday. Celia is the younger daughter of Diana\u0027s sister Lady Sarah McCorquodale, which makes her Diana\u0027s niece.  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were among the guests on the day, just four weeks after their own special day.  Princess Diana broke with tradition on her wedding day and wore the Spencer family tiara rather than picking one from the royal collection.  The tiara dates back to th 18th century, and the family heirloom is now owned the Diana\u0027s brother Earl Spencer. It has been worn by several members of the family on their wedding day, including both of Diana\u0027s sisters. Celia wore the stunning tiara with a full veil and a beautiful lace-bodiced dress with a bouquet of white roses. She arrived at the church in a vintage 1910 Rolls Royce Silver Ghost and walked into the church on the arm of her father, Neil McCorquodale. The new Duke and Duchess of Sussex were full of smiles as they arrived at the ceremony.  But the new Duchess of Sussex, who was wearing a long-sleeved blue-and-white paisley dress and white fascinator, almost had an embarrassing moment when she took a bit of a stumble walking into the church. Luckily hubby Harry, who looked sharp in a morning suit, kept a firm grip on her hand.  Celia attended the royal wedding last month.

Rimi Thapar appeared on the show looking for \u0026pound50,000 investment in her LoveRaw business. But she turned down Debra Meaden when she asked for 30 per cent stake in return for her investment in the company which makes organic, gluten and dairy-free products. She has now made the company a success on her own and said she\u0027s glad she walked away from the dragons.  Speaking to the Manchester Evening News , Rimi said: “They were just asking for way too much.  There was no way we were giving that much away. All that time I spent building the business, doing 20-hour days, I just couldn’t give a big chunk of it away.  We did want the investment, of course, but we weren’t in such a desperate position.” Thapar, a former banker, who lives in Altrincham with husband Manav and daughter Marni, two, said she doesn\u0027t regret turning down the Dragon\u0027s offer. After the show we put together an investment deck which valued the company at \u0026pound1.7m and raised what we needed through private angel investors, she said.  Appearing on the show was an amazing experience. It was a great opportunity to show people what we do and the philosophy behind our products. We are passionate about creating wholesome food that makes people feel good. The Dragons are great at what they do having the chance to pitch to them is invaluable. “It was very scary, it’s a very intimidating process. I walked in and saw these poker faces, the dragons are looking right at you. All I was thinking was, ‘don’t mess up, don’t scupper the pitch. Thapar is originally from Wolverhampton where her parents were textile manufacturers. After studying economics at university she got a job at Merrill Lynch working in its private banking arm. I really enjoyed working with a range of people, Thapar said. It was a tough job and taught me to be resilient, organised and certainly better at crunching numbers.  During her seven years at the firm Thapar met and married her husband Manav, who was from Manchester but was running an interior textile business in Spain. In 2010 Thapar quit her job to join Manav in Spain where she started to help developing the e-commerce side of his business. But then 2011 Thapar\u0027s father died after a serious illness. During her grief she started to explore the local markets where she discovered a world of fresh, organic and locally grown food. I found that eating this wonderful food made me feel better and it started me off on a health food journey, she said. I gave up gluten, and felt better, then tried veganism. I found it helped me get out of that dark and negative time. Thapar said the experience completely transformed her attitude towards food.

But the 32-year-old said the group were left devastated when the budget airline cancelled their flight without warning when they were in the departure lounge ready to take off.  Ms Parker told Wales Online : “We were waiting in the departure lounge and the flight had already been delayed for 40 minutes.  We were then told over the tannoy that the flight had been cancelled. We were escorted out of the departure lounge by the police. “There were only two members of staff dealing with everybody from the flight.

Ernestas Lukosevicius was repeatedly booted out of the country where it was said he had developed the necessary \u0027skills and expertise\u0027 to carry out such car crime. By April last year, the Lithuanian had racked up his eighth conviction for 23 offences, was jailed for nine months and handed his fourth deportation order. A court heard he is currently banned from returning to Sweden until February 2027. But it was between January and March this year, having moved to the UK, that the 27-year-old was recruited for his techniques to help steal valuable car parts. In that short time he and another man targeted 70 high-value BMW, Audi and Mercedes vehicles parked late at night on driveways outside homes across north Kent. In one botched theft in Swanley on March 3, a BMW caught alight and was engulfed in flames, leaving the homeowners including two young children fearing for their lives and their house fire-damaged. However, footprints found in the snow outside were subsequently matched to trainers Lukosevicius was wearing when arrested in Larkfield, near Maidstone, just nine days later. Police were alerted to a garage break-in in Carroll Gardens on March 12 and discovered the Lithuanian crouched down by a BMW. Inside his jacket was a steering wheel stolen from another BMW in the same road.  Maidstone Crown Court in Kent was told that was the only stolen car part ever recovered from all 70 vehicles. Lukosevicius, of no fixed address, admitted conspiracy to steal. His accomplice remains on the run. Prosecutor Mary Jacobson told the court that as well as onboard computers and parts, the thieves stole personal belongings from the cars including SatNavs, laptops, designer clothing, expensive sunglasses, and golf clubs. Vehicles were targeted in Gravesend, Medway, Maidstone, Sevenoaks, Sittingbourne and Canterbury. The total loss was \u0026pound503,698 although it was claimed Lukosevicius never received any financial benefit. The court was told there was no record of when he came to the UK, and Recorder Matthew McDonagh said he could not make the same recommendation for deportation as ordered in Sweden. But on jailing Lukosevicius for four years on Friday the judge told him his illicit skills had been \u0027essential and integral\u0027 to the conspiracy. This was lucrative work and in the two to three months when you and your colleague carried out those activities, you targeted whole streets and areas. It undoubtedly had substantial impact on the victims, and the targeting and stealing to order caused a high level of inconvenience and financial loss. Any suggestion you were recruited to this enterprise because of your own vulnerability cannot follow from the fact you have done this before in Sweden. You have skills and expertise which either you informed others of or they became aware of and were utilised in this spate of high-value offending. While I accept you were not ultimately benefiting from that taken and may not have been directly involved in the planning, your skills were essential and integral to what was taking place.

The duchesses are both 36, they routinely set fashion trends and they have helped to spark a worldwide frenzy over Britain\u0027s royals.

An expert has examined Meghan and Kate\u0027s body language and given her ruling on their relationship.  Author and public speaking coach Judi James told the  that Meghan tends to subconsciously mirror Kate in a bid to embed herself in the Royal Family. She said: “Meghan’s mirroring of Kate currently involves wardrobe and body language mimicry and this reflects a degree of submission to show a desire for rapport and team acceptance.” That kind of behaviour could strengthen their established friendship, she added.  Judi pointed to Meghan and Kate\u0027s appearance at the Trooping the Colour ceremony on June 9. She said: “In this respect we have the nude court shoes, the satellite hats and those small clutch bags held in front of the torso in a very signature ‘Middleton’ style.” Last week, Meghan joined the Queen in Cheshire as they made their first joint royal engagement together.

According to local rumours, the new Duke and Duchess of Sussex are hoping to move in as soon as the development is finished. The luxury manor house has three reception rooms, a huge walk-in wardrobe and staff quarters - so it would be the perfect home for the new couple. Computer-generated images of the development show the stone building in all its glory, including the stunning grounds and garden. But the stunning house, which is set in the Great Tew estate, has a very ironic name which couldn\u0027t be less fitting.  Bizarrely, the huge building is called Beggers Lodge.  A source told the Mail on Sunday : The property has been earmarked for a specific couple and the project is shrouded in secrecy, so naturally the assumption in the village is that Meghan and Harry might move in.  The property will take at least a year to build, which would explain why they are renting in the area for that amount of time.  According to Zoopla , the old building on the site was worth \u0026pound945,000 so the new property will likely have a huge price tag.   The Great Tew estate is just over an hour from London, and is often described as one of the prettiest villages in England. It has been managed by the Johnston Family since the 1960s. The estate\u0027s website lists some of the site\u0027s best features, including a thriving village community and excellent village services. The village also has a local shop, cafe, pub, cricket club and a primary school.

Dr Jane Barton, 69, is accused of prescribing fatal overdoses of opiate painkiller diamorphine to elderly patients in the 1990s. An independent panel led by ex-Bishop of Liverpool James Jones is looking into whether she shortened hundreds of people’s lives. It has examined 833 death certificates she signed at Gosport War Memorial Hospital, Hants. A report compiled after the \u0026pound13million probe is due to be published on Wednesday. It will reportedly say Dr Barton was responsible for a number of deaths. Dori Graham said her husband, Leonard, was killed after receiving care from Dr Barton and then a fatal injection by a nurse – the probe has included deaths involving other health workers acting on her orders.  Dori, 86, said: “Len said he wasn’t in pain but they gave him the injection anyway. I sat there. Within a few minutes he was dead.” The number of people who died suspiciously under her care could exceed the 92 cases examined by police previously. Families have suggested relatives were routinely given huge doses to “keep them quiet” on over-stretched wards. Another patient Arthur Cunningham, 79, died at the hospital in 1998, but his stepson Charles Farthing said: “He went in to be treated for bedsores. There’s no way he was near death.” Concerns about Dr Barton date back to 1991, when two nurses said they believed patients were being given diamorphine instead of the sedative diazepam.

People living in Mevagissey on the Cornwall coast have voted for action after a surge in new builds being bought as holiday homes.   The average house price is now almost \u0026pound300,000, which is 20 times the local salary.  And residents of the fishing village say they are being forced to move elsewhere if they want to get on the property ladder. To clamp down, people living in the tourist hotspot held a referendum to block the sale of new builds to second home owners - with 90 per cent in favour. It comes after the Mevagissey Neighbourhood Development Plan was set up in an effort to restore the balance to the playing field for local people.  Councillor for the village James Mustoe said the vote had a 32.74 per cent turnout, with 89.58 per cent (516 people) voting in favour. Just 60 people (10.4 per cent) voted against the plan. Mr Mustoe said: I was delighted to see the Mevagissey Neighbourhood Development Plan pass into legislation following the referendum result. The landslide result, with 90 per cent of those who voted, voting for it, is a strong endorsement from our community that they want this strong and positive local planning legislation to protect the villages of Mevagissey and Portmellon now and for future generations. My thanks to all the volunteers, both members of the public and parish council who have worked so hard to bring this forward. On a personal note, I now look forward to having this publicly endorsed legislation by my side to fight for the types of development we do and do not want to see in the parish from now on.

Ruby, seven, has Pierre Robin syndrome, scoliosis and limited use of her arms as a result of missing radius bones and is registered blind. “Lily, Ruby’s five-year-old half-sister, is profoundly deaf and uses British Sign Language (BSL) to communicate. “Most recently adopted three-year-old Joseph has Down’s syndrome and uses a colostomy bag. “And it doesn’t stop there Benjamin is currently considering adopting child number five.”  The BCA spokesman said Ben talked about his passion for adoption at community groups. “He starts meetings with prospective adopters by asking them, ‘What are you looking for in adoption?’ “Many adopters start with what he calls the ‘Angelina Jolie or Madonna adoption’ — where everything is perfect. “However, the reality is that many children over four years old, and those with special needs, struggle to be placed with a family because they do not fit that mould.  “Benjamin shows them photos of his own children and tells his story - the positive and negative - and through educating prospective adopters dispels any notion of ‘normal’.” Ben is one of 29 people who will receive a medal and a certificate at the ceremony which will be hosted by Lord Dholakia. Each person will receive a Medal of Honour inscribed with the words ‘For the Good of the Country’. Medallists are also invited to use the initials BCA after their name.

Nigel Chappell, who was 21 stone in January, had been \u0027unhappy\u0027 with his weight for some time but decided to give Slimming World a go after doctors told him he needed to lose weight for an upcoming operation. At first he thought the groups were only aimed at women and assumed the focus would be on \u0027diet\u0027 food and talking about people\u0027s emotions.  It was nerve-wracking walking through those doors for the first time but I wasn’t the only man there and everyone was so supportive, he told Cornwall Live.  He said: Now I look forward to the sessions. There is lots of banter and laughter and I get some really good ideas too, from new recipe suggestions to ideas to boost my activity levels. Nigel is now 16 stone two pounds and he has scooped up his group\u0027s Slimming World Man of the Year 2018.  He said: I’ve realised now though that far from being weak, asking for help takes strength of character and getting support to make changes has given me a sense of confidence that is benefitting every aspect of my life. I didn’t know what my mates would think about me attending Slimming World but they’ve been right behind it. Once they realised I could still have a beer they started to take an interest and when they see me eating things like steak and homemade chips, chicken curry or a roast dinner they always ask how it’s possible to eat like that and still lose weight. What really had them sitting up and paying attention though was how well I was losing weight. As the weight came off, Nigel found he had more energy and so he was eager to use it. He added: As a man I always thought that physical activity would be the best way to lose weight, but when I was at my heaviest I just wasn’t fit enough to do it.

Warning signs have also been posted around the building telling travellers: Please do not lay down on the seats. The Essex airport brought in the new policy amid claims that hundreds of passengers were camping out overnight - some of them on hammocks or blow-up beds.  But it isn\u0027t going down well with passengers, who say the move is unfair and mean to tired travellers. Under the lock-out policy, which began on Monday, the departures wing is closed after the final flight of the night. It remains shut from midnight until 2am, meaning anyone arriving at the budget flight airport during that time is directed to the arrivals area. They can take a seat and rest there, but they are banned from having a nap on the floor.  Guards are on patrol to wake up those who are fast asleep. Passengers who book early morning flights have been told not to arrive sooner than their scheduled check-in time. Stansted said it has seen up to 600 people camp out in the terminal overnight. Some travellers would rather sleep on the terminal floor instead of a local hotel, where rooms can cost upwards of \u0026pound140 a night. They can hamper overnight work or get in the way of passengers arriving later in the morning.

Temperatures are expected to soar to 30C in parts of the UK on Tuesday amid a mini-heatwave. June is on track to be Britain’s hottest for 42 years, when stifling heat led to standpipes on streets as drought hit. Forecasters say a lot of fine and dry weather is set to come this summer, with this month warmer and drier than average.    This month’s average temperature of 14.7 - from June 1-14 - is 1.7C above normal. That makes it the warmest June since 1976 when it was 15C over the whole of June, Met Office figures show. Storm Hector, which brought strong winds to northern England, Northern Ireland and Scotland just days ago, will be forgotten as the Met Office forecast drier skies from Sunday with sunny spells and temperatures soaring.    Highs pushing close to 30C were forecast by ex-BBC and Met Office forecaster John Hammond of weathertrending. Temperatures are poised to pip the 29.1C hottest day of the year, set on April 19 at St James’s Park, London. Until then, Sunday will remain cool and breezy across much of the UK with temperatures lingering in the high teens or low twenties.  There will be rain or drizzle in some places with occasional clear spells. Monday will be a vast improvement with temperatures hitting about 25C in South East England and 22C in the South West, where it will be rather breezy with some rain possible. Temperatures will be in the low twenties through the Midlands and parts of Wales, and in the high teens across northern England and Northern Ireland.

She wrote: I\u0027d also like to take this time to let you all know Matt and I are expecting! Little bubba on the way, due November.

Still without any replies, Jordan took the opportunity to tell her colleagues she would be heading off on maternity leave in the next few weeks.  And then, after an extremely short pregnancy, Jordan shared the happy news that her baby boy had arrived.  And then - finally - some actually paid attention to her email and there was a little celebration in the office to celebrate the arrival of little Malachy.

Islamists are taking “job swaps” from the Middle East in a scheme that runs in a belt from Somalia, Kenya and South Sudan all the way to Nigeria. It is feared the training exchanges and the networks being built could lead to the rise of a caliphate in the region – and pose a \u0026shysignificant security threat to the UK. So our military is trying to stem the tide of militants by providing counter-terror training for local forces across Africa.  The Mirror joined British and Nigerian forces at training camps in Nigeria, where a senior local commander spoke of the challenge of two-way jihadi migration. Since 2014, terrorists have murdered 20,000 civilians in Nigeria. Roadside and suicide bombings kill as many as 50 a time, three times a week. More than two million Nigerians are thought to have been displaced and 11 million need humanitarian aid. Kidnappings are rife. And the UK has already been rocked by extremism linked to the nation as Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale, who beheaded Fusilier Lee Rigby in 2013, were of Nigerian descent.  Group Captain Isaac Subi, 46, of the Nigerian Air Force, has fought terror across Africa since 1991. He said Nigeria has had “hundreds” of exchange fighters. In the oppressive heat of Kaduna, we watched RAF Regiment soldiers teach his men how to beat an IS ambush. Subi, whose soldiers protect airfields, warned: “They train fighters here and our insurgents get access to training in Yemen and Syria, then come back and teach others. “When they conduct serious acts, like bombings, the news goes viral, then their sponsors think the money they give them is put to effective use. They leave trails of blood, tears and sorrow.” The terror threat in northeast Nigeria comes from Boko Haram and splinter group Islamic State in West Africa, which has strong links with IS in the Middle East. Locally, the terror threat is referred to simply as Boko Haram.  Military experts say an alliance between ISWA and Boko Haram boosts the terror risk to the UK. Boko Haram has abducted and killed \u0026shythousands – including the Chibok schoolgirls kidnapped in April 2014, many of whom were raped and forced to marry jihadists. Some of the girls have been released but many are still missing. The killings, torture and mayhem have \u0026shyworsened with the abduction of children as young as five being forced into suicide bomber cadres. Subi added: “They take over villages, overrun communities and capture children, using their innocence and giving them bomb vests. They tell them religious ideologies, ‘If you commit this suicide you will be accepted in heaven as a martyr’.”  Even the elderly are forced to blow themselves up. Subi said: “They tell them, ‘You are 70 years old – it’s better to die now and go to heaven and be married to virgins than staying here to suffer and die’.” The MoD spends more than \u0026pound8million annually on training Nigerian forces, in addition to the Department for International Development spending \u0026pound100million a year on aid. British troops were drafted in after the Chibok girls were seized and boosted an existing UK training mission in Nigeria, which now totals around 150 troops. Royal Marines based in Lagos are also teaching the Nigerian Special Boat Service how to combat crime and piracy on the coast and on rivers. British troop involvement in Nigeria is part of the British Military Advisory and Training Team and is aimed at helping local forces smash Boko Haram in Africa’s most prosperous and most populated country, with a \u0026pound405billion-a-year economy and 180 million citizens.  Our trade with Nigeria is worth \u0026pound7billion a year and 180,000 Nigerians live in Britain –while 20,000 Brits live there. Importantly, Nigeria’s population – 44% of which is under 15 – could hit 400 million by 2050, making it the world’s third-largest behind China and India. At our military HQ in Nigeria’s capital Abuja, Brigadier Charles Calder said Boko Haram and ISWA “respect no boundaries”. He added: “There are also al-Qaeda and IS affiliates in the wider region exploiting a lack of governance...which if unchecked could coagulate to form some kind of caliphate that is a surrogate of IS and if unchecked could then present a threat to both UK interests and conceivably the UK mainland.”  “One of the things I find most disturbing about this place is the coercion of very young, mainly girls, into being suicide bombers. We are here with a very small deployment that is very sustainable, that enables us to try and increase the capacity of the Nigerian army so they can deal with their own problems. “The British military set up the Nigerian \u0026shymilitary. The Nigerian army is fundamentally founded on British lines, British doctrine, British ways of doing business. “We have a big, big head-start here, because we talk the same military language. The Nigerian military trust us and have a degree of respect for the British military.” Wing Commander John Rees, 54, of 5 Force Protection Wing, commands 50 RAF Regiment trainers at Kaduna International Airport.

healthier home-cooked meals and it definitely wasn’t as difficult as I’d expected it to be.“In fact, we could still enjoy family favourites such as chicken curry, spaghetti bolognese and even chips – we just made healthy swaps, like switching to lean cuts of meat and using low-calorie cooking spray instead of oil.“The change in both of us has been remarkable – it’s like we have a whole new lease of life.”Edna, 76, who lost 4st 4.5lbs, added: “I must admit, it was almost a bit of a relief when I discovered Tony was feeling down about his weight, too.“We’re making healthy changes together to give us both a brighter future – and that’s an amazing feeling.“We’ve also become much more active.“We’ve taken up walking regularly and after a year, we even took part in a 5k run for the Stroke

We’ve got one retiring at Baldragon and we’ve filled that.“You’d think that they (Labour) would know that, considering that elected members sit on the panel to determine head teachers. It’s fair to say the position is getting better compared to a few years ago.“The posts that are unfilled at the moment will be filled. It’s not a case where we’ll just not replace anyone.“We’ve got applicants and candidates for every position. That’s not to say that they are all necessarily the right candidates and we still have to go through the interview process along with all the correct checks to prove that they are suitable.”Mr Malone believes vacant posts are having an adverse impact on closing the attainment gap in Dundee and called on the administration to “up its game” or risk “complete failure”.He added: “If we are to meet targets for enhancing the learning experience and closing the attainment gap, then we need to ensure our schools have the resources necessary for every child to get the educational opportunities they deserve.“Also, that our teachers can receive the support necessary to continue their efforts to deliver high-quality teaching without any undue stress due to staffing shortages.“Tighter financial controls would have allowed the council to free up money to deliver an incentive to attract the subject teachers.“The administration rejected Labour’s proposals at budget time that would have delivered a golden hello to the subject teachers we need to attract.“More financial control by the administration could have delivered so much more and resolved the problem we currently have in attracting teachers.”But Councillor Murray said Labour’s alternative was unviable, adding: “Other councils have done that but that’s not the route I want to go down.“It doesn’t work. It becomes an arms race where one authority can offer more than the other.“It doesn’t create any more staff and it’s just a waste of public money.“I’ve only been in the position for 12 months and it’s definitely been a lot easier this year finding staff.“I think a lot of it is down to there being more confidence in the city.“We’re doing a lot of work with Dundee University for people who can’t afford to quit their jobs to apply for teaching vacancies in city schools and that’s been positive.“There’s certainly no shortage of people applying.“We’ve been inundated particularly with people wanting to become head teachers, which is a good thing.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b238ed81901b-846x564.jpg ","title":"dundee va could host weddings as approval given to sell booze","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe V\u0026ampA Dundee museum could host events as varied as weddings and casino nights, its operators have revealed.The details emerged during a meeting of the council’s licensing board, during which the gallery made its case to sell booze for consumption both on and off the premises.The museum’s operation plan, distributed ahead of the meeting, revealed V\u0026ampA bosses hope to stage live music, dance performances, film screenings, private events and casino nights.Janet Hood, representing the V\u0026ampA at the board meeting, said this could even stretch to include weddings.She said: “As I am sure you are all aware, there is a cafe in the foyer.

the favourites last season to top the table but fell well short of champions St Mirren.This time around, it promises to be even more difficult with two teams coming down from the Premiership.Starting with those two, let’s have a look at the Tangerines’ main challengers this coming season.Partick ThistleThe Jags became only the second top-tier side to lose out in the play-offs and are among the favourites to go straight back up.Alan Archibald has stayed on at Firhill and is rebuilding his side for the Championship.How strong they are remains to be seen but the experienced duo of Chris Erskine and Kris Doolan will be big factors in any success they have.Ross CountyAlso coming down, the Staggies aren’t hanging about putting together a team that can win the division.Co-managers Stuart Kettlewell and Steven Ferguson are determined to make their first chance in management a success.County will be a tough nut to crack for most teams in the Championship.Inverness CTCaley Thistle were expected to be Dundee United’s main challengers last season but got off to an awful start.Boss John Robertson turned things around and a late surge almost saw them into the play-offs.Expect that good form to continue in the new campaign.DunfermlineAllan Johnston’s 2017/18 team has been ripped apart with players leaving left, right and centre.With a lot of work to be done in the transfer market at the moment, another finish in the play-offs looks unlikely but Johnston has a history of getting his sides into the top four.FalkirkFormer Dundee manager Paul Hartley is slowly making the Bairns side his own after big changes in the winter and more to come this summer.Way off the pace last season, another mediocre campaign won’t be acceptable for the Falkirk faithful.MortonFormer United boss Ray McKinnon is just in the door at Cappielow and is busy bringing in players.His aim is the play-offs – Jim Duffy was sacked for not making them – so pressure is on.Queen of the SouthThe Doonhamers haven’t done much business this summer, the arrival of Gary Harkins apart, and will have to tighten up their defence if they are to cause any trouble at the top end of the division in the new

yet to take place ahead of any big decisions.Highland Council\u0027 announcement\u0026nbsplast week that it is to buy the notorious 1960s Upper Bridge Street buildings as part of a bigger redevelopment of Inverness Castle has been broadly welcomed.Already there have been suggestions for the site ranging from demolishing the entire block to creating a green space.But any action to redevelop the concrete carbuncles will not happen immediately as possible options have yet to be drawn up ahead of a public consultation, while tenants in some units still have several years left on the leases.They include the Scottish Children\u0027 Reporter Admin-istration (SCRA) which has stated its intentions to remain in its unit until the end of the lease in October 2025 while the Shapla Indian Restaurant is among the businesses yet to be contacted by the council on how the takeover and potential plans might impact on its future.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspRestaurant owner Shabaro Ali said this week\u0027 announcement had come as a surprise, although he welcomed the news.\"Obviously, if Highland Council is going to redevelop the site, it is good for the city, it is good for us, it is good for everyone,\" he said.With about another 10 years remaining on the lease, Mr Ali wants the restaurant to remain in its prime riverside location where it has been for the last 22 years.\"I am sure Highland Council will try to keep everyone happy,\" he said.Orkney businesswoman Judith Glue opened her shop in Bridge Street 10 years ago and although she has yet to be directly approached by her new landlord, she was not unduly worried about the change in ownership,\"I hope it will be positive for businesses to be a part of a brand new project which would be good for Inverness,\" she said. \"Until they get in touch and tell us about the plans, there is not a lot I can say.\"The SCRA, meanwhile, occupies the main concrete block nearest the river which many would like to see removed.When contacted by the Inverness Courier last week ahead of the official announcement, a spokeswoman said there were no plans to move out.\"This is where our staff are based and where we hold children\u0027 hearings,\" she said.Following discussions with the council, that position remained unchanged this week.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspScotland\u0027 rural economy secretary Fergus Ewing \u0026ndash also the Inverness and Nairn MSP and co-chairman of the steering group overseeing the castle redevelopment \u0026ndash warned the project would take time.\"I don\u0026rsquot wish expectations to be raised in that things will happen in the next year or so,\" he said. \"I think that most things worth achieving in life do take several years.

GREATER sense of empowerment for residents of one of the Highlands\u0026rsquo most deprived communities is being promised as part of a new plan for the area.The South Kessock and Merkinch locality plan, launched this week, details measures to boost quality of life there.Drawn up by the Inverness Community Partnership (ICP) \u0026ndash a body bringing together representatives of a range of bodies including Highland Council, police and NHS Highland \u0026ndash it includes proposals to improve support for school leavers and provision for unemployed people looking to move into work, as well as plans for a new family science event and a community clean-up.As part of moves to develop \"stronger connections for local voices\", as well as improving participation by young people and schools in community planning, there are also proposals for a new focus group drawn from local residents to support the ICP\u0027 work.This is off the back of evidence that residents have \"little confidence that their voices are heard\".Marked by lower than average incomes and a lack of qualifications in young people leaving school, in 2016 the average life expectancy in Merkinch was just 66 years \u0026ndash compared to 82 in the affluent Crown area, barely a mile away.The report stated: \"Community partners recognise that, in order for health and wellbeing interventions to be effective, they need to be delivered in the local community in partnership with existing community projects and activities.\"We recognise that our best chance of achieving success is to put people and communities at the centre of our planning and delivery processes.\"We will work with the people to tackle what matters most to them and will make a positive difference to their lives and to the community.\"Notwithstanding this, it also means that we recognise that communities can and do achieve great things for themselves.\"We need to harness such achievements and increase the level of influence and sense of control that people have over decisions and services across the locality.\"The plan also raises the possibility of support for residents to take direct control of a range of community assets.Council city centre manager David Haas said: \"We have talked to all the local communities to find out what people want to see improved and help the great work that\u0027 already being done in these areas by existing groups.\"We want to give them the encouragement to do more.\"It\u0027 down to us to listen to what people want and give them a helping hand to create the community they want.\"Dell McClurg, chairwoman of Merkinch Community Council, said it was ironic that it was apparently not told of the launch event \"until it had already started\" but agreed: \"There needs to be more help for the people who are already working at the coal-face in the area.\"She said: \"It\u0027 important that the people who live and work here are listened to.\"We live here and we know what works in this area.\"We just need the right level of support.\"Highland councillor Bet McAllister (Inverness Central) said: \"Things are really moving forward in the area and people seem happy with where we are going.\"As councillors, we need to be out there speaking to the community, and letting people know that they can come to us.\"Many strands of the plan are due to get under way imminently, with moves to review current provision for unemployed people set to start in August. The findings will be used to determine future actions.Longer term plans for a \"bespoke early leavers programme\", which includes ensuring all early school leavers have an individual work coach, are set to be in place by July next year.Monday 18 Jun 2018 4:35 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04111000/04111983.jpg","title":"New school campus is given the green light","story":"AMBITIOUS plans to create a badly-needed new school campus in a growing Inverness neighbourhood have been given the green light to the delight of community leaders.Highland councillors approved proposals to transform the existing Merkinch Primary School and nursery into a facility fit for the 21st century including all-weather sports pitches which will be available to the local community.It will also incorporate the Merkinch Family Centre which will relocate from its base in Coronation Park.The school is presently housed in cramped accommodation in a 132-year-old category B-listed building with extensions plus portable classrooms in the playground.Under the plans, which are broadly supported by the community, a new two-storey extension in a contemporary design will be built to accommodate the primary school and nursery.There will also be an adjoining single-storey double height sports block, play areas, informal/social courtyard spaces and garden areas.The relocated family centre, school dining hall and community sports studios will be housed in the original school building which will be refurbished while previous extensions will be demolished.Inverness Central councillor Richard Laird outlined the challenges of the development site when he spoke at the council\u0027s south planning applications committee meeting on Tuesday.\"To describe this as simply expanding a new school understates what the council is seeking to do,\" he said.The SNP representative said the integrated campus would provide services from the very early years right through primary school.Cllr Laird felt the designs addressed a range of existing issues including the grassed playing area which he described as an \"unusable bog\" at certain times of the year plus road safety concerns over traffic on Telford Road where the present school entrance is located.He also felt the location of the proposed two-storey extension in the centre of the site presented no risk of overshadowing Carse Road.\"I think what we have is a very elegant solution to a number of challenges,\" he said.\"This is a project which has almost unanimous support in the Merkinch community.\"Speaking after the meeting, fellow ward councillor Bet McAllister was \"over the moon\" the plans had been given the go ahead.\"It will make a huge difference to the community,\" the Labour representative said.\"It is a lovely school. Unfortunately, it is very small and it gets very over-crowded.\"The children and teachers deserve a place to meet modern-day learning needs while the outdoor facilities will benefit the whole community.\"I think everyone will be delighted.\"Dell McClurg, chairman of Merkinch Community Council, also welcomed the news but had reservations over the loss of some open space which will be

People want it open more often and to accommodate all age groups. It could be based on water fountains/jets, as in an installation in Southend which includes colour changing lighting.Another option is to create a three-storey adjacent lido with open-air pool on the top floor and spa facilities on the first floor.A further option is to take over the nearby council-owned Nairn Leisure Centre pool, give it a glass roof and create a training and competition facility to complement a lido.The lido proposal was inspired by Bath\u0027 dramatic Thermae Spa.Lessees of the neighbouring links tearoom and James\u0026rsquo Caf\u0026eacute have put forward proposals to improve their facilities.Community leaders are excited but have urged sensitive handling of the initiative.Nairn River Community Council chairman Tommy Hogg said: \"That area is part of Nairn\u0027 heritage so they\u0026rsquove got to do it sympathetically or it\u0026rsquoll cause massive problems.\"A council consultation keen to include input from local schools and youth groups is expected to follow in August.Planning officers say \"the time is ripe for a development plan\".Their report suggests building on a trail around Nairn from the Links through Viewfield and along the riverside featuring various attractions for \"people to linger, to learn about Nairn, to take part in an activity and to enjoy their surroundings\".Each point would incorporate a theme and\u0026nbspa dolphin-inspired artwork has been mooted.A draft plan is currently evolving for Nairn\u0027 77-pontoon harbour and waterfront to improve the harbour basin, surrounding buildings and maximise its potential to boost Nairn\u0027 economy.Planned projects include expansion of the pontoon system, increasing capacity to 97 boats and to develop a watersports centre.Other than driving to the links, people generally walk there as there is no public transport to the beach area.The planners say \"there may be an opportunity to operate a land train type tourist train in the summer months, taking people round the links, the harbour, Viewfield and Fishertown.\"Alternatively, there may be potential to develop a miniature railway, of the type used at Whin Park in Inverness.\"Monday 18 Jun 2018 4:35 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04114000/04114012.jpg","title":"The street has no name six years on","story":"\u0026nbspTHE hunt is on for a name for an Inverness street \u0026ndash after a six-year wait.The road that runs through Milton of Leys has never been named.Highland Council said it was agreed as far back as 2012 that naming the street \"would not be beneficial as it was not providing access to a particular address\".But the council has changed tack after a complaint from the ward\u0027\u0026nbspNon-Aligned Highland councillor Ken Gowans.He said residents were experiencing difficulties directing delivery drivers and added: \"If you had a bad accident on that road how would you identify your position? \"That road is a main thoroughfare that goes right the way down Milton of Leys.

It just shows the fine margins in football.“Switzerland are a very good side but over in Basel in the second leg (0-0) I thought we were far better.“We created the better chances and on another time it could have been our night.“Looking back we probably shot ourselves in the foot as we were maybe a bit more cautious at home than we usually are.”With no World Cup action McGinn has opted to return to Pittodrie a week earlier than the rest of the squad to ensure he can make an immediate impact in the new campaign.Aberdeen enter the Europa League at the second qualifying round on July 26 and discover their opponents in Wednesday’s draw.McGinn said: “I had a frustrating end to the last campaign picking up a few niggly injuries but I’ve had a good break now which has been really beneficial.“We come back near the end of June but I’m going in around a week prior to that to give myself time with the physios before I go back into full training.“I want to get myself ready to go and am determined to do well for the team.“I’m really excited about the season as we have European football and I really look forward to those games at the start of the campaign.“Hopefully we can do well in the Europa League then make a strong start domestically, which can build belief we can have another good season.”This summer though McGinn and his Northern Ireland team-mates will be left considering what could have been after the disappointment of the play-off loss to the Swiss.In the first leg at Windsor Park last November Ricardo Rodriguez scored the only goal of the play-off from the spot after Corry Evans was adjudged to have handled.The ball clearly struck the defender’s shoulder.It prevented Northern Ireland a second straight finals appearance having advanced to the Euro 2016 knock-out phase in the nation’s first appearance at a major finals since World Cup 1986.“Having experienced the Euros and all that followed from that tournament it is very frustrating not to be at the World Cup,” said McGinn.“It was an unbelievable experience and I saw just how much it meant to the people of Northern Ireland and that group of players.“To go to another tournament would have been incredible, especially the World Cup.”Following the World Cup play-offs the SFA made a botched attempt to secure Northern Ireland boss O’Neill as replacement for Gordon Strachan whose contract was not renewed.O’Neill rejected the SFA’s advances and opted to sign a new contract until 2024.“It is one of those ones where we didn’t qualify so we just have to keep moving forward,” said McGinn.“We are happy the manager has stayed and things are very positive in Northern Ireland at the moment.”The play-off disappointment had added poignancy for McGinn as he watched it from the other side of the world in South Korea having moved to Gwangju after rejecting a new deal at Pittodrie at the end of the 2016-17 season.The switch to the K League did not work out as he dropped out of the international reckoning and struggled to get regular game time at Gwangju.He said: “I was left out of the squad for the play-offs which was disappointing as I am an experienced player.“I wasn’t playing much club football at the time so I couldn’t really have an answer to that.“However, I have shown in the past that even when I have been on the bench and called upon I have always done a good job.“I came on and scored in the Euros and played my part in that campaign as well.“Being an experienced player it was disappointing I wasn’t involved.”Following Gwangju’s relegation and change of manager McGinn’s contract was terminated by mutual consent, opening the way to a Pittodrie return where he penned a three-and-a-half year deal in January.It propelled McGinn back into the international reckoning as he was selected for the squad to face South Korea in March but had to pull out through injury.He also missed out on the end-of-season friendlies away to Panama (0-0) and Costa Rica (3-0 loss) with a groin injury that ruled him out of the final games of the domestic season.He sat out the 1-0 win against Celtic at Parkhead.McGinn said: “The lads went into that game knowing if Rangers won at Hibs and we lost, Rangers would finish second – so to achieve what we did was fantastic.“To finish above Rangers was huge considering the financial side of things and the difference in that aspect between the two clubs.“I’m not sure we were recognised as much as we should have been for that.“It was probably our best achievement in the league under Derek McInnes.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/06/5b26423574d7b-459x564.jpg ","title":"could you help rehome any of these beautiful kittens","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAre you looking to get a new pet?

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000. If you are involved in a community-run or farming support project and think your organisation may benefit – or if you know someone who might –  visit  www.princescountrysidefund. org.uk/grants.The fund has supported a diverse range of projects, including a community transport app in Argyll and projects on Barra, Orkney and Shetland. We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest. We can still see her face full of horror and hear her cry.Otherwise we had a lovely holiday. You have a most beautiful part of the country to live in.Name and address supplied.Sir,It has been announced recently a Scottish Conservative government would invest £100 million into fixing potholes over the course of the next parliament.We all rely on our roads but they are now plagued with potholes which are damaging cars. Beyond our concerns for public safety, this systematic under-investment is slowing our economy and costing local councils a fortune in compensation for car owners.We recognise the importance of well-maintained roads and we are willing to invest in it.The SNP has consistently neglected Scotland’s roads and the results are obvious for everyone to see.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.On Monday May 14, I spotted six swallows over the rear of Meadows Place, hopefully heralding a decent summer.First seen this year.Mike Power, Lochgilphead.Sir,During this week\u0026#8217s Holyrood vote on the UK Government’s Withdrawal Bill, Labour, the Greens and LibDems joined the SNP in an overwhelming rejection of the UK Government’s currently-drafted Brexit plans, voting 93 to 30 against the bill.While the Scottish Government agrees in the need for UK-wide frameworks, it has described the retention of the overall control of agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement as a power grab.The Scottish Parliament has spoken loudly and clearly, and if the UK Government wants us to believe they value Scotland and devolution, they must respect the vote and remove the proposed power grab.Any constraints placed on the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament without consent would be a democratic outrage.During Prime Minister\u0026#8217s Questions, Theresa May failed to reassure us she will respect the decision of the Scottish Parliament. If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade.

By taking part in Walk Your Way you’ll be helping to reduce your own risk of stroke, and the vital funds you’ll raise will help the charity to support more stroke survivors to regain their independence.Sign up to Walk Your Way now: stroke.org.uk/WalkYourWayMichael Lynagh, former Australian rugby union internationalSir,What is it with people who drive cars while doing other things?As a driver I often see people behind the wheel talking on mobile phones, sending texts, touching up make-up in the mirror and, on a few occasions recently, the same man has been shaving while bowling merrily along the A83 trunk road \u0026#8211 while in a van belonging to an Argyll and Bute public agency.It just takes a split second for an accident to happen through losing concentration behind the wheel.Put down your smartphone, make-up bag and electric razor before either the police catch you or an accident happens.Name and address supplied\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"harbour gallery open entry call from tarbert golf club","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 01/06/18, 5:48 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowSunday June 3, sees the Stuart Herd Harbour Gallery Open take place at Glenralloch with an entry fee of £15.The club is hopeful that the recent good weather will encourage a healthy turnout of competitors for this popular event.There are four nett prizes and four scratch prizes on offer with the winner receiving one of Stuart\u0026#8217s stunning prints of a scene from Tarbert golf course.To book your entry please call the club at 01880 820565.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 26","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 02/06/18, 3:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.What a spell of weather we have had over the past week and more.Knowing the Argyll climate, by the time you read this you might be sitting in a blizzard in front of the fire enjoying your paper but it was good while it lasted.Welcome as it is, warm weather brings its own problems.

These had a variety of riding and control of paces challenges including an unusual off piste element using the quarry area of the field.Judge Debbie Hay Thorburn was very impressed with the independent riding of the youngest members who tackled all the tasks with confidence and determination. The show jumping catered for all ages and abilities and there were exciting jump-offs to entertain spectators. In fact many of the passing ferry passengers stopped to watch from the road.The new timing equipment, purchased with aid of a grant from Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust, was in full use by judge Mairi Henderson and made for more professional accuracy in timing aspects.The final Grand Prix had only two competitors but it was a masterclass of style and competence from Jojo and Katie which made it a joy to watch.As usual the event ended with some fast and exciting games and after the field was cleared there was the prizegiving in the Pony Club’s brand new blue tent.The Junior Trophy for the day was won by Louise Ralston from Campbeltown and Iris McMillan from Tayvallich took the Senior Trophy for a second year while the non-members trophy was won by Andrea McShannon.Pony Club PonyClass 11 Frazer Prentice, Firefly2 Louise Ralston, Nero3 Rory Shaw, Libby4 Jake Rowan, AliceClass 21 Willow Ryan, Ryan2 Zoe Prentice, Cowal3 Isla McShannon, ColeyClass 31 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Katie MacKay, Eva3 Josephine Boase, ValerieClass 41 Andrea McShannon, Nicole2 Julie McLeish, Eclipse3 Shelagh Oakes, Pery4 Catriona Ryan, DoneyShow JumpingStars of the Future \u0026#8211 Lead Rein1 Louise Ralston, Nero2 Frazer Prentice, Firefly3 Rory Shaw, Libby4 Jake Rowan, AliceStars of the Future1 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Zoe Prentice, Cowal3 Isla McShannon, Coley4 Willow Ryan, RyanNewcomers1 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Andrea McShannon, Nicole3 Michelle McAloon, Eclipse4 Catriona Ryan, DoneyDiscovery1 Josephine Boase, Valerie2 Andrea McShannon, Nicole3 Katie MacKay, Eva4 Michelle McAloon, EclipseGrand Prix1 Josephine Boase, Valerie2 Katie MacKay, Eva\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 07/06/18, 4:46 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.This week\u0026#8217s photograph comes from Jacqui Barker of Tarbert.

After a pit stop in the Royal Burgh it was on to Fort William, then Inverness and back home again- all to raise money for Cancer Research UK and Target Ovarian Cancer.Spokesperson for Breast Way Round, Laura White, said: ‘This year was full of fun, laughter, meeting new family members and although the daily miles are hard going, the weather and the beauty of the Scottish scenery made it that little bit easier.’As well as the sponsored trek, the bikers raised money in more traditional ways, such as bucket shaking (the men wearing bras) and hosting a raffle and auction in Caol Community Centre. The most coveted item, a patchwork quilt made by rider Cathy Anderson, went for a whopping £700.The annual trip was started in 2008 by Shirley-Ann McKnight as a last tour of Scotland for fellow biker and close friend, Alyson Porter, who was suffering from cancer. Sadly, Alyson never made it to her trip and now each year the journey is retraced in celebration of her life and all those affected by cancer.Since 2008, more than 600 riders have participated, each clad with a pink mohawk courtesy of Hairy-RS, and the team has raised £347,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support.

They won a throw-in deep in the Glasgow Red Star half, taken by Craig Aitken. After playing a neat one-two with Woody Hoad, Craig sent in a teasing cross for Keiran Caskie to glance past the Glasgow Red Star keeper.Lochgilphead introduced Jamie Stewart and Ciaran Gibson who helped freshen things up and work hard to close the game out.Special mention to subs Lee Harris, just returning from injury, and the ever reliable Calum Paterson.At the end of the game the Lochgilphead boys were presented with the League Cup and also the League Championship for 2004 age group teams to make it a double celebration.With three games still left to play the boys are looking to make it through the season with only one league defeat.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 27","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 10/06/18, 3:50 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.The last thing David MacInnes sees himself as is a hero.Be we believe differently.

The pair were seeded car 30 in the two wheel drive section, run first on the day in a new schedule being piloted by the rally, the two wheel drive cars covering the stages before the four wheel drive cars followed in the afternoon.With the dry conditions in the weeks running up to the event dust would be the main problem for those running further down the field. Douglas attacked the first stage, Twiglees, and was catching the car in front when, unfortunately due to the dust being created by that car, came out of a 90 degree corner with zero visibility and connected heavily with a rock, damaging the suspension and forcing his early retirement.The car, and the driver, are noticeably quicker  each event they compete in and it\u0026#8217s only a matter of time before the results are there.The other Argyll car out on the stages was Ally Currie from Mull and Grant McNiven in the Ford Fiesta ST picking up 9th overall and 1st in Class 6.The next round of the Scottish Championship is Argyll Rally, based in Dunoon on June 23 \u0026#8211 the closest round for most Argyll rally enthusiasts and one not to be missed. The stages look absolutely breathtaking this year and well worth a watch.The Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship continues as well with round three being the Granite at Leuchars Stages hosted by Aberdeen and District Motor Club at the MOD base in Leuchars, Fife.Argyll was well represented both in the drivers seat and the co-drivers. All Argyll crew Willie and Steven Beattie were out in the newly finished and beautifully finished Escort MkII. They were absolutely flying and really getting to grips with the car when a sixth gear lock-up threw them into a spin and off the stage, clouting a fairly substantial fence post in the process.The navigators side now looks decidedly second hand, but nothing a few hours in the workshop won\u0026#8217t sort. A bent bottom suspension arm put paid to them re-joining but they will take the positives and the blistering pace into the next round for sure.Willie Beattie Snr in his equally exquisite Escort was also beginning to get the hang of the car, with some more seat time this year, not to mention experienced co-driver, Phil Sandham, pushing him on. He, after making sure his boys were okay when they didn\u0026#8217t show up at service after their spin, continued on to secure 12th overall and second in class: his first honours since building the car.The next round may see some family ties severely stretched, at least until the final results are announced.Ian Parker was also out in familiar machinery, co-driving for Fraser Smith in his Canal Garage-prepared Honda Civic. The pair were also making good progress up the class rankings until the diff decided to implode and finished their rally on Stage six.The drive of the day was not in question. Alan Kirkaldy led from start to finish despite some interesting issues in the first test. His door came loose after about a third of stage and he continued, holding the door shut by the open window whilst steering, changing gear and waving with the other.Astonishingly he still managed quickest stage time by five seconds. His co-driver for the day could forgive himself for being a little green about the gills after that.Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan was lucky enough to win the seat in a charity auction at the Annual STRC Dinner earlier in the year. An experience he is unlikely to forget in a hurry, although some of the memories may be a little bit blurry and perhaps just a little sideways. The top three were rounded out by Ian Forgan, ably guided round in his Subaru by his daughter in her first rally and the final position on the podium went to Ian and Allan Paterson, also in a Subaru.The next round is this weekend at Crail where the Beattie boys will be back out, Ian Parker swaps a Civic for an Escort MKII and Donald Bowness is set to get back out in the Nova.PICS:Photos: Gavin Brown, West Coast PhotosRed Escort (Car 1) Alan Kirkaldy/Eoghan Anderson (first overall) no_a24rally01\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"high tech preparation for mid argyll art show","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 14/06/18, 7:45 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThis year has seen a lot of preparatory work ahead of the 2018 Mid Argyll Art Society exhibition in August.The popular show will again be held in the Drill Hall, Lochgilphead and will run from August 6-11.As in the last few years, the Mid Argyll Camera Club will have photos on display.The society is harnessing modern technology in a campaign to raise the profile of this year\u0026#8217s event.There is now a Mid Argyll Art Society Facebook page that can be used to get updates on what is happening.There will shortly be a website giving details about the art society, its history, information on the exhibition and how to participate, and photos of past exhibits to give a flavour of what the event is like.A lot of work has been done on modernising the entry process.

There is also a small fee to be paid by each exhibitor for every painting or photo that is hung, and this goes to help to cover running expenses.With over 500 people having visited the exhibition in 2017, organisers hope this excellent support from the community will continue. Both professional and amateur artists in the area are encouraged to make use of the exhibition to display their work.The overriding aim of the exhibition, since its beginning in 1967, has always been to foster interest in locally-produced art and to give people from the community the opportunity to let others see, appreciate, and maybe buy their works.Organisers wish to thank the Army Cadet Force for permission to use their building.Details about how to enter exhibits will appear in adverts in the Argyllshire Advertiser, Facebook and on the exhibition website.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"brave mum set skydive charity","story":"NewsBrave mum set to skydive for charity for inspirational nephewJoanne Dunlop, of Ayr, will jump from a hair-raising 10,000ft at Skydive St Andrews.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet10:32, 15 JUN 2018NewsMegan Mcphearson and Joanne Dunlop\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA brave mum is set to take to the skies for her inspirational nephew.

Villagers - and residents across the greenbelt in Muirhead - mounted a stiff rearguard action after a bid to get it zoned for housing. For the first time it emerged a developer WAS behind the plan, rather than, as was insisted, South Ayrshire Council officers just selected it as a prospect. Senior SNP councillor Craig Mackay said on Tuesday it was now “highly unlikely” it would make the next stage. And he told Troon Community Council : “No decisions have been made and we are not out of the woods yet with the Muirhead-Loans site yet. “But on the basis the available land pretty much matches what we need for new housing over the next five years, there should be no need for any release of greenbelt sites. “It is highly unlikely it will be built on.” We revealed the secret plan for the soggy 30 acre field in October, which would link the medieval clachan to the town of Troon. It sparked an emergency meeting of Loans Community Council and the public packed out Troon Community Council meetings.  And at the time town councillor Peter Convery said: “That ground is sacrosanct and it should never have been suggested for the local plan.” Planners were promoting the sight, saying the “layouts of both settlements turn their backs twoards each other at the moment and this doesnt create an attractive approach to either of them.” Councillor Mackay said the house sites currently available “pretty much” matched the demand. And he revealed South Ayrshire Council has now taking a slightly different approach from the developer-led schemes. He added: “Brownfield land will be prioritised even though that is not as lucrative for developers.” Councillor Mackay also revealed a developer had been circling on the Loans site - despite insistence from council officers there was no developer. He said:”Planning officers gave assurances there was no developer.. but there was.”  The breakthrough has been hailed by David Chalmers, chairman of Loans Community Council. He said: “It is obviously encouraging hearing Councillor McKay’s statement that development be allowed on the greenbelt between Loans and Muirhead is unlikely to be adopted in LDP2. “We will, of course, anxiously await SAC’s verification of this which we understand will not be until nearer the end of this year. “Every praise should be given to the overwhelming response given by the residents of Loans and Muirhead - a 367 signature petition and 246 letters - which clearly demonstrated the level of feeling against.” South Ayrshire Council said the process to publish the new Development Plan was still active. A spokesman said: “There are a range of issues that are suggested, discussed and determined. This is a very thorough process to ensure that all stakeholders are given due consideration. As a result, we’ll only be able to give assurance of what is included in, or excluded from the proposed plan when a report is considered by the Council later this year.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnScottish National PartySouth Ayrshire CouncilTroonAyrAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"council perform u turn over","story":"NewsCouncil perform U-turn over car park feesThe astonishing cave-in by wobbling South Ayrshire Council came amidst a 1700-name petition signed by furious residents and businesses.\u0026nbspShareByStephen Houston15:41, 13 JUN 2018NewsSouth Beach car park (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailParking charges WON’T be introduced at two Troon car parks, we can reveal. The astonishing cave-in by wobbling South Ayrshire Council came amidst a 1700-name petition signed by furious residents and businesses. The council ARE pressing ahead with fees at a third Troon car park, at Bellevue in Prestwick and Ayr Blackburn. They argued the \u0026pound2 charge would destroy much-needed trade and lead to chaos in surrounding streets in Troon The U-turn was revealed by Councillor Craig Mackay at Troon Community Council last Tuesday. He managed to finally nail down an answer from his officials, admitting: “This issue has caused confusion within the council.” There will be no charges at the car park at the Walker Hall or the Italian Gardens.  But council officers are pressing ahead with a \u0026pound2 fee at the South Beach car park next to Royal Troon. This lead to anger from Community Councillor Robert Milligan, who said: “I suggest if you are going to charge for South Beach you actually need to provide loos, even temporary between May and September, to meet demand. If people are paying for parking the least we can do is to have toilet facilities without peeing in the dunes. “People are urinating in the sand dunes and residents can see it from their houses.” At the community council police revealed Troon only gets a traffic warden once every 2.8 days. And townspeople feared cars would be abandoned on the streets rather than pay for parking. The Ayrshire Post has led the way on the issue, revealing Troon has NEVER had to pay parking fees. Councillor Mackay said: “ We were working on the basis of parking charges being introduced to three car parks in Troon.  “I had a meeting with senior officers to discuss concerns of residents and businesses, in particular at the Walker Hall. “The knock-on conserquences are complex, particularly with displacement into residential streets.” He finally got an admission the council were axing the charges in a statement from SNP party colleague Ian Cochrane. Councillor Mackay added: “I was still struggling to get full clarity. “Traffic Orders are being progressed at Royal Troon, Belevue Road in Prestwick and Blackburn Road in Ayr. “It came as a surprise to me as the statement said no other parking charges are proposed at this time and that is quite a changes from what we were looking at.” Troon council vice-chairman Dougie Graham added: “We will wait to see what happens.” Five days after being asked for a comment on the U-turn, South Ayrshire Council would only say: “We’re currently finalising plans for the introduction of charges at Blackburn Road, Bellevue Road and Troon seafront car parks – all of which will require a new Traffic Regulation Order (TRO). We’ll soon be getting the TRO process underway, which will include a period of public consultation, and further details on this will be shared in due course.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12539593.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/14478946.jpg","title":"lawrence shankland agrees new deal","story":"NewsLawrence Shankland agrees new deal to stay at Ayr United for Championship pushThe 29-goal striker has put pen to paper on a new deal at Somerset Park.\u0026nbspShareByStuart WilsonLochlin Highet13:14, 15 MAY 2018Updated13:18, 15 MAY 2018NewsShankland is staying on at Somerset (Image: Daily Record)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailLawrence Shankland insists money can’t buy happiness after he sensationally spurned a host of lucrative offers to pen a new deal at Ayr United.

Mhari Bryce, 27-year-old Reception Manager from Hamilton married 36-year-old Operations Manager Chris Rowe from Manchester. The pair now live in Ayr. “We met on a training course in Livingston in 2010 - Chris offered me his last jelly baby!” said Mhari. “It was after Chris moved from Livingston to Ayr that we started dating properly and have been together since.” The couple tied the knot on Sunday, April 1 at The Waterside Hotel in West Kilbride. Mhari said: “We had the perfect day with amazing weather and a beautiful sunset.  “All our closest friends and family joined us for a simple but loving ceremony carried out by Peter Clark of the Scottish Humanist Society.” The bride wore a Mori lee dress from Bijoux Bridal, Hamilton. Mhari’s veil held a special sentimental value to it. She said: “The veil is 25 years old which was worn by my aunt on her wedding day.” The groom and best men wore Grey Spirit kilts from Slaters, Ayr. The couple’s wedding party consisted of bridesmaids Sara Bryce (bride’s sister) and Lyndsey Bickerton and best men Grant Russell and Mark Rowe (groom’s brother). The newly married Mr and Mrs jetted off for a fortnight in the sun after the big day.  The couple said: “We flew to St Lucia for 2 weeks and stayed at The Royalton. “It was amazing - so relaxed, exactly what we needed after the wedding.” Adore Weddings captured the couple’s big day, with both photography and videography, leaving them with lovely memories to look back on. Mhari added: “Both Barrie and Jim were fantastic all day, with us and all the guests. “The pictures are just too hard to pick from.” Stems and Gems in Saltcoats created the bouquets, buttonholes and flowers for the centrepieces while the cake was made by a relative.  Mhari said: “The cake was made by my aunt. “It was baked in Norwich then driven all the way to Scotland and built. “All the flowers are made of icing to match the flowers in my bouquet.” Linzi of Linzi Smith Hair at Distinction styled the hair for the day while Elaine Sawyer of Lookz Mobile Makeup Artist created the makeup looks. The couple added: “We would like to thank everyone who travelled the distance to make our special day - some all the way from Texas. “Also a massive thank you to Ryan and Stacey of The Waterside - our day ran perfectly all thanks to them.” For more photos of this week\u0027s Wedding of the Week, pick up your copy of the Ayrshire Post.

Stuart Laing gets a glittering OBE for nearly 50 years hard graft in the shiny world of jewellery. And Kirsty Letton is now an MBE after more than four decades of dedication to Scottish curling. That they live within 500 yards of each other in Troon is highly noteworthy in that NOBODY else who lives in mainland Ayrshire received anything this year. Stuart,68, has been honoured not just for running the family’s firm Laings, but his foundation of a UK consortium that allowed independents to flourish. He said: “I am thrilled and delighted to speak about it . . . this has been very difficult not to mention.  “I am proud and honoured, but also very humbled as well.” In 1970 he joined the family firm which was begun 130 years earlier. He expanded it to seven branches and started the Houlden (his mother’s maiden name) buying and professional services group for independent jewellers. Stuart remains active as executive chairman of Laings, though his son-in-law Joe Walsh is now chief executive. The father-of-three and now grandad-to-five has been such an influence in the jewellery market he’s regarded by the trade throughout the world. He said: “Strengthening and creating a strong, independent retail sector and giving the UK industry a global identity has been extremely rewarding.” “But this honour is for my entire family and colleagues as a lot of people have been with me on this journey.”  Stuart and his wife Lynda have three children - son Simon and daughters Susanna Laing, and Wendy Walsh. Stuart added: “I would like to pay tribute to my wife Lynda, she has been a wonderful support, a real rock. “We have travelled the globe together representing the UK trade.” He also created the ‘Jewellers of Excellence’ brand, which is a hallmark of trust within the industry. Stuart has been involved in all aspects of the industry and was the only UK Director of SIHH (Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie), a renowned association of the best jewellers in the world, in co-operation with high-end watch houses. Curling champion and coach Kirsty Letton reckons her MBE is an accolade for the entire sport. She says: “Of course I am thrilled and proud. It was a big surprise, I must admit.”  And so are the family - husband Jimmy and children Avril, who now lives in Ascot, and Keith who is in Grenada. Superfit Kirsty - now a 77-year-old grandmother of three - is still playing on the rink as well as coaching at Ayr and manages to find the time to grab an oar for some coastal rowing. Last year she picked up a Sportscotland lifetime volunteering award. And although moving to Ayrshire 21 years ago and joining the Troon Portland club the link with her orginal Glasgow four has never been broken. The highlight of Kirsty’s playing career was winning senior silver in the World Championships in Finland in 2008. She is particularly proud of motivating South Ayrshire primary pupils to have fun on the ice, with 269 youngsters participating in her taster sessions last season.  As well as inspiring the stars of tomorrow, Kirsty instigated the strongly contested World Senior Curling Championships in 2000. She also set up the Glynhill Ladies Curling International event, which attracts world-class teams. Kirsty added: “I don’t know where I would be without curling. It has been a huge part of my life for 40 years. “Last week Ayr Curling Club got the active schools gold award for South Ayrshire and it is things like that which keep me going.” Ayrshire’s Lord-Lieutenant Iona McDonald congratulated the pair. She said: “They have made a considerable contribution to our communities and I am sure that this award comes as a great surprise, as many of them do not seek any recognition for the work that they do. •The Edinburgh-based business grandee Sir Brian Gammell Ivory, gets a CBE for his chairmanship role at Dumfries House.

The bill for absent workers comes on the back of 42,736 days lost during the last 12 months. Employees recorded an average of nine days on the sick during 2017/18. Psychological reasons (30 per cent) were cited as the leading cause for absence, followed by musculoskeletal (19 per cent) and hospitalisation (12 per cent). By far the biggest service to feel the strain was the Health and Social Care Partnership, where an average of 16 days per employee was lost. Teachers, who account for 23 per cent of the council’s workforce, were the best performing ‘directorate’ with a loss of just five days per worker.  All figures were recorded between April 1, 2017 and March 31, 2018. Council officials said trends were showing a “gradual and consistent improvement”. An average of 11.7 days were lost to absence by local government employees (all staff bar teachers) in 2010. The revised figure stands at 10.06 days for 2017/18. A council spokesman said they were “committed” to supporting staff and have a “number of policies and supports in place to maximise employee attendance”. They added: “In recent years, more robust monitoring and reporting arrangements have been introduced which have seen a steady improvement in this area, with our figures below the national average. “We continue to closely monitor employee attendance levels and take all appropriate steps to ensure appropriate standards.” "},{"url":null,"title":"Steam returns to the Borders Railway","story":"STEAM

reinstate a full-time service in the town.\nIn February 2017, the Border  and Peeblesshire News reported that the concession within the Daymart Newsagents on the town\u0026rsquos High Street had closed.\nThis sparked a six-week consultation by the Post Office on proposals to operate a one-day mobile service in the town.\nThe consultation was met with a huge backlash from local politicians and residents, who set up a petition to restore full Post Office services in Innerleithen and the launch of an appeal for local businesses to come forward to take on a concession within their stores.\nJust weeks after the announcement, local businessman Andrew Caldwell, of Caldwell\u0026rsquos Ices, came up with a plan to open the service within his store.\nBut a row over the opening hours with Post Office bosses soon put a stop to the idea.\nWhile the town has been without a permanent service, a mobile service has operated for several hours each Friday in Innerleithen, forcing residents who urgently need to make postal deliveries to travel east to Walkerburn, or west to Peebles to do so.\nA spokesperson from the Post Office told us that, while plans are yet to be finalised, further details about the reopening, including information about the range of services that will be on offer to customers, will be released in due course.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Work to begin on

fascinating medieval history of Stow.\nAlistair Riddell of Stow and Fountainhall Community Council told the Border : \u0026ldquoThe repairs to the graveyard have long been a priority for the local community and it is great to finally get the first grant of money to allow these works to go ahead.\n\"There is a lot of specialist work to be undertaken and the repairs may take several years to complete.\n\"However, once finished the old graveyard will become a real focus for locals and visitors alike.\nStow\u0027s history includes a visit in 1142 by King David I, a visit in 1297 by William Wallace and a visit in 1513 by Queen Margaret Tudor, wife of James IV, prior to the battle of Flodden.\nThe restoration, which is widely supported across the local community, will commence this summer

But Mr Duque\u0026rsquos detractors warn that his victory could throw an already delicate peace process into disarray.\nMr Duque is the son of a former governor and energy minister who friends say has harboured presidential aspirations since he was a child.\nThe father of three ago entered public service almost two decades as an adviser to then finance minister Juan Manuel Santos, who he will now replace as president.\nMr Duque later moved to Washington, where he spent more than a decade at the Inter-American Development Bank, first as an adviser for three Andean countries and later as chief of the institution\u0026rsquos cultural division.\nIt was during that time that Mr Duque forged a close relationship with former president Alvaro Uribe, the torchbearer of conservatives who is both adored and detested by legions of Colombians.\nMr Duque\u0026rsquos low-profile life as a Washington suburbanite came to end in 2014, when with Mr Uribe\u0026rsquos backing he was elected to Colombia\u0026rsquos Senate.\nSeated beside his mentor in the opulent Senate chamber, Mr Duque earned a reputation as a like-minded security hawk who did his homework and earned the respect of colleagues across the political spectrum.\nHe quickly climbed the ranks of Uribe\u0026rsquos Democratic Center party, clenching the group\u0026rsquos presidential nomination just four years later.\n(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i[\u0027GoogleAnalyticsObject\u0027]=ri[r]=i[r]||function(){(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date()a=s.createElement(o),m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0]a.async=1a.src=gm.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)})(window,document,\u0027script\u0027,\u0027//www.google-analytics/analytics.js\u0027,\u0027ga\u0027)ga(\u0027create\u0027, \u0027UA-72310761-1\u0027, \u0027auto\u0027, {\u0027name\u0027: \u0027pacontentapi\u0027})ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027referrer\u0027, location.origin)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension1\u0027, \u0027By Christine, Armario, Associated Press\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension2\u0027, \u0027f8f99f19-5227-4c2f-a729-868e1ac7338b\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension3\u0027, \u0027paservice:news,paservice:news:world\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension6\u0027, \u0027story\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension7\u0027, \u0027composite\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension8\u0027, null)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension9\u0027, null)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.send\u0027, \u0027pageview\u0027, { \u0027location\u0027: location.href, \u0027page\u0027: (location.pathname + location.search + location.hash), \u0027title\u0027: \u0027Young Conservative to become Colombia\\u2019s next president\u0027})\n"},{"url":null,"title":"David Dimbleby to leave Question Time after 25 years","story":"David Dimbleby is to leave Question Time after 25 years of presenting the BBC show.\nAnnouncing his departure the presenter said he would be returning to his first love of reporting.\nHis final broadcast of Question Time will be on December 13 this year.\nBREAKING: David Dimbleby announces that he will leave \n@bbcquestiontime\nin December 2018, after 25 years as presenter of the programme. \n#bbcqt\npic.twitter/qmy9WDlXCI\n\u0026mdash BBC Question Time (@bbcquestiontime) \nJune 17, 2018\nDimbleby said: \u0026ldquoAt the end of the year I will have been chairing Question Time for a quarter of a century and I have decided that this is the right moment to leave.\n\u0026ldquoIt has been a privilege to work for a programme which brings voters face to face with those in power.

For services to the Scottish seafood industry.\u0026#8217Mr MacMillan, from Carradale, East Kintyre, has already been invited to the Palace of Holyroodhouse garden party on Wednesday July 4.During more than half a century in the industry, Mr MacMillan, 72, has moved from working on a fishing boat, ring netting herring, to fine tuning a computer-controlled smoker to create smoked products for worldwide export.Mr MacMillan, has six employees, one of whom said: \u0026#8216Archie was awarded an MBE for being the best boss.\u0026#8217He took control of the artisan business in 1988 and has incrementally improved it ever since, eventually buying a £60,000 computer controlled smoker which it took him three months to fine tune.Mr MacMillan\u0026#8217s life in the seafood business started at the sharp end. Aged 15,  in 1961 he went to sea in the Amy Harris with an uncle.Mr MacMillan, who eats fish most days, said: \u0026#8216Sometimes in the mid-1960s we were earning between £9 and £11 a week which was a good wage.\u0026#8216It was spring 1962 when we started fishing for scallops and the price of a dozen sold to London was 12/6.\u0026#8217It was a brother of his mother, Mary MacMillan, née Paterson, Archie Paterson, who taught him all he knew, in a decade aboard Harvest Queen.By 1972 some Clyde boats were gearing up for pair trawling, where a net is trawled between two boats.Mr MacMillan, helped with a £12,000 loan from the Highlands and Islands Development Board, bought his own boat, Remembrance, from Finlay Cunningham.For pair trawling Mr MacMillan worked with a partner James Rennie on Monarch and in the 1980s they began exporting scallops to markets, including Belgium, Barcelona and Johannesburg.At the same time as fishing from a boat Mr MacMillan was learning about smoking products.\u0026#8216I used to come to the smokehouse when the weather was too bad to go out on the boat,\u0026#8217 said Mr MacMillan, \u0026#8216That is how I learned to smoke fish \u0026#8211 such as kippers.\u0026#8216It was different days there were not environmental health officers coming chapping at the door,\u0026#8217 added the man who has a prized certificate from SALSA \u0026#8211 Safe and Local Supplier Approval for hot and cold smoking of salmon.

And while a little young to be enjoying a champagne celebration, Maisie will be returning to her Upper Stratton home as one of the youngest actors to have starred in an Oscar-winning film.      THE. SILENT. CHILD. HAS. WON. AN. OSCAR.    I genuinely don\u0026rsquot know what to do now. #Oscar2018 pic.twitter/lfXWlFBCj9  The Silent Child beat four contenders to the award: DeKalb Elementary, The Eleven O\u0026rsquoClock,\u0026nbspMy Nephew Emmett and Watu Wote/All of Us.  The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.  The film was given its first public screening in Swindon last month at the Swindon Arts Centre. Gilson, who spoke before and after the showing, said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a great pleasure to be able to finally show this in Swindon.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a film to be appreciated, and to spread a message. Let people know what you\u0026rsquove seen and the emotions you\u0026rsquove felt.      \"Millions of children all over the world live in silence.\"    \u0027The Silent Child\u0027 screenwriter and star Rachel Shenton signed her #Oscars acceptance speech for Best Live Action Short Film. https://t.co/t3Dtf4Uy3c pic.twitter/PYB0M7gRNs"},{"url":null,"title":"  500 000 revamp of Musselburgh s Iceland complete","story":"              A SUPERMARKET store has been given a makeover at a cost of more than \u0026pound500,000.  Musselburgh\u0026rsquos Iceland store is back open after being closed for the refurbishment project.  The premises at Olive Bank Retail Park has a completely new layout and design, including the installation of new fascia and frontage, digital signage, LED lighting, improved in-store navigation and new checkouts that are quicker and easier to use.  The alcohol side of the business was discussed at a recent meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board in Haddington.  An increase in the display of alcohol of 8.8 square metres was proposed and given the green light by the committee\u0026rsquos councillors.  A detailed statement was provided to the committee which outlined the revamp both inside and outside the shop.  It read: \u0026ldquoThe result will be a modern, bright, accessible and customer-friendly store with a focus on quality. This will transcend all ranges and lines including alcohol.  \u0026ldquoWhilst alcohol is very much ancillary to the overall offer, there is a desire to incorporate premium wines and craft beers.  In a bid to prevent items being stolen, members heard how various measures were being taken to cut down on the chances of theft.  New CCTV has been installed throughout the store, while various bottles of alcohol are only accessed through a member of staff opening a locked cabinet.  Similarly, a number of \u0026ldquohigh value lines, including alcohol and various cuts of meat, are on \u0026ldquosmart shelves which sense when an item is lifted and alerts a member of staff through a pager.  Musselburgh is the company\u0026rsquos first of its so-called \u0026lsquoClapham-style\u0026rsquo stores in Scotland.  Neil Hayes, Iceland\u0026rsquos merchandising and format development director, said: \u0026ldquoRefurbishments on this scale are only possible if we close the stores for a time and I am grateful to all our customers in Musselburgh for their patience. I am sure that they will feel that it has been worth it when they experience the new store."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7885531.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"North Berwick named on list of top 20 most charming towns in Scotland","story":"              NORTH Berwick has been named one of the top 20 charming towns in Scotland.

Plain clothes police officers joined colleagues in uniform and members of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos community warden team at John Muir Park and Lochend Woods.  John Muir Park has regularly been used by teenagers who are celebrating the end of their exams.  But in recent years there have been complaints regarding underage drinking, with about 200 people at the park\u0026rsquos Bullet Hill in 2016.  Police have patrolled the area after concerns at public meetings regarding underage drinking and the flouting of local bylaws involving drinking in a public place.  On Friday and Saturday, police and community wardens seized the alcohol from youngsters aged 14 to 21, with a variety of lager, cider and spirits, including 12 litres of vodka, taken.  Inspector Andrew Harborow said: \u0026ldquoEvery year around this time we are aware of youths congregating at Bullet Hill. Whilst this started out as an end-of-school celebration involving those mainly in S6, the ages of those taking part has clearly widened.  \u0026ldquoIn order to reduce the risk to those involved, we have taken action over the weekend and seized alcohol to prevent harm being caused and will be making follow-up enquiries with parents, carers and local shops as to where the alcohol came from.  A council spokeswoman confirmed they had and would continue to work closely with police colleagues in \u0026ldquotackling anti-social behaviour in its many forms.  She said: \u0026ldquoThis can involve action being taken against the individuals responsible for the behaviour itself, alongside engagement with parents or s when appropriate.  \u0026ldquoOn the back of operations like the one at Bullet Hill, we also work with colleagues from other council departments to co-ordinate the clean-up of any affected areas so that members of the public can continue to enjoy our open spaces without debris from anti-social behaviour."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/4089089.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=180\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Residents call for change on recycling boxes","story":"              LOCAL residents have urged\u0026nbspEast Lothian Council to ditch recycling boxes for wheelie bins after the local authority produced a video about the\u0026nbsprecycling process.

April Robertson wrote: \"Come on East Lothian, we need a wheelie bin,\" adding: \"Sick of having loads of boxes cluttering up my garden.

Wheeled bins increase contamination levels by between 20 and 40 per cent.  \"There are then costs per tonne in treatment to ensure that the material can, in fact, be sent for reprocessing and, in some cases, authorities have had entire loads rejected to then be sent for landfill.  \"If we introduced wheeled bins for recycling and attracted similar levels of contamination that other authorities are finding, this would be an additional cost to the council -\u0026nbspand therefore\u0026nbspresidents - as much as \u0026pound1.2m per annum.\"  The local authority said it would cost about \u0026pound2milion in capital funding to supply all properties with wheeled bins for recycling.\u0026nbsp  The spokesperson added: \"We acknowledge the issues associated with the boxes themselves but they are the best option available at present.

Colin Beattie\u0027s comments follows a \"positive meeting\" with health bosses in the wake of patients\u0027 concerns about the service at the enlarged practice in the Musselburgh Primary Care Centre.  The Musselburgh MSP met with doctors and staff at the surgery, along with representatives from East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership.  Mr Beattie said: \"There is no doubt that there are issues around patients\u0026rsquo communication with the surgery, particularly at peak times. I was pleased that the surgery has recognised this and was in a position to give me a briefing on the situation.\"  He said doctors were now up to their full staffing level of 14 and an additional four staff members to take phone calls were in the process of being recruited.  During the visit, Mr Beattie had the chance to discuss other new initiatives which were \"positively transforming the surgery\".  He said: \"While much work seems to have been done, more still has to be achieved to improve the service to patients.  \"I am confident that Riverside and East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership are seriously addressing their remaining issues and I will be keeping in close contact going forward to ensure that my constituents receive the service they should expect.\"  He added that the practice was looking at introducing an online appointment booking system, which it is anticipated would reduce phone calls to the practice.  Riverside was also looking at different options as to how to more effectively manage phone calls at the volume it was receiving, he said.  Mr Beattie said: \"I have encouraged the practice to expedite the introduction of the online appointment booking system, which I feel will have the greatest and quickest effect on the experience of patients contacting the surgery.\"  He also raised the concerns of patients who might have to speak to multiple staff over a period before they were dealt with.  \"Clearly a single point of contact who can immediately direct the patient to the correct destination would be cheaper for the surgery and more efficient and less frustrating for the patient,\" added Mr Beattie."},{"url":null,"title":"Fund in memory of much-missed Jess Mackie helping others","story":"              A MEMORIAL fund set up following the tragic death of a caring 14-year-old girl is on target to reach \u0026pound10,000 raised.  Jess Mackie\u0026rsquos family created the fund in her name after the Gullane youngster, who loved to sing and help others, passed away suddenly on January 2 this year.  The North Berwick High School pupil was a member of the National Youth Choir of Scotland and sang with Aberlady and Gullane Parish Churches, at care homes and for charities, and at school concerts.  Despite her young age, she had a sense of how music could help people in need.  And now the Jess Mackie Memorial Fund will \u0026ldquohelp her to keep helping others, as she had always done, and would have continued to do if she was still with us, said parents Michael and Jackie.  \u0026ldquoWe cannot let our beautiful daughter\u0026rsquos name and character be forgotten, they said. \u0026ldquoShe had so much to offer.  All monies raised will be used to provide support and comfort through music therapy at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh.  Dad Michael, long-standing chairman of Gullane Sports Development Trust, said: \u0026ldquoWhen Jess passed away, we had a memorial service for her and decided to use it to donate to the Edinburgh Children\u0026rsquos Hospital Charity. Quickly thereafter, we learnt about an initiative involving music therapy they were running with Tinderbox Orchestra in the hospital. We met with one of the trustees initially and we decided to put in place something that would allow Jess to help other kids.  The memorial service, which was held at Aberlady Parish Church, raised more than \u0026pound2,000, with money continuing to be donated by members of the public and through organised events.  Michael, 52, said: \u0026ldquoWe were approached by Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches and they asked if they could run an event in Jess\u0026rsquo memory, which they did last Sunday.  \u0026ldquoFrom the family point of view, it was another show of overwhelming support by the village and the community. We have raised a substantial amount of money. Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches posted on Facebook that it had raised about \u0026pound1,800 for the fund and Gullane Athletic [FC] are running an event in August in support of the fund.  Twelve members of staff at North Berwick High School also took part in the recent Edinburgh Marathon Relay.  Split into three teams, they raised more than \u0026pound1,500 for The Royal Hospital for Sick Children Jess Mackie Memorial Fund, Richmond\u0026rsquos Hope and Leuchie House.  Jess, who was in S3 at the secondary school, was, like her twin sister Lauren, a keen singer.  Her dad told the Courier Jess \u0026ldquoloved singing and tried to help people and raise their spirits through her voice.  That love of singing and trying to help people has been mirrored through the success of the memorial fund, which sits at about \u0026pound9,800.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoI think that the fund reflects Jess completely. It reflects the impact she had while only 14 years old.  \u0026ldquoIt reflects the impact she had on people that she met and what she did in terms of her church singing, singing in local care homes, school concerts, helping out at various events like for the Bethany Christian Trust and Leuchie House. I think that reflects what she did while she was here.  The project aims to ensure children and young people who are feeling vulnerable in hospital are given the chance to enjoy music, which can have an enormous and positive impact, helping ignite a spark in them and giving them back a sense of control.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoMusic is a great comforter at times and what Tinderbox do is amazing for the kids.  \u0026ldquoWe had no hesitation in supporting what they do.  Janet Anderson, who is involved with the choirs at the two villages\u0026rsquo churches, also paid tribute to the talented teenager.  She said: \u0026ldquoI could not speak more highly of Jess.  \u0026ldquoShe did not think she had a special talent, she was just the most unassuming, normal girl you would ever meet.  \u0026ldquoShe was so pretty, so kind and so thoughtful and generous and she never thought she was anything special.

Chester, from Dunbar, is one of 13 pets, including cats, dogs and even a rat, taking part in the PDSA Pet Fit Club.  Together they weigh more than 200 kilogrammes and need to shed 75kg to reach their ideal weights.  Ten-year-old Chester, who lives with the Gilmour family on Newhouse Avenue, is looking to shift 2.6kg \u0026ndash or six pounds \u0026ndash to reach his ideal weight.  Chester, who tips the scales at 7.6kg, was gaining so much weight that his owners thought he must have an underlying medical condition. But when tests came back negative, it was clear Chester\u0026rsquos appetite and lazy ways were the root of the problem.  Owner Lisa said: \u0026ldquoWe realised everyone in the house was feeding him without knowing he\u0026rsquod already being fed, so he was getting fed by all four of us every day!  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove tried to help him lose weight, even putting a collar on him that says \u0026lsquoDo not feed me!\u0026rsquo for the neighbours, but that hasn\u0026rsquot worked.  \u0026ldquoHe eats whatever he can find including crisps left on the floor by the kids. He even stole my dad\u0026rsquos cheesecake that was on the kitchen counter! Another time my son woke up to the sound of rattling and he was trying to claw his way into a box of chocolates.  Lisa, along with partner Lindsay and sons Rhys and Ryan, got Chester when he was just a kitten.  Now they are determined to do what they can to help their pet lose some weight and be happier.  Lisa, who works in the family newsagent, added: \u0026ldquoHe\u0026rsquos getting older now and his weight will play on his joints if we don\u0026rsquot do something to help him. He can\u0026rsquot be comfortable carrying all that weight around and we want him to be happier and healthier as he ages.  Chester\u0026rsquos six-month Pet Fit Club diet and exercise programme will be specially tailored and overseen by the vets and nurses at Edinburgh PDSA Pet Hospital.  He is up against seven dogs, including a Cavalier King Charles spaniel who once ate a set of false teeth, a cat too fat to fit through the cat flap, and a rat who is double his ideal bodyweight.  If crowned the winner, Chester will receive a year\u0026rsquos supply of pet food, a pet-friendly holiday and a pet hamper.  Kathryn Marshall, PDSA Veterinary Care Assistant, will be helping to oversee Chester\u0026rsquos diet.  She said: \u0026ldquoWith the help of PDSA and Pet Fit Club, Lisa and Chester are making the necessary diet, exercise and lifestyle changes to help get Chester down to a healthier weight.  \u0026ldquoWe will support them every step of the way over the next six months to ensure they succeed."},{"url":null,"title":"Log found at Yellowcraig beach transformed into stunning violin","story":"              A VIOLIN maker has crafted a violin from driftwood found on an East Lothian beach to help raise awareness about the environment and the plight of the oceans.

Len Smith, 92, was conscripted at the age of 18 and was a supply lorry driver for the British Liberation Army.  He landed at Gold Beach, Normandy, where he said he was not shot at and saw little combat.  But he drove some of the first troops into Berlin in 1945 and moved supplies through a war-ravaged France, Belgium, Holland and Germany.  Despite his actions, modest Len, who went on to work in the civil service, said he had never thought of himself as veteran, never mind a hero.  He told the Courier: \u0026ldquoThere were thousands of young men like me. I never considered myself a veteran until the recent events marking the anniversary led to me looking back.  \u0026ldquoAt the time we just got on with it the real heroes are the soldiers who fought and died over there.  Mr Smith was one of eight children born in Pencaitland to local couple John and Euphemia Smith.  His sister Ellen, 97, still lives in Pencaitland and he visits the area regularly but after he was demobbed in 1947, Mr Smith moved to Longlevens, Gloucestershire, to find work.  Now a widower, Mr Smith\u0026rsquos sister sends him the Courier every week so he can keep up with local news.  His L\u0026eacutegion d\u0026rsquoHonneur medal was sent to his home in Cheltenham by post and contained a letter from Jean-Pierre Jouyet, French ambassador to the UK, which said: \u0026ldquoI offer you my warmest congratulations on this high honour, which recognises your military engagement and steadfast involvement in the liberation of France during the Second World War.  \u0026ldquoAs we contemplate this Europe of peace, we must never forget the heroes like you who came from Britain and the Commonwealth to begin the liberation of Europe by liberating France.  But Mr Smith insists he was just a young man doing a job.  He said: \u0026ldquoI didn\u0026rsquot know how the war was going, I didn\u0026rsquot read anything about the war. I was a young lad and I had no fear.  \u0026ldquoI just thought \u0026lsquoget on with it\u0026rsquo.  However, he remembers thinking about how worried his mother would be.  Len\u0026rsquos brothers James and Thomas were also in active service and James was in the D-Day landings. All three came home.

Education Scotland noted the following key improvements:  - The interim headteacher has provided effective leadership in taking forward work to secure improvements, including a review of the school values  - Staff have developed a range of policies to improve practice in equalities and inclusion, including a new safeguarding policy  - The recently created Pupil Support Faculty is now better placed to address the needs of young people, and those with social, emotional and behavioural needs in particular  - The school has made progress in establishing a more positive learning environment for all.  The report did note that there were still some improvements to be made.  Issues highlighted included using evidence from self-evaluation activities to ensure consistency in learning and teaching across the school reviewing the purpose of the pupil support base to ensure there was a greater focus on learning for the young people using it and ensuring there was a whole school approach to equalities and inclusion.  Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, praised staff at the school for their efforts.  She said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that Education Scotland acknowledges that Knox Academy has made important progress since the last inspection, and I would like to thank all the staff and pupils for their hard work and commitment in making these improvements.  \u0026ldquoIt is really encouraging that the positive relationships between pupils and teachers, and the fact that almost all young people recognise the value of learning in their lives, was noted.  \u0026ldquoThis is a strong basis for ensuring that the school continues to be a positive learning environment for staff and pupils alike.  And she added: \u0026ldquoWe will continue to work with the school and Education Scotland to make further improvements, and to working with Susan Cook, our new headteacher, who joins the school in August.  Education Scotland will continue to work with East Lothian Council regarding the school\u0026rsquos capacity to improve and will return to carry out another inspection within 18 months."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7898185.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Thousands oppose Dunbar town centre parking charge plans","story":"              MORE than 2,000 people have signed a petition against the idea of parking charges being introduced on Dunbar High Street.  A public consultation looking at potential parking solutions throughout East Lothian came to a close last month.  Meetings and workshops were held throughout the county by East Lothian Council, including one in Dunbar Royal British Legion.  A number of suggestions were put forward, including for a disc parking system where visitors to the busy street would set a disc showing when they had parked.  Another idea being explored is parking charges \u0026ndash but that has met with the opposition of Dunbar Trades\u0026rsquo Association (DTA).  Philip Mellor, DTA chairman, said that the group \u0026ldquostrongly oppose the introduction of parking charges.  A petition, which was put in various businesses in the town, has attracted more than 2,000 signatures.  Mr Mellor added: \u0026ldquoThe DTA feel introducing parking charges to High Street and other key off-street parking areas will have a detrimental effect on our High Street and the local economy.  \u0026ldquoThe current system since the introduction of traffic wardens has already addressed concerns around space for shoppers on High Street and it now seems counterintuitive to then introduce a measure which will drive more customers away to out-of-town developments.  \u0026ldquoWhilst parking during heavy summer visitor times can be difficult, it is very few special event days where parking is congested enough to even consider parking charges viable the majority of the time parking is available and this potential charge seems to be nothing more than a money-raising exercise at the expense yet again of already-struggling independent business owners.  A spokesman for East Lothian Council said \u0026ldquoall responses would be taken into consideration as it looked to develop a strategy.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe draft Local Transport Strategy (LTS) sets out ways in which the council can meet both national and local objectives sustainably, while supporting the local economy and environment.  \u0026ldquoOur consultation on the draft LTS recently closed and we are grateful to everyone who responded or attended one of our workshops. We are grateful for and value all responses, which will be taken into consideration as we look to agree a strategy which meets future needs in and around our communities."},{"url":null,"title":"Port Seton Lottery winner climbs Ben Nevis for highest champagne spray","story":"              LOTTERY millionaire John Edmond has undertaken a suitably large-scale celebration to mark the creation of the National Lottery\u0026rsquos 5,000th millionaire. . . by climbing Ben Nevis to conduct the UK\u0026rsquos highest Lottery champagne spray!  John, 35, from Port Seton, won \u0026pound1 million in the EuroMillions draw on June 26, 2015, but he remained in his job as a roofer, insisting he wanted to keep working.  He took on the challenge to climb more than 4,400 feet and faced treacherous weather conditions to mark the Lottery\u0026rsquos milestone and tick off a lifelong dream from his bucket list.  It comes as new research reveals that more than half of the millionaires are now spending more on experiences rather than possessions.  Looking at their shopping trends across time, out have gone designer watches, ride-on mowers, racehorses and conservatories, and in have come protecting woodlands, paying university fees and bar/games rooms.  John said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove always wanted to climb Ben Nevis so when the opportunity arose, I was up for the challenge.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not an avid hill walker, nor do I have much climbing experience, so I was a bit nervous as I knew I would have my work cut out \u0026ndash but excited to be part of this once-in-a-lifetime celebration.  \u0026ldquoScotland was looking glorious in the sunshine when we initially left ground level however, the conditions quickly changed as we reached the halfway mark \u0026ndash typical Scottish weather!  \u0026ldquoVisibility was poor, I couldn\u0026rsquot see two or three feet in front of me, and the wind speeds were averaging 40mph.  \u0026ldquoThe heavy snow on the ground made it more challenging \u0026ndash but to me, it was all part of the adventure.  \u0026ldquoWith tough climbing, there were moments I was unsure if I was going to make it to the top, so I can\u0026rsquot put into words how I felt when I finally reached the summit.  \u0026ldquoTo know I was standing on the UK\u0026rsquos highest peak was an unbelievable achievement, made all the better with a chilled glass of champagne in my hand.  \u0026ldquoI was honoured that the National Lottery asked me to participate in this opportunity out of all the millionaires in Scotland \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos certainly one I will never forget.

East Lothian Council intends to create a new primary school, operating from the existing school buildings, which will cover nursery through to primary seven. The proposal was approved by East Lothian Council in April after a public consultation. It has now also been approved by the Scottish Government.  Combined, the two schools currently have a school roll of about 700 pupils. However, it remains unclear who the new headteacher for the primary school, which is yet to be named, will be.  Current headteacher Seonaid McGillivray is set to be appointed at another as yet unnamed school in the county, with the final details expected to be tied up within a matter of days.  Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, said: \u0026ldquoWe believe that the decision to establish one new primary school, operating under a single management structure, offers the best solution to not only developing a stronger and more cohesive curriculum, but that local children will benefit from improved progression planning and transition as they progress from infant to upper stage.  \u0026ldquoOur education service will work closely with our current headteacher Mrs McGillivray, and the chairs of both parent councils, to recruit a headteacher for the newly established school.

Five retail units are planned for a site at Gateside previously earmarked for a Sainsbury\u0026rsquos supermarket and petrol station.  The site, which totals about 60,000 sq ft, could be made up of units ranging from 7,500 sq ft to 20,000 sq ft in size.  Alastair Dickie, development director with Ediston Real Estates, which now owns the site, attended the town\u0026rsquos community council meeting on Tuesday, one week before plans are unveiled to the public.  He told members the proposal was for the site to include three food retailers, with the other two units including \u0026ldquoa household-type retail business and a coffee drive-through facility.  However, he was keeping tight-lipped on the identity of the businesses until legal agreements were in place.  Mr Dickie hoped planning permission for the site, off Oak Tree Roundabout west of Haddington, could be achieved by the end of the year.  He said: \u0026ldquoIf we submit an application in August, we would hope. . . we would hopefully have a consent in December or January next year.  \u0026ldquoWe could be on site quarter one of 2019.  It is then hoped that the retailers could be trading in the lead-up to Christmas that year or early in 2020.  The development, which has been described as \u0026ldquoEast Lothian\u0026rsquos first retail park, will involve in the region of \u0026pound14 million investment, with 150 jobs potentially created, as well as those during the construction process.  It has already been revealed that talks are ongoing with \u0026ldquoa number of major retailers who will be new to East Lothian.  Concerns have been expressed by a number of retailers in the town centre that the creation of a retail park on the outskirts would be detrimental to their business.  But Mr Dickie, who previously lived in the town and continues to stay in the county, was hopeful the additional retailers would encourage people to remain in the area rather than heading further afield to retail parks in Edinburgh.  The proposals are on display to the public from 2pm to 7pm on Tuesday at the John Gray Centre.  The developer is also continuing to make progress at a second Haddington site for retail development \u0026ndashat Harperdean, between the A1 and the A199, east of Aberlady Road.

The new scheme offers people an opportunity to support Our Community Energy \u0026ndash a partnership between not-for-profit Scottish firm Our Power and Mongoose Energy, which manages community energy assets \u0026ndash and hopes to find investors in the county.  They say that the site at Pogbie Windfarm \u0026ndash already home to the turbines \u0026ndash will create enough energy to power 7,200 homes and believe that, when they combine it with a second site in Berwickshire, the scheme will raise an estimated \u0026pound1.9 million in surplus profit over 25 years.  Our Power said that profit from the wind turbines it takes over would then be used to keep energy prices down, helping people who are struggling with the costs.  They need to raise just over \u0026pound3 million for the project, which covers both sites, and community groups and individuals are being invited to invest in bonds and shares to raise the money needed to get the project up and running, with investments ranging from \u0026pound500 to \u0026pound100,000.  Andrew Smith, Our Community Energy acting chairperson, said: \u0026ldquoFuel poverty is a huge issue for Scotland and we\u0026rsquore proud to be launching such an important fundraising opportunity to directly tackle it.  \u0026ldquoInvesting with a social purpose is something close to the hearts of many Scots, and these bond and equity offers provide the chance to have a huge impact locally.  \u0026ldquoThese offers aim to support those who struggle to afford sufficiently heated homes, as well as providing investors with an exciting new option which not only targets a significant social impact but a positive environmental one too.  \u0026ldquoHowever with these types of investments there are some risks and funds are not readily realisable.  \u0026ldquoInvestors should note that capital is at risk and returns are not guaranteed.  A fuel poor household is defined as one which needs to spend more than 10 per cent of its income on all fuel use and to heat its home to an adequate standard of warmth.  Last year, the East Lothian Poverty Commission found that almost half of local pensioners were forced to spend more than 10 per cent of their income on energy bills.  Mark Kenber, CEO of Mongoose Energy, added: \u0026ldquoWith the majority of Scots recognising the critical level that fuel poverty has reached, it is now more important than ever for investors to put their money into causes that work for the social good, not just their own.  \u0026ldquoOur Community Energy not only gives investors the potential to earn competitive interest rates on their money, but also the opportunity to support the wider Scottish community.

A pressure group called \u0026lsquoBowls for Gullane\u0026rsquo was established on Facebook in the wake of concerns that the village\u0026rsquos bowling club \u0026ndash with a membership of only about 30 \u0026ndash was to be sold to developers.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay, ward member and former chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoAll three ward councillors are behind the campaign to save the club and we hope that the members understand the feeling in the village.  \u0026ldquoI understand that the committee own the club and it would be the members who benefit from any potential sale.  About 50 residents gathered outside the bowling club on Monday evening to show their displeasure at the possible loss of the club.  The group told the Courier they had had hundreds of offers of support.  Catherine MacKenzie said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove had people phone up, email and text us \u0026ndash and face-to-face \u0026ndash to tell us that they\u0026rsquore willing to become a member.  \u0026ldquoSome of them don\u0026rsquot live locally, or won\u0026rsquot be able to bowl, but they are willing to pay the membership fees.

Gordon McLelland, a local resident and member of the community council, added: \u0026ldquoThe community council want to save the club for the community.  \u0026ldquoWe have tried hard to offer the club our support to work with them but so far they have turned that down.  Billy Mellors, the county\u0026rsquos bowls development officer, said: \u0026ldquoThe overwhelming support from the local community indicates to me the future of Gullane Bowling Club can be sustained if the current members accept it.  Many locals have tried to sign up as members but have been turned away by the club, it has been claimed.  Another member of the group said: \u0026ldquoWhat has shocked us as a group is how many people have been refused membership in recent years \u0026ndash young and old have come forward with their personal experience of being turned away.  Mr Mellors added: \u0026ldquoTime will tell on the way the club want to go but we all hope a common sense approach is taken to preserve this community facility.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray met representatives of the Bowls for Gullane group last week and is keen to find a solution to ensure the club\u0026rsquos survival.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis is an unfortunate situation Gullane has lost too many local assets recently, so every effort should be made to avoid losing another. I did meet with representatives of the campaign and have said that I will support them in trying to find a way the land, and preferably bowling too, can remain part of the village community.  Ian McMillan, CEO of Bowls Scotland, said that he was \u0026ldquodelighted to see local residents lend their support to the campaign to save the 116-year-old club.  He added: \u0026ldquoI would encourage all in the village to support their historic club, get on the green, enjoy the great game of bowls and ensure future generations can benefit from the opportunity to play an accessible, inclusive sport. Bowls Scotland fully supports the work being undertaken to keep bowls an important part of Gullane\u0026rsquos community fabric.

In April, Mr Baxter told us: \u0026ldquoThere are not enough members to support the running of the club.  He had said then that the club was \u0026ldquotrying to find a solution but that it was not viable to continue with a dwindling membership.

Colin Beattie stressed that \u0026ldquoradical thinking needed to be done to create a solution, highlighting a possible extension of a tram or light rail system out to Musselburgh.  During a recent Holyrood debate, he said: \u0026ldquoPeople meet the queues of traffic heading on to the bypass on the main roads around my constituency before they are even near the bypass. This causes more congestion and more air pollution.  Mr Beattie later said: \u0026ldquoYou can go along the road at any time of the day and there are queues of traffic, mainly at Sheriffhall Roundabout.  \u0026ldquoIt is important that when the Government are looking at all the possible changes required to the bypass, all options are considered. The main priority should be that it is cost-efficient and done as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoIt may be that it is more economic to extend a tram or light rail system out to the main population centres such as Musselburgh than to take on the eye-watering cost of enlarging the A720. This would also benefit the environment and be much faster than using road transport.  \u0026ldquoClearly more radical thinking needs to be done on creating a sustainable solution. I am not convinced that simply replicating a system which moves traffic speedily and efficiently into new choke points is the answer.  Miles Briggs, Lothian region MSP who led the Parliamentary debate, said: \u0026ldquoThe transport information company Inrix in late 2016 identified the bypass as the most congested trunk road outside London, with four of the UK\u0026rsquos worst bottlenecks.  \u0026ldquoI continue to be contacted by frustrated constituents and businesspeople who face frequent delays when using the bypass to commute or transport goods, especially but not exclusively at peak times or when there is an accident on the route. Many drivers tell me their experience is that these tailbacks and traffic jams are becoming more and more regular.  He said that while proposed work at Sheriffhall would be an important improvement, he added: \u0026ldquoIt is only one part of what needs to be a far broader, long-term and coordinated programme of improvements to the bypass which will ensure traffic can keep moving in the decades ahead.  \u0026ldquoThis means looking at innovative solutions, assessing whether extra lanes will be needed, looking at the possible use of hard shoulders in some situations and utilising technology so the bypass can become a smart motorway.  Mr Briggs called on the Scottish Government to take forward a feasibility study into widening the city bypass and new options to address the growing congestion.  A Transport Scotland spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal includes investment of up to \u0026pound120m in the A720 city bypass for the grade separation of Sheriffhall Roundabout and \u0026pound20 million investment in public transport infrastructure in west Edinburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis investment will improve journey reliability and safety for all users and support significant planned investment in Edinburgh and South East Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government remains committed to undertaking the improvements at the Sheriffhall junction at the earliest opportunity. We are continuing to progress the detailed design development and assessment of the preferred option and expect to publish draft orders in 2019."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7930076.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Haddington pub seeking new owners","story":"              A TOWN centre pub which changed its name less than a year ago is on the lookout for new people to run it.

Persimmon Homes is hoping to get the go-ahead \u0026ldquoin principle from East Lothian Council for the mixed-use development, which includes a commercial hub with hotel, retail facilities and cafe/restaurant.  Community facilities such as a residential neighbourhood centre, playing fields, changing facilities and public parks are proposed.  Also planned is the construction of a grade-separated junction on the A1, roads and foot/cycle paths, as well as improvement to the Musselburgh rail halt.  Submission of the planning application in principle follows a Proposal of Application Notice and public consultation exercise for the major scheme, which included an exhibition on the draft masterplan at The Brunton last year.  A planning statement from Holder Planning, acting for Persimmon, read: \u0026ldquoThe application site is allocated for the mixed use development proposed in the soon-to-be adopted East Lothian Local Development Plan.  \u0026ldquoThe proposed development will deliver 1,500 homes across the site. These homes will comprise a range of housing types. Twenty-five per cent of the housing provision will be affordable as defined by the council.  \u0026ldquoA primary school is proposed that will accommodate the requirements arising from residential development on the wider site. It is located centrally in the application site within walking distance of new homes via a network of paths that offer safe and convenient links. The detailed design will be in accordance with the requirements of the education authority, East Lothian Council.  \u0026ldquoThe masterplan proposes enhancing a pedestrian link under the A1 that will link the site areas together, allowing new neighbourhoods and services to the west, identified in the wider masterplan, to gain access to Musselburgh Station and services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThe proposal incorporates a significant network of multi-functional open spaces and semi-natural landscape areas, including allotments/community growing space, natural play areas, sports pitches and outdoor gym facilities, and seating. This framework of green space will contribute to the legibility of the neighbourhood\u0026rsquos spatial pattern, establishing distinct areas of new housing linked together via a network of green foot and cycle routes.  A new research and innovation quarter for East Lothian offering more than 20 hectares of new commercial space is proposed.  The planning statement added: \u0026ldquoWith strong links to the adjacent Queen Margaret University, the site offers the potential to build upon the reputation of Edinburgh and the Lothians for its research and innovation.  Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, said: \u0026ldquoThe issue at Craighall is that major development here will be very close to major development in Edinburgh at Newcraighall and in Midlothian at Shawfair, turning the whole area into a cross-boundary urban sprawl and effectively an extension to Edinburgh\u0026rsquos built-up area.  Predicting that the plan for 1,500 houses would be approved, given that was the number in the Local Development Plan, he added: \u0026ldquoAll that we can hope for is that conditions will be put in place to make this amount of housing as acceptable as possible in terms of layout, design, amenities and access to walking and cycling routes and to public transport.  \u0026ldquoOf note is that the secondary-age children here will have to get to Musselburgh Grammar School, which is some distance away and not an easy walk, certainly not from the other side of the A1.  \u0026ldquoThe recently promoted Active Travel Network shows no cycle link to Musselburgh Grammar School. We are worried about the prospect of increased car usage to get kids to and from school thus adding to the gradually worsening traffic problems in the town.  Jim Kirkpatrick, managing director of Persimmon Homes East Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoWe have had extensive engagement with East Lothian Council and the local community prior to the application being lodged and have generally been encouraged by the positive response to our masterplan.  \u0026ldquoThe comments of Musselburgh Conservation Society are noted and we believe the issues raised are addressed in the suite of information provided to the council.  \u0026ldquoThe application is fully compliant with the proposals contained within the emerging East Lothian Local Development Plan and we look forward to working with officers and other stakeholders during the determination process."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7868119.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"12 new rules the council is making over selfish parking in Musselburgh","story":"              A RAFT of traffic restrictions are to be introduced in Musselburgh to control inconsiderate parking.

Ivan Duque captured almost 54% of the vote, putting him 12 points ahead of former leftist guerrilla Gustavo Petro in a tense run-off election that had appeared to be tightening in recent days.  In the end, the 41-year-old sailed to victory, promising to change parts of the accord with leftist rebels but not \u0026ldquoshred it to pieces as some of his hawkish allies had been urging.  When he takes office in August, he will be Colombia\u0026rsquos youngest president in more than a century.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove come here to fulfil a dream, Mr Duque said outside his polling centre.  \u0026ldquoFor Colombia to be governed by a new generation, one that wants to govern for all and with. One that unites the country and turns the page on corruption.  The new president will inherit a country still scarred by five decades of bloody armed conflict and grappling with soaring cocaine production.  In his victory speech, he said: \u0026ldquoThe peace we all dream of demands corrections. So that victims are the true centre of the process and so that there is justice, reparations and no repetition.  Former guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia are struggling to reinsert themselves in civilian life in a nation where many people remain hesitant to forgive.  Vast swaths of remote territory remain under the control of violent drug mafias and residual rebel bands.  \u0026ldquoUndoubtedly, for the peace process, this is an important test, said Patricia Munoz, a professor of political science at the Pontifical Xavierian University in Bogota.  It was the first presidential election since the signing of the peace agreement ending Latin America\u0026rsquos longest-running conflict and was as much about the accord as it was deeply entrenched issues such as corruption and inequality.  Mr Petro galvanised young voters and drew millions to public plazas with his fiery speeches vowing to improve the lives of poor, disenfranchised Colombians.  Though he failed to catch Mr Duque, his more than eight million votes marked the biggest ballot box success for a leftist presidential contender in a country where leftist politicos were stigmatised over fears of potential ties to guerrilla causes.  He took his loss in stride, refusing to call it a defeat and saying that \u0026ldquofor now he and his supporters will not form a government \u0026mdash echoing the words used by socialist revolutionary Hugo Chavez following his failed 1992 coup against Venezuela\u0026rsquos government.  Six years later Mr Chavez was elected president, setting the stage for a surge of the left throughout Latin America.  \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot think there is a single Colombian who thinks things are going well today, Mr Petro said after casting his ballot with his young daughter in hand.  Colombia\u0026rsquos peace process to end a conflict that left more than 250,000 people dead is considered largely irreversible.  Most of the more than 7,000 rebels who have surrendered their weapons have started new lives as farmers, community leaders and journalists.  Last year the rebels launched a new political party and will soon occupy 10 seats in congress.  But the 2016 accord remains contentious and Mr Duque pledged throughout his campaign to make changes that would deliver \u0026ldquopeace with justice.  Through constitutional reform or by decree, he could proceed with proposals such as not allowing ex-combatants behind grave human rights abuses to take political office until they have confessed their war crimes and compensated victims.  The current agreement allows most rebels to avoid jail, a sore point for many. But Mr Duque\u0026rsquos detractors warn that his victory could throw an already delicate peace process into disarray.  Mr Duque is the son of a former governor and energy minister who friends say has harboured presidential aspirations since he was a child.  The father of three ago entered public service almost two decades as an adviser to then finance minister Juan Manuel Santos, who he will now replace as president.  Mr Duque later moved to Washington, where he spent more than a decade at the Inter-American Development Bank, first as an adviser for three Andean countries and later as chief of the institution\u0026rsquos cultural division.  It was during that time that Mr Duque forged a close relationship with former president Alvaro Uribe, the torchbearer of conservatives who is both adored and detested by legions of Colombians.  Mr Duque\u0026rsquos low-profile life as a Washington suburbanite came to end in 2014, when with Mr Uribe\u0026rsquos backing he was elected to Colombia\u0026rsquos Senate.  Seated beside his mentor in the opulent Senate chamber, Mr Duque earned a reputation as a like-minded security hawk who did his homework and earned the respect of colleagues across the political spectrum.  He quickly climbed the ranks of Uribe\u0026rsquos Democratic Center party, clenching the group\u0026rsquos presidential nomination just four years later."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7937388.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"David Dimbleby to leave Question Time after 25 years","story":"              David Dimbleby is to leave Question Time after 25 years of presenting the BBC show.

Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard MSP last week met East Lothian Labour Party campaigners at Holyrood as they delivered a petition signed by more than 1,000 people to Kevin Stewart MSP.  While Councillor Lachlan Bruce, ward member for Preston, Seton, Gosford was joined by South of Scotland MSP Michelle Ballantyne, both Conservative, as they sent letters to Mr Stewart calling for the same action (see image inset).  The campaign comes after the minister called in a planning application by Inch Cape Offshore Ltd (ICOL) to build a substation \u0026ndash which would bring energy ashore from a planned offshore wind farm \u0026ndash on a large section of the site, which was recently purchased by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower.  That sparked cross-party condemnation from county politicians, who fear it could jeopardise local plans to create jobs and boost the economy on the site.  Mr Leonard added his signature to the Hands Off Cockenzie petition before it was submitted.  Iain Gray (Lab), East Lothian MSP said: \u0026ldquoMinisters claim the call-in is because the site is of national importance, but even the leader of the SNP Group on East Lothian Council has condemned the decision as unnecessary.  \u0026ldquoBy signing our petition in such large numbers, local people have sent a clear message they want East Lothian to decide on decisions about the future of the site.  Meanwhile, Mr Bruce said he had asked Mr Stewart to send the decision back to the council. He said: \u0026ldquoI think it is only right that this decision is made locally by the council on behalf of local residents.

Painted on a 60ft by 40ft wall overlooking the city\u0027s Clutha bar, it features a portrait of Mackintosh looking through a stained-glass window.  The street art was commissioned by Radisson RED and designed and created by Art Pistol Projects and well-known Glasgow street artist Rogue-one as a gift to the city.  As part of the project, Radisson RED has donated \u0026pound1,000 to The Clutha Trust, the charity set up after 10 people died when a police helicopter crashed onto the roof of the pub in November 2013.  Michael Weston, curator at Radisson RED hotel in Glasgow, said: \"After opening our doors in April, we wanted to give something that showed our commitment to the local art scene as well as the city of Glasgow itself.  \"It was important to us that the mural represented a key piece of Glasgow\u0027s history, so commissioning a mural of one of the city\u0027s most iconic artists, Charles Rennie Mackintosh, was perfect.  \"It is a fitting tribute to one of Glasgow\u0027s greatest talents in his 150th anniversary year - and I\u0027d encourage everyone to come see it.\"  Born on June 7 1868, Mackintosh trained as an architect and went on to create much-admired buildings including the Glasgow School of Art and Scotland Street School in Glasgow.  The mural was given the go-ahead following a planning row after an objection from a neighbouring business.  Alan Crossan, owner of the Clutha bar, said: \"This mural is a fantastic piece of artwork and a fantastic donation to the Clutha Trust.\"  Bobby McNamara, known as Rogue-one, is renowned for his photo-realistic style and is behind a number of artworks in Glasgow, including Mitchell Street\u0027s floating taxi.  Mr McNamara said: \"From the original design sketch to the completion of the mural, it\u0027s been hard work but of course great fun.  \"Using scaffolding to access the wall was awkward at times as it\u0027s hard to see what you\u0027re doing, but I pushed on utilising my skills and experience. In the end I think I achieved something special.\"  Ali Smith, founder of Art Pistol Projects, said: \"Mackintosh is a bit of a global superstar so we had to get this one right.  \"Stepping away from the wall now it really feels like a special one, a just portrayal of such an iconic and well-loved figure.  \"Everyone that\u0027s been involved deserves a big thanks.\""},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7936576.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Singing for England  Musician   s rallying call for Scotland to get behind their old rivals in World Cup","story":"              A SCOTTISH musician has issued a rallying call for his countrymen to get behind their old rivals in the World Cup.

That works in reverse order too obviously.  \"I\u0027ve done this with a humble heart, trying to support our fellow islanders.  \"The cultural and economic links between Scotland and England couldn\u0027t be deeper.  \"To the tiny minority of Scots who get spiteful about the English football team, I\u0027d say go and have a chat with the whisky distilleries up north and ask them how they\u0027d feel if they lost their English customer base.\"  The singer-songwriter won a BAFTA for his music in the thriller film Killer.

But Sir Brian Souter, who has also ploughed in part of his fortune to the SNP, has taken aim at his fellow millionaires.  At a prayer breakfast earlier this month, the transport tycoon said the most \u0026ldquonarcissistic and \u0026ldquoself-obsessed people he had met were rich.  He added that wealthy people are in need of \u0026ldquotransformation in their lives just as much as heroin addicts.  Souter and his sister Ann Gloag made their money by founding Scottish-based bus company Stagecoach, which also owns coach operator Megabus and South West Trains.  Stagecoach serves around 2.5 million passengers a day and the transport giant also operates in North America. Souter and Gloag were said to be worth \u0026pound920 million, although it was reported last year that the siblings had split their wealth in order to follow \"different investment strategies\".  Souter is also known for his charitable giving via his family trust, which has awarded more than \u0026pound32 million over the last three years.  An evangelical Christian who is linked to the Church of the Nazarene, the tycoon\u0026rsquos charity is interested in projects that relieve human suffering and promote spiritual welfare.  Souter recently fronted an event in Edinburgh at which he promoted the theory of \u0026ldquotransformation, which in Christianity focuses on changing individual lives.  He interviewed a former heroin addict, Alfie McCracken, who told of how he used to be homeless and had considered taking his own life.  In conversation with Souter, McCracken said his life changed after he visited a church in Largs and was \u0026ldquosmothered in love. He said he found Jesus and stopped using drugs.  Souter then made a speech in which he said \u0026ldquorules and \u0026ldquorole models are not enough to transform lives, a process that also requires a \u0026ldquoredeemer.  He claimed McCracken had found his redeemer: \u0026ldquoWhen he [Alfie] had an encounter with Jesus Christ, transformation happened in his life. When a supernatural power, greater than his own, was able to deliver him from the addiction of heroin.  However, he added that other individuals did not feel their own lives required the same change: \u0026ldquoI meet a lot of wealthy people in my walk of life, and let me tell you, they need transformation just as much as Alfie.  Souter added: \u0026ldquoThe most narcissistic, self-obsessed people I have met have had a lot of money, and I don\u0026rsquot find that amongst the homeless. The truth is we all need transformation.  The tycoon\u0027s political donations have attracted more attention than his charitable giving. Souter has donated over \u0026pound2m to the SNP and pro-independence causes, including sizeable pre-election donations.  He also spent over \u0026pound1 million in 2000 bankrolling a private referendum opposing Government plans to repeal anti-gay rights legislation. His high-profile campaign was widely criticised by MSPs, who believed he was hijacking democracy in a bid to keep a discriminatory law.  Christian Wolmer, who wrote a book in the 1990s which charted the rise of Stagecoach, said of Souter\u0026rsquos remarks:  \u0026ldquoI am glad that Brian is prepared to be critical of some of his fellow millionaires but it is a mistake to think that only religion offers solutions. If the rich paid taxes commensurate with their income and their wealth, then there would be sufficient money in the public services to ensure that there would be fewer people like Alfie who find themselves in bad situations.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe rich need to develop a social conscience, recognise the problem of inequality and be prepared to put back into society what they have gained from it. To be fair, I do recognise that Brian does that."},{"url":null,"title":"How did we determine the weather pre-digital age ","story":"              THERE\u0027S a storm coming. I can feel it in my throbbing temples and in the oppressive, muggy heat that\u0027s been building all day. I also know from this morning\u0027s radio forecast that thundery showers are expected by nightfall but having just read a book that claims humans don\u0027t need professional meteorologists to predict the weather, I have switched off all my gadgets and determined to study the world around me for clues as to when the storm will break.  This, after all, is what our ancestors did. \u0026ldquoIn the past, writes Peter Wohlleben in The Weather Detective, \u0026ldquoit was vital that everyone could recognise and interpret these signs. People were dependent on nature and intimately familiar with it.  So highly attuned were they to nature\u0027s sights, scents and sounds that in the centuries before barometers, clocks and digital calendars, humans used those signals not only to predict the weather but to establish the time of day and season of the year.  These days, most of the UK population is urban and even here in Scotland, where 98 per cent of the landmass is rural, only 20 per cent of us live in the countryside. But if we think our ancient bond with the natural world no longer matters we are dangerously deluded, argues Wohlleben, a German forester whose last book, The Hidden Life Of Trees, was an international bestseller. \u0026ldquoIn the face of climate change and damage to the environment, he argues, \u0026ldquoit is more urgent than ever that we recognise and understand the signs of nature. Only then will we appreciate what we stand to lose.  With those ominous words ringing in my ears, I step out through my front door and prepare to tune in to those elemental messages, but instead find myself negotiating a sensory assault course of traffic noise, reeking dustbins and ugly building sites.  Once inside the fecund haven of my nearest park, however, I sit on the grass and look heavenwards as our great, great, great grandparents would routinely have done before deciding whether this was a good day to sow their oats or bring in the sheep, cast their nets or batten down the hatches. Their existential dread of spoiled harvests and shipwreck was written into folklore and Met Office research conducted last summer suggests 75 per cent of us still set store by those old proverbs, particularly the one about a red sky at night foretelling shepherd\u0027s (or sailor\u0027s) delight, which 70 per cent of us believe. And apparently we are not far wrong, since that nocturnal rosy glow is caused by the high pressure associated with good weather. \u0026ldquoHigh pressure traps dust and dirt in the air, which scatters blue light, only leaving the red remaining \u0026ndash hence the reddish appearance of the sky, explains the Met Office website.  A red sky in the morning, meanwhile, actually does act as a reliable shepherd\u0027s (or sailor\u0027s) warning since, as Wohlleben explains, \u0026ldquothe sun rises in the east, where the sky is clear, and shines onto the clouds gathering in the west, which will rapidly spread and fill the sky.  Useful as it may be, that old adage is no help to me now in the middle of a sultry afternoon so I decide to examine the clouds themselves, which people seem always to have known were linked to weather even if they didn\u0027t understand the scientific reasons. In Greek mythology, clouds were nymphs who gathered river water in cloudy pitchers before ascending to the sky where they floated around in billowing robes, emptying the contents over the earth. Ancient Hindu tradition construed clouds as heavenly white elephants, which used their trunks to shower rainwater over the land below. And for the Native American Navajo people, clouds were formed by the flapping wings of a great white swan.  As we now know, of course, the more prosaic explanation is that low pressure causes water vapour to condense into droplets or ice crystals. Thinner cloud lets more light through and so appears white. \u0026ldquoIf you see tall, towering clouds on the horizon, it means rain (or snow) is likely soon, writes Wohlleben. \u0026ldquoIf they seem to puff out at the top, or form an anvil shape (where the cloud tower is being pulled apart at the top), then a thunderstorm is on the way.  Right now, there is no discernable shape to the cloud, which is lightish grey but so widely dispersed across the sky that although I can hear the drone of an aircraft overhead, I can\u0027t see it and nor can I tell whether it has left one of those lingering condensation trails which Wohlleben says act as \u0026ldquoearly harbingers, of bad weather since if they don\u0027t dissolve, \u0026ldquothat means humidity is on its way, and with it a low-pressure area. The sky will soon cloud over.  Clearly, we have passed that milepost so I lower my gaze and look around for earthly omens. With no cattle around, I can\u0027t test the old trope about cows lying down before a cloudburst (which is nonsense anyway, according to the Met Office, even if 61 per cent of us believe in it), so I look for botanical soothsayers in the form of daisies. \u0026ldquoOne glance at the white and yellow flowers is enough to tell if you should hang your laundry out, writes Wohlleben. \u0026ldquoIf rain is on the way, or a storm, the petals close up. Some also droop downwards, to avoid letting a single drop in.  Evidently, the daisies in this Glasgow park are rebellious little flowers, for despite the fact that the sky has darkened and I can actually hear the rumble of distant thunder, their petals are defiantly open. So I search instead for some dandelions, having heard that the seeding heads shut up like umbrellas when bad weather is approaching. And Eureka! I find a clump of elderly dandelions with one fully formed clock and three of those feathery heads, all tightly furled like little green and white brollies.  And now I close my eyes and listen for the sound of silence. We all know calm is supposed to precede a storm, and it\u0027s generally thought that birds go quiet beforehand. And if evidence for this is hard to come by, they are known to be extremely sensitive to small changes in atmospheric pressure and to time their migratory flights accordingly. A 2014 study by the University of California found that golden-winged warblers took a substantial detour from their usual migration route to avoid ferocious tornadoes which killed 35 people.  Our feathered friends feature prominently in weather lore. \u0026ldquoHawks flying high means a clear sky, runs the old rhyme. \u0026ldquoWhen they fly low, prepare for a blow. Seabirds flying inland and solo-flying crows are also supposed to presage foul weather, while birds singing in the rain reputedly do so before a change for the better.  More pertinently for today\u0027s purposes, low-flying swallows are meant to warn us that storms are approaching but Wohlleben casts doubt on this theory, arguing that \u0026ldquoif anything, it\u0027s the other way around: as the wind picks up before a storm, swallows are likely to fly higher than usual. The saying \u0027when swallows fly high, the weather will be dry\u0027 could well lead you astray.  He says chaffinches are better barometers, apparently modifying their song when the weather is set to turn. When the sun is shining, he writes,\u0026ldquothe males usually trill a melody that sounds a little like \u0027chi-chip-chirichirichiri-chip-cheweeoo\u0027. If storm clouds loom or rain falls, however, he switches to a monosyllabic \u0027raaatch\u0027.  Sadly, I couldn\u0027t tell a chaffinch\u0027s cry from a sparrow\u0027s, which is probably symptomatic of how detached I am from the natural signals with which my great-great-great-etc-grandmother would have been intimately familiar. The Weather Detective contains fascinating, if depressing, insights into the way our urban lifestyles are shattering our ties with nature \u0026ndash not least through light pollution, which is obliterating the nocturnal star-shows that once guided our ancestors\u0027 footsteps. Meanwhile, moths, which mistake artificial lights for the moon by which they orientate their flight paths, find themselves hopelessly circumnavigating those electrical orbs until they die of exhaustion. (Bats, apparently, have learned to profit from their confusion, by patrolling street lights on warm summer nights, where they feast on disorientated moths.)  Here in the park, it\u0027s still broad daylight and in fact, the clouds have lightened to a greyish white. The thunder appears to have passed overhead and only a few splashes of rain have fallen. Perhaps those daisies were better informed than the dandelions after all. And indeed even my troubled bones \u0026ndash or rather, the headache that\u0027s been nagging since morning \u0026ndash has miraculously cleared with the storm clouds.  For as Wohlleben confirms, your granny is not necessarily havering about the rheumatic twinges or other physical symptoms that supposedly presage a change in the weather, since humans \u0026ndash like other animals \u0026ndash are hardwired to detect the shifts in air pressure that determine meteorological variations. Why some people are more sensitive than others to their inbuilt barometer is unclear, though Wohlleben surmises that it could be linked to changes in the conductivity of our cell membranes, which can become more sensitive as a result of certain medical conditions.  Whatever the cause, in the days before central heating and ready-meals, paying attention to those physiological indicators, and to their surroundings, would have been second nature to our ancestors.  Today, we are increasingly alienated from the natural world. In 2005, American author Richard Louv coined the term \u0026ldquonature deficit disorder to describe the harm we are doing to our children by robbing them of the opportunity to run, play and climb trees in the great outdoors. Even the language of childhood is changing. In 2015, prominent authors such as Margaret Atwood and Michael Morpurgo expressed \u0026ldquoprofound alarm at the Oxford University Press\u0027s decision to drop words such as \u0026ldquobuttercup and \u0026ldquominnows from its children\u0027s dictionaries, in favour of terms such as \u0026ldquobroadband and \u0026ldquocut-and-paste.  So does Wohlleben want us to throw away our smartphones? Apparently not. \u0026ldquoI\u0027m not advocating a return to our roots or a rejection of modern life, he insists. \u0026ldquoWhat I\u0027m really interested in is reclaiming our sensitivity to nature and reawakening our powers of observation. When we use our senses at full capacity, we access the wealth of thrilling and calming experiences waiting for us just outside our back doors, in nature and in our gardens. He urges us to train our sense of hearing, by attending to nature\u0027s noises. \u0026ldquoFind out what your own favourite garden sound is: perhaps it\u0027s the song of a blackbird at dusk, the rustle of a hedgehog under a hedge or the brisk buzz of a bumblebee in the shrubs. There are so many amazing things to hear out there beyond the everyday tumult of cars and planes.  Here in this city park, the rumble of cars and planes remains audible through the trees but so does the chirrup of birds (which may or may not be chaffinches) and the rustle of something that just might be a hedgehog.  The storm clouds, meanwhile, have all but disappeared. And I\u0027m sure I can smell sunshine.  The Weather Detective: Rediscovering Nature\u0027s Signs by Peter Wohlleben is published by Rider, \u0026pound12.99  PREDICTING THE SEASONS  Does a bumper summer crop of nuts, berries and fruits mean a hard winter is coming? Not necessarily. \u0026ldquoSadly, we can\u0027t predict the future from a bountiful crop, writes Peter Wohlleben. \u0026ldquoAfter all, the fruit buds are produced the previous summer. If it indicates anything, an abundance of acorns and beechnuts in the forests suggests \u0026hellip a dry summer the previous year.  Can snowmen sense the coming of spring? Astonishingly, yes \u0026hellip though only in the sense that if you can manage to build one, it means the snow itself is of the right consistency to be rolled into balls. And since this happens when temperatures are comparatively mild, it could mean that a long, hard spell is coming to an end.  Do pine cones act as weather stations? Sort of. \u0026ldquoThey open up in sunny, dry weather making a big puffy cone, while in rainy weather they close up making the cone smaller and narrower, explains Wohlleben. \u0026ldquoHowever, since the change lags behind the weather \u0026hellip they are completely useless as a forecasting instrument.  HOW TO TELL THE TIME BY NATURE\u0027S CLOCK  You can set your watch by flowers, many of which open at different times of day. \u0026ldquoPumpkins and courgettes kick things off first by opening their flowers at 5 o\u0027clock in the morning, writes Peter Wohlleben in The Weather Detective. \u0026ldquoFrom 8am the marigolds spread out their petals and the daisies follow at 9.  Meanwhile, birdsong can help tell us the early morning time but only if your ears are attuned to the melodies of particular birds, since the various species vary their peak dawn chorus moment, in order to ensure their territorial and mating calls aren\u0027t drowned out by others.  On the RSPB\u0027s website, Jenny Shelton offers this evocative chronology of the UK\u0027s dawn chorus, which she says peaks in the half-hour before and after sunrise: \u0026ldquoRobins, blackbirds and song thrushes begin, then the wrens and warblers join in. Finally, come the chaffinches, goldfinches and sparrows. It\u0027s thought that, because this last group have smaller eyes, they need more light to find food.  WHY DOES MIDSUMMER\u0027S DAY FALL AT THE BEGINNING OF SUMMER?  On Midsummer\u0027s Day, June 21, the sun is at its peak in the sky. \u0026ldquoThe reason why summer only truly begins after this peak, writes Peter Wohlleben, \u0026ldquois that the sun needs several weeks to heat up the air. This means the temperature increase lags a little behind the sun\u0027s height in the sky, and the air temperature only reaches its maximum later in the season when the days are already getting shorter again."},{"url":null,"title":"Alex Salmond says he urged Ian Blackford to adopt more disruptive tactics ahead of SNP Commons walkout","story":"              ALEX Salmond says he was behind the SNP\u0027s dramatic mass walkout at Westminster.  SNP MPs stormed out of the Commons chamber earlier this week when Ian Blackford was kicked out by the speaker during Prime Minister\u0027s Questions amid protests that MPs had not been given enough time to consider over 50 amendments to the Brexit bill on devolution.  Salmond said he suggested the dramatic protest during a chat with Blackford, the SNP\u0027s Westminster leader.  The former First Minister said Blackford phoned him on the eve of the clash.  \u0026ldquoOne of the iron laws of parliamentary politics is that if you always play the Westminster game then you will always lose,\" Salmond told the Sunday Herald.  \"And the way to turn that round successfully is to target interventions at those occasions which mean so much to the Westminster establishment - PMQs, budgets, state openings etc, and then use their own procedures against them.  \"Certainly that was my advice to Ian Blackford when he phoned me last Tuesday night and I was delighted to see him carry it through.\"  Salmond said he was filming in Gibraltar for a TV programme about Brexit when Blackford sought his advice about taking on the Tories.  Writing in today\u0027s Sunday Herald, Blackford blasted the \"absolute scandal\" of what he said was a lack of debate on a \"power grab\".  After the transfer of powers from Brussels to Whitehall and Westminster, London will take charge of policy areas traditionally devolved to Holyrood.  The SNP has said that means completely demolishing the principle at the heart of the devolution settlement by giving Westminster the final say on many devolved policy areas.  The UK wants to retain control over 24 devolved areas, most related to agriculture, fisheries and the environment, for up to seven years.  Blackford said MPs had been given just 15 minutes to debate the measures in the EU Withdrawal Bill, and warned that the stand off was a \"defining moment when the UK Parliament chose to reject devolution\".  Blackford is to use a debate in Westminster tomorrow (Monday) to make the case for emergency legislation to halt the \"power grab\".  Salmond was famously thrown out of the Commons chamber in 1988 after he interrupted the then chancellor, Nigel Lawson, in mid-flow.  In a dramatic move, Salmond \u0026ndash who had been an MP for just a year \u0026ndash spoke out against the controversial poll tax, a flagship policy of the Thatcher government.  After barracking Lawson and becoming the first MP in history to break parliamentary convention by intervening during the Chancellor\u0026rsquos budget, Salmond was ordered to leave the Commons.  In a frank admission, Salmond said that some SNP MPs between 2015 and 2017 had been \"intent on winning the gold star for good attendance rather than independence\".  He suggested that the SNP\u0027s loss of 21 seats in the 2017 general election was partly due to it becoming too comfortable with the Westminster set up.  Salmond, who was one of the SNP\u0027s casualties last year, said the walkout was a return to a much more effective style of opposition by the party.  \"The challenge for the SNP is to keep up the momentum. Westminster is treating Scotland with contempt,\" he said.  \"Now they are receiving a taste of their own medicine.  \"If they want business as usual then they should get their mitts off the powers of the Scottish Parliament.  \"In my opinion the SNP fell into the Westminster trap after 2015 and then paid the price at the polls.  \"Too many of the current crop of MPs then seemed intent on winning the gold star for good attendance rather than independence. Now all that has changed and well done to them.  \"The people who send the SNP south expect their MPs to shake it up, not settle down.  In response, a UK Government spokesman said: \"The UK Government is proceeding entirely in line with devolution. Rather than manufacture grievance the SNP should be working with us to get best deal for people in Scotland as we leave the EU.  Scottish Tory MP John Lamont added: \u0026ldquoThis really demonstrates the utter immaturity of the SNP.\""},{"url":null,"title":"Digital currency Scotcoin holders to be given bonus if they transfer to new version of coin","story":"              HOLDERS of the digital currency Scotcoin will be given a bonus of four times their stake if they transfer, or \"migrate\", to a new version of the coin.

But he is confident that holders will make the switch. \"Why keep an old Russian bearer bond,\" is how he puts it, \"when you can have a dollar?\"  Another advantage of the new system is that people will be able to switch directly to and from the main established currencies, like sterling, the euro and the dollar. And it will take the volatility out of crypto-trading because scotcoin will be linked to the pound and not bitcoin, which has been highly volatile. So its value will rise or fall with sterling.  Low has also offered scotcoin\u0027s IP address to the Scottish Government which, if taken up, would make it the country\u0027s official digital currency. He described initial meetings about it as \"highly encouraging\".  As he told the Sunday Herald in the past: \u0026ldquoHere\u0027s me, a guy who makes money out of the system and I basically latched onto the currency issue, the single biggest thing which lost the referendum. An independent Scotland must have its own currency, for better or worse.\"  Low may seem an unlikely rebel against financial orthodoxy but the accountant and financial adviser has a starry track record. It was him who organised, on the ground, the shareholder uprising which removed the seemingly impregnable families who owned Celtic and ushered in Fergus McCann, the jaggy bunneted Scottish ex-pat from Canada, who transformed the football club.  When the new scotcoin is launched, Low and his partner Temple Melville will hold a stake worth, notionally, around \u0026pound950 million. But he doesn\u0027t intend to profit from it, all of it will go into what he calls a common wealth fund. \"It will be the polar opposite of a sovereign wealth fund because it will benefit the poor and the disadvantaged.\" Administered by a group of \"the great and the good\", the plan is to pay young people in scotcoin to do good works for the benefit of the community.  It\u0027s a kind of quantitive easing in reverse, contrary to the present system where \"the rich get richer and poorer get poorer, the poorer will get richer\". If under-25s are given, say, pounds1000 or pounds10,000 \"they can do with it what they want, save it or spend it and if they spend it then it benefits the economy\".  To spend it they need outlets, and not just the Arlington Bar, which Low owns. \"I\u0027m confident that the big companies will get involved so that the kid will be able to walk into Greggs or M\u0026ampS or any large retailer and buy what he or she wants using a card, just like now. It\u0027s coming. It\u0027s just a matter of time.\""},{"url":null,"title":"Henry McLeish says Brexit  quot power grab quot  makes indyref2 more likely","story":"              FORMER First Minister Henry McLeish said the clashes at Westminster over a Brexit \"power grab\" had revived the prospect of an early referendum on independence.  McLeish helped steer the Scotland Act, which created the Scottish Parliament, through the House of Commons when he was a minister in Tony Blair\u0027s government in the late 1990s.  However, McLeish said the devolution settlement was now \"unravelling before our eyes\".  McLeish, who was First Minister from 2000 to 2001, said it was a \"tragic step back for Scotland\".  He added that the measures opponents of the Tories have described as a \"power grab\" by Westminster from Scotland made a second referendum much more likely.  He said: \"It\u0027s a gift to the SNP.  \"There was little prospect of an independence referendum, but this may have brought the idea forward.  \"To have devolution unravelling before our eyes is a tragic step back for Scotland and it may shift people\u0027s views.\""},{"url":null,"title":"Why this chapter of history for Glasgow School of Art seems so particularly cruel and unfair","story":"              UNTIL Friday night it had seemed that the fire which ravaged Glasgow School of Art in 2014 would simply become another part of the institution\u0026rsquos illustrious history.  After the shock in May 2014, fears about the continued existence of the building subsided and it appeared that, by some miracle, it was salvageable. Rather than devastation, the tale was shaping up take its place in history is a miraculous escape. It would take more than that to break a building which held such passion and history within its walls.  It\u0026rsquos difficult to articulate the richness of that history, and its importance to Glasgow. The Mackintosh building cements the place of Charles Rennie Mackintosh into the fabric of the city. It sits among the buzz of the bustle, both soaking up the Glasgow culture and helping define it.  The building has occupied its place in the Glasgow landscape since 1899, when the first half of the project was completed. It was designed by Rennie Mackintosh, then a junior draughtsman at firm Honeyman and Keppie, which submitted the plans as part of an architectural competition.  The school itself, as an institution, was founded more than 50 years before, and had already gained a substantial reputation in the field. Before it settled in its new home in Renfrew Street, in the glory of Rennie Mackintosh\u0026rsquos design, it had enjoyed stints in the Merchant City\u0026rsquos Ingram Street and the McLellan Galleries.  The prestigious institution went on to hold a number of academic schools: the Mackintosh School of Architecture, the School of Design, the School of Fine Art, the School of Simulation and Visualisation, and the Innovation School.  While maintaining its reputation as a revered place of study and continuing to appeal to international students as well as local, the School of Art, and in particular the Mackintosh building, has been popular with tourists as a place of historical and cultural significance.  Its relevance to modern art as well as history is undisputed. The School has been host to numerous winners and nominees of the Turner Prize in recent times, such as Richard Wright, Simon Starling and Martin Boyce.  Indeed, it boasts a strong roster of alumni. As well as its most famous son, Charles Rennie Mackintosh, Glasgow School of Art has also counted artist Peter Howson, Travis singer Fran Healy, author Alasdair Gray, former Doctor Who Peter Capaldi, former Scots Makar Liz Lochhead and broadcaster Muriel Gray among its students.  While Rennie Mackintosh is celebrated in the modern age and he has secured his place in the history of art and architecture, he wasn\u0026rsquot always appreciated in his time. Despite his unexpected success with the Art School design, he struggled to get other major commissions in his time. The Glasgow School of Art is the most emphatic physical expression of his contribution to cultural history, and the building therefore represents something bigger for Scotland than just as a hub of rich art and cultural nurturing.  For the city of Glasgow, it hurts. Locals have dealt with several tragedies in recent years. While there is relief at the lack of any casualties as a result of the fire, the same could not be said for the disasters in 2013, when a police helicopter crashed into the roof of the Clutha Bar, and at Christmas 2014, when a number of people were killed in the bin lorry tragedy in the centre of town.  The first fire at the School of Art almost became a ray of light after the initial shock and sadness had calmed. For once it seemed the city may have caught a small break when it became clear that the School could be saved and restored. Now, the double blow feels like a knockout punch to the gut for a city looking forward to a grand re-opening of the Mackintosh building next year. And if it hadn\u0026rsquot already seemed like the planets had for some reason aligned to seal the famous building\u0026rsquos fate, the added salt in the wound is that the second fire happened on the School\u0026rsquos graduation day.  Perhaps one of the most difficult things to consider when thinking, when writing, about events since Friday night is accepting that we now may be discussing the Mackintosh building as something that once existed. It is not the chapter of history anyone could have imagined. It feels cruel and unfair. It\u0026rsquos hard to imagine it as something that was, but that no longer is. Glasgow will, of course, recover, and the School\u0026rsquos admirable reputation will continue. For now, however, the city needs a moment to mourn. Then, the questions, and anger, will inevitably come."},{"url":null,"title":"A classic pudding has been renamed in the House of Commons","story":"              A popular pudding in the House of Commons has been renamed Spotted Richard after waiters were too embarrassed to call it Dick.

She knew better than to get excited \u0026ndash it was simply a detailed drawing of his foot so she could tailor him the perfect sock. Ever the logician, this selfish gesture made perfect sense to Albert. He had feet and a wife who could sew. Socks or mc2, both are simply conclusions to cold calculations.  Perhaps Einstein had simply outgrown his brain\u0026rsquos empathetic static, that hunger for emotional reciprocation gifted to us by evolution to maintain social order. Despite his saintly posthumous persona, there is clear evidence that paints the young Einstein as a chap whose much-vaunted \u0026ldquohumanity was actually a wildly prejudiced, dispassionate study in societal anthropology.  Certainly, a dark disdain for his fellow man has been revealed in private diaries which finally went on public view this week.  Penned in the 20s, these jottings mainly detail the physicist\u0026rsquos tour of Asia and his highly questionable attitudes towards folk he observed on his travels. In particular, the Chinese. A great bunch of lads, according to Father Ted. Einstein disagreed. Like Ted, he preferred to group individuals as a collective and branded the entire Chinese population \u0026ndash 400 million at the time \u0026ndash \u0026ldquopeculiar, herd-like \u0026hellip often more like automatons than people. And, typical of Einstein, he was thinking of the future when he signed off with the zinger: \u0026ldquoIt would be a pity if these Chinese supplant all other races. The Bernard Manning of physics had spoken.  A spectacular level of conceit is also evident in a lame yet rather lyrical piece of \u0026ldquoothering which conveyed Einstein\u0026rsquos distaste for Chinese women. Unlike his foot sketch this critique was, assumedly, an attempt at humour \u0026ndash yet its laboured structure suggests a sentence squeezed out by the bowels of the mind as some sort of dirty protest against decency. Einstein wrote: \u0026ldquo... how little difference there is between (the) men and women. I don\u0026rsquot understand what kind of fatal attraction Chinese women possess which enthrals the corresponding men to such an extent that they are incapable of defending themselves against the formidable blessing of offspring. A simple \u0026ldquodon\u0026rsquot fancy yours much would have done, Albert. He certainly wouldn\u0026rsquot have been a fan of xhamster.  The irony of having expressed such abhorrent views on racial superiority was likely not lost on Einstein when he was forced to flee Germany 10 years later. Dehumanising Nazi propaganda, echoing his own musings on Chinese inferiority, had stoked anti-semitic fervour to fever pitch in his homeland. Einstein was forced to face himself in the mirror and see the real-world consequences of casual stereotypes and generalisations when used as weapons by politicians.  And as his star rose and influence grew in America, a newfound devotion towards civil rights and race relations made it clear that this great teacher of the universe\u0026rsquos secrets had learned a powerful lesson of his own in humility.  THE FUTURE IS IN CHINA\u0027S HANDS  IT\u0026rsquoS especially ironic that the most forward-thinking of modern physicists chose China as his target for blinkered offloading of the id. Shame on the young Einstein if he was already aware that no civilisation on Earth has enjoyed a longer continuous tradition of astronomy and science than the Chinese.  Around 1500BC, China\u0026rsquos stargazers inprinted detailed depictions of complex cosmic events on to shells and bones \u0026ndash with one of these fascinating relics being the earliest known record of a solar eclipse.  The Chinese are far from done with their 4,000-year quest to unlock the secrets of the universe. In fact, they\u0026rsquore just getting started \u0026ndash having recently spent billions to build the Jehovah\u0026rsquos dinner plate of satellites \u0026ndash Earth\u0026rsquos largest-ever communication structure. It was created with the single objective of discovering signals from alien civilisations.  A government splurging so much of its new-found wealth on alien hunting may seem a frivolous waste of cash, especially one with appalling levels of socio-economic hardship, but a newly-revived China views such expenditure as an investment in the future.  Above all their myriad Earthly geopolitical ambitions, what China truly desires is \u0026ldquofirst contact. Keen to solidify their superpower status in the eyes of the world, they\u0026rsquore too late to put the first man in space (Russia) or on the moon (Kubrick. Kidding, USA) so they have turned their focus on something even more seismic and culturally significant.  Of course, the Chinese also want extra-terrestrials to view them as Earth\u0026rsquos dominant nation \u0026ndash but whether aliens will recognise lines on maps as a viable way to draw distinctions between this lukewarm rock\u0026rsquos self-destructive, territorial hate machines is another matter.  Chinese ambitions don\u0026rsquot end at discovering extraterrestrial civilisations either \u0026ndash there are advanced plans for building an observatory on the dark side of the moon within the next few decades. They also quite fancy trumping the Americans by colonising Mars first too. Make no mistake, putting that first human foot on the red planet is presently the superpowers\u0026rsquo most highly contested prize, one desired beyond all other Earthly concerns.  Admirably, China has also raised a salutary two fingers towards the strain of xenophobic isolationism favoured by young Einstein, with plans to link up their alien-hunting satellite with countless other SETI projects across the planet. A vision of one big united skin condition itching Earth\u0026rsquos crust together to explore the great unknown \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos a beautiful thing.  In fact, it\u0026rsquos the kind of progressive \u0026ldquostrength in numbers societal partnership that might one day save us all from being skinned alive by interstellar big game hunters from Zeta Reticuli that China inadvertently alert to our presence.  HARDWIRED FOR PREJUDICE  THE more hysterical media reports covering Einstein\u0026rsquos racist indiscretions were predictably light on the physicist\u0026rsquos attempts to confront the issue of civil rights in his adopted home of America \u0026ndash a lifelong crusade perhaps born of a desire to make amends for his rather prejudiced views as a younger man.  Yet, it\u0026rsquos not so easy to brush off Einstein\u0026rsquos mindset as simply a naive reflection of the prevailing attitudes of the era. Racism isn\u0026rsquot quite so clear-cut \u0026ndash one day, the dissonant turbulence left in the wake of a Trump presidency, Brexit and rise of the far-right across the globe will likely rank high among humanity\u0026rsquos most dangerously xenophobic eras \u0026ndash depressingly arriving just half a century after the Jewish holocaust.  Although humanity toils under the illusion of forward progress, human cultural norms and societal attitudes \u0026ndash as Einstein discovered with light \u0026ndash don\u0026rsquot always travel in a straight line.  Our perceptions of reality swim in a continual state of flux, adapting by expanding and contracting to fit the sociological, cultural and economical climate of the era. Evolution has evidently built our brains to be vulnerable to societal herdthink, and we only have to open our eyes to see our willingness to fall in line with hive mentality.  Prejudice certainly sharpens the hazy chaos of internal dialogue to a sharp point, giving the meaninglessness meaning and reinforcing the heady delusion of racial superiority. Reciprocated antipathy releases a highly addictive brain chemical cocktail of dopamine, serotonin, oxytocin and endorphins.  Territorialism is seriously addictive \u0026ndash quite likely a hardwired evolutionary hangover. Yet ironically, many individuals only feel that they truly exist when becoming anonymous in the echo chamber \u0026ndash with the hive validating their infected mindset.  Einstein\u0026rsquos own addiction to the rush of personal prejudice was clearly still evident during the twilight of his career, having mutated from blinkered racism to a stubborn refusal to accept new scientific ideas \u0026ndash most famously his denial of the reality of quantum physics.  It led to wasted decades of dead-end research, with Einstein himself acknowledging the relative uneventfulness of his post-fame career.  A fruitless search to find a unifying theory to marry the world of the very small with Newtonian physics once again showed that even genius is not invulner-able to that opiate of the human condition \u0026ndash the rose-tinted comfort of our own long-calcified mindsets.  As Einstein himself said: \u0026ldquoBrief is this existence, a fleeting visit in a strange house. The path to be pursued is poorly lit by a flickering consciousness."},{"url":null,"title":"Plans to increase weeks off work for paternity leave would help 17 000 families in Scotland","story":"              Around 17,000 families in Scotland would benefit from an increase in paternity pay and leave, according to Labour.

When asked what message she had for Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson after he was recorded expressing concern the UK could end up remaining in orbit around the EU and not fully free to make trade deals, Mrs May said: \"The message is Government has agreed that we will have an independent trade policy. We will be free to negotiate those trade deals around the rest of the world.\"  She explained how in the week beginning July 9 the UK Government would publish a White Paper on Brexit, setting out in more detail its ambition for a future relationship with the EU.  The PM told BBC1\u0027s The Andrew Marr Show that she could not agree to any EU move that would harm the Union of the United Kingdom by creating a trade border between Britain and Northern Ireland, declaring: \"That\u0027s not right. That\u0027s not acceptable.\"  Ahead of a debate in the House of Lords tomorrow on the EU Withdrawal Bill and a crunch, potentially knife-edge vote on Wednesday when the amended legislation returns to the Commons, Mrs May insisted she was a woman of her word after some Tory rebels expressed fears they were not getting the compromise deal they believed had been on offer over Parliament having a greater influence on Brexit.  \"I did indeed meet a group of my fellow MPs. I listened to their concerns and I undertook to consider their concerns. And the next day I stood up in Prime Minister\u0027s Questions and said I\u0027d put an amendment down in the House of Lords. I\u0027ve done exactly that.  Facing claims of betrayal by some pro-EU colleagues, Mrs May insisted that she and her Cabinet colleagues recognised the concerns some people had about the role of Parliament in the Brexit process but she made clear she would not budge on the primacy of Government in the talks with Brussels, saying: \"Parliament cannot tie the hands of Government in negotiations.\"  However, her Tory colleagues Dominic Grieve made it clear the Conservative rebels did not intend to back down on getting Parliament more say on Brexit.

And I can assure you I wake up at 2am in a cold sweat thinking about the problems that we have put on our shoulders. The difficulty is that the Brexit process is inherently risky.\"  Robert Buckland, the Solicitor General, insisted UK ministers intended to press on with their own meaningful vote amendment, which suggested a Government motion on the final deal could not be amended rebels believe this means the meaningful vote would, therefore, not be meaningful.  Mr Buckland stressed that while Tory rebels argued the vote they wanted would only be advisory, he stressed that even this vote could have a political consequence and send a signal to Brussels that the UK Government was not in control of its own negotiating strategy. \u0026ldquoThere is a political contest to all of this, he insisted.  Ahead of the Lords debate tomorrow, Lord Newby, who leads the Liberal Democrats in the upper chamber, accused Mrs May\u0026rsquos plans on the Brexit bill as \u0026ldquobreathtaking in their arrogance and deceit.  \u0026ldquoHaving reneged on a promise made to her own colleagues, it is clear she cannot be trusted.

His response came after Theresa May appeared taken aback as to why she had allowed Sir Christopher Chope, who has sought to block a number of bills over the years, to receive a knighthood just a few months ago.  The MP for Christchurch in Dorset sparked outrage when, to cries of \u0026ldquoshame in the Commons, he single-handedly blocked the criminalisation of upskirting in England and Wales it has been banned in Scotland since 2009.  After the outcry, Sir Christopher told his local newspaper he supported outlawing what he called was the \"vulgar, humiliating and unacceptable\" act of upskirting but stressed he had objected on a point of principle about Government misusing parliamentary procedure.  He shouted down Liberal Democrat MP Wera Hobhouse\u0027s Voyeurism Offences Bill, which would have made illegal what the Prime Minister branded an \"invasive\" and \"degrading\" act she has pledged to revive an attempt to ban it.  The 71-year-old backbencher told the Daily Echo on Sunday: \"I feel a bit sore about being scapegoated over this. The suggestion that I am some kind of pervert is a complete travesty of the truth. It\u0027s defamatory of my character and it\u0027s very depressing some of my colleagues have been perpetuating that in the past 48 hours.\"  Sir Christopher urged the Government to find the \"fastest, fairest and surest passage\" for a bill banning people from taking pictures up someone\u0027s clothing without their consent as he accused ministers of \"hijacking\" backbenchers\u0027 time with the Friday afternoon debate.  But Ms Hobhouse, the MP for Bath, demanded the Tory MP apologise, saying: \u0026ldquoBy objecting to the Bill, Christopher Chope let women in England and Wales down. I, therefore, expect him to make a full apology to all the woman who have been harassed and degraded by this vile practice.  Earlier, Culture Minister Margot James said her Tory colleague had brought their party into disrepute while the Prime Minister expressed her \"disappointment\" at his move.  However, when Mrs May was asked why she had permitted the knighthood of Sir Christopher - who has attempted to block the pardon of the World War Two Enigma code-breaker Alan Turing and the proposed ban on using wild animals in circuses - she seemed taken aback.

Despite being ravaged by fire at the weekend, leading architectural conservationist, Professor Miles Glendinning, believes the Glasgow School of Art building can be completely restored - it is just a question of finding the money to do it.  Following the fire in 2014, Historic Environment Scotland worked with the school to draw up a digital record of the site using photographs and drawings, with exacting detail down to the nearest millimetre.  Professor Glendinning, director of the Scottish Centre for Conservation Studies, claims this \"astonishing\" record means that despite the damage being far worse this time round, the building is in a much better position for restoration.  Speaking to Good Morning Scotland, he argued that the structure was of such significance that it should be restored, despite the financial barriers.  \"In terms of conservation and restoration, we\u0027re funnily enough a lot better off this time because of a very remarkable recording project that GSA undertook after the last fire,\" he said.  \"The building still exists digitally, even if the inside is for the moment physically absent.  \"It\u0027s a digital recording and reconstruction of the whole building down to the nearest millimetre outside and in, using photos and measured drawings.  \"This is kind of a world first for Scotland and it means the start of the restoration work doesn\u0027t need to involve questions over whether it can be done at all.  \"However bad it looks now, the problem now is not about that, but about when and how it is to be paid for.\"  Professor Glendinning, who chairs architectural conservation at Edinburgh College of Art, said Scotland could look to other countries for examples of ruined buildings being brought back to life - including Germany where a church destroyed during World War II was rebuilt after 50 years.  Frauenkirche in Dresden was reduced to a pile of rubble but was reopened in 2005 after a 10-year restoration project.  Mr Glendinning said: \"As far as the physical damage is concerned, it does look very bad, but it\u0027s not as bad as some other cases we\u0027ve seen in recent history.  \"It\u0027s really a matter of how long it will take and where the money\u0027s going to come from.\"  He added that he would be \"very surprised\" if a decision was taken to demolish the building, saying he believes it is more likely that the existing walls will be reinforced.  \"It may look absolutely daunting at the moment, but there have been a lot of buildings worse than this that have been successfully restored - and they didn\u0027t have this digital record.\"  Fiona Hyslop, cabinet secretary for Culture, Tourism and External Affairs, said she has already been in touch with Historic Environment Scotland about the digitisation and has asked officials there to be involved in looking at possible options for the site.

Ms Hyslop added: \"The Scottish Government stands ready to do what it can to help, as we have done in the past.  \"We\u0027ll have to identify what the possibilities are going forward, but we\u0027ve got to be very realistic.\""},{"url":null,"title":"pupils to benefit from new mentoring scheme","story":"\t\t\t\tMCR Pathways\u0026rsquo Young Scottish Talent initiative will be available to support disadvantaged and care-experienced pupils at St Machar, Banff, Inverurie, Fraserburgh and Peterhead Academies, as well as The Gordon Schools from August.                                                    The charity, which is being supported by The Wood Foundation as it expands its reach in the North-east, hopes to eventually be active in every City and Shire secondary school.                                                    The North-east is the first area for the nationwide expansion of the programme outside of Glasgow. Aberdeen has the second highest proportion of young people failing to move onto \u0026lsquopositive destinations\u0026rsquo when they leave school.        The Wood Foundation\u0026rsquos UK Director Ali MacLachlan said: \u0026ldquoNurturing young people at this crossroads in their lives is vitally important in terms of supporting them to find the right path to fulfil their potential.\u0026ldquoPeople may be surprised to learn that the North-east has such high rates of young people unable to move onto positive destinations after school. We must harness the potential of these young people to support the current and future economic performance of our region.\u0026ldquoMany of these vulnerable young people lack the stability and support many of us take for granted. This imbalance is something the programme aims to address.\u0026ldquoMCR Pathways has already demonstrated significant impact and we are pleased to support its introduction to the North-east.                                                                                                        The Wood Foundation will be hosting an open event next week to inform potential mentors and business partners about the programme.A mentor meets a young person weekly in their school. They provide a listening ear and supportive voice \u0026ndash a constant adult role model who will build confidence, aspirations and a route to meaningful training or employment. Mentors are trained to guide young people through subject choices, training and professional routes to broaden their mind-sets and realise their potential.One of the opportunities, which requires support from the local business community, is \u0026lsquoTalent Tasters\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash a bite-sized work experience programme showing young people different aspects of industry.Iain MacRitchie of MCR Pathways said: \u0026ldquoA young person\u0026rsquos future should be determined by their potential, never their circumstances. Our mentoring scheme levels the playing field and gives young people structured, enthusiastic and dedicated support to really find a way to realise and achieve their goals as they make that transition from childhood to their adult lives.                                                                                                        \u0026ldquoWe are very proud of what the programme and our young people have achieved to date and we have no doubt the same successes will be realised in the North-east where we have recognised a real need and desire for this support.\u0026lsquoPathways Coordinators\u0026rsquo have been hired for each of the six schools and will begin work after the summer break. They support pupils in S1 and 2 and match them with a mentor from S3.MCR Pathways is already operational across all Glasgow secondary schools where more than 1300 young people are supported each week through a mixture of group work, mentoring and work-based \u0026lsquoTalent Taster\u0026rsquo opportunities. More than 80% of mentored participants have moved onto further education, higher education or employment in sharp contrast to the national figure of 54%.Businessman Iain MacRitchie launched the charity in 2007 after being shocked by a professional experience restructuring a youth care business. While the business health was restored, the poor outcomes for young people remained the same and he realised the need for relationship-based, meaningful support.He commented: \u0026ldquoThat professional experience was a real eye-opener for me, seeing that these young people were not getting the support they needed and nowhere near achieving their potential. I vowed then to do something and have taken time out from my business to make a difference. This programme really does deliver profound results for some of the most vulnerable in our society.                                                                                                        \u0026ldquoHelping a young person onto the right path at this stage really is life-changing. We continuously hear incredible stories including a mentee who went from a homeless unit to medical school and another who had to contend with family addiction issues and was four years behind in their education to graduating university and becoming a building surveyor.\u0026ldquoTheir stories, among countless other, have spurred us to roll out this project nationwide and we look forward to hearing of the successes of North-east youngsters in the years to come.The first information event for individuals and businesses keen to support the programme in the North-east will be held at The Wood Foundation\u0026rsquos office in Aberdeen on Monday, June 18.To register, or for more information on future events, please contact Alison.maclachlan@thewoodfoundation.org.uk.

The issue was raised with Mr Clark by a constituent at a recent surgery, Alfred Middleton from Inverurie, who is a shareholder in RBS.                                                    The claimants secured a £200million settlement from RBS last summer.        However, solicitors for the claimants have not yet received all the money from RBS and only about £25million has been paid to investors so far. A legal battle is ongoing between the Action Group Company and Manx Capital, the investment vehicle and major claimant that took control of the mass legal claim and secured the settlement on behalf of the claimants..In his letter, Mr Clark said that investigations by a Sunday newspaper had raised serious questions about the credibility of the Action Group Company.He has joined parliamentary colleagues including Kevin Hollinrake, Conservative MP and co-chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Fair Business Banking in calling for an inquiry.Mr Clark said: \u0026ldquoThis is an issue that was raised with me by a constituent that is directly affected by issues with the settlement agreed with RBS last summer.                                                                                                        \u0026ldquoMany RBS shareholders believe that the rights issue undertaken by RBS in 2008 was promoted on a misleading basis.\u0026ldquoThey believe there were serious omissions of information which should have been brought to the attention of investors.\u0026ldquoThe RBS Shareholders Action Group Company was set up in 2009 purportedly to represent the interests of those investors.\u0026ldquoHowever, since the £200million settlement was agreed, a very small fraction of that sum has been paid out.                                                                                                        \u0026ldquoThere are serious concerns about the Action Group Company and the lack of regulation in place to protect shareholders.\u0026ldquoI have now written to the Justice Secretary to join calls for an investigation into the RBS Shareholders Action Group Company, which should happen as a matter of urgency.

Isobel Campbell (missing from photo) makes up the team.THE 70-plus volunteers working for Befriending Caithness have been praised for their commitment as the organisation continues to expand.\u0026nbspIt now has groups running throughout Caithness and into north Sutherland and there is a growing waiting list for the service which aims to tackle isolation and loneliness.Speaking during Volunteers\u0026rsquo Week, Befriending Caithness senior co-ordinator Angie House said: \u0026ldquoThis is an opportunity to say thank you very much to all our volunteers for all that they do and to raise awareness of what Befriending Caithness is about.\u0026ldquoAcknowledging what our volunteers do is really important, as we couldn\u0026rsquot work without them.Their role involves being matched with a befriendee, meeting up for at least one hour a week, hearing about their experiences and enhancing their lives.\u0026ldquoThe generosity of some people\u0026rsquos time is absolutely amazing, Angie said. \u0026ldquoOur volunteers show an absolutely tremendous commitment and do over and above what they\u0026rsquore supposed to do.For example, one befriendee had lived in India as a child so her befriender did some research and brought a map in to her. She was delighted someone wanted to hear her story.Befriending Caithness \u0026ndash part of Caithness Voluntary Group \u0026ndash now has groups in Wick, Thurso, Mey, Berriedale and Bettyhill. Mey is especially popular, with befriendees meeting from across the county every couple of months for soup and sandwiches, where there is a \u0026ldquoconstant buzz of chatter, like music. It\u0026rsquos lovely to hear, Angie said.The intergenerational group involves S5/S6 school pupils visiting hospitals and care homes. One befriendee said these befrienders are \u0026ldquolike young relations.The benefits of this are twofold. As well as keeping the befriendees company, it gets the young befriendees into the voluntary mind-set early on, encourages them to become more empathetic and confident and it shows they can make a difference.Befriendees also benefit from regular contact with people \u0026ldquoso they feel as though they\u0026rsquore part of the community, according to befriending co-ordinator Elspeth Manson.Angie added: \u0026ldquoHelping someone recognise their worth is a benefit for both the befriendee and the volunteer.The recruitment procedure includes volunteers receiving Protecting Vulnerable Groups (PVG) clearance and providing three references. Once accepted, training includes support from other groups such as stroke awareness, Hearing and Sight Care and Parkinson\u0026rsquos awareness.Befriending Caithness is not a standalone organisation \u0026ndash it is helped by the community.An event to look out for is a fashion show at M\u0026ampCo in Thurso on June 28, starting at 7pm. Tickets cost \u0026pound5 and this will go towards the July summer lunch.As well as being greatly appreciated by co-ordinators, the joy felt by the befriendees is evident. Co-ordinator Isobel Campbell shared a few, including \u0026ldquobefriending has saved my life, \u0026ldquohaving a befriender would be a luxury and \u0026ldquobefriending is a cup of kindness.One volunteer remarked: \u0026ldquoI just love a laugh and the banter.Befriending Caithness is looking for a volunteer marketing/social media intern.

When he left the club and took over the national team he asked me to come help with a few bits, and from there I\u0026rsquove been working with the team since November 2017.\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not based in Croatia. I only come into the country for the preparations and matches, but when I\u0026rsquom there everyone is very friendly and welcoming.\u0026ldquoThe language is very difficult but luckily most of the team and all the staff speak English. Croatia is a beautiful country and the food is delicious so it\u0026rsquos always a pleasure to go over.\u0026ldquoWhen I\u0026rsquom there you see the culture is a strong passionate people but they are also very considerate and well mannered in general, with everyone happy to help each other out.\u0026ldquoIn my current role I am responsible for the gathering and compiling of our information to share with the coaching staff on the opposition and our own performances and training sessions, then to make that information available through video and written documents.\u0026ldquoWe record all our performances in training through GPS and video and then feed that back each night. Along with this we look to prepare our team through use of video meetings and documents on the opposite team.\u0026ldquoMy role is very much a support role for the coaches where I produce information so they can make the best and most informed decisions.\u0026ldquoThe post-match sessions are used to highlight areas which we can improve and the players are very professional and take this on board and process it into better performances where required next time.\u0026ldquoAs for Croatia\u0026rsquos World Cup campaign, the process began when we saw the draw for the group stages and we\u0026rsquove been building to now since then.Marc says a large chunk of his success has come down to the support of family and friends back home in Caithness.His grannies Nanette Plowman (Wick) and Lilian Campbell (Castletown) both still live in Caithness.Marc added: \u0026ldquoAll of my grandparents and my mum have been very supportive of me throughout my life and have always encouraged me to continue to do better. We speak each week and they always give me a boost in energy through encouragement.\u0026ldquoI always know they are there to support me and my little family and we are forever grateful for their love and support.\u0026ldquoPlus all of my aunts, uncles and cousins have also had an influence in who I am and what I do today. I have a few friends still around Caithness.\u0026ldquoI used to come up and play football at the garages in Papigoe or in Castletown, I would jump the neighbours\u0026rsquo wall and have a kick-about with the boys next door. It\u0026rsquos from experiences like this that I have developed a deep passion for football and a love of the game.window._taboola = window._taboola || []_taboola.push({mode:\u0027autosized-generated-2r\u0027, container:\u0027taboola-below-main-column\u0027, placement:\u0027below-main-column\u0027})\t\t\t\t\tMore storieswindow._taboola = window._taboola || []_taboola.push({mode: \u0027thumbnails-d\u0027,container: \u0027taboola-below-article-thumbnails\u0027,placement: \u0027Below Article Thumbnails\u0027,target_type: \u0027mix\u0027})\t\t\t\t\tQuick LinksFamily NoticesPropertyJobsMotorsBusiness FinderPhoto SalesSubscriptionse-editionDatingTop 25 Days OutHighlands ExplorerNewsSportFeaturesYour CaithnessHighland HeroesWhat\u0027s OnMusicFilmTravel and TransportWeatherJohn O\u0027Groat JournalFollow us on  Monday 18 Jun 2018 4:37 AMvar addthis_config = {data_ga_property: \u0027UA-25496687-7\u0027}\u0026nbspif (window.adgroupid == undefined) {window.adgroupid = Math.round(Math.random() * 1000)}document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--if (window.adgroupid == undefined) {window.adgroupid = Math.round(Math.random() * 1000)}document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--border=\"0\"if (window.adgroupid == undefined) {window.adgroupid = Math.round(Math.random() * 1000)}document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--border=\"0\"if (window.adgroupid == undefined) {window.adgroupid = Math.round(Math.random() * 1000)}document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--border=\"0\"window.___gcfg = { lang: \u0027en-GB\u0027 }(function() {var po = document.createElement(\u0027script\u0027) po.type = \u0027text/javascript\u0027 po.async = truepo.src = \u0027https://apis.google/js/plusone.js\u0027var s = document.getElementsByTagName(\u0027script\u0027)[0] s.parentNode.insertBefore(po, s)})()MOST COMMENTSMOST POPULARFury over threat to John O\u0027Groats bus link\u0027I wanted to do it for my mum\u0027 says Old Man of Hoy climber Edward (8)Councillor Donnie Mackay joins ConservativesNorth MP calls for action from Sturgeon and May over town centre decline Author takes a road trip through history at Wick illustrated talkJune vents its rage on CaithnessLewis shines for Scotland in CanadaJohn O\u0027Groats go the distance to reach last fourStaxigoe keep their eye on a cup final boostBus users voice concern at threat to \u0027lifeline service\u0027 between Wick and John O\u0027GroatsMarc\u0027s Croatia role gives Caithness a World Cup connectionAuthor takes a road trip through history at Wick illustrated talkBus users voice concern at threat to \u0027lifeline service\u0027 between Wick and John O\u0027GroatsSpecial delivery for retiring Lybster postieJune vents its rage on CaithnessNorth MP calls for action from Sturgeon and May over town centre decline Man dies following collision on A836\u0027I wanted to do it for my mum\u0027 says Old Man of Hoy climber Edward (8)Fury over threat to John O\u0027Groats bus linkNew posts will help hospital patients(function(d, s, id) {var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]if (d.getElementById(id)) {return}js = d.createElement(s) js.id = idjs.src = \"//connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js#xfbml=1\"fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs)}(document, \u0027script\u0027, \u0027facebook-jssdk\u0027))\u0026nbspFollow @GroatNews property-northBuying, selling or renting - we\u0027ve got it coveredjobs-northLooking for a job?

Few local high street businesses remain in Tain, Mr Stone\u0026rsquos home town.\u0026ldquoThe presence of these empty and increasingly derelict properties undermines one of the most important industries of the Highlands \u0026ndash namely tourism, he says.\u0026ldquoI would therefore suggest that properly tackling this problem should now be one of the most urgent issues for both the UK and Scottish governments.\u0026ldquoThis problem can no longer be ducked by plans that turn out to be more about words than actions \u0026ndash or, worse still, by means of the argument that the decline in the UK\u0026rsquos high street retail sector is inevitable.\u0026ldquoIf we really value our communities and their built heritage, then we must use every means at our disposal \u0026ndash grants, infrastructure investment, tax breaks, local and national planning \u0026ndash so that we can find new ways of bringing these buildings back into sustainable use.Speaking yesterday, Mr Stone said: \u0026ldquoIt pains me greatly to see what is happening, and also to witness nothing better than fine words and hand-wringing when it comes to tackling the problem.\u0026ldquoThis letter is my first move in a campaign that I am going to pursue with the greatest vigour. Tain is my home town and I care about it \u0026ndash and the same is true of the other communities that I have the honour to represent.window._taboola = window._taboola || []_taboola.push({mode:\u0027autosized-generated-2r\u0027, container:\u0027taboola-below-main-column\u0027, placement:\u0027below-main-column\u0027})\t\t\t\t\tMore storieswindow._taboola = window._taboola || []_taboola.push({mode: \u0027thumbnails-d\u0027,container: \u0027taboola-below-article-thumbnails\u0027,placement: \u0027Below Article Thumbnails\u0027,target_type: \u0027mix\u0027})\t\t\t\t\tQuick LinksFamily NoticesPropertyJobsMotorsBusiness FinderPhoto SalesSubscriptionse-editionDatingTop 25 Days OutHighlands ExplorerNewsSportFeaturesYour CaithnessHighland HeroesWhat\u0027s OnMusicFilmTravel and TransportWeatherJohn O\u0027Groat JournalFollow us on  Monday 18 Jun 2018 4:37 AMvar addthis_config = {data_ga_property: \u0027UA-25496687-7\u0027}\u0026nbspif (window.adgroupid == undefined) {window.adgroupid = Math.round(Math.random() * 1000)}document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--if (window.adgroupid == undefined) {window.adgroupid = Math.round(Math.random() * 1000)}document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--border=\"0\"if (window.adgroupid == undefined) {window.adgroupid = Math.round(Math.random() * 1000)}document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--border=\"0\"if (window.adgroupid == undefined) {window.adgroupid = Math.round(Math.random() * 1000)}document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--border=\"0\"window.___gcfg = { lang: \u0027en-GB\u0027 }(function() {var po = document.createElement(\u0027script\u0027) po.type = \u0027text/javascript\u0027 po.async = truepo.src = \u0027https://apis.google/js/plusone.js\u0027var s = document.getElementsByTagName(\u0027script\u0027)[0] s.parentNode.insertBefore(po, s)})()MOST COMMENTSMOST POPULARFury over threat to John O\u0027Groats bus link\u0027I wanted to do it for my mum\u0027 says Old Man of Hoy climber Edward (8)Councillor Donnie Mackay joins ConservativesNorth MP calls for action from Sturgeon and May over town centre decline Author takes a road trip through history at Wick illustrated talkJune vents its rage on CaithnessLewis shines for Scotland in CanadaJohn O\u0027Groats go the distance to reach last fourStaxigoe keep their eye on a cup final boostBus users voice concern at threat to \u0027lifeline service\u0027 between Wick and John O\u0027GroatsMarc\u0027s Croatia role gives Caithness a World Cup connectionAuthor takes a road trip through history at Wick illustrated talkBus users voice concern at threat to \u0027lifeline service\u0027 between Wick and John O\u0027GroatsSpecial delivery for retiring Lybster postieJune vents its rage on CaithnessNorth MP calls for action from Sturgeon and May over town centre decline Man dies following collision on A836\u0027I wanted to do it for my mum\u0027 says Old Man of Hoy climber Edward (8)Fury over threat to John O\u0027Groats bus linkNew posts will help hospital patients(function(d, s, id) {var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]if (d.getElementById(id)) {return}js = d.createElement(s) js.id = idjs.src = \"//connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js#xfbml=1\"fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs)}(document, \u0027script\u0027, \u0027facebook-jssdk\u0027))\u0026nbspFollow @GroatNews property-northBuying, selling or renting - we\u0027ve got it coveredjobs-northLooking for a job?

Making the presentation is Duncan Winfield (right) accompanied by wife Gail (left). Pic: Marshall BowmanWELL-known Lybster postie Murray Smythe has retired after 30 years on his rounds serving the communities of south-east Caithness.\u0026nbspHe started in 1988, taking over from another postie who was a familiar figure to a certain generation, Donnie Bremner from Mid-Clyth.Thirty years ago Murray had to go over the Ord to Helmsdale to meet the train north to collect the mail then take it to the local sorting offices in Dunbeath and Lybster. All the small local post offices and all the postboxes between Berriedale and Lybster had to have the mail uplifted on this run.Now two trucks each morning bring the mail north from Inverness and Murray has been working mainly, since these changes, on the rural run through Occumster, Roster, Clyth, Bruan and Ulbster.Murray frequently found himself stuck in snow in past winters and has been rescued by farmers pulling him out of drifts in the rural hinterland of south-east Caithness.He served under three postmasters in Lybster \u0026ndash firstly as a part-time postie as well as being a fisherman under the late Hugh Gunn, whose father before him had been the Lybster postmaster. After Hugh retired, Des and the late Mary Somerville took over before handing over to the present incumbent, Duncan Winfield, and wife Gail.One incident in particular has stayed with Murray and harks back to his early days on his rounds. When arriving at the late Annie Bain\u0026rsquos place on the Smerlie road he was implored to catch a ewe that had got loose.Murray jumped the fence and caught it as Annie almost simultaneously thrust her arm up its rear to pull out a new lamb and straight back in for another.After a quick wipe down of the livestock he was then asked if there was anything in the post, almost as if nothing had happened in the previous five minutes. Murray duly delivered Annie\u0026rsquos mail having firstly helped with the other delivery, and on to his next stop.A collection was taken in Lybster Post Office and the money was handed over by local postmaster Duncan Winfield accompanied by wife Gail in a small ceremony on June 6.window._taboola = window._taboola || []_taboola.push({mode:\u0027autosized-generated-2r\u0027, container:\u0027taboola-below-main-column\u0027, placement:\u0027below-main-column\u0027})\t\t\t\t\tMore storieswindow._taboola = window._taboola || []_taboola.push({mode: \u0027thumbnails-d\u0027,container: \u0027taboola-below-article-thumbnails\u0027,placement: \u0027Below Article Thumbnails\u0027,target_type: \u0027mix\u0027})\t\t\t\t\tQuick LinksFamily NoticesPropertyJobsMotorsBusiness FinderPhoto SalesSubscriptionse-editionDatingTop 25 Days OutHighlands ExplorerNewsSportFeaturesYour CaithnessHighland HeroesWhat\u0027s OnMusicFilmTravel and TransportWeatherJohn O\u0027Groat JournalFollow us on  Monday 18 Jun 2018 4:37 AMvar addthis_config = {data_ga_property: \u0027UA-25496687-7\u0027}\u0026nbspif (window.adgroupid == undefined) {window.adgroupid = Math.round(Math.random() * 1000)}document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--if (window.adgroupid == undefined) {window.adgroupid = Math.round(Math.random() * 1000)}document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--border=\"0\"if (window.adgroupid == undefined) {window.adgroupid = Math.round(Math.random() * 1000)}document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--border=\"0\"if (window.adgroupid == undefined) {window.adgroupid = Math.round(Math.random() * 1000)}document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--border=\"0\"window.___gcfg = { lang: \u0027en-GB\u0027 }(function() {var po = document.createElement(\u0027script\u0027) po.type = \u0027text/javascript\u0027 po.async = truepo.src = \u0027https://apis.google/js/plusone.js\u0027var s = document.getElementsByTagName(\u0027script\u0027)[0] s.parentNode.insertBefore(po, s)})()MOST COMMENTSMOST POPULARFury over threat to John O\u0027Groats bus link\u0027I wanted to do it for my mum\u0027 says Old Man of Hoy climber Edward (8)Councillor Donnie Mackay joins ConservativesNorth MP calls for action from Sturgeon and May over town centre decline Author takes a road trip through history at Wick illustrated talkJune vents its rage on CaithnessLewis shines for Scotland in CanadaJohn O\u0027Groats go the distance to reach last fourStaxigoe keep their eye on a cup final boostBus users voice concern at threat to \u0027lifeline service\u0027 between Wick and John O\u0027GroatsMarc\u0027s Croatia role gives Caithness a World Cup connectionAuthor takes a road trip through history at Wick illustrated talkBus users voice concern at threat to \u0027lifeline service\u0027 between Wick and John O\u0027GroatsSpecial delivery for retiring Lybster postieJune vents its rage on CaithnessNorth MP calls for action from Sturgeon and May over town centre decline Man dies following collision on A836\u0027I wanted to do it for my mum\u0027 says Old Man of Hoy climber Edward (8)Fury over threat to John O\u0027Groats bus linkNew posts will help hospital patients(function(d, s, id) {var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]if (d.getElementById(id)) {return}js = d.createElement(s) js.id = idjs.src = \"//connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js#xfbml=1\"fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs)}(document, \u0027script\u0027, \u0027facebook-jssdk\u0027))\u0026nbspFollow @GroatNews property-northBuying, selling or renting - we\u0027ve got it coveredjobs-northLooking for a job?

We\u0026rsquore getting a lot of Australians in at the moment.\u0026ldquoOne thing we would like to get more of is local people. It\u0026rsquos great that we get these visitors from all over the world, and many of them have Caithness connections and they come on that basis, but it would be nice to get more local people.\u0026ldquoOur open day on January 2 was a good start in that respect because it opened the door to people from the local area to come and see what we have.\u0026ldquoA number have come back on the basis of that.\u0026ldquoThe local people are very supportive of the Wick Society. Everything in this museum is donated by people who either live locally or have connections with this place.\u0026ldquoI mentioned at the AGM about the amount of donations that we get in monetary terms. That\u0026rsquos considerable, from local businesses and local people. Some of those are also in-kind donations, certainly in terms of the boat section \u0026ndash they get quite a lot of in-kind help from businesses around the harbour.\u0026ldquoSo, while we would like more local people to come in through our doors and appreciate what we\u0026rsquove got here, it\u0026rsquos not a criticism of the local people because they are very, very supportive.He added: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos an honour to be part of the Wick Society and to be part of its development.\u0026ldquoWe have a number of plans in place for things we want to do. We\u0026rsquove achieved quite a lot in the last couple of years and we\u0026rsquore looking forward to continuing that.The Wick Society will be supporting the Industrial Archaeology Conference taking place from June 22-27. It will cover many aspects of industrial heritage in Caithness, including talks, tours, an exhibition and a visit to Orkney.\u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore involved in that on two fronts, Mr Leith said. \u0026ldquoThe Johnston photographic collection is having a display in Caithness Horizons throughout the month of June but Wick Heritage Museum will also host some of the tours as part of the conference programme.\u0026ldquoWe will open our doors at appropriate times to let delegates see the museum.window._taboola = window._taboola || []_taboola.push({mode:\u0027autosized-generated-2r\u0027, container:\u0027taboola-below-main-column\u0027, placement:\u0027below-main-column\u0027})\t\t\t\t\tMore storieswindow._taboola = window._taboola || []_taboola.push({mode: \u0027thumbnails-d\u0027,container: \u0027taboola-below-article-thumbnails\u0027,placement: \u0027Below Article Thumbnails\u0027,target_type: \u0027mix\u0027})\t\t\t\t\tQuick LinksFamily NoticesPropertyJobsMotorsBusiness FinderPhoto SalesSubscriptionse-editionDatingTop 25 Days OutHighlands ExplorerNewsSportFeaturesYour CaithnessHighland HeroesWhat\u0027s OnMusicFilmTravel and TransportWeatherJohn O\u0027Groat JournalFollow us on  Monday 18 Jun 2018 4:37 AMvar addthis_config = {data_ga_property: \u0027UA-25496687-7\u0027}\u0026nbspif (window.adgroupid == undefined) {window.adgroupid = Math.round(Math.random() * 1000)}document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--if (window.adgroupid == undefined) {window.adgroupid = Math.round(Math.random() * 1000)}document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--border=\"0\"if (window.adgroupid == undefined) {window.adgroupid = Math.round(Math.random() * 1000)}document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--border=\"0\"if (window.adgroupid == undefined) {window.adgroupid = Math.round(Math.random() * 1000)}document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--border=\"0\"window.___gcfg = { lang: \u0027en-GB\u0027 }(function() {var po = document.createElement(\u0027script\u0027) po.type = \u0027text/javascript\u0027 po.async = truepo.src = \u0027https://apis.google/js/plusone.js\u0027var s = document.getElementsByTagName(\u0027script\u0027)[0] s.parentNode.insertBefore(po, s)})()MOST COMMENTSMOST POPULARFury over threat to John O\u0027Groats bus link\u0027I wanted to do it for my mum\u0027 says Old Man of Hoy climber Edward (8)Councillor Donnie Mackay joins ConservativesNorth MP calls for action from Sturgeon and May over town centre decline Author takes a road trip through history at Wick illustrated talkJune vents its rage on CaithnessLewis shines for Scotland in CanadaJohn O\u0027Groats go the distance to reach last fourStaxigoe keep their eye on a cup final boostBus users voice concern at threat to \u0027lifeline service\u0027 between Wick and John O\u0027GroatsMarc\u0027s Croatia role gives Caithness a World Cup connectionAuthor takes a road trip through history at Wick illustrated talkBus users voice concern at threat to \u0027lifeline service\u0027 between Wick and John O\u0027GroatsSpecial delivery for retiring Lybster postieJune vents its rage on CaithnessNorth MP calls for action from Sturgeon and May over town centre decline Man dies following collision on A836\u0027I wanted to do it for my mum\u0027 says Old Man of Hoy climber Edward (8)Fury over threat to John O\u0027Groats bus linkNew posts will help hospital patients(function(d, s, id) {var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]if (d.getElementById(id)) {return}js = d.createElement(s) js.id = idjs.src = \"//connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js#xfbml=1\"fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs)}(document, \u0027script\u0027, \u0027facebook-jssdk\u0027))\u0026nbspFollow @GroatNews property-northBuying, selling or renting - we\u0027ve got it coveredjobs-northLooking for a job?

Picture: Robert MacDonald / Northern StudiosThe memorial overlooking the town\u0026rsquos harbour has been refurbished by John Hood \u0026amp Son (Sculptors) and paid for by local building firm MM Miller.\u0026nbspThe Wick Paths Group, which was instrumental in getting the work at the memorial under way, plans to place an interpretive panel at the site telling people about the work Bremner carried out.Group secretary John Bogle said: \u0026ldquoThere are a wealth of stories about James Bremner. I\u0026rsquom sure there are a lot of people who won\u0026rsquot know them.He explained that only the base of the memorial, which was erected in 1903, was still to be refurbished with the interpretation panels set to complete the whole project.The path along by the memorial is on the Wick section of the John O\u0026rsquoGroats Trail, a 147-mile route from Inverness.Mr Bogle pointed out that interpretation panels were already in place on the stretch of the trail through Wick, with one at the Trinkie. However, two existing panels are being moved to the Braehead and North Head.He said the paths were already proving popular with local people and visitors and the group is keen to provide information about the area.Mr Bogle added that the civil engineer\u0026rsquos gravestone \u0026ndash in the graveyard of Wick St Fergus Church \u0026ndash had also been tidied up recently.Wick Harbour Authority chairman Willie Watt MBE said: \u0026ldquoFor me James Bremner is one of the unsung heroes of Caithness. He is just an amazing character. Nothing was too difficult for him and he treated everybody he worked with the greatest of respect. He was a great leader and motivator.Mr Watt pointed out that one of the Wick engineer\u0026rsquos greatest achievements was the refloating of the SS Great Britain \u0026ndash the largest ship of its time \u0026ndash when she ran aground off Ireland in the 1840s.He said that Mr Bremner was sent for from Wick, along with a few of his men, when other engineers had failed in one of the biggest salvage operations of that era.James Bremner (1784-1856) was born at Stain, Keiss. He was an apprentice in a Greenock shipyard and returned to Wick to establish his own shipbuilding business, constructing over 50 vessels in as many years as well as designing and building many harbours. He was involved in the construction of the breakwater at Wick harbour.A local author, John Mowat, once described Mr Bremner as \u0026ldquothe Ulysses of the north and \u0026ldquoour greatest Caithnessian.Mr Bremner is still remembered in Keiss with a plaque at the harbour erected by the Institution of Civil Engineers.window._taboola = window._taboola || []_taboola.push({mode:\u0027autosized-generated-2r\u0027, container:\u0027taboola-below-main-column\u0027, placement:\u0027below-main-column\u0027})\t\t\t\t\tMore storieswindow._taboola = window._taboola || []_taboola.push({mode: \u0027thumbnails-d\u0027,container: \u0027taboola-below-article-thumbnails\u0027,placement: \u0027Below Article Thumbnails\u0027,target_type: \u0027mix\u0027})\t\t\t\t\tQuick LinksFamily NoticesPropertyJobsMotorsBusiness FinderPhoto SalesSubscriptionse-editionDatingTop 25 Days OutHighlands ExplorerNewsSportFeaturesYour CaithnessHighland HeroesWhat\u0027s OnMusicFilmTravel and TransportWeatherJohn O\u0027Groat JournalFollow us on  Monday 18 Jun 2018 4:37 AMvar addthis_config = {data_ga_property: \u0027UA-25496687-7\u0027}\u0026nbspif (window.adgroupid == undefined) {window.adgroupid = Math.round(Math.random() * 1000)}document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--if (window.adgroupid == undefined) {window.adgroupid = Math.round(Math.random() * 1000)}document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--border=\"0\"if (window.adgroupid == undefined) {window.adgroupid = Math.round(Math.random() * 1000)}document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--border=\"0\"if (window.adgroupid == undefined) {window.adgroupid = Math.round(Math.random() * 1000)}document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--border=\"0\"window.___gcfg = { lang: \u0027en-GB\u0027 }(function() {var po = document.createElement(\u0027script\u0027) po.type = \u0027text/javascript\u0027 po.async = truepo.src = \u0027https://apis.google/js/plusone.js\u0027var s = document.getElementsByTagName(\u0027script\u0027)[0] s.parentNode.insertBefore(po, s)})()MOST COMMENTSMOST POPULARFury over threat to John O\u0027Groats bus link\u0027I wanted to do it for my mum\u0027 says Old Man of Hoy climber Edward (8)Councillor Donnie Mackay joins ConservativesNorth MP calls for action from Sturgeon and May over town centre decline Author takes a road trip through history at Wick illustrated talkJune vents its rage on CaithnessLewis shines for Scotland in CanadaJohn O\u0027Groats go the distance to reach last fourStaxigoe keep their eye on a cup final boostBus users voice concern at threat to \u0027lifeline service\u0027 between Wick and John O\u0027GroatsMarc\u0027s Croatia role gives Caithness a World Cup connectionAuthor takes a road trip through history at Wick illustrated talkBus users voice concern at threat to \u0027lifeline service\u0027 between Wick and John O\u0027GroatsSpecial delivery for retiring Lybster postieJune vents its rage on CaithnessNorth MP calls for action from Sturgeon and May over town centre decline Man dies following collision on A836\u0027I wanted to do it for my mum\u0027 says Old Man of Hoy climber Edward (8)Fury over threat to John O\u0027Groats bus linkNew posts will help hospital patients(function(d, s, id) {var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]if (d.getElementById(id)) {return}js = d.createElement(s) js.id = idjs.src = \"//connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js#xfbml=1\"fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs)}(document, \u0027script\u0027, \u0027facebook-jssdk\u0027))\u0026nbspFollow @GroatNews property-northBuying, selling or renting - we\u0027ve got it coveredjobs-northLooking for a job?
