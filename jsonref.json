[{"url":null,"title":"Dame Judi Dench says theatres NEVER reopen lifetime amid coronavirus lockdown","story":"Share this article Boris Johnson and his Chancellor Rishi Sunak need to think hard about what is at stake here. One top forecasting firm projects that revenue from the creative industries will drop by an astonishing £74billion in 2020 thanks to the coronavirus lockdown. More than 400,000 jobs will be lost by year\u0027s end - simply a human tragedy - and the damage doesn\u0027t stop there. Countless more millions in revenue will be lost to the bars and restaurants that complement theatres and concert halls around the country. At the Theatre Royal, Plymouth, we earn 91 per cent of our annual turnover and take only a 9 per cent government subsidy. At a stroke, all our income except that small subsidy has been lost. Many regional theatres have a reputation for developing acting and writing talent. In Plymouth, I gave Michael Sheen his first directing job at our Drum theatre, while David Suchet and Ben Whishaw have also performed there and James Corden, Michael Ball - a Plymouth lad - and Sir Ian McKellen have played our Lyric stage.  It is a virtuous circle of British creative talent that now circulates around Hollywood and the globe. Now all of that is threatened. South Korea shows us what can be done. It may surprise some to learn that Phantom of the Opera is currently playing in Seoul to packed houses. Cast and patrons have their temperatures taken and apply sanitising gel. Masks are worn. But people sit side by side, with no social distancing. At the beginning of the reopening, only half those Koreans with booked seats were prepared to attend. But after a dozen or so performances, the figure shot up to above 90 per cent. This is the sort of bold thinking that will be necessary to save our industry. Large-scale theatres require attendances of 70 to 80 per cent to break even, so social distancing, even at one metre, is a non-starter. In the immediate term, we need a financial support scheme for the whole sector. But equally important is political leadership. The Prime Minister and his scientific advisers must get behind a new regime that will allow theatres to open again. We need to get back to the business of safely delighting people. Adrian Vinken is chief executive of the Theatre Royal, PlymouthTimes letters: Arts still in peril after the lockdown lifts | Comment | The Times"},{"url":null,"title":"Amber Heard called Elon Musk Rocketman texts","story":"Share this articleShare this articleAmber Heard called Elon Musk her \u0027Rocketman\u0027 in texts while married to Johnny Depp - Mirror OnlineElon Musk denies threesome with Amber Heard and Cara Delevingne"},{"url":null,"title":"Massive cargo ship runs aground trying enter mouth Aberdeen harbour","story":"Share this articleVIDEO: Joint investigation launched after cargo ship runs aground entering Aberdeen Harbour | Press and Journal"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f54ed507203aabe0b98e339d917da33deed420fe/43_81_2915_1749/master/2915.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cdb19a41fc94e32a182f340d362d7234","title":"prince parade cherry moon jeff katz best photograph","story":"‘I took this on the Cote d’Azur where he was filming Under the Cherry Moon surrounded by megastars. He put some music on and said he was good to go. I didn’t have time to be nervous’Early in the autumn of 1985, Prince’s assistant called me and said: “Prince would like you to come to France to be his personal photographer for the new film he’s making.” I packed my bags and jumped on a plane the next day to Studio La Victorine on the French Riviera, to document the filming of Under the Cherry Moon, Prince’s directorial debut. I was only 25 at the time. To this day, I think it’s one of the craziest things I’ve ever done.It wasn’t my first time working with Prince. A few months earlier, Warner Brothers asked me to help him put together the album artwork for some of the smaller bands he was working with. I was mostly shooting his proteges – not Prince himself – but we got to know each other and I learned what he liked.I had shot a few concerts, some bands, but no real celebrities. Then there I was, in the Cote d’Azur, surrounded by megastars. Warner Brothers had assembled the most star-studded crew you could think of: Academy award winners, the best cinematographers in the world, the best set designers – everybody you could imagine was there.I arrived a week before filming got under way and I was in awe. Being in this place where Truffaut had made a number of his films with some of the leading lights of cinema felt like I was witnessing something legendary.There were some technical things like locations and lighting and sets that were still being worked out, so I thought I’d have time to soak it in. I soon learned that Prince didn’t like his time to be idle. He was constantly at work, whether it was playing, recording, shooting a music video or a photo session. In the first week, his assistant announced that the formal photo shoot would take place that day. Two hours later, I was shooting Prince.I didn’t have time to be nervous. The focus that kicked in was what I imagine people who do extreme sports feel. You know if you falter for even a second you will fail. So I focused, intently, and made sure I got what I needed.He led me towards a huge soundstage and we decided to keep things simple: I set up a white background with some unfussy lighting. I was fascinated by stripped-back portraiture at the time so I knew I wanted an image with nothing getting in the way. Prince let hair and makeup fuss over him, and then sent them all out of the room when he was ready. He put some music on a small boombox, and told me he was good to go. Within three rolls of film, I knew I had the shot.I captured exactly what I set out to achieve: something simple, dramatic and iconic. The way the delicacy of his face offsets the muscularity of his stomach and the drama of his hand gestures makes this photo special for me. It ended up on the cover of his album Parade.It was the start of more than a decade photographing Prince. I’ve worked with people of immense talent throughout my career, but nobody compares to him. Prince was Prince from the moment he woke up to the moment he went to sleep: he was meticulous in his art at every moment. Not once did I see him lose his temper or cause a scene, and working with him over such a long time frame allowed me to witness him in so many different iterations. Every year would herald a whole new reinvention, both in his aesthetic and his sound.We parted ways in 1996. It was an amicable split. I didn’t hear from him for years, but we caught up in the early 2010s about making new work. Then, inevitably, he got swept on to a different project, and we never had chance to reconnect after that.When I heard the news of his passing, I didn’t believe it. It sounds absurd, but I just didn’t believe he would die. The man was so endlessly creative that it was impossible to imagine his death. I spent 11 years of my life photographing him. Now, I hope my archive captures something of his inimitable creativity.• Limited-edition prints from Jeff Katz’s archive of Prince are available from his website, princebyjeffkatz.Trained: BA in film and cinema, Ithaca College, New York State.High point: “Being able to do what I love every day.”Low point: “The death of film.”Top tip: “Slow down, think more about your shot, and make something that makes people stop scrolling.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68ca6b3b594fdbca56109b923a9e4e5954ca1c8a/0_320_5715_3429/master/5715.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=64ec5fc8cee6d27981a043504c67df9d","title":"splendid isolation in search of scotlands hermits","story":"Many isolated people have struggled in lockdown, but others enjoy solitude and choose it as a way of life. Here, Elliot Caunce portrays four modern hermits who live off the grid in ScotlandWilliams, 70, moved into his off-grid farmhouse in the 70s, with his then wife and his daughter, Ceilidh, after falling out with his landlord in Aberdeen. When the marriage ended, he stayed on alone, but he is philosophically optimistic about a future relationship: “I was once married and I may well be married again. It’s a big house to be rattling around in by myself.”Down a remote forestry track in Aberdeenshire, his house has no mains electricity, water or conventional sewage system. For a hermit, he is not averse to fame: he featured in the cinema documentary Two Years At Sea by Ben Rivers, appeared on a Frankie Boyle television show and plays folk music at open mic nights.Maitland, 70, is a successful author who writes books about religious fantasy and solitude, informed by her Roman Catholic faith. She spent increasing amounts of time alone when her marriage broke down in 1993. “I went to live in the country. It was here I started to practise solitude and it grew from there. I found I loved it.” She has lived in the remote moorlands of Galloway since 2006.She recognises that living alone in remote countryside could become difficult as she gets older, especially if she becomes unable to drive. She needs a car to fetch supplies and to remove rubbish, as there is no bin collection.McDonald, 65, moved into a tent in 2007, after he was diagnosed with a critical heart condition and told he needed a transplant. He decided to self-isolate on the edge of a loch, to the east of Fort William. “I thought: if I’ve only got a short life expectancy, I’m just going to come out and live in the wild, which is what I was going to do when I retired.” Living in an area without a phone signal or roads, and few hikers, he has become resilient and self-sufficient. Shopping for supplies involves a round trip of 10 miles walking and 50 miles by train.Smith, 74, is known as the Hermit of Loch Treig. He has lived alone in an isolated log cabin, lacking all modern amenities, since 1984. Once a month, he hikes along an active train track to his nearest station, then takes an hour’s ride to Fort William for food and medical supplies. His one concession to modern life is an emergency locator beacon, which he activated in February 2019 after becoming ill – the distress signal was routed via Houston, Texas, to the coastguard and then Lochaber Mountain Rescue he was airlifted to hospital by helicopter."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/782f474623b6dcc280562e0b6a7da5adca3e315f/0_14_4680_2808/master/4680.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b1c49ef46a2a05b4dd7cccb56014502","title":"david levenes glastonbury highlights buy a guardian print","story":"From Bono to a bare stage...  photographer David Levene talks through his favourite Glastonbury shots"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc84426d73dfd98ab17b51072e73e0c9bb378a60/0_0_2953_2214/master/2953.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=a2556e93fa5fa8ef851155f3280c694a","title":"delivering joy meet south londons lockdown book angel","story":"As libraries remain shut, Millie Ginnett has been delivering secondhand books to desperate readers. She talks about trading books for brownies, and which novels have been most popularIn the three months since lockdown began, I’ve spent more on books than I care to admit. But with charity shops and secondhand bookshops shut, donating finished books seemed impossible – until I discovered the South London Book Swap. It is run by Millie Ginnett since she was furloughed from her advertising job in April, and she is bringing joy to the lives of those stuck at home.“Everyone was asking how I was going to make my time on furlough ‘productive’. They were asking, what online courses I was planning to take, was I going to learn a language, none of which I wanted to do,” says Ginnett. “I was burning through books and after swapping a few with a friend, I resorted to buying some – which I knew would get expensive and was unsustainable.”Ginnett, who lives in Tooting with her boyfriend, posted a list of around 20 books on various community support groups, and offered to deliver them as part of her daily exercise. All of them were snapped up that day. So Ginnett set up the South London Book Swap on Facebook. Within two days, she had amassed almost 300 books by collecting them from doorsteps all around south London.“The group has gone from strength to strength, gaining more members every week I feel so privileged to have met and interacted with many amazing people who I maybe never would have had the chance to otherwise,” she says. “One lady gave me some fresh blondies in exchange for her book, and we laughed about how wholesome it was to swap baked goods for books.”Another person gave her wine vouchers, which Ginnett used to celebrate when she hit the 500-book milestone. And there was also a high-speed book drop: “It was a rainy evening and I was meeting a lady on her bus route home. She ran to the front of the bus and grabbed them from me without getting off. The driver was very amused!”Ginnett collects the books from people’s doorsteps, adds them to a spreadsheet, and then photographs them by genre. Books are allocated on a first-come, first-served basis. She wipes down all the books before rehoming them, either by delivering them on her walks, or collection from a box outside her house made by her boyfriend.As libraries remain shut, demand is high, with books such as Queenie by Candice Carty-Williams and The Tattooist of Auschwitz by Heather Morris proving most popular. One week, I managed to bag a copy of Girl, Woman, Other by Bernadine Evaristo. Navigating several school drop-offs meant collection was tricky, so it was a delight to have Ginnett leave it on my doorstep, and to have a socially distanced chat.There are currently 378 people signed up to receive and donate books. The swap has even spawned a sister group in Fiji.Ginnett hopes to continue the group after lockdown ends, but says she may have to find an alternative way to keep it running. “I’m keen to carry the swap on for as long as I can, but once I’m back at work I will struggle to keep up, with the collections, deliveries and admin. We will also have to turn our library back into a spare bedroom as and when we are allowed to have people stay again, which means I would have nowhere to store the books in our small flat.” But with such strong community support, Ginnett is brainstorming all options, including starting a weekend stall or handing the project on to a member.“I’ve had so many touching messages from people who have found it a help during this uncertain and scary time,” she says. “I will keep thinking and working towards ways of keeping it alive.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d7e8b2f373bcbc24dfc1c163d5fd079b4a50b84/0_149_2772_1663/master/2772.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25c8f51eb00f531188b7477744bb0bed","title":"unfinished story by little women author louisa may alcott published for first time","story":"Aunt Nellie’s Diary, from author’s ‘sentimental period’, features in Strand magazine with a call for writers to complete itAn early story from a young Louisa May Alcott, in which the Little Women author writes of two teenage girls vying for the attentions of a handsome young man, has been published for the first time.Written in 1849, when Alcott was 17, Aunt Nellie’s Diary is told from the perspective of a 40-year-old woman bringing up her orphaned niece, Annie. When Annie’s friend Isabel comes to stay, Nellie becomes concerned that the girl’s attractive exterior hides a “darkness within”.“Isabel is not what I thought her. I fear under a fine gay manner of a light laughing face she conceals a cold unfeeling heart, bent only on the accomplishment of her wishes,” writes Alcott in the unfinished story, which appears this week in the Strand magazine.The 9,000-word work, describes both girls fall for the motherless Edward Clifford, who possesses his late “mother’s gentle heart beautifully blended with the calm and noble mind of his father”.It was written almost 20 years before Little Women was published. The Strand’s editor Andrew Gulli said the tale showed how mature Alcott was at a very early age. “She was ahead of her time in many respects, from being a feminist and abolitionist,” said Gulli. “Fans will enjoy the idyllic life portrayed in the novel with picnics, and masked balls, which is a far cry from the life most of are leading today.”Daniel Shealy, professor of English at the University of North Carolina-Charlotte, said the story showed “an emerging talent on the cusp of a promising career”.Alcott would write her first novel, The Inheritance, the same year. The story of an Italian orphan who discovers that her inheritance is the English estate on which she is a paid companion, it was not published until 1997. Together with Aunt Nellie’s Diary, it is part of what Alcott described in her journals as her sentimental period. “I fancy ‘lurid things’, if true and strong also,” Alcott wrote of her literary influences at the time – Charles Dickens, Sir Walter Scott, Charlotte Brontë and Nathaniel Hawthorne. “Aunt Nellie’s Diary shows hints of that love of darker fiction,” writes Shealy in an introduction to the tale.The Strand is calling for writers to put themselves forward to finish the narrative. “Unfortunately, after 9,000 words, the narrative was abandoned, leaving many questions unanswered,” said Gulli. “We’re now looking for authors who think they are up for the task of completing it.”Shealy said: “Good stories always keep readers wanting to turn the pages and Alcott, even in her late teens, knew this well. Aunt Nellie’s Diary, over 170 years after it was penned, now takes its rightful place among Alcott’s earliest works, revealing the promise and talent that would blossom in her celebrated literary career.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d003381bd181ab75e16026c889e90b41c136678c/0_187_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e6ffab2eaefea4eb952b1d792d74b59","title":"center parcs to reopen on 13 july in uk and ireland but pools stay closed","story":"Fewer holidaymakers allowed and activities changed because of physical distancingCenter Parcs is to reopen its UK and Irish holiday “villages” on 13 July – but its pools and spas will stay closed.The company, which shut its five UK centres on 20 March ahead of the coronavirus lockdown, said it would allow visitors to cancel new and existing bookings up to six days before arrival and receive a full refund, as it recognised some would want to reschedule because of changes to its facilities.As well as the closure of pools and spas, Center Parcs said there would be a reduced number of holidaymakers at each venue, changes to some activities to ensure physical distancing in line with government guidelines, extra cleaning and a new takeaway service.Martin Dalby, the chief executive, said: “We know how disappointing it will be for some families that the subtropical swimming paradise isn’t open during their break. We have been planning the changes needed to maintain social distancing and we look forward to reopening these facilities as soon as we are able. However, we know that so many families have been looking forward to their breaks and we are so pleased to be open for the summer.”The company said it was beginning to bring back its 8,500 employees from furlough and train them in new ways of working and safety procedures ahead of reopening.Center Parcs will reopen more than a week after hospitality venues were given the green light to get back to business. Hotels, bed and breakfasts, holiday homes, campsites, caravan parks and boarding houses will be able to open in England from 4 July. Campsites will be given guidance on shared areas such as shower, toilet and washing-up facilities.British businesses are expected to enjoy a boom in trade from staycations over the remains of the summer, as fears about flying abroad as well as quarantine rules put a dampener on overseas trips."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3418873fce60d267bad82e6a375e44601ff1dfb/0_178_5385_3234/master/5385.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea6077048ffa4c32affb22312e12d9de","title":"uk retailers remain gloomy about quick post lockdown bounce back","story":"CBI says retailers fear lower consumer demand, problems from staff absences and transport difficulties will dent salesBritain’s retailers are downbeat about the prospects of a rapid bounce back in business after the easing of Covid-19 restrictions, the CBI has reported.Despite the reopening of non-essential stores from 15 June, retailers fear that a lack of demand and a continued absence of staff due to school closures will leave sales in July well below levels of a year ago.Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI chief economist, said: “With high street shops, department stores and shopping centres reopening across England last week amid some scenes of long queues, you’d be forgiven for thinking retailers’ difficulties are coming to an end. But the health of the retail sector remains in the balance.“Despite retailers working flat out to make sure they are safe and ready to open their doors, outside the grocery sector most retailers expect sales to be far below where they were this time last year.“Enabling these businesses to open is a critical step on the road to restarting our economy and will help support hundreds of thousands of jobs across the UK.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/691ab490cfae444fde14b10d2ee844d7ea038fc5/0_0_5013_3008/master/5013.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4842a3f0a8d0c8d0c67af5a638d7765c","title":"markets ftse covid 19 cases investors retail sales unemployment business live","story":"Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial newsDing ding! US stock traders have returned to the fray after yesterday’s rout, with anxiety over the coronavirus pandemic still swirling.The virus dominates several newspapers today, which could focus minds on the health and economic crisis:This is the 14th week in a row in which new US jobless claims exceed one million - a previously unprecedented level (and indeed scarcely believable before the lockdown).Glassdoor senior economist Daniel Zhao says the US jobs market remains fragile.The labor market continues its lethargic recovery as we see another week of only modest declines in the tens of millions of Americans continuing to claim UI benefits amid an ongoing pandemic. While recent economic indicators like the May jobs report stoked optimism for a swift recovery earlier this month, the slow improvement in continuing claims puts a damper on those high hopes.Looking ahead to the June jobs report next week, we’re likely to see more signs of a labor market only modestly improving, balancing precariously between a speedy V-shaped and a much slower recovery.” Zhao also points out that PUA claims - paid to gig economy workers who are sidelined - are also rising.Some snap reaction to the latest US jobless figures:Slightly more encouragingly, the number of Americans who have been claiming unemployment benefit for at least a fortnight has dropped.This ‘continued claims’ total has dropped from 20.289m to 19.522m - still alarmingly high.Newsflash: Nearly 1.5 million Americans filed new claims for unemployment benefit last week.That’s worse than expected -- economists had expected 1.3m fresh job losses. It’s barely lower than the previous week, when 1.54m initial jobless claims were filed.This suggests America’s economy is struggling to emerge from its slump, and that some companies are still laying staff off.It also means that at least a million Americans have lost their jobs every week since mid-March, when the initial jobless claims smashed the previous record of under 700k.US department store Macy’s has just announced it is cutting 3,900 corporate jobs.The move will save around $364m, Macy’s says, as it tries to cut costs to ride out the coronavirus pandemic.Another blow to America’s labor market, just minutes before we get the latest weekly jobless data....UK retailers are right to be concerned about their sales prospects, says Howard Archer of the EY Item Club.He suspects demand for big-ticket items will remain weak, especially among workers who are currently furloughed....While there may well be a significant initial element of ‘pent-up’ demand for some retailers following their re-opening, further out the upside for may well be capped by cautious consumers.Consumer spending has clearly taken a substantial downturn as a result of COVID-19and is likely to remain under pressure for the near term, at least. Many people have lost their jobs, despite the supportive government measures. while others may be worried about job security once the furlough scheme ends in October.There’s still two hours to go, but Wall Street isn’t expected to bounce back when trading starts.A reminder of the scale of the Wirecard scandal:Cinema-goers will be barred from visiting the pick-n-mix stall when they’re allowed back to the screens next month.The new coronavirus safety measures outlaw cinemas from selling open, unpacked, confectionery, to curb the spread of Covid-19. Disappointment for sweet-toothed film fans, but perhaps a relief for parents who fear they’ll need a second mortgage to fund a handful of fizzy cola bottles.Singalongs are also outlawed because of worries they could encourage aerosol spreading of the virus. So, no chance to warble along to Mamma Mia!, The Rocky Horror Picture Show or The Sound of Music (shame....).Although the FTSE 100 has recovered its earlier losses, there are twice as many fallers as risers on the blue-chip index today.Technology stocks, consumer cyclicals and industrial groups are down, suggesting there is still concern about the impact of rising Covid-19 cases on the economy.Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, says:“Any gains made by equities over the last week or so are being wiped out as concern builds over the increase in coronavirus infections in the US.“Selling which started in Europe on Wednesday spread to the US overnight, not helped by sickly looking US manufacturing numbers.”Apple’s decision to reintroduce store closures in some US cities seems emblematic of the ongoing struggle with the disease in the world’s largest economy.Just in: UK retailers remain very gloomy about their prospects this summer, despite the government’s efforts to reopen the economy.The “vast majority” of retailers expect sales to be lower in July than a year ago, after suffering slumping sales under the lockdown, according to the latest survey from the CBI.Retailers also reported that sales were much poorer in June than a year ago, although not as bad as in May.Here are the key findings from the report:Shares in Wirecard have, predictably, plunged after it applied for insolvency protection (which will presumably wipe investors out).They’re changing hands at just €2.50 each this morning, down from €140 back in January. Many investors will now be wondering why they ignored the warning signs - the Financial Times’ excellent investigation flagged up there was something seriously wrong with Wirecard’s accounts. German financial regulator Bafin is also in hot water, after it banned investors from betting against Wirecard shares and filed criminal charges against the FT! Wirecard may simply have been too important. Europe has long been envious of Silicon Valley’s success, so didn’t want to admit that one of its own rising stars was flawed. Here’s our news story on Wirecard’s fall from grace:The crisis in the airlines industry also deepened overnight, with Australia’s Qantas announcing 6,000 job cuts.The 2,000 job cuts announced at Royal Mail today will hit managers, not posties on the streets.But frontline jobs are also under threat, as my colleague Kalyeena Makortoff explains:CEO Keith Williams described the job cuts as “regrettable”, adding: “We are committed to conducting the upcoming consultation process carefully and sensitively. We will work closely with our managers and their representatives during this difficult period, including supporting them as they transition into the next stage in their careers.”While delivery staff were not targeted by the cuts, Royal Mail confirmed there would be a gradual decline in frontline workers as it started to automate the processing of letters and parcels.Newsflash: German payments company Wirecard has applied to open insolvency proceedings, a week after admitting that €1.9bn is missing from its accounts.The management board of Wirecard AG has decided today to file an application for the opening of insolvency proceedings for Wirecard AG with the competent district court of Munich (Amtsgericht München) due to impending insolvency and over-indebtedness.It is currently evaluated whether insolvency applications have to be filed for subsidiaries of Wirecard Group.Wirecard’s technology handles billions of payments between online retailers and customers each year. CEO Markus Braun was arrested on Monday. Last Thursday, Wirecard admitted the money was missing - having previously denied reports in the Financial Times that its sales and profits were being artificially inflated, misleading auditors for many years.Britain’s stock market has now shrugged off its early losses, driving the FTSE 100 back up towards last night’s close.Investors seem to be cheered by the ECB’s new offer of euro loans to non-eurozone central banks (see previous post)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55540f7b9c4ff264cc5a2fa10c77971843dbc1eb/0_397_6048_3627/master/6048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e4dd5aaa3c23e4c065ebb1161117fe7","title":"dystopia or utopia the future of cities could go either way","story":"Cities are always changing, but rarely as fast as this huge experiment changing how we all live, for better or worseA friend of mine who is a doctor in Ontario, one of the Canadian provinces most affected by coronavirus, told me a fascinating story about what Covid-19 has meant for his work.He had long been an advocate for treating patients remotely, arguing a single group video session on, say, diabetes, could replace dozens of one-on-one consultations and nurse practitioners could be empowered to handle routine medical interventions.Paradoxically, he said, this would actually mean more personal attention for patients as doctors would be freed for the most urgent cases.His colleagues figured he was a dangerous maverick.Then coronavirus struck, the entire medical profession adopted his ideas en masse, and my friend’s clinic is now considered cutting-edge. “The virus forced a real-life experiment that achieved in a month what I’d struggled to argue for 10 years,” he said.If, as appears likely, we don’t get a vaccine that fixes Covid-19 at a stroke, we’ll likely be living with this virus in some time, as we do with influenza.So what does that mean for city life, so truncated these past few months? Is the Covid-19 pandemic a death blow to our cities, a stake driven through the heart of our ideal of dense, communal urban living?Or, like my friend’s experience suggests, is the pandemic an opening, an invitation to do things differently, in all facets of urban life?The dystopian theory, as usual, is the grim one, where many people simply flee. Those who can will either work remotely from a second home, or sell up and move to the suburbs or beyond. Those who cannot – people barely making ends meet on state benefits, or working service jobs that require them to be in place – will be forced to stay. Many will be people of colour, whose vulnerability to the virus is already reflected in data showing that black people are dying at roughly twice the rate of white people. As with the post-war “white flight” to the suburbs, the city centres will be abandoned by those with money, leaving them to crumble and reversing several decades of urban renewal. The old Victorian prejudice that urban density is a hive of disease and immorality will reign once again.With commuting even more miserable than before, more companies will follow Twitter in allowing their employees to work from home for ever. We’ll all get lonelier and more depressed as a result, with lower productivity and fewer of the “weak ties” that social scientists say make cities productive. Home workers will shoulder the costs of home offices.The utopians, however, look at the same apocalypse and see a lot fewer zombies. Cities, they say, badly needed a change of course. Now that we’ve discovered with our own lungs the benefits of less air pollution – Los Angeles has enjoyed its longest streak of “good” air quality days since 1995 – we’ll demand better emissions standards, congestion pricing and more car-free streets. Everyone who can will buy a bike – in fact they already are – as cities from Paris to Bogotá free up car lanes for cycleways. Health, both physical and mental, will improve. Overburdened transit systems will, blissfully, be less like sardine cans. The inevitable decline in transit fares will force governments to properly fund mass transit as a public service, which they should have done from the beginning the cities that don’t do so will immediately lose ground to those that do. Ultra-low emission zones like London’s will grow stronger until the only cars that remain are electric we’ll all be able to join Copenhagen’s pledge to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2025, thereby at least partly mitigating the true danger from which Covid-19 has distracted us: the climate emergency.Remote working will be with us for good, yes, but in the early-internet ideal of the glorious erasure of distance. For staff, it will mean eased childcare concerns and a higher quality of life. Many companies, for their part, will save cash on office space, freeing up money to invest in productivity. Any subsequent downtick in commercial real estate values will be offset because those firms that do still need some office space will likely need more of it: social distancing (at the ’s office in London it’s 2 metres between workstations) requires more floorspace, not less. Co-working spaces for remote workers who lack home offices will proliferate, too. (I’m not sure the return of WeWork qualifies as utopian, but on we go.)Density, far from being the bugbear of cities, will remain their great appeal. As soon as we’ve grown accustomed to wearing masks, as the Japanese do (and maybe even started bowing instead of shaking hands), we’ll find that cities remain the safest places to live: better access to hospitals and community services mean if you do contract Covid-19 you’re in the best hands. The world’s densest cities – Hong Kong, Seoul, Tokyo, Singapore – have handled the virus spectacularly well. Even the fear of transit may abate, as we learn from the cases of Japan or France where it hasn’t generally spread the virus at all.Restaurants will suffer, yes, but faced with the prospect of having no tenants at all, landlords will negotiate on lower rents – further loosening the vice grip of rentier capitalism that Thomas Piketty argues has led to vast inequality. More independent businesses may be able to afford storefront space. Cities like New York (which, if it weren’t for Central Park, would have one of the worst green-space ratios of any metropolis on Earth) will at last invest in parks, pedestrians and public spaces.Indeed, westerners will be forced to embrace the streets again in a way we haven’t for a generation: hanging out in front yards and parks, on stoops and street corners.And if some people, mostly older because of their higher vulnerability to Covid-19, move to the countryside – well what of it? A modest correction to the housing market, which unfairly enriched the boomer generation at the expense of millennials, will finally defang the great cobra of the urban 21st century: gentrification, at last, will have met its match. Will anyone bemoan less social cleansing, or cry for the overseas investors no longer parking their money in wildly overpriced Thameside or Hudson River developments that have helped make homes unaffordable for actual Londoners and New Yorkers?We don’t know. Some data suggest cities are still attractive, such as a study by City Observatory researcher Joe Cortright that property searches for cities went up in April year on year others show increases in searches for smaller towns and country properties. Air pollution has returned but the new cycle lanes remain. The truth is that with governments still terrified to stop spending money, we’re still in phase one.All we know for certain is that cities have been thrown into an experiment we would never otherwise have tried. Given the way things were going, that can’t be entirely a bad thing. Whether you see the results as dystopian or utopian will probably depend a lot on you."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6caffe8627ba3168bac367471542922c7c360fe6/0_281_5792_3475/master/5792.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=27fa1ada16d3308337a323a5386493dd","title":"polish populism evening news public broadcaster presidential election","story":"Poland’s public broadcaster has entered the paranoid realm of the far right. A presidential election shows what is at stakeAs Poland approaches the climax of a presidential election campaign on which the future of its democracy depends, and Donald Trump gives his fellow populist Andrzej Duda electoral help by receiving him in the White House, come with me on a tour through the magical world of the evening News programme on Polish state television (TVP).We start on Sunday 14 June. The first item marks the 80th anniversary of the first deportation of Poles to Auschwitz in 1940. This is indeed a moment worthy of the most solemn remembrance. Too many people around the world forget that innocent and sometimes heroic Poles were the first prisoners in Auschwitz. But in the entire news item, lasting more than four minutes, the words ‘Jewish victims’ do not appear once. Instead, the head of the Institute of National Remembrance tells viewers: “That was the purpose of Auschwitz – that there would never be an independent Poland to murder it.” No other groups of victims are mentioned until the footage of a memorial ceremony in Berlin, where the Polish ambassador to Germany says that from the moment of the creation of Auschwitz “we talk of the Holocaust”.Soon the programme turns to what can only be described as pure election propaganda for the candidate of the ruling Law and Justice party (PiS), Trump’s pal Duda, the country’s current president. Sample:Announcer: Voters speak about the credibility of Andrzej Duda.Unidentified woman: He’s a great patriot and really we need such patriots, and not any of those egoists.After berating Poland’s independent media, the News turns to differences between Duda and the front-running opposition candidate, Rafal Trzaskowski. Now the Jews do get an explicit mention, as the programme characterises the two candidates’ allegedly different responses to Jewish restitution claims, or, as the announcer puts it “giving money back to the Jews for the second world war”.The next day News tells us that President Duda’s “family charter” envisages “the defence of children against LGBT ideology”. Returning to the Jewish restitution theme, the announcer makes this truly despicable claim:And so it goes on, day after day, with the crude, mendacious, repetitive blows characteristic of propaganda. (Watch the original broadcasts here.)Polish state television makes Fox News look like the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. It is still notionally meant to be a public service broadcaster, but since the Law and Justice party won both parliamentary and presidential elections five years ago it has become a partisan mouthpiece, widely known as “TVPiS”. With the ruling party obviously rattled by the Trzaskowski challenge, it has now plumbed new depths.I have been writing about Poland for more than 40 years and have constantly struggled against a widespread western stereotype of this fascinating, complicated country as stiff-necked, narrow-minded, reactionary, nationalist and antisemitic. Now here is state television comprehensively reinforcing that stereotype. Professedly defending Poland’s good name, TVP is besmirching it. Detecting anti-Polish forces everywhere, it is itself an anti-Polish force, doing serious damage to the country’s reputation in the world.What can be done about this? First, Polish voters will have the chance, probably in a second round of the presidential election on 12 July, to vote out Duda, who – disappointing early hopes that he might show statesmanlike independence – has proved to be a PiS-man through and through. The issue here is not whether undecided swing voters particularly like Trzaskowski, let alone his Civic Platform party, which many are fed up with. It is whether Poland will have some counterbalance at the highest level to prevent further damage to the rule of law, democracy and the country’s international standing. For if Duda is reelected, PiS will have three years without significant elections in which to do to Polish democracy what Viktor Orbán has already done to Hungarian democracy – emasculate it.Second, we need to defend media pluralism. Media scholars distinguish between internal and external pluralism. Internal pluralism means you get a wide range of political views inside one channel, radio station, newspaper or online platform. (Think BBC.) External pluralism means different political tendencies are represented by separate channels, stations etc. Internal pluralism is better because a truly liberal democracy requires informed citizens who are exposed to a wide range of facts, arguments and opinions even if they only watch one channel. But in Poland that was never fully realised after 1989 – public television was always inclined to sway under pressure from governing parties, although incomparably less crudely than today – and the chances of achieving it are now remote.All the more vital, then, to keep the external pluralism that the country does still enjoy. There are newspapers such as the historic Gazeta Wyborcza, weeklies such as the Polish Newsweek, online platforms such as onet.pl, and the independent journalism site oko.press, which recently won Index on Censorship’s Freedom of Expression award. And there is a major independent TV channel, TVN, which is owned by the US-based Discovery channel. I often watch TVN24’s evening news programme, Facts, which has roughly the same number of viewers as News. Facts is not BBC-style impartial: it clearly favours a more liberal, pro-European Poland and is strongly anti-PiS. But unlike the so-called News, it is still definitely professional, high quality, reality-based journalism. (Think something between CNN and MSNBC.)A defeat for PiS-man Duda in this election could stop Poland descending all the way down the Hungarian path, and that would have positive implications for the whole of Europe. But even then, the long-term future of democracy in Poland will depend on defending free and erse media."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/185f5d8db953310dfe67c12c02bb603aa52857d4/0_82_6016_3609/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73324e3e9ce732d0ca334990b68f2a03","title":"tell us how do you feel about cinemas museums and galleries reopening","story":"We’d like to hear your thoughts about returning to cultural venues in England after the coronavirus lockdown Cinemas, museums and art galleries in England will be able to re-open on 4 July after the easing of lockdown rules.Theatres and concert halls can also open their doors again, but only to show previous works on a screen.

By setting up new schemes to insulate homes, raise carbon taxes, switch to electric vehicles and improve broadband, the government could spur a green recovery to create jobs and cut emissions permanently.The CCC found that the lack of clear leadership and direction from the prime minister was at the heart of the problem, just as the world was looking to the UK as host of the next UN climate summit.Boris Johnson has chaired only one meeting of the cabinet committee on climate change since taking personal charge of the issue last October, with the government’s statutory advisers urging him to convene the group more often, as a matter of urgency, if the UK is to meet its 2050 net zero carbon target, which is off track.Deben added: “We have to do this as rapidly as possible – this window of opportunity is closing clearly. What we do not want is a lot of good-hearted statements about beginning policies – what we need to do is seize the opportunity.”Delay in the government’s regulations for housebuilding had already resulted in 1 million new homes that were “not fit for purpose” because they had been built to old inefficient standards, he said. They would all have to be retrofitted for energy efficiency at extra cost.“That’s what happens if you don’t take these measures,” he said.The “central role” of the cabinet committee on climate change, which Johnson said last October would spearhead a cross-government push to bring down emissions, is mentioned 10 times in the CCC’s 196-page progress report to parliament, published on Thursday.The cabinet committee’s one meeting, chaired by Johnson, was in March, the  has established, and a second meeting is planned in the near future. Details are scant as the government has said it does not intend to report publicly on the committee meetings.Insiders told the  that despite the government’s public commitment to net zero carbon emissions, the lack of leadership was severely hampering the UK’s ability to meet its carbon targets and its credibility as host of next year’s UN Cop26 climate summit.“We are not being given a good lead by the prime minister and this is really undermining our ability to move things on,” said Tom Burke, co-founder of the environment thinktank E3G and a veteran government adviser. “What binds any institution, but especially the government, is leadership, and if you don’t get leadership, then people go off in different directions.”He called for Johnson to take personal control. “The point of setting up a cabinet committee is to signal the importance of the issue for the government. If you don’t follow up that signal by using the device you created, you tell people you are more interested in the headline than in the outcome.”Other recommendations in the CCC report include:The report sets out 29 milestones for the government to reach by 2030, as well as more than 130 detailed policy recommendations covering each government department. Ministers must respond to the report by 15 October.A government spokesperson said: “We agree with the CCC that tackling climate change should be at the heart of our economic recovery. We were the first major economy to commit to achieving net zero emissions by 2050 and want to ensure the UK has the most ambitious environmental programme of any country on earth.”Green campaigners called on ministers to act urgently, as the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, prepared a statement on the post-coronavirus economic rescue package for early next month. Rosie Rogers, head of green recovery at Greenpeace UK, said: “The likes of energy, efficiency, cycling and saving peatlands are essential, not nice-to-have measures. The CCC have shown the government where they need to put their money, and all eyes are now on the chancellor to make it happen.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea9476a6c2b341f0cf592889835df020afd15b67/0_0_5617_3371/master/5617.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bec39e5b3a35e92dc348cdf19859920d","title":"what the west midlands is getting right and wrong for cycling","story":"The region has made progress in getting people on to bikes, but where’s the ambition?When the mayor of the West Midlands, Andy Street, stood on an unlit section of towpath opposite what appeared to be an abandoned warehouse recently and hailed a “big summer for cycling and walking”, it was perhaps worryingly symbolic. That Friday, hours after Street invited us to “come cycle Birmingham’s canals”, at least two women were pushed into Birmingham waterways by a group of young men.The West Midlands is proud of its industrial heritage, but unlit, isolated towpaths are no replacement for a cycle network that safely takes people places they want to be.Happily, another part of the region’s heritage is the modern bicycle, invented on Street’s patch by JK Starley in Coventry in 1884, kickstarting an era of bike manufacturing in the region.Street, the former boss of John Lewis, was elected the region’s Conservative mayor in May 2017. Improvement of the region’s canal network aside, just four miles of protected on-road cycle routes have been built by Birmingham since, and those were funded via the city council rather than Street’s combined authority. Birmingham may have bold plans to cut unnecessary car use, but there are concerns too little is being done to help people cycle in the region.The West Midlands was given £17.2m from the government’s emergency active travel fund in May, £3.4m to be spent in the next two months on 47 projects including a pop-up cycle route from Coventry city centre to the canal basin, bike parking and cycle training. How the remaining £13.6m will be spent is still under discussion with the region’s seven council leaders.Street’s team will top that up with a £23m pot granted by government last year. Of that sum, £15m was already assigned to four main projects, three alongside rapid bus or metro extensions for delivery in 2022 or 2023 and a route between Coventry University and University hospital, now being brought forward to start this year. Community projects were allocated £2m.In the long term, West Midlands’ 200km region-wide “route network plan” lacks the scope, the cohesive branding or urgency of Street’s colleagues’ plans in Manchester – the 1,800-mile £1.5bn Bee network Sheffield – 620 miles of walking and cycling routes and Leicester, which is currently adding a mile a week to its active travel network.Then there’s confusion over the contract of Street’s cycling and walking ambassador, the former world champion cyclist Shanaze Reade, which her agent says Transport for West Midlands decided not to renew last month. Street, however, insists “her contract’s been extended, so as far as I’m concerned, we have a cycling champion”. Street’s press department said they are looking to work with Reade “ad hoc” in what sounds like a zero-hours version of roles held by counterparts Chris Boardman in Manchester and Sarah Storey in Sheffield.As mayor it’s Street’s job to cheerlead for investment in the region and to allocate government funding for the seven councils to spend, but he seems to be talking cycling down while saying “the best way of getting people out of their cars is to invest in rail and that is what we want to do“. He is also still banging a drum for the car industry, a major employer in the region.More worryingly, a document published this week detailing the region’s post-coronavirus recovery plans and setting out requests for funding from central government makes only a single passing mention of cycling. This may be a missed opportunity, given the government has explicitly told local councils they must support walking and cycling in any plans.It’s fair to say the region hasn’t had the cycling investment London has enjoyed, and high-quality routes are not always cheap – though they still cost a fraction of the amounts pledged to road building. Street says Birmingham’s two protected routes cost £60m, although Birmingham city council’s website says they cost £12.4m, including a city-centre link. Either way, with the £23m pot alone, they have £10 per head to spend on cycling in the next year, a lot more than most UK cities.Street’s own government has said it wants to “decarbonise transport” and reduce car use, and Boris Johnson has called for a “golden age of cycling”.Street says with the money available, current cycling plans are realistic. But are they really ambitious? His response: “The evidence of that is, once we’ve got just this little bit of emergency funding, how imaginatively, quickly, in a united way – no political difficulties over this – all of our boroughs have got behind the opportunity.“There is no lack of desire or ambition. It’s a question of how rapidly we can assemble the funding, as it was not here historically. I actually think we’ve done a pretty decent job.”It’s good to hear this, and there is progress. The region’s bike hire scheme, NextBike, foundered last year after supplier issues led to the contract being terminated, which Street says was a frustration. A new supplier will be chosen in July and “we will be rolling that out through this year”, he said.Street’s position, like other city mayors, is in limbo, with elections postponed during the coronavirus crisis. This leaves him a choice: He can talk up cycling as a viable means of mass transport, or he can keep it a minority pursuit to be delivered while keeping cycles on towpaths out of the way of cars.If he wants the former, that means having a big vision for it, as he does with his £15bn public transport network. He could learn from counterparts in Manchester, Leicester, Sheffield and indeed London – think, talk and plan big for cycling, ready for the next round of funding when it comes, which it will. He could realise the huge potential for cycling in the region by planning a genuine network of safe, protected cycle routes on roads – the network that already takes people where they want to go.The potential is huge, but now is the time for deeds to match words."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f0a53a5eabd44b4f662b2966839007efed38fd5/0_0_4561_2739/master/4561.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14f51266c1dcb4c0139caf4613327672","title":"glastonbury is 50 the best style moments in pictures","story":"From Kate Moss’s mini-minidress in 2004 to Lizzo in lilac sequins and Dennis Brown’s 80s double denim, here are 35 great looks seen at Worthy Farm over the years"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c16a1488ae3c1bceee698c37ab185f10d694789/849_0_2143_1286/master/2143.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=650534dcd528f1152508677236d29d91","title":"julie walters best film performances ranked","story":"With her latest film, The Secret Garden, arriving in August, here’s a look at Walters’ greatest big-screen roles – from Educating Rita to PaddingtonLewis Gilbert directed Walters in her seminal movie debut, Educating Rita, and although this stagey and subdued film (Gilbert’s last) doesn’t have anything like the fizz of that, Walters gives it her considerable best. She is the eldest of three sisters uneasily reunited for their mother’s funeral (the other two are Joanne Whalley and Victoria Hamilton). Walters is Teresa, a housewife devoted to her mother’s memory and very domineering when it comes to her husband, played by Tom Wilkinson. A strong character performance.It’s a tearjerker and a heartwarmer these things can be a bit formulaic, but Walters puts some heat under this. She is Jackie, the funny, lippy mate of Dawn, played by Brenda Blethyn, who is a lot quieter and devoted to her family. When Dawn gets cancer, Jackie decides the best thing is for the two of them to go on a massive girls-night-out trip to Las Vegas, using Dawn’s recent winnings from the bingo. In many ways, the emotional dynamic is similar to Calendar Girls, but this is likable stuff.This film and its 2017 sequel were tremendous treats, and there was surely never any doubt as to who was going to play Mrs Bird, who in Michael Bond’s original books was the Brown family’s no-nonsense housekeeper, keeping a keen eye on Paddington’s misdemeanours. Walters plays the role very nicely, and in fact Mrs Bird’s existence has been updated a bit – she is now a sort of vaguely defined family friend or distant cousin – although there isn’t much for her to do.This was Richard E Grant’s bittersweet movie memoir of his boyhood in Swaziland in southern Africa in the late 60s, just before independence. The grownups were the sun-dried white colonialists, bored, alcoholic, adulterous, casually racist. Nicholas Hoult plays the lonely teen Ralph (a version of Grant) and Walters pinches every scene as “Auntie” Gwen, who enjoys jokes about liking drinks “stiff” and whose husband is having an affair with Ralph’s mother.Walters has a very brief role in this superlative film, but she makes it count. She plays Elsie Orton, the mother of the dramatist Joe Orton (Gary Oldman), who is flustered when a council official comes round to congratulate Joe on his theatrical talent. She gestures at Joe’s father, saying: “That’s my husband, ignore him.” Walters continues to take a bite out of this film even after her character is dead. Elsie wore a complete set of false teeth and after her demise, Joe gives these teeth as a prop to the female actor playing a fictional version of her in his new play.Another “mum” role for Walters, but with a seriousness and tenderness that movie screenwriters don’t often let her show. She is Marion, the mother of Rose, played by Jessie Buckley, a young woman with two kids who has been in trouble with the law and now lives with her mum under house arrest, wearing an ankle bracelet. But Rose has got a brilliant singing voice and a passion for country music, so it seems that it’s Marion’s job to look after her children while Rose chases the showbiz dream. Walters conveys Marion’s complex mix of frustration and love.Walters plays June, the poignantly disaffected wife of Buster Edwards, one of Britain’s “Great Train Robbery” gang who stole millions in 1963 and – although unarmed – brutally coshed the train driver, who never fully recovered. Walters has a nice rapport with Phil Collins playing Buster and with Sheila Hancock as her mother. When she and Buster have to be extradition exiles in Brazil, she is stricken with homesickness and returns to Blighty before, finally, Buster comes back to be with her. Not a masterpiece, perhaps, but Walters is very good at selling a motherlywifely role with wit.In this true-life drama, Walters offers another of the quietly modulated supporting-character turns that have lent substance to so many movies. This one has a subtle complexity – and she was reunited with Jamie Bell, with whom she had a glorious performance in Billy Elliot. She plays Bella, the Liverpool-dwelling mother of Peter Turner (Bell), the young actor who in the late 70s was having an age-gap love-affair with the famed Hollywood star Gloria Grahame, played by Annette Bening. Long after their relationship has come to a painful end, the ageing and deeply unwell movie star poignantly asks to stay with Peter’s mum and dad. Walters shows how Bella, initially a kind of rival to the quasi-maternal Gloria, in effect becomes a caring mum for her.Walters plays the mother of Jane Austen in a speculative biopic that, with pastiche-Austen protocol, imagines the possibility that Austen had a real-life romance with a young Irish lawyer, played by James McAvoy. Walters’s Mrs Austen says things such as: “Affection is desirable money is absolutely indispensable.” But Walters’s most startling moment comes when Jane’s father, Rev George Austen (James Cromwell) snuggles down in the marital bed to perform an act of oral love on Jane’s mother. With the cares of so many children, it was perhaps the only intimacy he considered prudent.This is a juicy, nasty role for Walters in an interesting film scripted by Emma Thompson: the overbearing and malevolent figure Mrs Ruskin, mother of the great Victorian art critic John Ruskin (played by Greg Wise). She icily disapproves of his marriage to an impudent young woman, Effie Gray (Dakota Fanning) – a marriage that was famously to founder on the wedding night, due to Ruskin’s apparent fastidious horror that a real woman’s body was different from the classical nude. Walters is ferociously hostile to Effie and brings an effortless air of malign contempt.The real-life murder case from France that inspired Jean Genet’s The Maids was also the source of Wendy Kesselman’s 1988 play My Sister in This House, which she adapted for the screen with Nancy Meckler directing. The result is a strange, stylised, claustrophobically dark satirical drama. Walters plays the unspeakable Mme Danzard – smug, wealthy, entitled – who lives with her pampered daughter, Isabelle (Sophie Thursfield). Their relationship is bizarre, dysfunctional and unfolds in tandem with that of their sensuous, mutinous maids (played by Jodhi May and Joely Richardson). The power dynamic explodes in violence. Walters provides a discreet, potent spark.Walters gave what some believe was one of her most underrated performances in this bizarre blackly comic crime drama based on the macabre real-life case of Albert Goozee, who in 1956 murdered his landlady and her teenage daughter. (Having been freed from Broadmoor in 1971, he was convicted of another sexual assault case in 1996, the year of this film’s release, which could account for its muted reception.) Walters gives a powerhouse serio-comic turn as Marjorie, a bustling and sexually repressed landlady having an oedipal affair with her young lodger (Rupert Graves) while involving her teenaged daughter in this unwholesome ménage-à-trois. Walters has a fierce, driven presence.Walters has an enormous amount of fun with her role here – as do the audience. She plays “Dame” Evie Walton, a terribly grand retired star of stage and screen (although her damehood seems to exist only in her head) who towards the end of her career only appeared in Acorn-Antiques-type telly, and now spends her time declaiming Shakespeare in her back garden. She hires a nervy young assistant (played by Rupert Grint) and insists that he drive her everywhere in Miss Daisy style, despite the fact that he is only a learner himself. This shy and lonely young man finds an unexpected friend and ally in Dame Evie.There may not be a very big role for Walters here, but if ever an actor was utterly in tune with the feel, the tone and the audience of a big movie franchise it is Walters in Mamma Mia! and the distinctively weirder Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again (2018), the colossally corny yet lucrative and widely adored jukebox musicals based on the songs of Abba. Walters radiates fun and humour, playing Rosie – who along with Tanya (Christine Baranski) is the best friend and former bandmate of Donna (Meryl Streep) who was in a group called Donna and the Dynamos. Walters is an important dilithium crystal powering the film.A cracking performance from Walters in a movie that was to become a feelgood pop culture phenomenon, both in the cinema and on the London stage. It is based on the true story of the Rylstone and District branch of the WI in Yorkshire, which becomes a media sensation after bringing out a cheeky semi-nude calendar to raise money for a local hospital. Walters plays Annie, the tough widow behind everything, her gutsy humour and fierce common sense concealing her hurt and vulnerability. Helen Mirren plays Chris, her fearless mate, with whom she has an awful row when the Calendar Girls become an international and over-commercialised hit.Harry Potter is famously a hero all alone in the world an orphan. And so there could hardly be a more important or quasi-maternal figure to the youthful Harry, at least at first, than the mum of his mate Ron Weasley – that is, Molly Weasley, played by Walters, who is crucially to introduce Harry to the mystery of Platform 9¾. Walters was in seven out of the eight Potter films and her apotheosis came in the final movie, in which Molly takes on the death eater Lieutenant Bellatrix Lestrange (played by Helena Bonham Carter) when Bellatrix nearly kills her daughter, Ginny. “Not my daughter, you bitch!” snarls Walters and there is an epic wand duel between the two of them.Walters delivered a glorious blast of focused comedy in this heartfelt drama, based on the Colm Toibin novel, with Saoirse Ronan as Eilis, a shy young woman who emigrates from 50s Ireland and finds herself in New York, where she finds love with an Italian boy. Her landlady is the sharp-tongued Mrs Kehoe, sumptuously played by Walters, who presides over a nightly dinner that all her young tenant ladies are expected to attend. She is on the lookout for any sign of giggly flightiness. “I’ll tell you this much,” Kehoe snaps. “I am going to ask Father Flood to preach a sermon on the dangers of giddiness. I now see that giddiness is the eighth deadly sin. A giddy girl is every bit as evil as a slothful man, and the noise she makes is a lot worse!”This was the one of the great performances from Walters in this subversively unsexy sex comedy, all about the joyless hypocrisy of the British approach to sex. She plays Christine Painter, based on the real-life suburban “madam” and brothel keeper Cynthia Payne. Her Christine is an essentially placid soul who rises from being a waitress to hosting regular “parties” that are bizarrely ordinary in their outlook, offering tea and cooked breakfasts to follow whatever pervy shenanigans are demanded by her clients, who include high court judges. Walters plays a woman who presides over a world, not of exciting erotica, but absurdly tacky and dull kitchen-sink drear.This was the sensational and Oscar-nominated performance, in a movie adapted from Willy Russell’s stage hit, that launched the 33-year-old Walters towards becoming a national treasure, although not to the international stardom that appeared at first to be possible. Walters (wise and sane as always) decided that Hollywood was not for her. It was perhaps the only movie role in which she was a young and quasi-romantic female lead – playing a tough working-class autodidact called Susan, who has rechristened herself after the feminist author Rita Mae Brown. She attends night-school tutorials run by a boozy and disillusioned old humanities professor, wonderfully played by Michael Caine, and demands instruction in English literature. Her heartbreaking trust and naivety in his abilities and the power of literature itself causes Caine’s raddled old don to question himself and fall in love with her. Walters delivered a spiky megavolt jolt to the movie, and perhaps to the stagnant world of Brit cinema generally with her fierce and passionate performance.“Miss, you don’t fancy me, do you?” “No, Billy. Funnily enough, I don’t. Now piss off!” Walters’s delivery of her line, holding on the pause with masterly skill, and then rebuking Billy for his presumption while keeping it light, showed her control of this great role. She plays Mrs Wilkinson, the dance teacher into whose class young Billy (Jamie Bell) accidentally strays while supposedly taking boxing lessons next door and in which he shows precious talent. The exchange comes when Mrs Wilkinson tells Billy: “For some time now I’ve been thinking about the Royal Ballet school.” – “Aren’t you a bit old, miss?” “No, not me, YOU! I’m the BLOODY TEACHER!”Walters and Bell had a wonderful rapport in this film, and were, apart from everything else, a great comedy double act. She takes it upon herself to teach him and in some ways she is a redeemed, hopeful version of Caine’s professor in Educating Rita. And her relationship with Billy reaches its high point in the outstanding dance scene they have together to the accompaniment of T Rex’s I Love to Boogie. It’s a modern Brit cinema classic – an irresistibly funny, lovable sequence, perhaps because Walters is not, in fact, a natural dancer. But she gives it everything she’s got and the result is genuinely joyful."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d45203a1590564987d3acb126d7a63dcfdb2eeb/0_0_5107_3065/master/5107.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=0498a21f477913cbd2c325b39db7298c","title":"how to make the perfect flammekueche recipe felicity cloake","story":"AKA tarte flambée, flammekueche is a Franco-German version of pizza, with almost as many versions. Luckily, our resident perfectionist has tried more than her fair share ...Flammekueche (flammeküeche, flammeküche, flammenkueche and flammenküche are also permitted by France’s Le Robert dictionaries) is a traditional speciality of the Franco-German borderlands, Alsace-Lorraine on one side, Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate on the other. It’s also known, especially outside the region, as tarte à la flamme or tarte flambée, though no alcohol is involved in its production – as the name suggests, it’s a tart, albeit one that’s cooked quickly in a hot oven much like a pizza, then topped with distinctly un-Italian combination of salt pork and soured cream.It is, however, often enjoyed with alcohol, and pairs particularly well with a chilled glass of crisp riesling or pinot blanc – preferably local, sitting at a cafe in a half-timbered square festooned with geraniums, happily watching the world go by.\u0026nbspFlammekueche recipes seem to fall into two camps: those that use bread dough and those that opt for an unleavened pastry. The latter is, in my experience, more common these days – despite being a committed consumer of the stuff, I’m not sure I’ve ever had a bread-based example on either side of the border.\u0026nbspSince that other regional speciality, the quiche lorraine, was also once made from leftover bread dough, it seems likely to me that this is the older variation, a theory backed up by its inclusion in a 1981 collection of recipes from a French television series exploring the nation’s culinary traditions, Les Recettes de Mon Village. A Monsieur Kohln, from Erstein in the Bas-Rhin, calls simply for “bread dough”, as does the late Paul Bocuse, widely considered to be one of the most important French chefs of the last century – though he hailed from farther south-west. Both versions are delicious in the same way that a pizza is, but with such rich toppings, the whole thing is unapologetically hefty. Great as a main dish, as the gloss in the tie-in recipe book to the French television programme suggests, but a bit much as a snack with drinks, which is how I’m used to consuming flammekueche.Another celebrated and much-mourned chef, Michel Roux, suggests using puff pastry in his book The Essence of French Cooking, while Gabriel Kreuther, a native of Niederschaeffolsheim now picking up Michelin stars in New York, makes a kind of flatbread, raised with baking powder and enriched with egg yolks. Puff pastry, to my mind – though a temptingly easy option if you buy it ready-made – turns this into just another tart. And the yolks make Kreuther’s base too soft and flaky for the job. The base that comes closest to those I’ve enjoyed in Alsace comes from the association of local winemakers and uses plain flour and a little oil, but no raising agent, giving it a winningly crisp texture that makes it the perfect foil for the rich dairy and pork on top.If you live in France, of course, you’ll probably be able to buy excellent dough at your local supermarket. No judgment here it’s not as if it’s the only ingredient we’re missing out on on this side of the Channel. Whatever you use, bear in mind that this is a dish traditionally baked in a bread oven, so, as with pizzas, you’ll need to crank up your home machine. I’d also recommend heating the baking tray, too, to help the middle of the base cook through before the edges burn to a cinder in the furnace.\u0026nbspIf this were a pizza, it would be a pizza bianca, with dairy replacing the familiar tomato sauce. Roux uses double cream mixed with a little lemon juice, presumably to simulate the tangy richness of creme fraiche, but if the latter, which is thicker and more interesting, is available, I’d choose that instead. Vins d’Alsace, the official site of the wine-growing area, mixes the cream with fromage blanc, a milky young cheese with a gentle acidity that’s all but impossible to find in this country. After many experiments, I’ve settled on drained whole Greek yoghurt as a decent, if imperfect substitute, or you could try Kreuther’s cream cheese, but really, if creme fraiche alone is good enough for Monsieur Kohln, it’s good enough for me.\u0026nbspInterestingly, Strasbourg textile designer and blogger Frédérique Froidevaux advises those watching their figure to use a mixture of half creme fraiche and half fromage blanc for a lighter result, explaining that, in the past, the cheaper fromage blanc was used alone. If you don’t add much, however – and I don’t think you need much – there’s no need to dilute it. I would mix it with some of the other toppings before spreading it, though it makes it go further and stops the onions from drying out.There’s very little variation here: onions and cured pork are the order of the day. Cut the former as thinly as possible and, to keep them nice and sweet, soften them in butter first, as both Monsieur Kohln and Vins d’Alsace suggest. I’d do the same for the pork, too, though it’s less important – fry it before the onions, so they can benefit from any rendered fat.That pork doesn’t have to be smoked, but for reasons of flavour, I’d strongly urge you to make sure it is the same goes for finding a cut with a decent amount of fat. That means streaky, rather than back – and go for lardons or slab bacon, if either is available the wafer-thin, cruelly trimmed slices favoured by British supermarkets these days will burn to a crisp in the oven.\u0026nbspRick Stein adds grated cheese (emmental or gruyère) in his latest book, Secret France, which makes his, strictly speaking, a flammekueche gratinée, while Froidevaux informs me that fresh mushrooms would make it a flammekueche forestière (perhaps a good option for those who don’t eat pork) a sweet spin can be made with stewed apple and sliced fruit. In fact, I’m sure you could put almost anything on there but, as with pizzas, that doesn’t necessarily mean you should.\u0026nbspRoux adds thyme to his tart, a flavour that works well with the other ingredients, but the warmth of nutmeg favoured by Kohln, Kreuther and Vins d’Alsace is even better. Most recipes are finished with a drizzle of oil but, for once, I don’t think it needs any extra fat. That said, to each their own.\u0026nbsp250g flour, preferably strong white bread½ tsp salt, plus extra for seasoning150ml water50ml neutral oil1 tbsp butter100g smoked streaky bacon or pancetta, preferably in one piece, or chunky lardons1 large onion75g creme fraiche1 good grating nutmegStart by making the base. Mix the flour and salt in a large bowl. In a jug, whisk the water and oil, then stir into the flour bowl and mix until you have a smooth dough. Continue mixing until it feels elastic, then cover and leave to rest for an hour.Meanwhile, peel and finely slice the onion (if you have one, a mandoline would be helpful here) and, if necessary, cut the bacon into chunky pieces.Melt the butter in a frying pan over a medium heat, fry the bacon until the fat begins to render, then scoop out with a slotted spoon and set aside, keeping as much fat in the pan as possible. Turn down the heat and fry the onions with a pinch of salt until soft and golden, but not browned.\u0026nbspHeat the oven, and a lightly greased baking tray, to 250C (conventional and fan)gas 9, or as hot as it will go. Mix the creme fraiche into the onions and season generously with nutmeg.\u0026nbspOn a lightly floured surface, roll or stretch out the dough into a rectangle or circle as close to 1mm thick as you can get it. Take the hot baking tray out of the oven, carefully transfer the base to it, then spread the onion mixture over the surface.\u0026nbspScatter the lardons all over the top, then bake for about 12 minutes, until the edges are crisp and well browned (the timings will depend on how hot your oven gets, so keep a beady eye on it). Cut into squares and serve immediately.\u0026nbsp• Flammekueche or tarte flambée – whatever you call it, how do you like yours? Bready or crunchy, creamy or cheesy – and where did you have the best one you’ve ever eaten? (I have happy memories of one eaten standing up at a wine festival in Colmar.)

The Arsenal goalkeeper was 22 when, in November 2014, injuries to Wojciech Szczesny and David Ospina afforded him his first crack at the top level. He was outstanding in a win over Borussia Dortmund before keeping clean sheets against West Brom and Southampton. Arsène Wenger was sufficiently impressed to decide that, if another three points followed at the then Britannia Stadium, the imposing youngster would keep his place despite Szczesny’s return. But Arsenal crumbled in familiar fashion and, while little blame could be attached to Martínez in their 3-2 defeat, Wenger reverted to what he knew.Until last Saturday, when Bernd Leno’s injury necessitated a 50-minute outing as a substitute, Martínez had made only made two further appearances in the Premier League. Now he has a chance to amass at least another eight, with Leno almost certainly sidelined for the rest of the campaign, and those who have worked with him during his decade in north London are adamant that he is no stopgap Martínez, they say, has what it takes to become Arsenal’s long-term No 1.Mikel Arteta agreed on Tuesday, pointing out that anyone who was not ready to become first choice “wouldn’t be the No 1 at Arsenal”. The nagging doubt, looking objectively at the career of a 27-year-old with only 90 professional appearances and 26 for his parent club, is that something must be wrong: is the player ambitious or, for that matter, good enough? But there would be few eyebrows raised within the club if Martínez used his own stroke of fortune and pushed seriously for the position he has never written off.Martínez came to Arsenal’s attention during the 2009 South American Under-17 Championship in the Chilean city of Iquique. Their scout Francis Cagigao – who turned up Cesc Fàbregas and Gabriel Martinelli, and is the now the head of recruitment – had another target in mind before Martínez, drafted into Argentina’s side due to an injury, staked his claim. He was brought to London for a two-day audition with the then goalkeeping coach Gerry Peyton upon turning 18 and quickly signed from Independiente for a sum that – including a sizeable appearance-related fee paid this season – stands at around £1m.Arsenal’s staff had a good feeling about Martínez. They liked the way he used his 6ft 4in frame maturely for one so young and saw the potential of his laser-like “side kick”, a technique often seen in Latin American goalkeepers. The raw materials were present in bundles and so, according to one figure closely involved at the time, was “an inner hardness” that he has certainly gone on to need.While Szczesny, Ospina, Lukasz Fabianski, Vito Mannone, Jens Lehmann, Manuel Almunia and Petr Cech have been and gone, Martínez was shuttled around on six loans, the time never quite right to give him a serious first-team opportunity upon returning from any. He was lent to Rotherham, then struggling in the Championship, for the end of that 2014-15 season, with Arsenal’s coaches telling their second-tier counterparts in complete seriousness he would keep them up. They were not wrong, but other moves did not go as well. He began well at Wolves before hurting a thigh and a season with Getafe went less successfully than hoped, five La Liga appearances proving considerably fewer than Arsenal had been led to expect.But Reading were hugely impressed during an 18-game spell last season and Martínez returned to north London with a bounce. “When I was playing for Reading, I got this feeling of being the No 1 – and I want that at Arsenal,” he said in an interview with the club’s website last September. One school of thought around Arsenal’s training ground has been that previous goalkeepers were, in some cases, pitched into action too early. Martínez has bided his time and is deemed a more rounded inidual than some of his predecessors, living an uncomplicated family life and making plenty of allies with his sunny, yet focused, disposition.If he can convince at St Mary’s on Thursday, and help Arsenal revive their push for the European places, then he will quickly forge thousands more friendships. Another close associate of Martínez points out that goalkeepers have become so durable over the last two decades that the mid-to-late 20s can still be considered a relatively young age, emphasising that none of his coaches has doubted his potential to become first choice. Now, half a decade after seeing a leaky back line sieve his chance in the Potteries, he finally has the opportunity to prove them right."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa8afcfcc31803eaf94b204c6b4291a85ddd241b/0_145_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=87b0d489600b85e954007f3c97e7567f","title":"inter unwelcome dose of craziness antonio conte serie a","story":"Inter keep playing good football but are unable to stop throwing away matches from winning positionsSix goals, a red card, two penalties and an early contender for miss of the century. Not bad for the warm-up act. Wednesday’s main event in Serie A was Atalanta-Lazio, a meeting of two teams that have produced some of the finest footballing symphonies on the peninsula. But first on stage, in the ‘early’ 7.30pm slot, were the chaotic chords of Inter-Sassuolo.It was the sort of tune that Antonio Conte never wanted to hear at San Siro. After becoming the Inter manager last summer, one of his first acts was to stop the club’s anthem, Amala, from being played before home games. The song is an ode to “Pazza Inter” – Crazy Inter. “Enough talk of craziness,” he said. “Inter will be regular and strong.”Easier said than done. Inter have produced some of their best football in years, but they have interspersed it with familiar follies – throwing away games that looked won. They did it twice on Wednesday, surrendering a lead in the 81st minute, then doing it again in the 89th. This after coming from behind to lead at the half.Conte gambled with his team selection, leaving out five of 11 starters from Sunday’s win over Sampdoria. A slow-motion midfield of Roberto Gagliardini and Borja Valero looked like a mistake from the outset, Filip Djuricic accelerating away to set up Francesco Caputo for Sassuolo’s fourth-minute opener.Inter had shown little sign of coming back into the game, before Jeremie Boga lost track of Milan Skriniar, swiping a boot into his opponent without even knowing they were there. Romelu Lukaku converted the penalty. Five minutes later, Cristiano Biraghi exchanged a one-two with Alexis Sánchez and ran through to make it 2-1.Even Conte must have wondered how his team was ahead. All of Italy, though, would be left flummoxed by Gagliardini’s failure to extend Inter’s lead once play resumed.Lukaku fed Lautaro Martínez down the left channel to launch an Inter counterattack. The Argentinian returned the ball to his strike partner near the penalty spot. Lukaku’s first-time effort was parried straight into the path of Gagliardini, five yards from goal. All he had to do was nudge it over the line. Somehow, he thwacked it on to the bar.It was an astonishing miss – right up there with Edin Dzeko against Palermo in 2016 and Mattia Destro for Bologna against SPAL. At least this was not the fourth minute of added time of a derby. Gagliardini’s gaffe is unlikely to be commemorated, as Destro’s was, with its own choreography, but it did cost Inter a chance to put this game to bed.Instead, they shook it awake. Ashley Young, on as a sub in the 75th minute, was lucky not to give away a penalty in the 77th when the ball struck his arm in the area. He allowed no such room for interpretation in the 80th, when he went through the back of Mert Müldür. “I never touched him, mate,” protested Young. Reality begged to differ.Domenico Berardi scored the penalty. Five minutes later, Inter were back in front, Valero arriving unmarked at the back post to help Antonio Candreva’s free-kick across the line.It could have been an ending that spoke to the resilience of Conte’s team: evidence they were ready to fight for the Scudetto. But it wasn’t. Müldür had already drawn another good save from Samir Handanovic before Giangiacomo Magnani swept home a deflected cross to make it 3-3.There was barely time to breathe before Atalanta and Lazio filled up a nation’s TV screens. For the second time in four days, kick-off at the Gewiss Stadium was preceded by a moment’s reflection to a soundtrack of Roby Facchinetti’s Rinascerò, Rinascerai (I will be reborn, you will be reborn). The game that followed could have served as an extended metaphor.Atalanta were two goals down inside 11 minutes. Marten de Roon smashed the ball into his own net from a similar range to where Gagliardini had missed from. Sergej Milinkovic-Savic casually picked out the corner of Pierluigi Gollini’s goal from 25 yards.At the time, it felt like a statement of intent. Juventus had moved four points clear of Lazio at the top of Serie A when they beat Bologna on Monday. That was already their third game back since the coronavirus interruption, with the previous two coming in the Coppa Italia. Likewise Inter, this season’s other aspiring title contender, had played three times between league and cup.Lazio had been left kicking their heels, itching to get out there and remind everyone what they were capable of. Before the pause, they had gone 21 league games without defeat. Now they were 2-0 up away to the team that sat fourth opponents who had demolished Sassuolo 4-1 on Sunday.Like Inter, though, they failed to press home their advantage. Ciro Immobile missed a pair of chances to make it 3-0, before Robin Gosens halved the deficit instead. Atalanta never looked back.It took a spectacular finish from Ruslan Malinovskyi to get them level, belted with such violence from the edge of the area that the cameraman could scarcely react in time to catch it hitting the net. Atalanta, though, were already dominating the play by that point. José Luis Palomino finally headed them in front in the 80th minute, but the outcome had long felt inevitable.Lazio’s manager, Simone Inzaghi, could not hide his disappointment, acknowledging that his team’s path to the title had become “more complicated”. That four-point lead for Juventus over Lazio, as well as the eight-point advantage they hold over Inter, was enough for some to declare the race was already at an end.It is easy for such fatalism to take hold when the team in first place has won the past eight titles. Juventus were already the favourites and their position has strengthened. On the other hand, there is still almost a third of the season to go. They have games against Atalanta, Roma and Milan in July, as well as a head-to-head with Lazio.What is true is that the fixtures have fallen kindly for Juventus in this initial phase of restart. Although the Coppa Italia ended badly, it allowed them to shake off any rust before resuming their league campaign against a spirited, but modest, Bologna. Lazio looked tired in the second-half against Atalanta – as you would expect for a group of players thrown into such a high-intensity encounter without any competitive action in their legs.None of which should be used to diminish Atalanta’s efforts. It is worth remembering they led 3-0 at Lazio in October, too, before the home side pulled off an extraordinary comeback of their own to rescue a point.Atalanta were the top scorers last season with 77 goals. They have reached the same tally this time around with 11 games to spare. Twelve points behind Juventus, they are unlikely to challenge for the title, but not even the craziest Inter can truly claim to put on a more entertaining show."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/440290c990d848cf2b92b1a5b0a28fa40b178887/176_281_2480_1488/master/2480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1525416ec1ca4f26e7876326cb323e7c","title":"he could nutmeg a mermaid the rise of brentfords said benrahma","story":"Algerian has dazzled for Brentford, having followed a familiar path through France’s lower isions, and looks Premier League-boundBe it with backheels, rainbow flicks or making the opposition look silly, few players outside the Premier League have made a bigger impression than Saïd Benrahma in the past couple of seasons. The Brentford winger boasts an endless box of tricks but he is more than just easy on the eye – he is approaching double figures in assists after equalling last season’s goal tally of 11 with eight Championship games to play. More often than not, his coup de grâce is sliding the ball through the legs of dazed defenders. “He could nutmeg a mermaid,” said Sam Saunders, the Brentford B assistant coach.The buzz around Benrahma is growing and Friday’s game at home to West Bromwich Albion brings another opportunity to impress after he scored the opening goal in victory at Fulham last weekend. In February Middlesbrough’s Lewis Wing was left hopping in frustration after being on the receiving end of a double nutmeg and, given Benrahma’s palette of pirouettes and twirls, it is perhaps no surprise he counts Ronaldinho and Hatem Ben Arfa, with whom he played at Nice, as idols.Chelsea are among those taking a keen interest in his progress. Last summer Aston Villa, whose manager, Dean Smith, worked with Benrahma at Brentford in the player’s first season in England, had a bid of about £15m rejected, with the Bees unwilling to sell both him and Neal Maupay, who joined Brighton for £20m.Benrahma was born in Aïn Témouchent, an Algerian resort on the Mediterranean popular with holidaymakers, but grew up inland in Bel Abbès, a city with a rich military history once home to the French Foreign Legion. He moved to France with his parents at the age of 11, settling in the suburbs of Toulouse, where he played for fifth-tier Colomiers, for whom his performances for the under-19s, including at a tournament in Barcelona, attracted interest from Monaco, Bordeaux and Nice. He joined Nice, making his debut as an 18-year-old under Claude Puel, who promoted him from the reserves.Ankle injuries and the arrival of Lucien Favre – “we didn’t understand each other” – halted his progress and a series of loans followed: to Angers and then Gazélec Ajaccio of Ligue 2, where he came to the attention of Brendan MacFarlane, Brentford’s lead scout in France. His flair and ability to eliminate players in one-against-one situations stood out against Bourg-en-Bresse Péronnas, against whom he scored twice and celebrated with his mother, and then came a fruitful spell at second-tier Châteauroux.Two years ago he joined Brentford from Nice for £2.7m, 12 months after Maupay made a similar move from Saint-Étienne for £1.6m after impressing on loan at Ligue 2 Brest. It is a well-trodden path and Bryan Mbeumo, a 20-year-old winger who has scored 14 goals in his first season in England after joining from Troyes for a record fee last summer, is the latest to make the transition look remarkably easy.He did not speak English on arrival and credits Maupay with a key role in his rise, particularly in helping him settle. He lives with his mother and has struck up a friendship with an Algerian chef at the training ground. Incidentally, his first professional career start came at Griffin Park six years ago, for Nice in a pre-season friendly defeat, a game in which Maupay scored. “We would find each other on the pitch with our eyes closed. I have known Neal since Nice but we were not so close then. He took care of me as soon as I arrived here and was essential to my integration. I wasn’t expecting him to make that much effort for me. He became my friend, my brother.”These days Benrahma is one-third of Brentford’s ‘“BMW” attack alongside Mbeumo and Ollie Watkins, who has led the line impeccably in the No 9 role vacated by Maupay. Algeria is enjoying a boom of talented players as a result of investment into infrastructure, namely a national technical centre on the outskirts of Algiers, and Benrahma, who has three caps, has inevitably drawn comparisons to their captain, Riyad Mahrez, the Manchester City winger who provides an obvious source of inspiration given his journey since leaving Le Havre of Ligue 2 six years ago.Benrahma, too, seems destined for the Premier League and, just like Mahrez, trying to stop him is a thankless task, as Henrik Dalsgaard, the Brentford defender, can vouch. “He’s such a tricky player, you think you’ve got him locked in the corner and then, all of a sudden, he’s out,” he said.• Who will make a late dash for the play-offs? A vibrant Derby side head into the weekend in mid-table but three points off sixth-placed Preston, whom they visit next Wednesday. Louie Sibley’s stunning hat-trick on his second Championship start helped them to victory over Millwall, who remain among a clutch of seven play-off-chasing teams separated by three points. Before then, Preston take on Cardiff, who returned with an impressive win over Leeds. “I was pumped up for the game to beat Marcelo Bielsa, because he’s the man,” said Cardiff’s manager, Neil Harris. “It is only one game and we want to build on that.”• Is the great escape on for Barnsley? Gerhard Struber’s side remain four points adrift of safety but have won four of their past six matches and host Millwall and Blackburn inside the next five days. Wigan, too, are seemingly heading in the right direction after one defeat in 10 matches, a run that includes five successive clean sheets. Middlesbrough travel to fellow strugglers Stoke on Saturday having acted on their dreadful form by appointing Neil Warnock, and things do not get easier for Hull, who dropped into the relegation zone having last week banned the Hull Daily Mail owing to “negative coverage”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc6ceece18933c660b02dab90d54540038067d43/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=756526cd71d324bd286fd73b1133d608","title":"trauma and triumph my father his dementia and surviving segregation","story":"For my father, marooned in the Emmett-Tamir loop he could not stop, 1955 was 2017I had just entered my father’s nursing-home room when he swung his head around and pronounced, “They killed that boy in Mississippi.”Not the greeting I expected. I was startled by how swiftly he turned and pinned his gaze on me. Confined to a wheelchair and the world of dementia, my father rarely moved that quickly anymore. He often would talk to me, full-out lucid conversations, without opening his eyes. But that day he looked at me intently, eyes wet and runny. Tears or discharge from an ongoing eye issue, I didn’t know.Neither did I know what he was talking about, and I felt ambushed by the simple declarative sentence about another black death at the hands of a “they” that I assumed to be police. I wracked my brain to recall the day’s headlines. Had I missed a shooting, an unexplained hanging, a suspicious suicide? There have been so many – too many to remember.Then, he said, insistently: “They killed that boy in Money, Mississippi,” and gestured to the television. Sound muted, it flashed new developments in the case of Tamir Rice, the 12-year-old Cleveland boy killed by police in late November 2014 as he played with snowballs and a pellet gun in a park. With the “Money” reference, I realized that my father was conflating Rice with Emmett Till. Another black boy, big for his 14 years, considered a threat and accused of “provoking” his own lynching in 1955 when a white woman, Carolyn Bryant, lied that he’d approached her sexually.It would do no good to correct my father the brain on dementia doesn’t always respond to reason. My father had vascular dementia. Different from the more common Alzheimer’s disease, it’s a form of cognitive and physical decline often caused by multiple strokes. Those strokes might be virtually undetectable until, cumulatively, they result in brain damage, confusion, and impaired mobility. When my father was diagnosed, a kind doctor told us that his brain was functioning like a camera shutter that’s constantly misfiring – sometimes fast, sometimes slow, collecting thousands of impressions that it couldn’t process or organize. But that didn’t mean that all memory was lost.This was the case with my father, who died this spring at the age of 86. His historical memory was remarkably intact. He could remember a football game from decades ago, the shebeen called Hell’s Half Acre that he frequented as a young, wild-oats-sowing man (the same place he tried to take my mother, who said, “I’m not that kind of girl” and demanded to be taken elsewhere). But he sometimes got stuck in a time machine.I realized, as my father spoke with a firm voice and brimming eyes, that he was of an age with Emmett Till. Could have been an older brother. I mulled turning off the TV or turning it to a sports channel. Distraction and ersion are your friends when a loved one has dementia. I wanted to dislodge this memory that defined his generation in the way that the killings of Trayvon Martin and George Floyd have and will define later ones.For my father, marooned in the Emmett-Tamir loop he could not stop, 1955 was 2017.I trotted out all the techniques I’d been taught by “memory care” experts. I changed the subject gently and agreed pleasantly when he seemed agitated, an old conflict-resolution trick called “fogging”.I left, thinking it had worked, until I heard that my father refused to have a white certified nursing assistant (CNA) bathe him.“She might say I’d try to rape her,” he said.My father became irate when a CNA said things like white women’s unfounded rape allegations against black men “didn’t happen”. He knew it did, from both the impersonal arc of history and family experience. Soon after, when my father had a bad reaction to steroids, he lashed out at his caregivers, shouting about the mistreatment he’d suffered as a black man born during the 1930s in rural Appalachia.I think of this moment often now, as I see and hear black elders talk about this latest racial spasm in our society and their lives. I worry for African American seniors like my father, who are living with dementia and struggle to make sense of eating breakfast. Or those who live in nursing homes where they are one of the few black residents (for years, my father was the only black man in his). I wonder if they see modern-day uprisings and are mentally catapulted into the fires that burned cities in 1968, if they see police brutality and marches, and think of the daily indignities of Jim Crow.I know that my 74-year-old mother does. Since George Floyd’s death, she’s commented multiple times about white children spitting on her from school buses she could not ride, how the state of South Carolina was so fixed on ridding the state of future “problems” that it paid the difference between in-state tuition and her out-of-state fees (better if educated Negroes went out of state and stayed there).A friend told me that her senior mother abruptly packed her bags and fled the city she lived in, going to the country town of her upbringing and resettling among her people. Maybe to flee Covid-19, maybe to find succor in open spaces and familiar faces. And these women, my mother included, don’t have dementia.My mother can talk about her feelings and sort through them consciously in a way my father couldn’t. I got to better understand his racial wounds as a survivor of segregation – and maybe we should think of black people of my parent’s generation just this way: as survivors. I heard more about the things that made him through the loss of inhibition that made him both irritable and so affectionate. My father told me that he loved me more as he declined. I heard about his adventures hunting, running bootleg liquor across state borders to earn money for graduate school, the fast pitch that almost took him to the Negro Leagues, the difficult horse he broke and trained.Dementia gave me my father in a new way. It also took him away.I cherish the times I have with my mother and listen to her stories of trauma and triumph. I’m proud that she goes to a therapist to talk to people who aren’t her children. My mother also has the Southern gifts of well-rehearsed public politeness and meaningless, cordial chitchat. Recently shopping in a grocery story, she had a brief encounter with a white woman customer, around her age, that gave her pause.“We were just saying hi to each other, in the aisle. We both had our masks on, and we were saying ‘How are you?” And I said, ‘These are trying times.’ She said, ‘Are things THAT bad for black people?”’ – a sign of both white oblivion and a pandemic-driven thirst for conversation.There’s little precedent for the multiple hits that everyone is taking now — with Covid-19 and police violence taking many black lives. Many black elders of the civil rights generation are aware that they are extremely vulnerable to coronavirus, but they may be hard to reach with the latest and best information.Boddie said: “The main thing is socialization. We have people who live in our housing and want to go in common areas together, who go to the grocery store as a group. We can’t do our chair exercises in a group. It’s hard to say to a grandmother that her grandson can’t come in and visit.”Boddie’s own grandmother, formerly a South Carolina native, celebrated her recent birthday, thanking God for seeing 90 years and not having coronavirus.In the past, she had her own domestic ritual to support civil rights activists – and it’s one she’s replicating now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74761d0d1d2fd4eb3c803d4a05edf88d303cae07/0_150_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7fb2dd2c96d5dec5639e10f8722d6436","title":"coronavirus lockdown eased 4 july england pub hairdresser gym","story":"People in England will able to visit a pub, restaurant or hairdresser, but not a gymThe government has announced an easing of lockdown rules in England from 4 July. Hospitality and leisure businesses will be allowed to reopen, and there will be more freedom to see other people.From 4 July you will able to go to a pub, cafe or restaurant, visit a museum, library or theme park, watch a film at a cinema, or stay in a hotel or on campsite – as long as the venue can open safely. You can also be part of a group meeting at a place of worship. If you need to sort out your lockdown hair, you will be able to go to a hairdresser or barber.You can’t go to the gym or do any type of exercise class – the risk is still too great to allow people to breathe heavily while in close proximity. The risk level also means that you can’t watch a play, except on a screen, or live music. Soft play areas will still be closed, as will activities that involve sharing or borrowing equipment – for example bowling or ice-skating. In more bad news for anyone trying to shake off any lockdown pounds, swimming pools will remain closed. Beauty salons, casinos and nightclubs won’t reopen yet, nor will cricket clubs. If you are a church goer, you will not be allowed to sing at services.Yes – and friends. But it is complicated. You will be able to spend time indoors or outside with another household, either at home or at a pub or restaurant. If you are outside at a pub, you can meet up to five people from more than two households, but if you are inside the two household rule applies. Social distancing of 1-metre-plus will apply in all cases.If you are already in a support bubble, that will count as one household so you can all visit another set of friends or family. You can stay overnight at someone’s home and there are no restrictions on how far you can travel to see people. But again the 1- metre-plus social distancing rule applies.Yes, over-70s can meet others under the easing, but they have been advised to remain especially cautious as their risk of complications if they do get Covid-19 is higher than for younger people.The government says the fall in the number of infections and the fact that the R rate – the number of people each virus-positive person infects – has remained below 1 means it can reduce the social distancing guidance for England. Instead of insisting that businesses cater for people to stay 2 metres apart, the guidance has been reduced to 1-metre-plus. This means that people can be closer as long as there are other safety measures in place – such as more handwashing facilities and screens at venues, or you could be asked to wear a face mask or sit so you are not facing other people.It’s a yes to staycations – you can stay overnight at holiday homes and second homes, book hotels, caravan parks and campsites, and tourist attractions can reopen. You can visit one other household, as long as you maintain social distancing.As for trips abroad, the government is in discussion to create “air bridges” with other countries, which would allow people to travel without quarantining, and an announcement is expected in the next few days. The countries being considered include holiday favourites such as France, Italy, Spain and Greece.At the weekend Tui said it would resume trips to Spain and Greece on 11 July, suggesting that the ban on travel could end by then.In Wales there is no date set for pubs and other leisure outlets to reopen but tourism businesses have been told they can open on 6 July and take bookings from 13 July. It’s a similar situation in Scotland, although tourism could reopen in the middle of the month. In Northern Ireland pubs, cafes and restaurants can reopen from 3 July."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0f6bf277254e4902df5bb46ede4f46f97f1fa23/0_50_5576_3345/master/5576.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c75fc1bbbf8137a4a8eb66c848b7917b","title":"a new normal how has working from home been for you","story":"We’d like to hear from  readers for a video series about what’s next in the world of work In our video series, A new normal, we ask  readers what they want a future shaped by Covid-19 to look like.

On Tuesday, Boris Johnson had been in his comfort zone. The Mr Bright Side telling the Commons more or less what it wanted to hear and getting little pushback even from opposition MPs. The saviour releasing the country from months of hibernation. Trusting everyone to still observe the essentials of social distancing even while they were getting pissed in newly-opened pubs and bars.Prime minister’s questions, though, exposes Boris’s fallibilities. Not because he is too lazy to properly prepare and isn’t nearly as clever as he imagines himself to be – though both of those things are true – but because the very idea causes his psyche to go into meltdown. Johnson is the narcissists’ narcissist. He believes in his inalienable right to do whatever he pleases. Even the merest hint of a challenge is an insult to his fragile ego.Someone more self-aware might realise that the coronavirus is nowhere near half-done. That mistakes have been made and others may well be in the future. That the pandemic can make fools of anyone and a degree of humility might be in order if he is to keep the country onside in the weeks and months ahead. People can forgive a lot if they feel they aren’t being taken for mugs. But for Boris any admission of failure or liability is a psychological impossibility.Asking Boris to take responsibility for his own actions is pointless. He just can’t do it, because he is the centre of his own universe, locked into his own closed system of thought. What he wants he must have. So it follows that whatever he does must automatically be right. People who disagree with him or are no longer useful to him are easily discarded as inconveniences.The trouble is that Boris can dump wives, mistresses, ministers and friends but he just can’t get rid of Keir Starmer. For the first time in his life, Johnson has come up against an immovable object. And rather than accept the inevitable, Boris has merely allowed himself to regress.Initially he saw the Labour leader as a mild inconvenience – an unwelcome intrusion into his alternative reality – but, after discovering that he couldn’t make him go away with mockery, a few cheap gags and by trying to turn the session into an interrogation of Starmer, his feelings have turned to hatred. Keir has got under his opponent’s skin. Somewhere in Boris’s subconscious he knows that Starmer is both better briefed and a great deal sharper and he can’t bear it. So all he can do is lash out, flailing wildly, tilting at windmills.Part of Starmer’s skill is to keep things simple. His questions have a logic that even a 10-year old can follow. It’s just a shame that Boris is still stuck in the toddler age of development. The Labour leader began by pointing out that easing restrictions was all very well providing that the track-and-trace system was functioning properly. Which at present it wasn’t as it was missing two-thirds of cases. So how did the government propose to get it working properly by 4 July? Boris was outraged. How could the person who had offered him cautious support the day before dare to now challenge him on the detail? That was the kind of disloyalty only he was allowed. The Labour leader just kept plugging away. This wasn’t obstruction, it was constructive criticism, he observed, as he reiterated the point that he was quoting from the government’s own data and wasn’t interested in the one-third of the system that was working. He then moved on to the app that had been downgraded in the past few weeks from critical and world-beating to “additional support” before observing that the prime minister had misled the house on the child poverty figures last week and would he mind correcting himself. Just for the record.All that Boris had to offer was histrionics and lies. Gestures of feigned “What me Guv?” innocence, combined with blatant untruths. Boris still labours under the impression that if you tell a lie often enough then it somehow becomes true. But what might work on the campaign trail on the side of buses just doesn’t cut it when you’re supposed to be the prime minister during the greatest health crisis for a century.We reached full-on meltdown shortly after Johnson claimed he had never said the app would be anything other than “icing on the cake” – since Boris begins each day as a tabula rasa, he must think the rest of us are equally amnesiac – when he went back to the tactic of asking Starmer about schools that had been moderately successful the week before. Only this time it failed dismally as Starmer had long since answered it.The few dozen Tory backbenchers in the chamber kept their heads down. They were as embarrassed as Boris would have been had he the capacity for that level of empathy. It’s slowly dawning on most Tories that Boris just isn’t up to the job as they witness their leader unravel at PMQs week after week. Nor do many have much faith in his ability to make the right calls at the right time with the pandemic. And having used up what little goodwill he might have had – Boris has never bothered to conceal his contempt for most, make that all, of his colleagues – his support is dwindling.Too many more PMQs like this and something will start to give. And as Boris is incapable of change, then it can’t be long before his suitability for the job comes under scrutiny from his own party. It was probably always inevitable that the person who would ultimately destroy Boris was Boris himself. But Starmer is doing a great job of exposing his faults. There is a crack in everything. That’s how the light gets in."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27d5c0b79a2876caa555d78fb50a38010b9bf7cb/0_203_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e9c5563a5adea9a73fd3eef429f02d1","title":"britain beyond lockdown can we become cleaner coronavirus","story":"As Covid-19 accelerates the shift towards renewable energy, Jonathan Watts hears how this change risks causing intergenerational injustice in AberdeenLike many young people in Aberdeen, Mike Scotland dreamed of a well-paid job on a rig in the North Sea, in the oil and gas field that has made his home town a boom town for most of the past 40 years.In February the 28-year-old landed the position he had wanted with Shell, and he was due to take a helicopter to the Shearwater platform in July once he had completed training.“I don’t think I have ever been as excited about anything in my life,” he recalled. “All I ever wanted was to land a health and safety role on a rig. I really wanted to make a difference.”Then Covid-19 struck, oil prices crashed, new projects were cancelled and Scotland was laid off. He is now working as a team member at the KFC restaurant in the Haudagain retail park, where he earns the minimum wage.“I earn in a week what I would have made in a day on the rig, but I can support my family and that is the main thing,” said Scotland, whose fiancee is expecting their second child in July. “I appreciate I have a job. Many don’t.”Since the start of the crisis, thousands of workers have been laid off in Aberdeen, which is the centre of the oil and gas industry in Europe. The town was already struggling to recover from a sharp fall in crude prices five years ago, as well as increasing social pressure to rein back on fossil fuels that are destabilising the climate.The pandemic looks likely to accelerate the shift towards renewable energy, but while this raises hopes for a greener future, it also throws up huge concerns about intergenerational injustice. Without government intervention, the young look set to take a double hit from the post-lockdown economic downturn and the energy transition.No age group is immune to the shift, but those closer to retirement are more likely to have a nest egg saved up from the golden era of North Sea oil.Timothy Robinson, 62, a petroleum geologist, has decided to retire early as a result of the coronavirus downturn, which he believes is likely to choke the revival of the oil industry in AberdeenIn terms of the economic fallout from Covid-19, Aberdeen is likely to be among the worst-affected cities in Britain. This is partly because it has so much to lose. The city has grown affluent thanks to its offshore expertise, which is in demand around the world. The population here are highly globalised, and many technicians and consultants fly off for several months of the year to do lucrative contract work on oil fields in Africa, South America or Asia.But a  callout to readers about the impact of coronavirus revealed a huge number of job losses that some say are barely covered in the media.Nicola Gardiner, an Aberdeen resident whose husband works in the oil and gas industry, explained how her once-prosperous home city had been affected. Chatting on wicker chairs in the spacious garden outside her traditional granite house, she said house prices had slumped, people were stuck in negative equity and there were no jobs. Efforts to ersify the local economy by attracting more tourists have been hit by delays to the £350m harbour development. Restaurants and hotels are empty.“It’s a domino effect here as ‘Aber-dream’ turns to ‘Aber-nightmare’,” she said. “There are bleak times ahead. That’s what happens when an industry is dying and a pandemic arrives.”On the seafront, seagulls circle noisily over roads and beaches that are considerably emptier than those along the coastline south of the border. A helicopter buzzes overhead, taking workers out to oil and gas platforms in the North Sea, but the number of such flights is far lower than six months ago. Andrew Duncan (not his real name) used to be a frequent passenger because he specialises in maintenance of drilling equipment. Last week he was laid off after more than five years’ employment at a major oil service company.He believes the Covid-19 crisis is being used by some firms as an excuse to accelerate restructuring plans. “I’m absolutely gutted. They went about it in an underhand, sneaky way,” he said. “I was treated as if I was just another asset, like a piece of equipment.”He asked for his name to be changed because a public complaint could undermine his chances of getting a new job in the close-knit oil town, but he is seething at his experience.He is worried about how he can provide for his wife and child. “This is just the beginning. The oil industry faces a perfect storm of lockdown, low prices and climate change,” he said. Now he is applying for jobs in the wind turbine industry and oil rig decommissioning. “That is the future,” he said. He is encouraged by the Scottish government’s plans to support workers left adrift in the shift from fossil fuels to renewables. “If they could help me with training as a wind turbine technician, that would give me an extra chance.”The Scottish government has gone further than the rest of the UK in preparing its economy and workforce for a shift to renewables. Rachel McEwen is part of the Just Transition commission, which has been advising the Scottish government on ways to shift from high-carbon to low-carbon industry with minimum social disruption. “The opportunities for injustice are endless. We must think where bad things will happen and get ahead of them,” she said.She is also chief sustainability officer in one of Scotland’s leading companies, SSE, which last month announced a £3bn investment in a new windfarm off the Angus coast, just south of Aberdeen. The 1,075MW facility will be the country’s biggest ever privately funded project. McEwen said the numbers would mean little unless there was a positive social impact. “Companies like us have pinned our whole being on finding profitable solutions to climate change. If that transition is unfair, you delegitimise it. So we have an interest in ensuring it is done in a thoughtful and just way.”The potential for wind energy is evident at the Balmedie sand dunes, a short drive outside town. Gusts off the North Sea billow through the marram grass, allow kite-surfers to soar above the breakers and spin the giant turbine blades of a windfarm that sits a short distance away from the coastline. Locals joke that these giant structures were built as close as possible to the Trump golf course to infuriate the US president. But they are part of a broader trend. Aberdeenshire is said to be the largest windfarm in Europe in terms of the number of on- and offshore turbines. This is a major reason why wind is now the cheapest form of energy in the UK and has provided a substantial portion of our electricity during lockdown.Colette Cohen, the chief executiveof the Oil and Gas Technology Centre in Aberdeen, is optimistic there will be more support for energy transition in Scotland.“From industry perspective and from government connections, I would say the only recovery is a green recovery. A lot of people have seen a better world and want a change,” she said. “It’s very exciting. It’s an amazing time to be involved in energy and technology.”Among the likely future developments are more offshore wind in the West Shetlands and the UK’s first hydrogen plant, which is expected within two years.But she warned there was likely to be a dip for between 18 months to three years, as the investment shifted direction. “That is the difficult time. That’s the worry. It is hard to see how we will navigate that effectively.”One element will be managing a generational shift: as boom-era oil workers retire and old rigs are decommissioned, opportunities for the young may be hard to find. Coronavirus has made that challenge even harder because it has shut down the service sector.This week Scotland’s advisory group of economic recovery recommended that the government provide a two-year job lifeline and training scheme for young people as part of £6bn in stimulus spending. “If we don’t intervene radically to transform our economy, inequalities will drastically widen, with long-term scarring for communities across the country and for our young people in particular,” said the chair of the group, Benny Higgins.It is a sensible step in keeping with Scotland’s more cautious – and successful – approach to dealing with the virus itself. The country, which continues with tighter lockdown restrictions than England, has fewer cases relative to its population and a faster falling rate of infections.This prudent approach of acknowledging risk and alleviating adversity may explain why even the worst-affected workers find reasons for hope. Mike Scotland said he was throwing himself full-hearted into his new job at KFC, as well as continuing work on the mental health and environmental charities he founded.“I get it when people say they are having a bad time, but that is not an excuse to give up. I am looking at this as a life lesson, a step outside my comfort zone,” he said. In the long run, he said, he believed his generation would get more opportunities because they were more familiar with technology and more open to new ideas than those who had come before them.“I think there are a lot of people who want to change and are ready to change. But others who are not ready. I guess Covid could speed it up.

The intention was to get more housing built, quickly, for people who really need it,” Zahawi told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme about Jenrick’s decision to approve the Westferry development in east London, overruling earlier planning decisions.Pressure on Jenrick has increased after documents about the case, released by his department, showed he wanted the approval signed off immediately in January, to avoid Desmond’s company having to pay Tower Hamlets council a community infrastructure levy of £45m, which would have been spent on local infrastructure.Text message exchanges in the documents reveal how Desmond, the former Express titles newspaper owner and pornographer, lobbied Jenrick to speed up the decision and thus avoid the payment.The messages came after Desmond sat next to Jenrick at a Conservative fundraising event in November, at which the developer showed Jenrick a promotional video about the 1,500-apartment, 44-storey development on his phone.Two weeks after Jenrick made the decision in favour of Desmond, the developer donated £12,000 to the Conservative party.Zahawi said Jenrick had subsequently refused Desmond’s offer of a meeting, and had wanted to save Desmond’s company the £45m charge to make the scheme viable.“Viability is incredibly important,” he said. “Getting stuff built is important to Robert Jenrick. That was his motivation, but when there was a perception of bias he pulled back on this, pulled the plug on it, and will allow a different minister to decide the scheme.”Pressed on what a hypothetical Tory voter in Doncaster or Ashfield might think about Desmond’s ability to directly lobby the minister making the planning decision, Zahawi said they could consider doing the same thing.“Well, if people go to a fundraiser in their local area, in Doncaster, for the Conservative party, they’ll be sitting next to MPs and other people in their local area, and can interact with different parts of the authority,” he said. “The important thing is the access didn’t buy this billionaire a decision.”The documents detailing Jenrick’s contacts with Desmond were released on Wednesday after the minister faced a vote to force the issue.Speaking before Zahawi on Today, Bob Kerslake, the former head of the civil service, said the case raised some troubling issues about access and influence in what Jenrick had done.“I don’t for a moment suggest that he took his decision simply because of a donation to the Conservative party, but the fact is that, for the price of a dinner, the developer was able to present his scheme to the minister, follow up with texts, and seek to influence the decision,” Lord Kerslake said.While Jenrick “got to the right place in the end” by eventually reversing his decision and removing himself from the process, Kerslake added: “None of that process should happen in these circumstances.”He said: “It creates the impression – and appearance here is really important – that the developer has some level of influence in the decisions.”Following the documents’ release the cabinet secretary, Mark Sedwill, responded to an urgent query from Labour by stating: “The prime minister considers that the matter is closed.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59b7f6d004fca003b8e22d851d094fbeb44485ac/243_914_5943_3566/master/5943.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=290df15f82a7aaa21238922a1935f103","title":"novak djokovic left isolated as adria tennis tour acrimony rumbles on","story":"Novak Djokovic couldn’t buy a friend on Wednesday – at least not outside his tight circle of confidants and family in Belgrade, where the row over his virus-hit Balkan charity fortnight slid further into denial and acrimony.First to his side was his father, Srdjan, who tried to shift the blame for the fiasco on to Grigor Dimitrov, the first of three other players to test positive for coronavirus in Croatia, where the two-week tour was abandoned minutes before the final on Sunday.“How did the infection come about?” Djokovic Sr said on RTL’s Croatian TV network. “Probably because Dimitrov arrived sick, from who knows where. He was not tested in Zadar, but somewhere else. I don’t think that’s right. He brought great harm to you in Croatia, and to us as a family, and to Serbia.”At Wimbledon, meanwhile, the new regime took a more kindly if firm view of their blundering 2019 champion, who is quarantining in his home city for two weeks while coping with Covid-19, along with his wife, and contemplating the evaporation of goodwill that launched his well-meant venture.Richard Lewis, who hands over to the All England Club’s first female chief executive, Sally Bolton, in August, said protocols at the US Open in August and Roland Garros in September “will be easier to enforce and observe than they otherwise might have been”. And, while he shied away from saying Djokovic had a special responsibility to the game as its title-holder, he said: “It’s a fact in this day and age that all sportsmen and sportswomen have a leadership role that goes with the territory. It is disappointing.”The notion that the virus itself has bypassed the Balkans came under further scrutiny on Wednesday when another high-profile Serb athlete, the NBA star Nikola Jokic, had to delay his return to the US after testing positive. Jokic spent time with Djokovic during the Belgrade leg of the Adria Tour.Elsewhere, five footballers from Red Star Belgrade revealed they had contracted the virus 12 days after playing in the local derby against Partizan in front of a crowd of 18,000 on 10 June, about the time Djokovic’s tour was getting under way in the Serb capital. Neighbouring Montenegro, which had been declared virus-free, later confirmed a minor outbreak there after fans returned from the Belgrade football match.There was little respite for the world No 1 anywhere outside Serbia. Paul Annacone, who has coached Roger Federer and Andy Murray, told Sports Illustrated: “I think there’s a lot of his peer group who are scratching their heads. His passion to do something good clouded all the information, all the science. It was a good cause, driven by the right reason, but the end result was pretty disastrous.”The world No 35 Guido Pella is the latest player to take Djokovic to task. “He played with many people’s health and crossed a line from which it will be challenging to return, disrespecting the world of tennis and the entire planet,” he is quoted as saying on tennisworldusa.org. “I don’t know how he’s going to get out of this.”For Djokovic the party that rumbled joyously in a Belgrade nightclub two weekends ago is over. But the hangover lingers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff267075b03d3ef1c472ed65956fc095667a9451/1315_116_2185_1310/master/2185.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6118fdc8c8aab6f9e66ff7ecaa74ada9","title":"talking horses aidan obrien outlines plans for quick derby double","story":"Record-seeking trainer could rely on Russian Emperor, Mogul and Vatican City at Epsom, but Mogul’s prep has been rushedRussian Emperor, Mogul and possibly Vatican City look like forming the core of Aidan O’Brien’s challenge for the Derby a week on Saturday. Victory for the Irishman would break the trainer’s record of seven wins in the Epsom race, which has stood since Robert Robson was the first to reach that total in 1823, but O’Brien lacks an obvious star and the first three in the betting are trained in England.The difficulty this year is that the three major European Derbys will take place over a period of just eight days, starting with the Irish version on Saturday evening. Speaking in a webinar organised by Curragh officials on Wednesday evening, O’Brien said it was unlikely that he would ask any horse to run in the Derby just a week after competing in Ireland.Asked about his Epsom plans, O’Brien began by saying: “We’re thinking of running back some of the Irish Guineas horses in Epsom.” That race was just a fortnight ago and the trainer decided this weekend’s Irish Derby would come too soon for the likes of Vatican City, second in the Guineas. Though he did not mention them by name, he may also be considering Epsom for Armory, fourth in the Guineas, and the pacemaker Fort Myers.Of Russian Emperor, a winner at Royal Ascot, O’Brien said: “He looks to have come out of it well. He hasn’t done a lot, one little bit, he seems to be in good form. Entries for Epsom are on Monday. We have him down to be entered at the moment. So far, he seems to be in good form.” O’Brien made no mention of the French Derby a week on Sunday, for which Vatican City is currently second in the betting and Russian Emperor third.He appeared more concerned about the rushed preparation given to Mogul, a beaten favourite at Ascot. “He needed two runs, really, before the Derby but we weren’t able to get two runs into him. So we ran him in the toughest race over a mile and a half and we’re kind of asking that race to do two races’ job.“We had worked him as hard as we could but some horses need racing to get them there. He was very vulnerable going to Ascot but we thought, going to Epsom, he probably had to have a tough mile and a half somewhere. We just felt that was as tough as we could give him and at the same time give him a chance to make it back.”O’Brien named six horses as potential runners in the Irish Derby: Arthur’s Kingdom, Dawn Patrol, Tiger Moth, Santiago, Mythical and Serpentine. Adding spice to the rest of this weekend’s action at the Curragh, his intended runners include Magical, having her first race since winning the Champion Stakes at Ascot in October, and Sovereign, not seen since his shock 33-1 success in last year’s Irish Derby.He confirmed that Love, the impressive 1,000 Guineas winner, was on course for next week’s Oaks, so long as the ground does not go soft. Peaceful, his Irish 1,000 Guineas winner, is more likely to wait for the Irish Oaks later in July.Meanwhile, English King, the Derby favourite, has had a getting-to-know-you gallop with Frankie Dettori, recently booked to ride him at Epsom. The colt’s trainer, Ed Walker, said: “Frankie just wanted to come down, get a feel for the horse and he really liked him. He really wanted to get inside the horse’s head and understand him, which is a mark of Frankie’s professionalism. He rode him for well over an hour, they got on great.“He loves his personality, because he’s got a really big personality. He’s a playful horse, he’s not a boring horse, who just plods around the gallops. He’s a fun horse.”The money has been coming this morning for Exotic Escape (2.45) at Haydock, after the same connections had a well backed winner there on Wednesday. This three-year-old showed promise on her first start since leaving David Lanigan for David Loughnane, staying on bravely into fourth at Chelmsford after racing wide and far too free in the early stages.Today’s extra furlong helps and Hollie Doyle is booked. As at 9.30am, the best available is 11-2, as the influential Hugh Taylor tipped her up half an hour earlier.At Leicester tonight, Buzz Killington (6.55) could be overpriced at 14-1 on his first start since joining Grant Tuer from Noel Meade. Just two starts ago, he beat 13 rivals at Dundalk, although the blinkers fitted that day have been left off here. A mile and a half was too far on his only start since and he has since had a wind operation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/807fe7fbe81ad77545e9a9e6554887782bacab0b/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8aa7f50683726eeaae71aa7293efed7d","title":"qanon facebook conspiracy theories algorithm","story":" investigation finds more than 3m aggregate followers and members support QAnon on Facebook, and their numbers are growingIn early May, QAnon braced for a purge. Facebook had removed a small subset – five pages, six groups and 20 profiles – of the community on the social network, and as word of the bans spread, followers of Q began preparing for a broader sweep.Some groups changed their names, substituting “17” for “Q” (the 17th letter of the alphabet) others shared links to back-up accounts on alternative social media platforms with looser rules.More than just another internet conspiracy theory, QAnon is a movement of people who interpret as a kind of gospel the online messages of an anonymous figure – “Q” – who claims knowledge of a secret cabal of powerful pedophiles and sex traffickers. Within the constructed reality of QAnon, Donald Trump is secretly waging a patriotic crusade against these “deep state” child abusers, and a “Great Awakening” that will reveal the truth is on the horizon.QAnon evolved out of the baseless Pizzagate conspiracy theory, which posited that Hillary Clinton was running a child sex ring out of a Washington DC pizza restaurant, and has come to incorporate numerous strands of rightwing conspiracy mongering. Dedicated followers interpret Q’s cryptic messages in a kind of digital scavenger hunt. Despite the fact that Q’s prognostications have reliably failed to come true, followers rationalize the inaccuracies as part of a larger plan. Q’s initial commentary on the Facebook bans was concise: “Information Warfare,” Q posted on the website 8kun. Two days later, in a post that included a collage of dozens of news headlines about the takedowns, Q went further, speculating that there had been a “coordinated media roll-out designed to instill ‘fear’” in believers and dissuade them from discussing QAnon on social media. “When do you expend ammunition?” Q wrote. “For what purpose?”The anticipated purge never came. Instead, QAnon groups on Facebook have continued to grow at a considerable pace in the weeks following the takedown, with several adding more than 10,000 members over 30 days.These groups and pages play a critical role in disseminating Q’s messages to a broader audience and in recruiting more believers to the cult-like belief system, researchers say.“Facebook is a unique platform for recruitment and amplification,” said Brian Friedberg, a senior researcher at the Harvard Shorenstein Center’s Technology and Social Change Project who has been studying QAnon for years. “I really do not think that QAnon as we know it today would have been able to happen without the affordances of Facebook.”Moreover, Facebook is not merely providing a platform to QAnon groups. Its powerful algorithms are actively recommending them to users who may not otherwise have been exposed to them. did not initially go looking for QAnon content on Facebook. Instead, Facebook’s algorithms recommended a QAnon group to a  reporter’s account after it had joined pro-Trump, anti-vaccine and anti-lockdown Facebook groups. The list of more than 100 QAnon groups and accounts was then generated by following Facebook’s recommendation algorithms and using simple keyword searches. The Instagram accounts were discovered by searching for “QAnon” in the app’s discovery page and then following Instagram’s algorithmic recommendations.Receiving QAnon recommendations from Facebook does not appear to be that uncommon. “Once I started liking those pages and joining those groups, Facebook just started recommending more and more and more and more, to the point where I was afraid to like them all in case Facebook would flag me as a bot,” said Friedberg. Erin Gallagher, a researcher who studies social media extremism, said she was also encouraged to join a QAnon group by Facebook, soon after joining an anti-lockdown group.Facebook did not directly respond to questions from the  about its policy considerations around QAnon content. “Last month, we took down accounts, Groups, and Pages tied to this conspiracy theorist movement for violating our policies,” a company spokesperson said in a statement. “We also remove Groups and Pages that violate other policies from recommendations and demote in search results. We’re closely monitoring this activity and how our policies apply.”The company also claimed that “all of the Pages” and “the vast majority of Groups” documented by the  had been removed from recommendation algorithms prior to the ’s query. The company did not provide evidence for this claim, which is contradicted by screenshots of pages and groups appearing in recommendations that were taken in May.  also continued to receive recommendations to join additional QAnon groups after its initial query to Facebook.Asked about this discrepancy, Facebook said that the pages and groups in question had been marked as “non-recommendable” as of 8 April 2020 for violations of policies against clickbait, viral misinformation and hate speech, but that a page or group can be restored to eligibility for recommendations if its behavior improves for several months.To Friedberg, the window for Facebook to act on QAnon may have already passed. “I’m starting to wonder if we’re just waiting for the next shoe to drop – another act of violence,” he said. “That seems to be what the platforms wait for, and that in and of itself is terrifying.”While QAnon thrives on Facebook, another social media site took timely and decisive action against it. Nearly two years ago, Reddit, the link-sharing network of interest-based message boards, carried out a site-wide purge of QAnon – and made it stick.Reddit had been central to the development of the QAnon movement, which began in October 2017 with the emergence of “Q” on 4chan, the anarchic image board that has served as a launching pad for memes and internet culture but also racist extremism and harassment campaigns. Q, whose cryptic messages and predictions claimed to be based on a high-level government security clearance, quickly decamped from 4chan to the even more extreme 8chan, where believers could read Q’s latest “crumbs” directly from the source.Q went briefly silent in 2019 when 8chan was forced offline in the wake of the El Paso massacre, but re-emerged on the new site founded by 8chan’s owners, 8kun.Anonymous internet posters claiming to be high-level government officials are not entirely uncommon in recent years, other so-called “anons” have emerged with claims that they were revealing secrets from inside the FBI or CIA. But Q is the first such figure to have achieved such a broad audience and real-world political influence. This is largely due to the activism of three dedicated conspiracy theorists who latched on to Q’s posts in the early days, according to an investigation by NBC News. These activists worked to develop a mythology and culture around QAnon and cultivated an audience for it on mainstream social media platforms. Reddit was significantly easier to use for the kind of crowd-sourced research and interpretation that forms the core of participation in QAnon, and the site was host to a large pool of potential recruits, such as the 1.2m members of the subreddit rconspiracy. It had also long enjoyed and at times even earned a reputation as one of the danker cesspools of the social web, for years tolerating communities known as “subreddits” dedicated to sharing non-consensual sexualized images of women or advocating rape.But the violent anger of adherents to QAnon crossed the line for Reddit in less than a year. On 12 September 2018, citing its ban on content that “incites violence, disseminates personal information, or harasses”, the company banned 18 QAnon subreddits, the largest of which had more than 70,000 members.Social media bans are often difficult to maintain, but Reddit’s move was uncommonly effective. Today, QAnon remains unwelcome on Reddit, with the few subreddits that address it dedicated to either debunking the theory or providing support to people who have lost friends and family members to QAnon.QAnon did not disappear after Reddit pulled the plug, however. Instead, its believers moved on to other platforms, including YouTube, Twitter, Discord and – crucially – Facebook. At the time of the Reddit ban, one of the largest closed Facebook groups dedicated to QAnon, “Qanon Follow the White Rabbit” had 51,000 members, according to NBC News. Today that group has grown to more than 90,000 members.And while YouTube and Twitter have played an important role in providing a broadcast platform for QAnon content, the specific structures provided by Facebook are uniquely suited to the participatory “work” of engaging with QAnon. Facebook also provides QAnon with an even larger pool of potential recruits than Reddit could, especially for the somewhat older, Evangelical crowd that has proven susceptible to QAnon’s messaging.Will Partin, a research analyst with Data \u0026amp Society, and Alice Marwick, a professor of communication at the University of North Carolina, describe QAnon as a “dark participatory culture”, which is to say that it is a community that takes advantage of the infrastructure of social networking sites to bring disparate people together and foster discussion, collaboration, research and community, but directs those energies toward anti-democratic, regressive and even violent ends.“Everything about our research suggests that these people are not irrational they’re hyper-literate, even if they’ve come to beliefs that are empirically inaccurate ,” Partin said. “That’s partly because they have a fundamentally different epistemology to judge what is true and false.”The digital architecture of Facebook groups is also particularly well-suited to QAnon’s collaborative construction of an alternative body of knowledge, Friedberg said. The platform has created a ready-made digital pathway from public pages to public groups to private groups and finally secret groups that mirrors the process of “falling down the rabbit hole or taking the red pill”.“You can mechanically take those steps,” he said. “Very few of the contemporary Q-following base actually need to engage with 8chan at all.”While Facebook has policies banning hate speech, incitement to violence and other types of content that it considers undesirable on a family- and advertiser-friendly platform, QAnon does not fit neatly into any single category.Much of what is shared in QAnon groups on Facebook is a mix of pro-Trump political speech and pro-Trump political misinformation. Memes, videos and posts are often bigoted and disconnected from reality, but not all that different from the content that is shared in non-QAnon, pro-Trump Facebook groups.The pages and groups that were removed in early May violated the company’s ban on “coordinated inauthentic behavior” – ie the kind of digital astroturf tactics that Russian operatives used to support Trump’s presidential campaign in 2016. Those rules are aimed at operations in which actors make false representations about their identities in order to mislead people – a description that could encompass Q – but Facebook only applies its policy to deceptive behavior that occurs on its platform, not on 8kun.To enact a blanket ban akin to Reddit’s under its current rubric of rules, Facebook would likely have to designate QAnon as a “dangerous organization” – the category it uses to ban both terrorist and hate groups and any content published in support or praise of them. QAnon is hardly an organization, though as a movement it has certainly caused harm and could be considered dangerous.There are innate societal and inidual harms to convincing people of a version of reality that is simply false, as QAnon does, said Data \u0026amp Society research analyst Will Partin. “When a common sense of what is real and what is correct breaks apart, it becomes nearly impossible to reach a democratic consensus.”And QAnon followers’ enthusiasm for misinformation is not confined to politics as the coronavirus pandemic took hold, the groups became a hotbed for medical misinformation – something Facebook has claimed to be working hard to combat. Analyses by Gallagher, the social media researcher, and the New York Times demonstrated how QAnon groups fueled the viral spread of “Plandemic”, a 26-minute video chock full of dangerously false information about Covid-19 and vaccines.Facebook’s algorithms appear to have detected this synergy between the QAnon and anti-vaccine communities. Several QAnon groups are flagged with an automated warning label from Facebook that reads, “This group discusses vaccines” and encourages users to go to the website of the Centers for Disease Control for reliable information on health.It appears that anti-vaccine propagandists are also taking notice, and attempting to capitalize. Larry Cook, the administrator of Stop Mandatory Vaccination, one of the largest anti-vaxx Facebook groups, has begun incorporating QAnon rhetoric into the medical misinformation he peddles, as well as making explicit invitations to QAnon believers to join his group.Cook has begun referencing the “deep state” and stoking fear of forced vaccination and “FEMA camps”.“I have discussed the concept many, many, many times that vaccines destroy our connection to God and that we are in a spiritual war with Principalities of Darkness that have a death wish for our children, and humanity at large,” he wrote in one QAnon-inflected post. (Cook also uses the site to aggressively promote his various products and a subscription-only platform for “medical freedom patriots”.)But the potential for damage from QAnon goes well beyond. For those iniduals who truly believe in the QAnon narrative, the crimes of the “cabal” are so grievous as to make fighting them a moral imperative. “They’re talking about a group of people who are operating our government against our wishes and they’re molesting and torturing children and destroying our society,” said Joseph Uscinski, a professor of political science who studies conspiracy theories. “It’s an incitement to violence.”Indeed, there have been numerous incidents of real-world violence linked to QAnon, and in May 2019, the FBI identified QAnon as a potential domestic terrorism threat in an intelligence bulletin. While anti-government conspiracy theories were not new, the bulletin stated, social media was allowing them to reach a larger audience, and the online narratives were determining the targets of harassment and violence for the small subset of iniduals who crossed over into real-world action.Despite this, Uscinski is skeptical of the idea that kicking QAnon off Facebook would help anyone. He regularly polls conspiracy theories and consistently finds that QAnon is “one of the least believed things” out there, well below belief in theories about Jeffrey Epstein’s death, anti-vaccine hoaxes, and Holocaust denialism. Uscinski also cautions against overly exoticizing the QAnon narrative, noting that “most of the component parts of QAnon have been around forever”, with parallels in the Satanic Panic of the 1980s or the plot of Oliver Stone’s JFK. And he’s concerned about the free speech implications of censorship by tech platforms.“It’s a potentially dangerous belief it’s very disconnected from reality I don’t really think we want more people getting into it,” he said of QAnon. “Do the internet companies bear some responsibility? Yes. Would it be better if they took it down? Probably. Does that take care of it? No.”Partin said that he generally favored Facebook taking a “more aggressive approach to moderation”, including addressing the recommendation algorithms and trying to reduce the spread of misinformation out of dedicated conspiracy communities and into the mainstream.“If Facebook flipped a switch and every Q post disappeared tomorrow, that probably would be harmful for QAnon,” he said. “But there is resiliency built in. Getting deplatformed is harmful, but the idea that it would somehow make this disappear is fanciful.”In May, Republican voters in Oregon nominated a QAnon believer to run for the US Senate in November. Another QAnon supporter, Marjorie Taylor Greene, is likely to be elected to the House of Representatives after she came first in a Republican primary in a conservative Georgia district on 11 June.“In some ways, the second that Trump officially acknowledges QAnon is the second it becomes a partisan political issue that Facebook may not be able to take action against,” said Friedberg. “We’re watching a normalization process of these conspiracies, and I think the beast that is Facebook was really the answer to this all along.”Indeed, Trump himself has repeatedly retweeted QAnon accounts on Twitter, which believers take as confirmation of their alternate reality. And on 20 June, just before Trump’s campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Trump’s adult son Eric posted a QAnon meme on his Instagram account. Eric Trump deleted the image relatively quickly, but not before screenshots spread across the Facebook Q-sphere.“So Eric Trump posted a pic with a ‘Q’ in the imagery,” an administrator of one of the larger QAnon groups wrote. “The pic has been taken down but the message was received!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ceae7912d683b62b4477b8563ff13b63959c09f1/395_567_4388_2633/master/4388.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96580e84de31c0e91f19ddf92788c773","title":"withings sleep analyzer review advanced sleep tracking made easy","story":"Track sleep, heart rate, snoring and even sleep apnoea with a zero-maintenance mat you stick under your mattressSleep tracking has become an important piece of total wellness monitoring, but typically requires strapping devices to your wrist or head. Withings Sleep Analyzer records your sleep and heart rate, plus is one of the first devices to monitor sleep apnoea, all without you needing to attach anything to your person.Instead, the £120 Sleep Analyzer is a sensor-packed slim mat that you slide under your mattress. Once it’s there you simply go to sleep as normal.The mat is 637mm long, 190mm wide and only 5mm thick, so easily slides between your mattress and base (including slatted bases), positioned around where your chest lies. It tracks your breathing, heart rate and movement with a pneumatic sensor, and your snoring and sleep apnoea with a sound sensor. It then syncs the data via wifi to your Withings account and the accompanying Health Mate app when you get up.Set up is simple using Health Mate on iOS or Android. Put the mat in place, plug it in, find the mat via Bluetooth in the app and then wait for it to inflate and calibrate. The process takes about five minutes.You can’t feel it in bed and can barely see it, as just a thin USB power cable pokes out from under your mattress, which plugs into an adapter. The cable is long enough to stretch to the nearest plug, even if it’s on the other side of the bed.The tracking is automatic, so all you have to do is get into bed and sleep as you usually would, which is the beauty of the Sleep Analyzer system. You can completely forget about it and just pick up your data when you need it.Your data is securely synced and stored in your Withings account, but can be synced from there with other apps and combined with fitness data such as steps from Google Fit and Apple Health, among others.You get a colour-coded graph showing your periods of being awake, in light, deep and REM (when you dream) sleep over time, an overall sleep score each night out of 100 and a rating in words, such as “restful night”. But you also get data broken down into sections including duration, depth, regularity, the number of times your sleep has been interrupted, the time it took you to go to sleep and the time it took you to get up after waking.Each section has a traffic light system: green dot for good, orange for average and red if it’s been a bad night. They can be expanded for more information, too, such as a range of what was good and bad, comparisons with previous nights and some simple advice.Those are the basics of most sleep trackers and the Withings matches the data from various other wrist-borne sleep trackers including Garmin and Samsung watches pretty well. The Health Mate app presents the data in a way that makes it fairly easy to follow what happened overnight, and gives an average of sleep scores and sleep time over the last week or month. What it doesn’t do is provide much in the way of guidance on how to improve your sleep beyond the most obvious things, such as maintaining regular hours, keeping noises to a minimum in the bedroom and the temperature low.Beyond basic sleep stats, the Sleep Analyzer also measures your sleeping heart rate, with an accuracy matching wrist-borne heart rate monitors, as a good measure of overall health: the lower the better to a point.You can see a chart of your heart rate for the night, but also see the trend over the last quarter. My average sleep heart rate has decreased by two beats a minute over the last quarter, for instance. Here Withings has more advice covering health, fitness, diet and other bits, which can help you find out why your sleeping heart rate might be high.You can also spot things in your own charts. I can see, for instance, when I’ve been ill as my sleeping heart rate is higher than normal across the full night, or when I’ve drunk alcohol in the evening as my heart rate starts higher then tapers back down to normal as the night progresses.The Sleep Analyzer’s killer feature, which few other devices can offer, is tracking of sleep apnoea, something Withings recently got regulatory approval in the EU to implement.Sleep apnoea is a condition where breathing becomes more difficult when you’re asleep due to the relaxation of the muscles in your throat, which can lead to you to stop breathing. The result is a disturbed sleep where you’re often jolted at least partially awake to breathe again.For many this may happen occasionally in the night, but for some it can happen as much as 20 times an hour, which does your sleep no good at all. Many may be completely oblivious this is happening too.Each night the Sleep Analyzer watches for signs of sleep apnoea, recording events as well as snoring, which can be a precursor. The data is then presented to you on a sliding scale of normal to mild, moderate and severe. My highest over the last couple of months has been 11 events an hour, which was rated as normal to mild, but most nights are symptomless. I also don’t snore very often, but when I have the tracker has picked it up reliably.You can view your data over the last day, quarter or year, to keep an eye on it. But if the tracker detects enough sleep apnoea events it will recommend a couple of tests to estimate your risk, give you guidance on the symptoms, advice on how to improve things and lets you share a report with your doctor should medical help be needed.It’s worth noting that some wrist-borne fitness trackers with blood oxygen sensors can also track sleep apnoea events by measuring the dip in oxygen in your blood associated with them.The Withings Sleep Analyzer is a sleep tracking mat that’s simply easy to live with. Stick it under your mattress and go to sleep. It works automatically. You can’t feel it, nor do you have to wear or charge anything.The data it produces is good and the way it’s presented in the excellent Health Mate app is easy to follow and track across days, weeks or quarters. Sleep heart rate data is interesting and the ability to track both snoring and sleep apnoea without having to wear anything is the mat’s killer feature.The app provides some good information around heart rate and sleep apnoea, what it means and how to improve it, but it could do with some more effective guidance on how to turn around a trend of bad sleep, rather than letting the user work it out from graphs and stats.With sleep tracking built into many wearables, you might wonder why you need a purpose-built gadget for it. Really the Sleep Analyzer is for those who, like me, don’t like wearing devices or watches overnight. It’s not cheap, but the Withings Sleep Analyzer works great with the minimum of fuss if you want to track your sleep.Pros: comprehensive sleep tracking, nothing to wear, very easy to live with, fits most beds, tracks heart rate, monitors sleep apnoea, syncs over wifiCons: expensive, guidance on how to improve sleep could be better This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Here is a selection of small coastal pitches to tryOn the shore of the Dyfi estuary, Smugglers Cove’s three secluded pitches are some of the most fortunately situated in the country. Across the sands and water sits the RSPB’s Ynys-hir nature reserve (as seen on BBC’s Springwatch), home to lapwings, redshanks and, most dramatically of all, ospreys. A beached boat called The Boy John provides a communal area for campers or funky glamping accommodation. And if you can bear to leave, the beach at Aberdyfi and dunes beyond are magnificent. • From £20 for a two-person tent (maximum 5 people per pitch) hoping to open from early August, smugglerscove.infoThere are probably worse things in life than being surrounded by apple and pear orchards in a dip of the North Kent Downs. The owners have gone to town on safety here: so expect a guaranteed 10m space between pitches, extra loos and showers, a twice-daily deep clean and antibacterial foggers. If you want to go fancy, there are 15 furnished bell tents for hire (and two unfurnished if you want to go fancy but with your own gear). Close by the coastal towns of Deal and Ramsgate await exploration with the long sweep of Sandwich Bay between them.• Adult £10-£13, child £7-8, open from 4 July (mostly midweek availability), fallowfieldscampingWithin easy striking distance of Ilfracombe, Woolacombe and the two-mile stretch of sandy beach at Morte Bay, Strawfields is a pleasingly tiny campsite of two cosy little fields, replete with rustic wooden bridges over streams. Capacity has been reduced to eight pitches to enable physical distancing, so you can relax and enjoy the menagerie of four-legged beasts that live here, including alpacas, pygmy goats, Kune Kune pigs and Shetland ponies. Those seeking a little more luxury can book one of the two new yurts or four shepherd’s huts (and if even that’s too outdoorsy, there’s a holiday cottage, too).• Pitch (including 2 adults) £20, child £5, open from 4 July, strawfieldsNamed after the gargantuan limestone figure of the Osmington White Horse beneath whose hooves the campsite sits, this pop-up site’s laid-back choose-your-own-pitch ethos means you should be able to escape any madding crowds. In an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) with green rolling vistas, Whitehorse is a mile from the sea as the gull swoops, while Weymouth is just down the road.

Below its sails an extra field is being prepared for camping this summer so there should be lots of space among the site’s almond, cherry, nectarine, pear and plum trees. In Norfolk’s north-west corner, it’s ideal for exploring both the western end of the Norfolk Coast AONB and the beaches running down The Wash. The windmill – fully restored and working – will be opening to visitors, and you can buy bread and cakes fresh from the adjoining bakery.• Pitches from £20, open 4 July to 30 September, birchamwindmillHidden away in rural Lincolnshire and run by a family that has farmed in these parts since the 1700s, Ostler’s Wood makes a fine base for hitting the lesser-visited coastline between Boston and Skegness. There are bell tents and deluxe pods, while campers have two equally appealing venues in which to pitch: a generously-sized field fit for spreading out in and enjoying views of the neighbouring countryside, or a brand new woodland area to hide away in and forget the world outside. Both come with fire pits so you can rustle up something tasty after a long day walking the shore.• Woodland pitch £25, field pitch £19 (minimum stay two nights), open 4 July, newfarmholidaysWith four hectares of land but only 15 pitches, there’s no excuse for not getting away from it all (and everybody else) at Ffynnonddewi. There are fire pits available to keep you warm while stargazing (the Newgale Beach Dark Sky Discovery Site is nearby) and eco-friendly touches, such as solar power for lighting and phone charging.

The strand is perfect for watching bottlenose dolphins or for a campfire while the sun sets over the mountains. And while it should be noted that shared facilities will remain closed (so bring a loo), you can probably leave your insect repellent at home – the Black Isle is practically midge-free.• Pitch (including 2 adults) £22 taking bookings for 15 July to 31 October, fortrosebaycampsiteBeneath the hulking flat-topped peaks known as MacLeod’s Tables, this former croft sits at the head of Loch Dunvegan.

So we packed (very little), rented double kayaks (90€kayak) from canoeevasion at Cosne sur Loire, took two of our own paddleboards, and with a week’s worth of gear on each craft, off we paddled. I say “we” paddled – the kids, in their kayaks, drifted downstream. But what a great trip to Orléans – the city liberated by Joan of Arc after years of English occupation – this was. We glided down the shallow, warm waters of the Loire, with only small pleasure craft, pretty towns like Gien and the occasional castle to break up the view. The 60-mile trip was an amazing, no-frills adventure, and the four teenagers still say it was their best holiday ever.Angela LukeIf you enjoy gentle cycling along traffic-free cycle paths and rural lanes, take your bike on the Newhaven-Dieppe ferry and head south-east through the Normandy countryside. After a few miles you’ll join a disused railway, part of the Avenue Verte between London and Paris. As you roll along, spot the half-timbered farm buildings set among green dairy pasture and apple orchards. Stay over in Neufchâtel-en-Bray (which offers several chambres d’hôtes) for day rides around the local villages, and make sure you stop at a farm to buy soft, creamy Neufchâtel cheese.

A red carpet stretched down the street, dotted with white-cloth covered tables and Parisians raising their champagne flutes. Madame in Yves Saint Laurent inclined her head as did Monsieur in velvet trousers. Flowers spilt out in front of exquisite small shops and galleries and the elegant doors of Rue de Verneuil, a street untouched by Haussmann’s hands, tucked in behind Musée d’Orsay.

We explored the whole of Brittany, and had our fair share of mussels and ice cream. In the tiny seaside village of Douarnenez, I saw a bunch of giddy children in lifejackets, heading down to the waterfront. It was a perfect sunny day and their enthusiasm summed up how it felt to be a child during their summer holidays.

There you find a still-unresolved fresco from the end of the 12th century, probably of Eleanor of Aquitaine with her son Richard the Lionheart. But if you go deeper inside the rock, down steep steps, you will find a sacred site of the Celts still in place: the aquamarine of a holy bath.Christine ZeileEvery June and July, the Anjou Vélo Vintage is held in Saumur on the Loire. I’ve been visiting, first as a spectator, then as a participant since 2014. Even without the event, Saumur is a pretty little town with a cracking château. But when it’s filled with vintage costumes, music and bicyclettes, it’s transformed into a carnival of colour. The festivities start on the Friday evening with 1950s live music and dancing in the vintage “village” overlooking the bridge over the Loire. The Saturday and Sunday have several rides leaving the town centre and ning the fields and country lanes nearby. This is suitable for everyone, from children to serious cyclists. Jane BlackGaillac wine is practically unheard of outside France, but its unpretentious and discreet nature can be best appreciated by experiencing an apéro concert in and around Gaillac. These outdoor events are held on warm summer evenings at numerous local vineyards. Music varies from classical (chateau-de-mayragues) to rock’n’roll (lesvignals.fr). You might get a table and chairs, or you might get hay bales to sit on. Children can run around freely. The wine has travelled no further than vine to cellar and is served by the owners themselves, while food vans offer a choice of Toulouse sausages, crèpes and assorted cheese.

It’s a small step, but one that shows the practical overhaul which is neededOn Wednesday, Jenny Slate and Kristen Bell, two white American actors, announced that they would step down from voicing their mixed-race characters in the animated comedies Big Mouth and Central Park respectively. Slate gave up her gig as the character Missy, explaining that she had realised that it was “an act of erasure of black people”. Bell quit her part, too, saying that she was “happy to relinquish this role to someone who can give a much more accurate portrayal”.Their decisions come after a month when race and racism have been interrogated on a global scale, and where much of popular culture is being seen for what it is: wholly problematic.The initial conversation around blackface on TV, and the withdrawal of shows such as Little Britain and an episode of Fawlty Towers from streaming services (the latter has since been reinstated by UKTV) distracts from the more systemic change needed. Offensive and vulgar as many of these shows were, the answer was surely to preface them with content warnings rather than to bin them, and stoke the fires of an often idiotic culture war.Tabloid conversations about “woke” PC culture in a frenzy are a ersion from the bigger issues at hand: the persistence of white supremacy, and the fact that it had taken another kind of media – the killing of George Floyd, broadcast across the world – for many white people to acknowledge the existence of racism in the 21st century.There is of course a conversation to be had about why these programmes, especially in the case of David Walliams and Matt Lucas’s output, were still being made until as recently as they were – and the “ironic racism” that went along with them. However, as the conversation grew, it was evidently a distraction from bigger structural issues. A colleague pointed out that none of the young people they were interviewing at Black Lives Matter protests had even heard of Fawlty Towers.Which brings us back to Slate and Bell, and the active role that the TV and entertainment industry can play in addressing racial disparity now that those black squares on Instagram and promises to “do better” are but a memory. This week, 3,500 people working in the UK TV and film industries signed a letter calling on broadcasters to take action. No longer are nebulous conversations about bringing in “erse talent” the order of the day: the emphasis is on specifics, from enlisting more independent producers to making sure that people parachuted in on ersity schemes are allowed to progress rather than stagnate in lower roles (which, of course, mean lower salaries and ever-widening pay gaps).You could ask (as I had before they resigned) why these actors accepted these jobs in the first place. As we’ve seen in the past month, much of this comes down to the way some people have been allowed to centre themselves in the world, and the misguided belief that living your life in a polite, passive, kind of anti-racist way is the same thing as actively being anti-racist (spoiler alert: it isn’t).But there is a chance now to make things right through genuine engagement. Quitting a role is one thing, but how can both actors make sure that they take the responsibility they’ve pledged to take going forward? What things can they, and others, call out or not allow to continue? bell hooks said: “While it is in no way racist for any author to write a book exclusively about white women, it is fundamentally racist for books to be published that focus solely on the American white woman’s experience in which that experience is assumed to be the American woman’s experience.” The same could easily be said for TV, where representation is still often of the stereotyped or siloed kind. I draw the line at praising Slate or Bell for giving up their roles, as this commitment to people of colour appears to be an afterthought (while Bell was newer to her role, Slate had played hers for three years). However, it is something. In a world where actors like these can play any role that they like, some things just shouldn’t be on the table. Now: let’s make sure their replacements are on the same salaries."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff394f5ce885a2705b011e3feb0494bccd5343c1/363_645_3908_2345/master/3908.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef9bf60ba42d0dcbc535f56c26c8bfd4","title":"washington dc statehood bid house","story":"DC has been trying to make its case to join the union for decades as its residents have long found themselves in a constitutional black holePaul Strauss was a 29-year-old activist when Washington, District of Columbia (DC) last had a shot at becoming the 51st state in the United States of America. He sat in the chamber as the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives defeated the statehood bill by an almost 2-1 margin in 1993.“I was very disappointed and very frustrated,” recalls Strauss, now 56 and the “shadow” senator for DC. “I really felt that we could do a lot more and I’ve been pushing the boulder uphill ever since.”Twenty-seven years later, DC’s bid for statehood returns to the House on Friday with far brighter prospects. Democrats, again in the majority, are expected to actually pass the bill this time, arguing that statehood has gained importance in the aftermath of protests for racial justice in Washington and across the US.It will not be mission accomplished since the legislation then faces insurmountable opposition in the Republican-controlled Senate. But should Democrats regain the Senate in November, DC will move closer to becoming the first state to join the union since Hawaii in August 1959.It has been trying to make its case for decades. Although at just 68 sq miles (176 sq km) DC is hard to find on maps, its population of just over 700,000 is bigger than than Wyoming’s and Vermont’s. Yet while famed as the most powerful capital city in the world, paradoxically its residents have long found themselves in a constitutional black hole.Uniquely disenfranchised, they could not even vote for US president until 1964 and, alone among national capitals in the democratic world, they are still denied a vote in their national congress or parliament. DC residents pay more per capita in federal income taxes than any state but Congress controls the city’s budget and can override its laws and withhold funds.Statehood would finally give DC one voting member of the House and two in the Senate, which may explain Republicans’ staunch opposition. Senator Edward Kennedy once described the arguments against statehood as the “four too’s”: a fear that DC would be too black, too urban, too Democratic and too liberal.The statehood campaign was already gathering momentum this year, with backing from numerous Democratic candidates for president, but the police killing of George Floyd, an African American man in Minneapolis, gave added impetus. As protests swelled in the capital, Trump ordered armed federal forces into DC against the will of the mayor, Muriel Bowser.Susan Rice, a former national security adviser who grew up in DC and supports statehood, wrote in the New York Times: “For one long week, Mr Trump transformed my hometown into a war zone to burnish his ‘law and order’ credentials. Without statehood, Washington was virtually powerless to prevent Mr Trump from using the capital as a petri dish to intimidate protesters, ide Americans and goad activists into ugly street battles to galvanize elements of his base.”It was Trump’s controversial use of federal security forces to clear Lafayette Square near the White House of peaceful protesters, allowing him to stage a photo op outside a historic church, that proved the catalyst for Democratic leaders to schedule the vote. The majority leader, Steny Hoyer, presented by Bowser with a US flag bearing 51 stars, said “this was an appropriate time to bring a bill forward to show respect for the citizens of the District of Columbia”.The DC statehood campaign has long been seen as an extension of the civil rights movement and could spur activists in Puerto Rico and other US territories. Strauss, who as shadow senator was forced to watch Trump’s impeachment trial from the public gallery, said: “Washington DC’s disenfranchisement has always had its roots in systemic racism. The fact that all of the nonvoting parts of the United States have majority non-white populations is more than just a coincidence.”DC would also get a new name: Washington, Douglass Commonwealth, which honors the abolitionist Frederick Douglass, a denizen of the city, and could still be written as Washington DC for short. “Trump is really being aided and abetted by an anti-democratic Senate. It’s an institution that disproportionately represents small rural states that are an ideological minority in this country. Meanwhile, 700,000 people who live in the District of Columbia, most of whom are not white, do not have any representation in the Senate at all, let alone a vote.”Hatcher-Mays, formerly an aide to Eleanor Holmes Norton, the sole DC non-voting delegate in the House, added that the Black Lives Matter protests, where Trump was “able to effectively declare martial law in DC”, also played a part. “It becomes not just a matter of democracy, but it becomes a racial justice issue, too. I think that really sealed it for a lot of people in a way that it hadn’t been a priority for people before.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4014f6fa721d030feb0281f4246da94be2eb4c96/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea55e4f1e90b96ea3c62876403138f23","title":"planning rules lifted for fairs markets and car boot sales in england","story":"Events can be held without planning permission under new laws designed to boost the economySummer fairs, outdoor markets and car boot sales can be held without planning permission in England, while alcohol will be widely available to take away, under what are designed to be new feel-good laws drawn up by ministers.Eating and drinking in pub and restaurant car parks will also be allowed when the business and planning bill is introduced tomorrow. The changes come ahead of what is being dubbed “Super Saturday” on 4 July, which will see the mass reopening of pubs, restaurants, hairdressers and museums in a dramatic easing of coronavirus lockdown measures.The new laws are part of a series of government policies designed to help people socialise and reinvigorate the economy this summer. But serious fears remain over the risk of a second wave of Covid-19, especially amid crowds where physical distancing is impossible, as well as the impact on workers.Lucy Powell, shadow minister for business and consumers, said: “We have to bear in mind that for a lot of people they won’t have confidence about going to restaurants and bars. It also won’t be the same experience so we shouldn’t see the reopening as a panacea for things getting back to normal.”It comes as Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, told MPs that plans for “air bridges” to allow quarantine-free travel abroad are gathering pace.He told the Commons transport select committee that there would be an announcement to parliament on Monday 29 June, with criteria and clarification on how they would operate.Shapps expects to speak to representatives from the devolved nations in coming days. Wales’ current five-mile restriction on travel – which would make it difficult for many to travel to an airport – will be discussed.New elements added to the business and planning bill, to be announced tomorrow, are designed to help businesses serve more customers outside and increase street trading. As well as summer fairs, car boot sales and outdoor markets not requiring planning permission, measures will be taken to help English councils pedestrianise streets so these events can be set up easily, the government said.Temporary changes to licensed premises will allow people to take drinks off-site, something which is typically banned in England through town by-laws.On Wednesday, sector-by-sector guidance for 4 July reopenings was issued, necessitating separate facilities for household groups in hotels and hostels, the use of screens and regular cleaning. Hair salons have been urged to keep the volume of piped music low to avoid customers and staff needing to shout, which creates an increased Covid-19 risk.Ahead of the hospitality sector opening its doors however, Michael Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association (NTIA), warned that the new guidance was creating “chaos and confusion”.“For our sector, 4 July might end up being more ‘doomsday’ rather than the ‘independence day’ that the prime minister is envisioning,” he said.“We are now grappling with operational guidance that places unworkable conditions on customer behaviour. This will make it highly challenging for the businesses to re-engage, meaning many venues will simply be unable to open and trade profitably,” he said.Trades unions complained that, unlike the reopening of other sectors, they had not been consulted on the new regime for the hospitality sector.The Unite general secretary, Len McCluskey, said: “The governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are all working closely with trade unions to keep workers safe.“England’s workers deserve the same commitment so it is totally baffling that the Westminster government will not accept Unite’s offer to use our standing army of health and safety reps to help with safe reopening of the economy.”The TUC has also raised concerns about whether the new guidance is enforceable.Frances O’Grady, general secretary of the TUC, is asking for more funding for the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) to carry out checks to make sure workplaces are safe.Boris Johnson’s spokesman said it will be up to local authorities and the HSE to police the new guidance under existing legislation that allows them to close premises and levy fines if safety is being put at risk.Police will retain the power to break up “irresponsible” gatherings of more than 30 people – though there will be nothing to stop pubs or other venues serving more than 30 customers, provided they abide by physical distancing rules.Ian Hodson, national president of the Bakers Food and Allied Workers Union, said he was disappointed with the Conservatives announcing the new “1 metre-plus” rule without meaningful consultation with workers who will be staffing pubs, restaurants and cafes, and working on food assembly lines.He said the union was also unhappy with the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, for accepting the rule change.He said: “It’s the people that have been missing from this announcement. It might suit the business lobby and it shows the pubs have a very powerful business lobby but workers haven’t been consulted.”The mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, criticised the government for reopening the hospitality industry on a Saturday.“I would say that they have just come down on the side of risk, rather than caution, on the side of the economy rather than health,” he told Sky News.“The plan to open everything on a Saturday is, I think, a mistake, certainly unwise.”He added: “I am concerned about everything opening up on what Sky might dub ‘Super Saturday’.

The report found the decade-long campaign “seems to be escalating”.The survey, carried out in September and October 2019, asked journalism unions from 58 countries on whether they have received overtures from Beijing. This included questions about sponsored trips, content-sharing agreements and approaches to sign bilateral agreements with Chinese bodies.Journalists from 29 of the nations surveyed had been on trips to China, with almost two-thirds of respondents judging that China has a visible presence in their national media. One-third of the journalism unions surveyed had been approached by Chinese entities seeking joint agreements.The research found Beijing increasingly relies upon non-Chinese journalists, especially from developing countries, to amplify its own talking points.“Beijing’s strategy whereby state-approved propaganda is diffused into existing systems is known as ‘borrowing a boat to reach the ocean’,” the report said.One example has been a recent attempt by Beijing to push back against western narratives of human rights abuses in the political indoctrination camps in the far western province of Xinjiang, where Beijing is holding up to one million members of the Uighur minority, according to United Nations estimates.Beijing has taken several groups of journalists from Muslim countries to the camps to win international support for its hardline strategy of combating what it says is religious extremism.China is not the only country that seeks to influence foreign journalists. Many others, including the US and Israel, run government-sponsored journalistic study tours of their countries, seeking to promote their positions and global points of view. And global arms of state-funded media organisations or national broadcasters – such as Voice of America and the BBC World Service – are seen as effective instruments of ‘soft power’ and influence.Report author Louisa Lim told the  China’s efforts were often more comprehensive and were specifically targeted to each country, in particular, towards small and developing nations.“It’s true other countries have done this every effectively. One difference, I would say, is the way journalists who go on these tours are being used domestically, by, for instance, going on tours of Xinjiang, that is used try and show international support for China’s policies.“Also journalists are sometimes asked to sign agreements before they leave, and told not to write critical stories. There is also an element of monitoring, with officials, translators always present.”At one roundtable of nine Myanmar journalists conducted for the IFJ research, every single journalist had been offered sponsored trips to China at least twice, and had accepted every single offer. One journalist had been to China nine times.“The message is not don’t go on these tours, but know what they are. If you have an opportunity to meet senior officials, use them to hold to account.” has sought comment from the Chinese embassy in Australia, sending a detailed list of questions to the embassy. It has not received a response.Media control and influence has become a critical diplomatic controversy between, in particular, the US and China. This week, the US state department announced that Chinese state-run media organisations China Central Television, China News Service, the People’s Daily, and the Global Times would be designated in the US as foreign missions.In response, China’s foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said the US decision was “proof of blatant political oppression by the US on Chinese media”.“We strongly urge the US to reject the cold war mindset and ideological bias, and to immediately stop and redress such wrongdoing that hurts others and itself, ” he said.China has also been refusing to renew the visas of US journalists working in the country.The IFJ research found Beijing has prioritised journalists from countries involved in its massive infrastructural project, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).In the Philippines a number of journalists received training in China after the President’s Communications Operation Office signed a memorandum of understanding with China’s National Radio and Television Administration.One Filipino journalist – who asked to remain anonymous – noted the subsequent impact on their news output. “The way they write their stories now, they reflect the way Xinhua – or the state media in China – is writing their stories. It’s normally propaganda.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5666dd9344ec19c4da202f88eae640c61d4ebd22/0_367_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d58ce65f9683ffbff2d117573c0a29b1","title":"israel brings back tracking system amid surge in covid 19 cases","story":"Knesset votes to approve bill authorising domestic security agency to track infectionsIsrael is experiencing an alarming surge in coronavirus cases, which has prompted the government to approve reimposing a controversial tracking system administered by the country’s domestic security agency, the Shin Bet, over the reported objections of the agency.Cases in the country have surged again after Israel eased restrictions at the end of May – a move that coincided with the Shavuot holiday, when people crowded beaches on both the Mediterranean and the Sea of Galilee.Amid mounting concern over the resurgence of the virus and criticism of the government’s “muddled” response, one senior health official warned that the country might have reopened too quickly.“We may have opened too quickly. The public is not disciplined or wearing masks,” Sigal Sadetzky, the head of public health services at Israel’s health ministry, told the Times of Israel.“There is an increase in the number of new patients and I am worried. We are still protecting the elderly and the populations at risk more than the rest, but it can never be totally effective,” Sadetzky said.With 532 new infections reported by the health ministry in the past 24 hours, Israel has seen the emergence of a number of hotspots including in the Sea of Galilee resort of Tiberias, as well as Tel Aviv and Jerusalem – the highest daily total in more than two months.As of Thursday morning, the number of coronavirus cases had hit 22,139 since the beginning of the outbreak, with 49 in serious condition and 29 on ventilators, and 500 new cases being reported every day.Cases also appeared to be rising in the occupied territories where the Palestinian Authority has announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in all mosques across the West Bank.On Wednesday night, Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, voted to approve a bill authorising Shin Bet to track coronavirus cases and those in contact with them.While some of the new clusters appear to be linked to schools, a significant number of cases in the country’s second peak appear to be affecting the under-40s, meaning the rise in infections has not been matched by a similar rise in fatalities.Among places recording a surge in new cases were the southern city of Ashdod, which recorded a steep hike in new virus cases, Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and the town of Elad, which has been put under lockdown.Since the beginning of the week, 1,392 new infections have been reported – more than the number of infections recorded during the entire month of May.The surge in cases follows the marked loosening of social restrictions, with the cabinet approval of gatherings for weddings and funerals of up to 250 people – a move the director general of health ministry, Chezy Levy, said might have to be reconsidered.“Additional restrictions are on the table for discussion, such as whether we take a step back in the area of events held in halls,” Levy told Army Radio. “Weddings may have to be smaller, if there is no choice.”Health officials forecast a sharp rise in the coming days, with as many as 1,000 new daily cases expected within just five days.Sadetzky told Channel 12 those involved in tracing the virus spread were “collapsing”. But she said she was confident the virus could be contained without reimposing another nationwide lockdown.The defence minister, Benny Gantz, ordered the Israel Defence Forces home front command to open additional hotels for coronavirus patients.

Will a leftward turn be enough?France should be proud of what its people – and government – have achieved in the battle against the coronavirus, Emmanuel Macron told the nation in his most recent address. Unfortunately, the nation seems in no particular mood to listen.With two years of his five-year term left, the 42-year-old French president’s agenda of economic and social reform – aimed at spurring growth, creating jobs and deregulating the economy – has been thrown badly off track by Covid-19.He is also battling a critical, if not outright hostile, French public an anticipated avalanche of dreadful local election results on 28 June and ever more evident splits in the centrist La République en Marche (LREM) movement that he led to sweeping presidential and parliamentary victories in 2017.Despite undeniable blunders, France has, by most measures, handled the pandemic reasonably well – and better than comparable neighbours such as Spain, Italy and Britain (although not, importantly for French voters, Germany).The country should probably have imposed its mandatory lockdown several days earlier than it did, on 16 March, and should certainly have been more honest about an early shortage of masks – and more energetic in building up testing capacity.But France contained the virus largely to the greater Paris region and the north-east was quick to propose a generous €500bn (£450m) aid package for businesses that has protected more than 11 million employees and has managed its exit from lockdown smoothly.The number of new infections has fallen steadily, to a recent seven-day average of about 450, compared with 4,500 in late March. Daily deaths have followed a similar curve since a peak of nearly 1,500 on 15 April and now average about 35. Cinemas, and all schools for the under-16s, opened again on Monday.“We have nothing to be ashamed of,” Macron said in his address on 14 June. “In how many countries was all this done? That’s fortunate and it shows the strength of our state and our social model. We can be proud of what was done and of our country.”But French voters, almost always more critical of their rulers than most, are not buying it – or Macron.The president’s ailing popularity has many causes besides his perceived errors in handling Covid-19. Having blown up France’s political landscape, crushing the main centre-left and centre-right parties on his way to the Élysée, he has no established tribe on which he can rely to back him come what may.Strongly partisan voters on both left and right loathe Macron with real passion. While he still retains the reasoned support of many in the centre, polls show a clear majority of voters, despite his recent efforts to appear more relatable, continue to see him as aloof and imperious.His LREM movement, meanwhile, is struggling to transition from raw political startup to functioning party machine. Last month, 17 MPs – mainly disgruntled former Macron supporters who believe the party, contrary to its pledge to be “neither left nor right”, is distinctly more right than left – formed a new parliamentary group.Ecology, Democracy, Solidarity is not formally part of the opposition, but has warned it will vote against the government if it feels it warranted. The move cost LREM its absolute majority and was a significant symbolic blow, even if the party still has a comfortable working majority thanks to other centrists in parliament.Nor will the second round of France’s local elections, delayed by the pandemic, provide much encouragement. In Paris, the Socialist mayor, Anne Hidalgo, is on course for re-election after a disastrous LREM campaign elsewhere, one-time Macron allies face excommunication after sealing electoral pacts with rivals.For these reasons and more – even if an early Ifop poll this week saw him winning the 2022 election by 10 points against the far-right leader, Marine Le Pen – Macron’s presidency is in need of a reboot. He is uncomfortably aware that both his immediate predecessors, Nicolas Sarkozy and François Hollande, were ejected from office after a single term.Macron has promised to “reinvent” himself – and present a detailed plan for the final two years of his mandate – next month. With the positive impact of some initial reforms (such as 800,000 new jobs) set to be mostly wiped out by Covid-19, most observers assume that this will entail at least the appearance of a shift to the left.The president signalled this in his 14 June address, promising a “new path” for the second half of his mandate, heavy on greener economic policies, more social solidarity and a greater emphasis on national production. “Our first priority will be to rebuild an economy that is strong, ecological, sovereign and united,” he said, but also “founded on hard work”.Acknowledging the crisis had “exposed our shortcomings and weaknesses, our dependence on others for certain products, our organisational handicaps,” he promised “massive investment” in education, greater “technological, digital, industrial and agricultural independence” and more power to local authorities.Since it is standard practice for French presidents to sack their prime ministers to mark a fresh start, an early victim of the administration’s expected step-change could be his loyal prime minister, Édouard Philippe, a conservative who never joined LREM and is, for most French voters, clearly associated more with the right than the left.So, Macron faces a dilemma: replace a credible, well-liked prime minister (and possibly create a future rival) or risk being eclipsed as he struggles to chart a more caring, eco-friendly, post-coronavirus course in the run-up to 2022. It is not the biggest decision the president faces, but it could be one of the more significant."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1126c556a784e2a836256952278ce96afc067d7b/180_187_1038_623/master/1038.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0502c0dbb22510cfeb4a987751e16617","title":"small scale miner finds biggest tanzanite gems in history worth 33m","story":"Saniniu Laizer plans to build a school and shopping mall near his home in Tanzania, but will hold a big party firstA Tanzanian subsistence miner has hit the jackpot after the government handed him a cheque for 7.74bn Tanzanian shillings ($3.35m) for the two largest tanzanite gemstones ever found.The two dark violet-blue gemstones, each about the dimensions of a forearm, were discovered by Saniniu Laizer in one of the tanzanite mines in the north of the country which are surrounded by a wall to control cross-border smuggling of the gemstones.“There will be a big party tomorrow,” the small-scale miner from Simanjiro district in Manyara, told the BBC.“I want to build a shopping mall and a school. I want to build this school near my home. There are many poor people around here who can’t afford to take their children to school.”“I am not educated but I like things run in a professional way.

President John Magufuli phoned to congratulate Laizer live on television.“This is a confirmation that Tanzania is rich,” Magufuli told minerals minister Doto Biteko.Tanzania last year set up trading centres around the country to allow artisanal miners to sell their gems and gold to the government.

Instead – with no warning, or chance to buy water or use the toilet – she found herself on a four-hour bus trip to Rotorua, a city 225km away, to spend her quarantine there.When she tweeted about her experience – New Zealand’s government had started to use hotels in Rotorua and the South Island city of Christchurch to quarantine returning travellers as Auckland reached capacity – it didn’t take long for responders to chide Ellen for what they saw as complaining. “Stay away from us until you’re declared safe,” one wrote. “So sorry if we don’t care about your food needs.”It was just one example of the backlash from some quarters against New Zealanders returning to the country in search of safety from the pandemic raging on other shores. In a nation in the rare position of returning to normal life free from Covid-19, New Zealanders are roiling with anxiety as coronavirus cases ratchet up in other countries, fearing the virus could be imported here. And some would rather pull up the drawbridge.“It was just baffling to me that these very fundamental, basic human needs that people would be willing to deny those in others,” Ellen said. “By no means have any of us been complaining about needing to quarantine, or the sacrifices or even the quality of quarantine. We just wanted to be told what was happening.”New Zealand was, until just over a week ago, free of Covid-19 after the last remaining case in the country was declared recovered, and had recorded 24 consecutive days with no fresh instances of the virus, drawing global admiration for prime minister Jacinda Ardern’s government. The nation has recorded fewer than 1,500 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in total, and 22 deaths.But over the past week, a slow trickle of cases has begun at the border - as Ardern and her officials warned it would - as the number of New Zealanders returning home increases.Quarantine hotels appointed to manage their two-week isolation are filling up - there were 4,200 people quarantined in the facilities as of Monday, Ardern said, with 900 more expected in the next two days.There are currently 11 active cases of Covid-19 in the country, with none in hospital - all of them returning travellers, and all but two diagnosed during routine testing at the quarantine hotels. Tensions among New Zealanders over some of the cases exploded last week when officials were forced to admit that two of them, women returning from Britain, had been allowed to leave quarantine early on compassionate grounds without being tested.Dozens of others were also allowed to leave facilities without testing before rules were tightened up, it was revealed. Now, resentment of new arrivals for - in the eyes of some - putting the country’s Covid-19 elimination status in jeopardy, combined with anger at news outlets for reporting each new quarantine bungle and complaint, has proved a potent mix.“Early on, we predicted there would be much higher levels of anxiety, but people really pulled together as this ‘team of five million,’” said Dougal Sutherland, the clinical practice manager at Victoria University’s school of psychology, referring to the phrase Ardern had coined to unite New Zealanders during a strict national lockdown in March and April.“On the other side, it seems like there’s a few fractures and splinters,” he added. “That animosity towards returning New Zealanders who might have the coronavirus is part of a fight, flight or freeze response, and the fight response really activates that anger part of it.”The country was on wartime footing, he said, and threats felt heightened. “The downside of the ‘team of five million’ is that we cast people as the out-group,” he said. “Anyone coming in from the outside is a potential threat and we respond to them that way.”Only New Zealanders, their immediate families, and certain essential workers are permitted to enter the country, Sutherland added: “They all have the right to be there.”The rhetoric of national unity – New Zealand together against the world – that Ardern successfully deployed to manage the national lockdown has been a unique part of the country’s response, other analysts said.“In New Zealand, we had enormous buy-in to this strategy that you don’t see elsewhere,” said Rodney Jones, an economist based in Auckland with Wigram Capital Advisors. “You read the British papers and you see enormous societal isions.”New Zealand had been “able to fashion consensus” about the need for a strict national lockdown, he said. “Australia has, but not to the same degree.”Now, Jones said he understood the anger about new arrivals taking issue with their conditions.“For me that’s people who finally make it to the lifeboat complaining they got wet,” he told TVNZ on Monday. “New Zealand is the lifeboat.”The government is considering making returnees pay for part of their quarantine and Jones said pressure would continue on ministers to do so.“I have seen people saying that people in quarantine should be grateful to be put in these hotels that are paid for by the taxpayers,” Ellen said. “People have said that New Zealanders have made so many sacrifices, they were in lockdown for a month, so we just have to suck it up and deal with it.”She and other returning travelers also made sacrifices during the crisis, she said she had lost her job in London and spent three months in isolation with almost no human contact in order to stay distanced from a housemate who was flouting the rules. New Zealanders have a complicated relationship with the idea of living overseas travel is considered a rite of passage for inhabitants of the small island nation, but there is resentment about it from some, said Sutherland, the psychologist.“I wonder if that’s a little bit of that tall poppy syndrome,” he said, referring to the phenomenon of high achievers being ‘cut down to size.’“You’ve been away and you’ve come back and you think you’re all that, but you’re not, you’re just one of us, so pull your head in a bit.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9bf7196fefbf3747c482735ad07a527f71546dd/0_508_6229_3737/master/6229.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dae940b694c53b770cb430f1ea8c485c","title":"uruguay and paraguay buck latin america coronavirus trend","story":"Despite sharing borders with Brazil, small countries can claim victory against virusLatin America has become the new centre of the worldwide coronavirus pandemic but two small countries, Uruguay and Paraguay, have bucked the regional trend and can claim a near total victory against the virus.There have been just 13 deaths in Paraguay and only 25 in Uruguay so far, despite the porous land borders both countries share with Brazil, where the pandemic has claimed more than 50,000 lives.Free of the endemic corruption and political strife that has plagued most other Latin American nations in recent decades, Uruguay in March switched painlessly from 15 years of centre-left administration to the centre-right administration of its new president, Luis Lacalle Pou, who has maintained the social advances of the previous administration.Uruguay is now gradually reopening its schools and shopping malls, albeit with social distancing, face masks and massive testing.Adapting to reduced physical contact has been no small feat in a country where kisses and warm embraces are the standard mode of greeting, and in which the sharing of the mate gourd, passed around between friends and family who sip the tea-like brew through the same metal straw, is deeply etched into the national psyche.“The key to our success has been a quick response detecting and isolating cases,” Rafael Radi, one of the government’s chief Covid-19 advisers, said.Testing is so aggressive that Uruguay is fourth worldwide after New Zealand, Australia and Thailand in the number of tests conducted per new confirmed case. Uruguay conducts 1,610 tests per new case. By comparison, the US and UK conduct only 52 and 21 tests respectively.With just 882 positive cases since the virus arrived on 13 March, Uruguay’s success has earned it comparisons with New Zealand, without it having the advantage of being an island surrounded by a vast ocean. Uruguay is sandwiched between South America’s two largest nations, Brazil and Argentina, where numbers are soaring.Its “red-hot” northern border with Brazil is a special source of concern. “Brazil is the great sword of Damocles hanging over our heads,” said Radi. The 1,000-kilometre border has towns and cities pitched right on it.“Our greatest concern is the city of Rivera, where the border is only an imaginary line down the middle of an avenue,” said Radi. About 170,000 Uruguayans and Brazilians live in Rivera and its Brazilian twin city Santana do Livramento, crossing the border daily to work, shop and visit family on the other side.Widespread testing in Rivera is not replicated in Livramento. “We had one case of a Uruguayan woman who crossed the avenue to go shopping in Livramento, caught the virus there, then travelled all the way to Montevideo,” said Radi. “We had to do a lot of work to trace all her interactions.”To the west, sandwiched between Brazil, Argentina and Bolivia, is Paraguay – a country where tereré, the ice-cold version of the highly communal mate tea, is ubiquitous – which has achieved a similar success in containing the pandemic. The landlocked country of 7 million has recorded only 1,392 cases and 13 deaths to date.Dr Antonio Arbo, an epidemiologist and former health minister, said the key to Paraguay’s success had been prompt, strict government measures, accompanied by good behaviour from the majority of the population. “Closing the borders, social distancing and an initial lockdown phase were successful when we analyse the data,” he said.The government of president Mario Abdo Benítez was one of the first in the region to implement containment measures after just the second confirmed case of Covid-19 on 10 March. It has now progressed to phase three of a four-stage reopening plan with the economy greatly reactivated.As in Uruguay, preventing the virus crossing from Brazil has been a priority. Paraguay has militarised key sections of its notoriously porous border and provided obligatory quarantine centres for returning Paraguayans. More than half of Paraguay’s Covid-19 cases have been related to citizens returning from Brazil.Despite the enviable results so far, criticism of Abdo Benítez’s administration is strong. A loud public outcry over multiple scandals involving the misuse of some of the funds designated to handle the crisis has led to several high-profile resignations.Numerous irregularities were detected in the procurement of medical supplies and there are insufficient levels of vital items such as testing kits, Arbo said.Dr Carlos Schaerer, a medical association leader, said that, despite the remarkable success achieved by authorities and the population so far, Paraguay has been left in a position of vulnerability.“In circumstances in which unselfishness should come first and corruption should be left to one side, corruption has surged even more strongly,” he said. “If there is an explosion of the disease, we’re going to be helpless because we aren’t prepared.”"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Friends of the Irish Environment challenges Government\u0026rsquos National Mitigation PlanFrench president created convention in April 2019 in response to gilets jaunes revoltMinister for Climate Action and Environment says funds would go to just transition"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4287726.1593031802!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dublin city traffic back to 75 of pre covid levels","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRoad works continue on College Green, Dublin to removed a traffic lane and make cycling and walking in the city safer. Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill Traffic volumes in Dublin city have returned to 75 per cent of their pre-coronavirus levels, according to new figures from Dublin City Council.The number of vehicles travelling in and out of the city at morning and evening peak times began to drop rapidly from the first week in March, hitting a low at the end of the month when strict Covid-19 restrictions on travel were introduced.At that point, when travel was restricted to 2km except for essential reasons and most businesses were closed, traffic volumes fell to just over a third of their normal levels.However, despite no change to the restrictions over the following month, traffic crept back to more than 40 per cent of normal levels at the start of May.Since then, peak-time traffic has risen steadily as travel and business restrictions have eased, with the largest jump seen from the start to the middle of this month when most shops in the city centre reopened.At the end of the first week in June, traffic was at about 60 per cent of its pre-pandemic volumes and by June 21st, it had hit 75 per cent.The rise in traffic has been matched by calls from the public for a reallocation of roadspace to cyclists and pedestrians.Since April the council has been gradually implementing a Covid-19 “mobility intervention programme”.Parking spaces and loading bays have been annexed for pedestrians, and segregated cyclepaths, protected by bollards, have been installed at a number of locations, including the Liffey quays.The council is also phasing traffic out of College Green. In recent weeks flower boxes were installed in front of the Bank of Ireland on the northbound side of the Green to protect cycling facilities from traffic.While, on Wednesday morning the bus-stop lane on the opposite side of the road, from Trinity College to Church Lane, has been reallocated for footpath space. Buses will now stop in what is an existing traffic lane, leaving one lane for traffic.More than 700 requests for “mobility measures” including footpath widening, more space at bus stops, segregated cycling facilities, and contraflow cycle lanes have been made to the council since April.Meanwhile councillors were told on Wednesday it would take 100 years to resurface the city’s roads at the current levels of investment.Government funding for the maintenance of the city’s 1,250km of roads has fallen from €7.65 million in 2011 to €5.78 million this year.Over the same period road construction costs have increased by 50 per cent."},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Another Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creaturesGolden kelp is notably bare of other sea life, so there are concerns over its possible impactLong-term objective is to see how wildflowers are responding to changes in weather patterns and climateTime to restore meadows once full of insects and nectar in summer and spires of seeds in winter"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

File photograph: EPADaniel PockettThe number of Covid-19 clusters in private houses has reached 500, surging by 110 clusters - a 28 per cent increase - in a single day, new official figures on the disease show.A cluster is defined as two or more people being infected with the disease in one location.While the number of clusters in congregated settings such as nursing homes has remained steady with many outbreaks being closed after two 14-day Covid-19 incubation periods passing without a single new case being recorded, the rate of increases in private households has surged.The biggest increase in the number of clusters in private houses came in the east of the country where, on Monday alone, the number of private house clusters being reported that day almost doubled to 182 from 97. The number in the south of the country rose from 59 to 83 in a day, according to the latest HPSC data on Covid-19.The number of clusters in private houses has more than doubled in just 11 days, rising from 240 on June 11th with the greater increase being recorded over last weekend.A cluster is defined as two or more people being infected with the disease in one location.The number of clusters in private houses stands at almost double the next highest location for clusters: nursing homes where there have been 257 clusters of Covid-19 infection.Private houses surpassed nursing homes as the location with the most outbreaks on June 12th.As of last week, some 190 nursing homes clusters had been closed.There have been 1,726 coronavirus-related deaths and 25,396 known cases of the disease in the State. The number of deaths and new cases reported every day has fallen significantly this month.However, HSE chief clinical officer Dr Colm Henry said at a briefing on Wednesday that the increase in the number of household coronavirus clusters was ”a worry”.He said that even though the rate of transmission of the virus was low in the community, there were still outbreaks of the virus and it can cause harm particularly to vulnerable people.Dr Henry urged people to continue to follow public health guidance on social distancing and the need to avoid congregated settings as the country reopens from lockdown restrictions.“My biggest worry is if people equate the easing of social restrictions to the easing of all restrictions,” he said at the HSE’s weekly media briefing.He echoed remarks by World Health Organisation director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus who this week urged all countries to “double down on the fundamental public health measures” that work to prevent the spread of the virus.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4288190.1593068488!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"face masks should be mandatory in irish shops says immunologist","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA staff member wearing a protective face mask in a shoe shop in Belfast.

Photograph: Alan BetsonAn infectious diseases specialist will on Thursday warn the Oireachtas about a second wave of Covid-19 and call on the Government for greater healthcare investment over the coming weeks “to rapidly upscale in emergency department capacity and isolation room facilities in hospitals.”Professor Paddy Mallon, an infectious diseases consultant at St Vincent’s and UCD, will tell the Covid-19 special committee that a highly effective programme of rapid testing, contact tracing and community actions must become a priority “in maintaining our national biosecurity.”The medic will tell TDs that as society reopens, the public is handing back some responsibility for controlling the virus to the State and if the programme of testing and tracing “fails to work effectively, we risk losing the gains provided to us through the sacrifices of the Irish people.”“We are still in the midst of a national public health emergency and our citizens are at no less risk of severe illness and death if they contract Covid-19 infection now than they were back in March,” Prof Mallon will tell the Oireachtas committee.He will tell say that there is “a very narrow window of opportunity” to learn from the lessons of the first wave and that this time must be used “wisely to improve our infrastructure.”“Failure to learn, or delays in planning and resourcing for what is ahead, would not only be potentially negligent but would be a travesty to the memories of those who have died from Covid-19, some avoidably, during the first wave,” Prof Mallon will say in his opening statement.Medical specialistsHe will call for networks of medical specialists to be established operating regionally under a common governance structure to enable “scalable, rapid regional responses to both current and future threats as they arise and evolve” and the rapid implementation of national guidelines.The HSE’s chief clinical officer Dr Colm Henry will tell the committee that a critical project for a new model of contact tracing and testing that will operate for the next 18 months and beyond will run over the summer months with a target implementation date in late August.It will be “flexible for any potential surges” of the diseases that may come, he will say.School closures will have a “real risk of regression” for many vulnerable children with complex needs, the Department of Education has warned.At a meeting of the Covid-19 special committee on Thursday, a senior department official will say that the loss of the regular school routine, social interaction with friends, access to teachers and vital supports are presenting risk of harming the learning, the social and emotional development, and wellbeing of these children.There are about 14,000 children attending special schools or special classes with special or complex needs.Inclusion Ireland, the support group for children with disabilities, said its survey of members found that most parents are struggling to educate and support their vulnerable children at home.It says support from schools has been variable, from “excellent to almost non-existent”, while plans for a summer catch-up programme continues to exclude some cohorts of children with disabilities and has been characterised by “poor planning leaving schools and families frustrated and in the dark”.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4288338.1593083447!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"q a everything you need to know about mandatory face masks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPeople at a bus stop wearing face masks waiting for bus at Dame Street in Dublin. File photograph: Leah FarrellRollingNews.ieFace masks are to become mandatory on public transport as the Government moves to increase capacity on bus, train and Luas services as more people return to work. Here, we run through everything you need to know about wearing face coverings and the new rule.What do they do and why are they a good idea?First of all, it’s important to note that wearing face masks does not offer you complete protection against Covid-19 and should not be treated as a substitute for all the other precautions people are supposed to be taking, such as regular hand-washing and social distancing.Their main function is to help stop you spreading the virus to another person if you are carrying it without your knowledge and moving around in the community.The virus is spread through cough or sneeze droplets so by covering your mouth and nose you reduce the odds of spreading the virus.Why is this being made mandatory all of a sudden?The Government has insisted masks will become more important as coronavirus restrictions are lifted. The two-metre social distancing rule for public transport operators will soon cease to apply and, instead, operators will be allowed to run at 50 per cent capacity.This means there will be more people using buses, trains and trams and so the risk of spreading the virus is greater.Fair enough. When does this new measure come into effect?The issue was discussed at a Cabinet sub-committee meeting on Wednesday and it is expected the mandatory mask rule will take effect in the next week or two.Okay, where can I get one then?Masks can be picked up in any pharmacy, or you can also order them online.How much do they cost?You can buy disposable masks for less than a euro, or you can buy reusable masks, made of cloth, for less than €5.Alternatively, if you want to go upmarket with a designer face mask, various companies offer masks with different designs and creations. Prices vary but you can pick up a pack of three for about €20 in Boots.Seems reasonable enough. So how do you wear them?Firstly, avoid touching the mask itself and use the loops to fit it. Make sure it covers the nose and goes under the chin. It should also fit snugly but comfortably against the side of the face and be secured with ties or ear loops. Avoid touching the mask while using it and, if you do, wash your hands.How do you take them on and off safely?You should clean your hands with soap and water beforehand. Then, take it off using the elastic tags without touching the front.Will I need a new mask every day?The disposable masks are designed for single use and should be disposed of afterwards in a bin. The reusable masks can be used about 50 times but should be washed after each use. The advice is to put reusable masks straight into the washing machine after use.Is there any advice on how to wash them?Yes. They need a hot wash over 60 degrees with detergent. If using a washing machine, you should be able to wash and machine dry it without damage or change to the shape. You do not need to sterilise it. You can also wash it by hand.Seems straightforward enough. When will I know to throw it out?You should throw out a cloth face covering when it no longer covers the nose and mouth has stretched out or damaged ties or straps cannot stay on the face or has holes or tears in the fabric.Are there any exceptions to wearing them?Cloth face coverings are not suitable for children under the age of 13 and anyone who has trouble breathing is unconscious or incapacitated is unable to remove it without help has special needs and who may feel upset or very uncomfortable wearing it. Health authorities have instructed people not to stigmatise those who are observed without them.Where exactly will this be applicable?The rule will apply to all public transport, so that’s the rail network including the Dart and intercity services, as well as all public bus services, including Dublin Bus, and the Luas. We will have to wait and see whether the Government decides to apply the rule to private bus operators and taxis.How will this be policed?The truth is we don’t really know yet. Dermot O’Leary, the general secretary of the National Bus and Railworkers Union, has said this will be a difficult issue, but that it should not be a job a bus driver or frontline worker on the rail network should have to deal with.“The last thing we want is conflict between drivers and passengers or between passengers,” he said, adding there is a role for the gardaí, the transport companies and the National Transport Authority. However, the gardaí have said they do not comment on proposed regulations so we will have to wait until all this is formalised before we know more."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Woman saw Vincent Moran staring back at her after she tried to plug hole in cubicle wallPrivate house clusters rising rapidly as restrictions easedTen Senators took case over whether House is properly constituted without 11 taoiseach\u0026rsquos nomineesCapacity to deal with resurgence depends on ability to test and trace quickly, Paddy Mallon saysTeen had burning sensation in mouth for two weeks after Trabolgan incident, court toldDramatic fall in temperatures from Friday as unsettled weather sets inMan attempted to assault garda\u0026iacute after he was approached following incidentHealth workers applaud LE Eithne as it returns to Naval Service\u0027s headquartersDUP MP questions Boris Johnson\u0026rsquos plans after producing letter about preparations\u0026lsquoPent-up demand\u0026rsquo for cancer services when they resume, says John CrownGarda had to come off operational duties and self-isolate for 14 days after spitting incidentUnions concerned about capacity and enforcement on public transportInfectious diseases expert will emphasise rapid testing and contact tracingNobel laureate Campbell\u0026rsquos memoir captures the essence of scientific endeavourWork to take traffic lanes out of College Green beginsDaniel Kinahan\u0026rsquos foray into pro boxing has \u0026lsquored-flagged\u0026rsquo him internationallyPaschal Donohoe is thought to have wide support as a candidate among membersGovernment to open \u0026lsquoair bridges\u0026rsquo allowing Irish tourists to go on holidays to certain destinationsParty says internal inquiry underway after Cork councillor made comments in messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4288352.1593086576!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus second wave inevitable as travel and flu to be big stress tests for ireland","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tProf Paddy Mallon speaking to the Covid-19 committe on Thursday. Photograph: Oireachtas TV screenshot It is “inevitable” that Ireland will experience a resurgence in coronavirus cases as restrictions are relaxed, the Covid-19 committee has been told. Expert in infectious diseases Prof Paddy Mallon told the committee on Thursday that the country is still within a geographical high-risk zone for coronavirus. “I and others in the infectious diseases clinical community believe that it is inevitable that we will experience a resurgence of cases as we relax restrictions and permit more travel.”A resurgence in coronavirus cases could emerge very quickly and the capacity to deal with it and avoid severe restrictions depends on the ability to test and trace contacts quickly, he told the committee.Prof Mallon warned that the likelihood of lockdown restrictions depended on two stress tests.“The first stress test for Ireland’s capacity to deal with a resurgence in Covid-19 cases will be in August when people decide if they’re going to travel overseas or not because we will inevitably have imported cases coming back into the country.“The second big stress tests is the onset of seasonal influenza because you will get a large number of people with symptoms consistent with Covid-19, seeking tests at one time.”The professor of microbial diseases at University College Dublin said a resurgence could emerge very quickly like what happened in Victoria, Australia where one million people are in “almost” stay at home restriction.The Australians were scrambling to upscale their testing capacity and Prof Mallon said “we cannot got rid of all our testing capacity and expect to switch it on overnight”.In a committee session dealing with testing and tracing,Prof Mallon told Fianna Fáil health spokesman Stephen Donnelly: “If you get a large number of people returning to the country from overseas and you’ve a wide geographical spread of community transmission and you can’t test and contact trace efficiently the only way that you’re going to control that is by returning to mass lockdown.” HSE clinical officer Dr Colm Henry said the number of testing centres had gone from 48 to two with the number of tests gone from 100,000 to 18,000 a week because of the low community transmission.Questioned by Fine Gael TD Colm Burke, Dr Henry said they should be able to ramp up testing at “extremely short notice”. He told Sinn Féin health spokeswoman Louise O’Reilly he was confident of hitting the target of 72 hours.HSE national lead for contact tracing and testing Niamh O’Beirne said services would be upscaled “if we have three consecutive days of 100 tests”. But Prof Mallon said the turnaround time should be one day for testing. The importance of containing infections at borders becomes higher as the level of transmission drops off.He warned that “if you want to maintain community transmission at minimum it’s important to have a robust screening methods at the point of entry”.He said that a different response to someone coming from New Zealand compared to Texas “might be a pragmatic approach. Focus your testing where you’ll get the most return for your time and expense.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4287705.1593031228!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"donohoe expected to bid for presidency of eurogroup","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Finance Paschal Donohoe:  the deadline for candidacies is on Thursday. Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsMinister for Finance Paschal Donohoe is expected to put himself forward as a candidate for the presidency of the Eurogroup, the influential club of finance ministers of countries that use the euro.The Minister will be forced to show his hand because the deadline for candidacies is on Thursday, which makes for awkward timing because parties do not conclude voting on the programme for government until Friday.“It’s tricky for him. It’s a gamble,” said one EU official. “But if he runs, he would be a serious candidate.”Mr Donohoe is thought to have wide support as a potential compromise candidate among Eurogroup members, as Ireland is viewed as a middle-ground country that straddles Europe’s north-south isions on economic matters.The job involves forging consensus in the informal but powerful group and would come at a crucial time ahead of an expected downturn across the EU.Coalition formationThe campaign by Spain’s deputy prime minister for the economy, Nadia Calviño, has already kicked off, and Mr Donohoe’s supporters in Europe have been forced to grapple with the complexities of Irish coalition formation in recent days in an attempt to understand whether his candidacy is certain.Luxembourg’s finance minister, Pierre Gramegna, has also been named as a potential contender for the job.Leaders Micheál Martin, Leo Varadkar and Eamon Ryan will meet on Thursday to discuss the allocation of ministerial portfolios.If Mr Donohoe applies for the Eurogroup position, it will be taken as an indication that he is confident he will stay in the Department of Finance.Such a scenario would likely see Fianna Fáil’s Michael McGrath become minister for public expenditure and reform, with Mr Donohoe and Mr McGrath swapping roles when Mr Varadkar takes over as taoiseach from Mr Martin in 2022.Voting is due to take place on July 9th, by which time Mr Donohoe’s position as finance minister will need to be clear, for him to have a chance of success.The best news and analysis from the campaign

candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus. A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates. All but one – Sanders – said they were opposed to this.

Even though the number of flights and demand is low, they are regarded as special cases.It is understood that countries in a third wave, such as Vietnam, Singapore and Hong Kong, have been told it is unlikely that air bridges will be established before late summer.The USA, where Donald Trump has closed the borders, is unlikely to be opened until after November, although that will depend on whether states can reduce their coronavirus rates.New Zealand is planning to keep its borders closed with a 14-day quarantine until March because of fears of a second winter wave of coronavirus. That may change if a vaccine is developed and proves effective by then.The UK bridges policy is expected to be finalised at a Covid-19 strategy meeting on Thursday with Boris Johnson, the Prime Minister, Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office Minister, Grant Shapps, the Transport Secretary, Dominic Raab, the Foreign Secretary, and Priti Patel, the Home Secretary.Mr Shapps is understood to have been pressing for a more ambitious, bigger opening of travel corridors in the initial phase, describing them on Wednesday as a massive priority to reinvigorate the aviation industry, help rebuild the economy and enable Britons to enjoy overseas summer sun.Foreign holiday bookings have risen by 52 per cent in two weeks, according to travelsupermarket. Seven of the 10 top destinations are in Spain.The criteria for deciding which countries, to be published on Monday, is focused on the virus infection rate, whether it is rising or falling and whether the prospective destination has a test and trace system to limit any outbreaks and social distancing rules as strict as the UK\u0027s.It will be set against their popularity as destinations for Britons and the economic case, which could mean dozens of countries in the first two waves.Mr Shapps told MPs on Wednesday: You can see there are a lot  of complexities. I don\u0027t want to be evasive but I don\u0027t also want to give people false hope, which is why I need to wait until the end of the process and wait until June 29.The European Commission has warned that it would be discriminatory to allow travel corridors between some but not all EU countries with similar low-risk coronavirus profiles. Backbenchers are making similar pleas. Henry Smith, the chairman of the cross-party Future of Aviation group, said: I would like to see air corridors across the whole of the EU and Schengen area.The Department for Transport, however, argues that there is no legal impediment to bilateral deals. We would regard that as their problem. I don\u0027t think you can imagine Brussels trying to tell the Spanish: \u0027You can\u0027t take Britons, said a minister.The moves came as the airport ground handling company Swissport announced plans to cut more than 4,500 jobs. The Airport Operators\u0027 Association warned in a report on Wednesday of 20,000 job losses at airports and a further 100,000 in associated businesses.The International Air Transport Association (IATA), on Wednesday joined BA\u0027s parent company, Ryanair and Easyjet in a legal challenge to ditch quarantine because of the economic damage.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"patriotic duty go pub save one britains last great institutions","story":"An Englishman, an Irishman and a Scotsman walk into a pub. Oh, those were the days!For a nation of boozers, the opening of the pubs next month brings glad tidings, and a dystopian “new normal”. Patrons could soon be queuing, supermarket-style, outside, before listing their personal details on arrival (for contact-tracing purposes), navigating one-way systems and dodging hazmat-suited barmaids. They may order their G\u0026ampTs through apps, and sit inside perspex booths to drink them. Outside, social distancing Stasi could patrol the beer gardens for signs of non-compliance.Sounds terrible, doesn’t it? And yet, I miss the pub so much, I don’t even care. When they are finally liberated, I’m half-tempted to pack a deckchair and thermos, and queue up overnight, swathed in a Union Jack, like those starry-eyed monarchists at the Lindo Wing whenever a new royal baby arrives.The PM insists supporting pubs is a “patriotic duty”, and so it is – not because this timid Government says so, but because, through no fault of its own, a great British institution is in mortal peril. Pandemic, lockdown and excessive caution have conspired to create a situation so dire that we should assume many of our favourite watering holes will never resurface from this economic maelstrom, and spend as if their – and our – lives depended on it.Britain is home to a dizzying array of pubs, a rich ecosystem in which all have their place. There’s the old-fashioned sort, where scotch eggs and pickled onions mingle with a selection of real ales as long as the wine list at the Ritz. There’s the splendour of an oak-timbered gastropub, or the spartan charm of a cheap-and-cheerful joint offering £3 pints and nothing to eat but a few salted peanuts, with a dartboard and an invariably rude landlord who will, nevertheless, sanction a bit of indoor smoking after dark.The country pub is a separate but equally vital institution. Betjeman unkindly described the “village bores more sure to roam  To village pubs than stay at home”. But we bores must go somewhere and certainly, my parents’ local, the Cottage Tavern in Ashorne, has bolstered morale with takeaways and Sunday roasts, and helped coordinate a tight-knit hub of local volunteers.The truly “faultless” pub remains as elusive as George Orwell’s fictional inn the Moon Under Water, yet many treasure a pantheon of near-perfect pubs (for me this includes the Sloop Inn at Bantham, The Union Tavern in Westbourne Park, London, and The Trout Inn, at Godstow, just outside Oxford, with its peacocks and aura of danger from the thundering weir).Public houses have always fulfilled mankind’s need for sanctuary and belonging – not for nothing does the satanic monster Grendel target the mead-hall in Beowulf. They are secular churches, binding communities together. Along with the Army and the monarchy, the pub is one of our last great institutions at a time of overwhelming systemic failure. Allowing pubs to fold through Covid-based nanny statism and neglect would deprive our descendants of their rightful inheritance.The “new normal” may be sterile and unappealing, but we must sustain the great British pub until we can provide the rapturous homecoming it deserves. Hazmat suits be damned, we\u0027ll meet again.  More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"devolution creating perplexing divides pandemic","story":"One of the many oddities of pandemic politics is how Boris Johnson has faced hostile questioning from MPs from Scotland and Wales even though these matters are devolved. Ian Blackford has taken it upon himself to demand action from the Prime Minister when the policy in Scotland is decided by Nicola Sturgeon and the administration at Holyrood. What happens in England is not a matter for the Westminster leader of the SNP. Indeed, he is not accountable for what happens north of the Border, either.The constituent parts of the UK have gone their own way, albeit more in timing than in substance. Ms Sturgeon has insisted upon maintaining a two metre rule in Scotland and has not yet followed England in modifying it to “one metre plus if circumstances allow” but will soon. In Wales, there is still a restriction on driving more than five miles from home which will need to end soon if the Principality is to benefit from “staycation” tourism this summer. It is expected to be lifted on July 6.Given the fact that the leaders of the four nations have access to the same scientific advice, these differences are perplexing though may be deliberate in order to make a point, which is not something their voters will appreciate. Indeed, in Scotland a public backlash has led the government to promise the return of all schools in August, when the term normally starts, without any social distancing among pupils.In England Mr Johnson has said all schools will return in September but this will only be possible with no social distancing. As we report today the Government is drawing up plans to match Scotland with “bubbles” of 30 children per class.

Luis Araujo, chief executive of Visit Portugal, this week told the  that he was optimistic the UK would be “fully confident” for Britons to return. “We are very excited to be welcoming them back,” he said. Portugal welcomed 2.5million visitors from the UK last year. However, according to sources, the country’s recent spike in coronavirus cases has meant Portugal will have to wait before enjoying friction-less travel with the UK. Turkey, Croatia and the US are three other popular destinations not to be included in the first tranche of deals.France, Spain and Italy, however, will be included in the first deals, allowing the return of travellers for the first time since March. Follow the latest news belowWhile no-one is suggesting that the Covid-19 crisis is over, the conversation in Europe has at least moved on to how life may be once the virus has receded. Travel has reemerged as a genuine possibility rather than a vague theory, with Spain reopening its borders last weekend, and Malta announcing that it will do the same thing from July 1.So spare a thought for South America, where travellers on the road back to some sort of normality have further to go. This week, Colombia has announced that it is taking the chains off its borders. However, the key will not turn fully in the lock until September 1. Read the full story.A mural in BogotaThere is no chance of travel restrictions in Ireland lifting ahead of schedule, with the middle of July the most likely date.This is according to a report in the , which quotes a government source as saying that despite the talk of ‘air bridges’ Ireland plans to remain in lockdown in terms of international movement. “The mood music has definitely changed and air bridges are being looked at in a very meaningful way but there is still no chance restrictions will be lifted on July 1,” the source said. “We realise we are behind the European Union but it still won’t happen quickly.”The country is set to move into a new phase of lockdown on Monday, with bars and restaurants able to reopen and travel restrictions within Ireland lifted. When it comes to air bridges, Spain, Italy, Greece and France have got the all-clear. But what about Portugal? Oliver Smith writes:Perhaps the most surprising omission is Portugal. The country is Britain’s oldest ally (634 years and counting) and is heavily reliant on free spending UK sunseekers. Around 2.5m of us visit each year, with the Algarve being the big draw, and back in February the country even suggested it would subsidise UK holidaymakers after Brexit to make sure they keep coming. Furthermore, it has been widely praised for its handling of coronavirus. Just over 150 deaths per million residents have been recorded in Portugal, putting it well ahead of Spain (606), Italy (573) and, indeed, the UK (647). Should its exclusion be confirmed, it would appear to have been punished for a recent spike in cases. The capital, Lisbon, and its surrounding metropolitan area, woke up on Tuesday to increased restrictions and more power for police to enforce them following a series of illegal parties, some attended by as many as 1,000 revellers. Its links with Brazil, where deaths are still spiralling, could also be a factor. Telegraph Travel has run through eight unanswered questions lingering ahead of the UK Government\u0027s likely announcement on air bridges this weekend.Does this mean I can book my holiday now? Well, not exactly. The Foreign Office still warns against all but essential travel (something which is “under constant review”), and the above lists have been revealed to the  via a Government source, not yet formally announced. The announcement is expected on or before June 29, and holidays to those destinations are expected to resume on July 4.However, given the numerous about-turns performed by the Government during the Covid-19 crisis, it would not be beyond the realms of possibility to learn that one of the countries in the aforementioned ‘Phase One’ list of air bridges is omitted. Italy’s Foreign Minister, Luigi di Maio, has previously said bilateral agreements on tourist flows are against the EU’s spirit”, for example. The pandemic is ever-changing and it would not be unimaginable to learn Italy, or indeed any of the countries mentioned, had stepped away from UK air bridge negotiations. Sudden spikes of Covid-19 cases are also of course an enduring possibility.It is also possible that the date when holidays officially resume is not July 4 but rather a date slightly further in the future – the following week, perhaps.Read the full story.  Visitors to Toshimaen amusement park in Tokyo are enjoying hydrangeas in bloom as rainy season arrives in Japan.

On Corfu, there are mixed feelings. “Is the reward worth the risk?,” says UK events organiser Christopher Gardner, living in the south of Corfu. “I’ve already lost a friend in the UK aged 42, so even if I’m going to lose out this summer, I just don’t think we should open to tourists.”For some of the island’s residents, the threat of an outbreak and the loss of lives is a much greater risk than the loss of a summer season. “I’m scared of the foreigners now. Before I would try and speak to them in the street, now I don’t even go near Greeks that have arrived from Athens,” says 85-year-old pensioner, Anastasia Kabbadias. Corfu hospital has just five ICU beds.

Conversely, the comparison website said, searches for the US are down 22 per cent. Tenerife, Corfu and Rhodes have also seen rises in interest. Emma Coulthurst from TravelSupermarket said that there had also been large growth in searches for UK holidays after the Government announced the reopening of the tourism industry from July 4. Searches for UK cottages are up 141 per cent this week compared to last. Car hire bookings are up 41 per cent.With all the talk of the air bridge deals that might be in place next week, it is worth noting that planes are already returning to European skies.

Pools and spas will not be open until at least July 28, the company said.Only cashless payments will be accepted across the villages and all activities must be booked online. A new takeaway service will be in place for lodges. Center Parcs’ CEO, Martin Dalby, said: “We’ve had our teams working around the clock to review everything we do, right down to the smallest detail, and we‘re now ready to open our doors again.“Those families who have visited us before will notice some changes to the way we’re doing things, but the essence of a Center Parcs break will remain the same, offering a fantastic short break experience with plenty of space within our 400 acres of natural woodland.”Greece wants British holidaymakers to return on July 1, the country’s tourism minister has said. Haris Theoharis said that a decision between the UK and Greece will “be in place in the next few days” and that there should be no need for visitors returning to Britain from Greece to quarantine. Greece is one of the countries included in the initial tranche of air bridge deals reported by the  today. Theoharis told Radio 4: “The point is that Greece is a safe country - we have proven that during this crisis and we will continue proving this in the exit stages of the health situation. We feel that the risk of someone contracting the disease in Greece is much lower than most of the countries in Europe and indeed the rest of the world.Bookings for UK holidays have soared since Boris Johnson announced an easing of the lockdown from July 4. Here is everything you need to know about your \u0027staycation\u0027 this summer - and what is left to find out.St Ives is set to be popular this summerAustralian airline Qantas is to cut at least 6,000 jobs and keep 15,000 more workers on furlough as it struggles to survive the coronavirus pandemic. The carrier said it also plans to ground 100 planes for more than a year and will retire its last six Boeing 747 aircraft. Qantas is a popular choice for Britons travelling to Australia, especially since the launch of the first non-stop, direct route between London and Perth in 2018.Chief Executive Alan Joyce said the airline has to become smaller as it braces for several years of much lower revenues. He said the furloughed workers faced a long interruption to their airline careers.The actions that we\u0027re taking will have a huge impact on thousands of our people. This is something that weighs very heavily on all of us, Joyce told reporters. This is something that we don\u0027t make a decision on very easily. But the collapse of billions of dollars in revenue leaves us with little choice if we are to save as many jobs as possible longer term.Joyce said the airline entered the crisis in a better position than most airlines and remained optimistic about the future.Guests staying at Premier Inn this summer will be kept apart by floor markings in the communal areas of the hotel, while staff will be behind acrylic screens at check-in and wear additional PPE “where appropriate”. New no-touch key return boxes and automated hand sanitisers are among changes to be introduced by the hotel chain as it prepares to reopen on July 4. Premier Inns are, of course, not the only hotels due to open next weekend.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Dizzee Rascal has been praised for refusing to answer Piers Morgan’s question about Black Lives Matter during an appearance on Good Morning Britain.The rapper was invited to talk to Morgan and Susanna Reid about the introduction of drive-in raves, which are said to be temporarily replacing crowd-filled live concerts following the Covid-19 pandemic.Morgan though, soon steered the conversation away from this subject and asked for Dizzee’s views on “what Black Lives matter actually means”.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesDizzee refused to comment on the situation, asking Morgan: “What makes you think I know? Am I the black spokesperson?”He then told Morgan that, while he has “a bunch of views” to share, he felt that “now is not the time” to speak about them.Meet Che Lingo, the London rapper confronting police brutalityHow the art world can step up for Black Lives Matter“I’ve brought my afro out, I’m looking a bit natural and so maybe that’s why you’re asking the question, but not today,” he said. Morgan defended himself by saying: “That’s not why I’m asking you the question. You’re a high-profile black man in this country, and it’s been a huge issue and has been a huge news story for four weeks.”Dizzee, attempting to get a word in, replied: “You know what, I watch you on telly and you never let no one speak. You’re not going to do this to me, mate. Let’s keep it calm.”After Morgan called his response “aggressive”, Dizzee – laughing – replied: “This is what happens – I become the aggressive black man! I just wanted to be nice, and look how he’s behaving.”Viewers praised the rapper for “totally owning” Morgan.“Dizzee Rascal has made everyone’s morning,” one tweeter wrote, adding: ”I love watching Piers Morgan squirm for once. Totally owned haha.”Another added: “I’m so happy the way Dizzee Rascal called out Piers Morgan for asking him about BLM on GMB – why does every white host ask every black person about BLM, but not white people?!”“Dizzee Rascal what a bloke,” one person concluded. “Sticking Piers Morgan in his place whilst fishing to stir up more issues when he’s got positive things to talk about.”The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Over the years, it has been criticised for presenting the Antebellum South and its history of slavery through rose-tinted glasses.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAfter being taken down by HBO Max, Gone with the Wind has now returned to the site, along with two videos discussing its historical context.One clip features TV host and film scholar Jacqueline Stewart, who says that while the movie was “one of most enduringly popular films of all time”, its depiction of African American people was controversial even when it was released 80 years ago.Why has Gone with the Wind been accused of racism?“Producer David O Selznick was well aware that black audiences were deeply concerned about the film’s handling of the topic of slavery and its treatment of black characters,” she said.She added that the film’s treatment of the Antebellum South as a “world of grace and beauty… through a lens of nostalgia denies the horrors of slavery, as well as its legacies of racial inequality”.The second video features a panel debating Gone with the Wind’s “complicated legacy”.Hattie McDaniel, who played house servant Mammy in the film, became the first African American to win an Oscar when she was awarded the accolade for Best Supporting Actress.However, due to racial segregation, she was not allowed to sit with the other cast members at the ceremony dinner.Gone with the Wind\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Acts including Static-X, Dope, Bobaflex and Royal Bliss are set to feature.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesOn Twitter, the band wrote: “Nonpoint is not playing the show because of the name of the show.”Since then, the festival’s organisers have removed the original advertising on Facebook, and posted a message which reads: “For the record the venues land can accommodate up to 10,000 occupancy.

Two of the stores – in Ross-on-Wye and Leominster – reopened on Monday 15 June.“Being able to shop in person, especially at smaller independents, is a joy,” owner Andy Rossiter, pictured above, says. “I think lockdown made a lot of people realise that they don’t want all their shopping to just land at their door, but booksellers also know they need to work hard for their audience. It’s not simply a case of just opening your doors.”Rossiter has been busy preparing the stores, moving fixtures and checkouts so that staff and customers can socially distance while browsing for books.Carry out a risk assessment: employers will need to carry out Covid-19 risk assessments in consultation with their workers or trade unions.Maintain social distancing: employers should redesign workspaces to maintain social distancing between people and stagger start times.Manage transmission risk:\u0026nbspemployers should look into putting barriers in shared spaces, creating workplace shift patterns or fixed teams.Reinforcing cleaning processes: workplaces should be cleaned more frequently, paying close attention to\u0026nbspdoor handles and keyboards.“We have installed Perspex screens at till points, bought hand sanitiser stations for the entrances to our stores and placed tape and signage throughout so we can clearly indicate the social distancing rules within our stores,” he says.The bookshops have reopened with less members of staff and they have limited their opening hours from their pre-lockdown seven days to just five. Rossiter has also been consulting staff and getting their input on the UK Government’s coronavirus advice.“Our trade body, the Booksellers Association, has been brilliant at reading and interpreting this advice to make it bookshop-specific and releasing it in digestible and accessible weekly bulletins, he says.“Booksellers love serving customers, and we’ve been serving our local community for a decade, so seeing those regulars again and having that relationship start to return to normal will be fantastic.Surinder Josan, owner of All Seasons DIY, a family-run shop, explains how he has used strict safe workplace measures to keep his shop doors open and his businesses afloat.“All Seasons DIY is a family-run shop which was established over 40 years ago, run by myself, my wife, and my mother. My son and daughter work in the shop around their university studies as well,” Josan, below, says.The family decided to shut the shop when school closures were announced. But after just a week they decided to reopen the business in order to serve the local community, who relied on the store for essential food and other items.“In order to reopen, we had to reassess how we both serve and interact with our customers,” Josan explains. “We adopted several new measures to comply with social distancing to keep both ourselves and our customers safe.”These new measures they adopted included safe distance markers outside the shop, to limit the number of people in store at any one time, installing screens at the checkout areas, encouraging contactless payments, lowering the minimum card spend to £1, and offering hand wipes to customers.“The number of customers who have come in and complimented us for it is unbelievable. They say when they come here they feel really safe,” Josan adds.Blend Coffee Co is an independent coffee shop based in Portslade, East Sussex, near Brighton. The two directors behind the business, Oli Crawley and Tom Jennion, have introduced a range of measures so they could confidently reopen for staff and customers.“Our primary concern is to keep people safe, so to make sure our coffee shop was ready to be reopened we implemented a number of safer working measures,” says Crawley.These new measures included a deep clean of the shop prior to reopening, implementation of a new ordering layout and adopting a new policy which stipulates that no customers are allowed inside the store.Working alongside Crawley and Jennion are a further three members of staff.“Only the directors returned to work to alleviate any pressure on our barista team feeling they need to work,” says Crawley. “This also allows an operational analysis of all our new protocols to ensure they are efficient and safe.”The checkout system has now been moved to the front of the shop, Blend now only accepts card payments and there is a new waiting area outside the shop.This plan was developed after we undertook a risk assessment and analysis of the premises to ensure that customer-staff interaction could be maintained and sustained in a safe manner. We ran a test prior to reopening to ensure that our new measures would work and allow us and our customers to stay safe,” adds Crawley.For further information from the UK Government on how employers, employees and the self-employed can return to work safely, click hereThis is Government advice for EnglandWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Unfortunately, not long after her return, jobs began to get cancelled because of the intensifying Covid-19 crisis.She started looking for something else right away – and is currently living and working on New Moor Farm in Southminster, Essex, working with asparagus, having swapped fashion for food.Though a far cry from a usual career, Philip is enjoying her new setting. “Right now, I live on site on the farm, in one of the caravans in the orchard. It’s nice,” she explains. “The community is amazing. There are so many different characters on the farm. Everyone is really friendly and we’re all here for the same reasons: to help and to work.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHer day-to-day routine varies. “Most days I’m up at five, start working at six on the farm, in the packhouse,” she says. “Generally, I’m doing a little bit of everything, so I’m helping on the line, bundling, helping customers, grading – just helping out wherever I can.”Philip is among Brits across the country working on farms in order to help the industry continue despite the many obstacles presented by the Covid-19 pandemic.The temporary closure of much of the food and hospitality industry has left huge quantities of fresh produce at risk of going to waste. The pubs and restaurants that would usually purchase large amounts of vegetables remain shut and travel restrictions have prevented pickers from overseas working on the farms.Join the Pick For BritainThat’s why the Government is urging fit and healthy people looking for work across the country to get involved. The Pick For Britain initiative is helping to bring workers and employers together to ensure the farming industry can continue.From furloughed employees whose contracts allow them to work during this time, to university students on their summer breaks, it’s a great opportunity to earn money and meet new people – while helping Britain’s food industry during these unprecedented times.The growing season is only just getting started, so from now until September, bringing in the harvest requires a major effort.

Nine in ten businesses are waiting to be paid an average of £148,917. Some 81 per cent of firms are also expecting to be made to wait longer to be paid for work done from now on, with half expecting to wait anywhere between 14 to 30 days longer than normal, the survey found.Coronavirus loans backed by government and furlough bill exceed £60bnThe businesses joining forces to get a better deal from their landlordGyms furious as rest of England opens upBusinesses breathe sigh of relief as social distancing rule relaxedQueen sends message of support to UK businesses as some reopenFifteen per cent of companies fear they could be waiting anywhere between three to six months longer to be paid for work.More than half of the firms surveyed that applied for the government’s Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS) were declined. The 43 per cent who were successful applied for almost double the amount of a typical loan of £211,667 they would have taken.Anil Stocker, chief executive of Marketfinance, said: “The reopening of the UK’s high streets marked the first buoyant moment for UK businesses in months but it might well be the calm before the storm.“Businesses are facing a three-prong assault on their finances. First up, it’s alarming that only half of their CBILS loans are being granted, then we learn that they close to £150,000 in outstanding payments since the lockdown began, and now it’s likely that they will have to wait twice as long to get paid for new work they do whilst demand and economic activity normalises.“Coupled with a very moderate outlook for trading conditions, ‘rent quarter day’ this week and uncertainty about their workforce no doubt this will put further pressure on businesses.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Our job retention scheme has protected more than nine million jobs across the UK. We have extended it until October – meaning it will have been open for eight months and will continue to support businesses as the economy reopens and people return to work.As well as furloughing staff, we have introduced a wide range of other targeted support measures to support people and protect jobs, including billions paid in loans and grants, tax deferrals, mortgage holidays and more than £6.5 billion injected into the welfare safety net.The Marketfinance report comes amid a slew of warnings from business groups, who are urging the government to extend grant support schemes set up to support businesses during the lockdown.The Confederation of British Industry said on Wednesday that the survival of many firms in the hardest-hit sectors “hangs in the balance”, while the Trades Union Congress has urged chancellor Rishi Sunak to announce spending plans to avoid widespread unemployment.Confederation of British Industry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Viruferrin has been scientifically proven to block 98 per cent of similar viruses to Covid-19, including influenza and Sars.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe snood-like coverings can be worn for up to 50 hours before they need washing, and their effectiveness only drops to 96 per cent after over 200 hours of wear.The face coverings are cut and sewn together by Cookson \u0026amp Clegg in Blackburn, which is run by Patrick Grant, star of the Great British Sewing Bee. He is also behind a campaign to get Britons making their own coverings, The Great Community Sew.How to support our campaignThe coverings, which retail at £20, are different to medical grade PPE used by NHS workers. However, due to the protein coverings they are more effective than standard face masks at protecting wearers from viruses.There was a buzz at the Royal Park Felix Project depot when boxes of Virustatic Shield coverings arrived.David Clark, who has been volunteering for three years, said: “I think it is important to wear these face coverings when you’re delivering to members of the public who potentially come into contact with vulnerable people.”Mr Clark dropped off some coverings to Ian Breen, centre manager at Acton Homeless Concern, which serves hot meals five days a week to those in temporary accommodation or on the streets. Mr Breen said: “It is fantastic to have a delivery of some masks for free. It is important to protect those working here and the people who use our centre.”Gretchen Fisher, from Ealing, who has been volunteering for four years, added: “I wear them whenever I go out as you have to protect others.” Mantas Keblis, the depot manager, said that having “extra precautions” would help food reach more people in London. “Everyone really likes them.

She said: “Soaring numbers of families are being pulled under and having to rely on food banks to get through the current crisis, even with the voucher scheme in place.”The harsh reality is that an astounding 66 per cent of food-insecure families – amounting to almost 200,000 children in London – cannot access government help and are forced to rely on food parcels from charities such as The Felix Project.Food and 10,000 face coverings donated to charities and vulnerableWhich star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day At the start of lockdown, The Felix Project faced an existential crisis with a total collapse of its fundraising. Thanks to The Independent’s campaign, it has not only been able to survive but has operated at twice its normal capacity, delivering up to 40 tons of nutritious produce a day and supplying 86 schools and 400 charities and community hubs across the capital over the course of a week.The Independent shareholder Evgeny Lebedev said: “These generous new donations take us 70 per cent of the way towards our goal to secure £10m to combat food poverty in London over the next three years. Our pledge is given added urgency by the release of worrying economic data, including that the number of people out of work and claiming benefits jumped 23 per cent to 2.8 million last month.”Jo West, of Ocado Retail, said most of its donation had been raised from Ocado and their customers via their “you give, we give” scheme. She added: “We’re extremely grateful to our customers for their generosity which enables groups like The Felix Project to bring food to people in desperate need.” James Murray, chair of the Bridgepoint Charitable Trust, which donated £50,000, said: “We are delighted to contribute to the work of The Felix Project in feeding vulnerable communities.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As the transport secretary has pointed out, we have seen far too many deaths already in the line of duty.Do I need to wear a face covering on public transport?“Yet it now appears that his words are hollow as the Tories are looking to use these heroic workers as nothing more than cannon fodder.“The lives of passengers and our members are being put at risk so that fat cats can accumulate profits.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Here are some of the measures that schools are implementing to make the transition easier for pupils, staff and parentsIn association with the UK GovernmentHinchingbrooke School is an academy school in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, with more than 1,900 pupils and 200 staff. Teachers started welcoming back A-level students last week.“We’ve only had the Year 12s in so far, but for them it was really clear they were delighted to be back,” says Mark Patterson, school principal, pictured above. “You could see it on their faces. It’s getting back to some sense of routine, structure and normality.He continues: “I think a lot of them have been surprised by how much they’ve missed school. I think if you’d asked them before lockdown ‘Would you like a week off?’, they’d have said ‘Please!’. I bet if you asked them now, they’d say ‘Can I come back?’. I think the parents and students now realise how important school is.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesPrior to the return, teachers organised a virtual assembly for Year 10 and 12 pupils, and sent a booklet home detailing the new guidelines which would be in place.5 back-to-school tips for parents\u0026nbsp“Don\u0027t give them a lot of small instructions – recognise your child would have had an enormous amount of\u0026nbspinstructions during the course of the day.”“If you are rewarding your child\u0027s behaviour, it\u0027s very important to do it every time.”“For a child who\u0027s been finding it tough,\u0026nbsptalking to another child who\u0027s been in the same situation is by far the best way of letting it out.”“It\u0027s important to encourage a child to work for themselves and get on with their own inner task.”New measures include red circles marked on the ground that are two metres apart and one-way systems throughout the school.“We’ve reorganised all the classrooms that we’re using so the desks and chairs are two metres apart,” Patterson explains. “We’ve got designated areas set aside at break and lunchtime for each group to go to, and we’ve got signage around the school reminding everybody of the importance of hygiene, frequent hand washing and keeping their distance.”Implementing new measuresRheeya Makwana is one of the Year 12 students who has returned to Hinchingbrooke. “We’ve been having online lessons and voiceover PowerPoints, but it’s not really the same as being in a classroom,” she says. “The structure was really good and I felt like I learned a lot more being back at school. I came home in such a good mood.”Rheeya’s father Yogesh Makwana did have some initial worries about his daughter returning to school: “There’s always some concern, but all the communication from school has been excellent in the build up to it and all the measures that have been put in place have reassured us. If you offered our 13-year-old the chance to go back to school tomorrow, he’d do it in a heartbeat. He misses his classes the social interaction. He loves PE and he does so much at school that he misses.Year 10 pupils Vahine and Lucia will also be returning to the school this week. “The twins are really looking forward to it,” says their mother, Alesia Dickinson. “They’ve been messaging all their friends to find out what group they’re in. Less than a week after we said yes to going back we found out what bubbles they were in and we had clear guidelines about times, rooms and what they can expect when they go back to school. They’re raring to go.”Both Makwana and Dickinson agree that their children have missed the structure of school lessons and that the transition back to the classroom has been easier than expected. “I think it’s a positive thing,” says Dickinson. “I think it’s a step in the right direction. We need to let the children start that process.”Going back to Embark schoolsTrust leader at Embark Matthew Crawford, pictured below, has been welcoming back primary pupils to the Federation’s schools across Derbyshire.“The feedback we have had so far from all the schools across the Trust is that it’s going really well in terms of welcoming the children back,” he says. “It’s not a one-size-fits-all. Each school has done a risk assessment based on what they can do.”Most Embark schools are now back at around 25-30 per cent capacity, Crawford says. It\u0027s up from around two per cent when lockdown began, when it was just key workers’ children and more vulnerable pupils in the classroom.“It’s lovely to hear the children playing and see schools becoming vibrant again,” he adds. “As soon as lockdown began, we started work on our Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme, a nine-stage support package to welcome children back safely.”Keyworker Vicki Ellis has two children who have returned to one of Embark\u0027s schools Richardson Endowed Primary - Amelia in Year 3 and Darcey in Year 1, pictured below.The first day the girls were back I was wondering how they were all day. I knew the school had done everything possible to welcome the children back in a happy, positive way but I worried whether Amelia and Darcey were enjoying themselves. But when they came home they were so happy to have had that day at school – and eager to go back next day. Crawford explains that the school has tried to make the transition back to the classroom as fun as possible for the children: “We’re following the guidelines but in a way that’s fun for the children. We aren’t marking big Xs on the floor. Some of our schools, for example, are painting snakes in bright colours to show the way.”Embark has also shared its programme with schools as far as Devon, Durham, South Gloucestershire and Wales.“It’s a suite of resources and activities that schools can adapt to their own settings, taking the bits that work for them,” explains Crawford. “It’s lovely that the brilliant work of our staff is making a difference and impacting the lives of millions of children across the country, not just the 3,000 within our Trust.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

Some of the animals are reportedly living in an abandoned cinema, while a nearby shop owner has set up stuffed crocodile and tiger toys in a bid to stop them stealing cans of spray-paint from their store.To tackle the growing problem, authorities have positioned large cages with fruit inside them around the city. They hope to catch around 300 monkeys, which will then undergo sterilisation.After they are sedated, they are shaved and given a tattoo with a unique reference number under their arms.The captured macaques will then spend one night recovering from the operation, before they are returned to their respective tribes.In total, the government aims to perform the operation on 500 monkeys over the next two months.Ms Supakarn said the decision to sterilise them did not threaten their population but would allow authorities to reduce its rate of growth. We\u0027re not doing this in the wild, only in the city areas,  she added.Additional reporting from ReutersNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There have been more than 170 new cases of Covid-19 since last week, marking the biggest increase since the virus\u0027s spread was close to being eliminated in April.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

IMeanwhile, the latest growth rate per day is -% to -%.There are lots of infection control measures experts can use to push this number down and reduce the spread.A study in the Lancet in April, for example, estimated that travel restrictions in Wuhan caused R to drop from . to . after just one week. The social distancing measures introduced in the UK have had a substantial impact so far.This is because as less people come into contact with one another, there is a lower chance for the virus to spread.More generally, a vaccination would help reduce the R rate of any given disease as this would mean that one infected person wouldnt be able to infect an inidual who had been given a vaccination.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You can now at last be within ft in of someone outside your immediate household! What’s more, from July , you will be able to eat in restaurants, have a drink and, of course, continue shopping.⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news  updatesWhat you won’t be able to do, unless you are very fortunate, is to get your children into school, which says something about our national priorities. Make no mistake about it, this is a “national emergency”. Education should have the upfront priority that we rightly give the NHS and saving our economy. The failure since the beginning of March to plan ahead for getting all schools and all youngsters back into the classroom has been reprehensible.I say all schools because the majority have been open for the children of key workers and for children designated as vulnerable.Many teachers have been doing a first-class job trying to keep in touch with children at home, providing them with online tuition, homework and marking. But there is still time to mobilise all the necessary resources to make it possible to get children back to school for at least a couple of weeks before the end of this term.Yes, it would involve finding extra premises for schools with inadequate space. Yes, we would have to appeal to teachers who have recently retired to come back for perhaps a few hours a week. Yes, we would need to employ supply teachers.In addition we could use university students, who won’t be finding summer jobs any time soon, to assist.Of course, we don’t have that reliable summer weather that will allow teaching outside on a regular basis, butDenmark can place many lessons in an outside setting, we can.If the French, Lord help us, can get their schools mobilised and back to full operation, we can. Their trade unions are far more bolshy than ours, and teachers regrettably much less well paid.So we need a combination of creativity, imagination and drive to get pupils back. We need to rebuild the confidence of parents and staff that they are highly unlikely to contract the virus from the children, or of the children passing it on to each other.That way, we can have ironed out the glitches and be ready in September to be absolutely on the ball. Small group tutoring for recovery programmes, mentoring not just organised centrally, but co-ordinated locally.For anyone who doesn’t believe that two or three weeks matter in terms of education, when children have been out of school since the middle of March, then think again. This is about equality, narrowing the gap between the haves and have-nots, and opening a window on the world. But it is also more than that. It’s a place of social interaction, of well-being and of safety. Don’t take my word for it. Take the word of the Royal College of Paediatricians, the people whose whole le is spent on the well-being of children. They are very clear: Schools must , children need each other as well as their teachers.The recognition of the importance of schools was something I was proud to oversee in , when the incoming government’s priority slogan was, “education, education, education”.Don’t get me wrong. The belated announcement last week of a one per cent uplt for all schools and a £million pot for an online recovery programme is extremely welcome. A pity, therefore, that in making a really great announcement, the Government managed not to put any money aside for the  to -year-olds in further education, who are surely the target group we would want to be helping the most.So, thank you to all those who have done everything they can to keep the wheels on the cart over the past dficult three and a half months. But now we need both national leadership and local organisation. To use an old adage, we need to think national but we need to act local. Education trusts, local authorities, teachers’ unions and all those committed to the future of this nation should want to come together to make it work.In the next ten days, while the Government thinks about its advice, others can get on with the job. Take what is working best and spread it.What can work in France or Denmark or Germany can certainly work here. We are not out of the woods yet, but we can take logical, rational and brave decisions. That is what leadership is all about.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

How could it not The sense of countryside and fresh air it evokes, the tweed caps, the fingerless mittens, the ornate walking stick . . .  just the innate Britishness of it all. Such a far cry from the smog, red carpets, bling and supercars of LA.And then, of course, it’s a reminder of the people he’s known since birth.Those who, unlike the “mwah mwah”, showbiz crowd, love him for who, rather than what, he is.Whichever way you view his behaviour of late, it’s undeniable that there is a huge, Harry-shaped hole in this image of family togetherness.Of course, there are Zoom meetings to be had and, post-lockdown, the occasional visit to be made. But it’s never quite the same.And therein lies the rub when you marry someone from another country.At first your initial attraction and then love for each other transcends geographical or cultural dferences.But when children come along and you’re required to stay in one place, inevitably one of you has to give up more than the other.Meghan tried it, albeit for a very short time, and now Harry is the one living thousands of miles away from his family and the only le he’s ever known.He made the decision to step down as a senior royal and decamp to the US for the sake of his new family — Meghan and Archie — but that doesn’t make it any less tough to see the old one ticking over nicely without him.A couple of years ago, I was in a central London restaurant with a group of other married couples and, much to the annoyance of we wives, the husbands couldn’t take their eyes off a woman sitting at the bar.Wearing the shortest of dresses, her legs were encircled around the object of her affections and her tongue made frequent visits to his ear.I recognised the man as actor Stephen Campbell Moore, ex-husband of The Crown star Claire Foy, and his obviously smitten companion as Sophie Cookson, who played Christine Keeler in last year’s BBC drama about the Profumo scandal.Fast forward to lockdown and this photo, suggests the couple may now be expecting their first child.The fond arrival of which will mean a heavy-hearted goodbye to those late-night, lust-filled liaisons that had the rest of us drooling with envy.Kaiser Chiefs frontman Ricky Wilson says he amuses himself by lying in interviews then changing his Wikipedia page to match his inventions.It reminds me of my stint as a royal correspondent when, after days of being on the road together, we would challenge each other to use silly names in stories.Hence, “Toby Lerone” was quoted in an article filed from the royals’ favourite ski resort in Switzerland, and in another story to do with Italy, “Sam Buca” made an appearance.Daft, I know, but it amused usno one .Mr Pendragon, who refuses to pay to park, says they stopped him from leaving his car on nearby roads.Shouldn’t he have been on horseback Bored by St Tropez, billionaires are reportedly snapping up “expedition yachts” that will take them to more adventurous corners of the globe.The one owned by US billionaire Ray Dalio has three deep-ing submersibles, and converted former Soviet spy boat Olivia is currently on the market for £million.Back home, lock-down quarantine rules have forced a  per cent rise in multi-millionaire Brits splashing their cash on vast private pools.Meanwhile, the rest of us will make do with a boat in the bath and a paddling pool.Sarah Ferguson – aka Prince Andrew’s ex we – is building up quite a following on her YouTube channel, where she reads children’s books such as The Wonky Donkey and Little Red Riding Hood while wearing fancy dress.Her success is no surprise, because on the many occasions I’ve seen her at charity events, she always connects brilliantly with the children in attendance.But personally, I can’t wait for her to get round to the critically acclaimed Idan Hadari book about a boy who wants to be famous.It’s called Andrew’s Claim To Fame.Or, in the Duke of York’s case, should that be infamy Yep. She now looks about .When -year-old Khairi Saadallah started his alleged kne rampage in a Reading park, a young, off-duty police officer ran towards the danger and rugby tackled him to the ground.It was a selfless act of bravery that, according to sources, saved “many more people dying”.Meanwhile, a judge has praised the bravery of PC Andrew Harper, who died after being dragged along by a car as he chased some thieves.Both of these are salutary reminders that, while every police force in the world has a few bad apples, the majority of those working in law enforcement are undeniably courageous people doing a tough job that most of us would shy away from.The latest money-making exercise candle from Gwyneth Paltrow is called This Smells Like My Orgasm.Which, as you ask, is “tart grapefruit, neroli, and ripe cassis berries blended with gunpowder tea and Turkish rose absolutes”. Er, right.Like its highly successful predecessor This Smells Like My Vagina candle – which, for the blissfully unaware, is “geranium, citrusy bergamot, and cedar absolutes juxtaposed with Damask rose and ambrette seed” – it costs£.Clearly, she’s a sales genius who could flog underwear to a nudist, but one suspects any attempt to branch out with a, to put it politely, Smells Like My Winkle range might prove a tougher sell.Hmmm. While the new name — Lost The Pot Noodle — is inspired, one notes that it now requires the consumer to put the ingredients in a mug or make it in a pan on the stove.As any self-respecting, Olympically idle student will tell you, a clean mug is a rarer sighting than an eclipse and, as for a pan, eventhey own one it will be housing enough penicillin growth to solve America’s recent shortage.So, memo to Unilever: Don’t phase out the original just yet.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The submission raised concerns that the government has not devoted the appropriate amount of resources to UAP.The Committee remains concerned that there is no unied, comprehensive process within the federal government for collecting and analyzing intelligence on unidentied aerial phenomena, despite the potential threat, the committee states in its report on the bill.The bill orders the Director of National Intelligence to produce a thorough report with relevant agencies, including the FBI and the Office of Naval Intelligence. The unclassied report, which may include a classied annex, will contain details about a series of encounters with UAP and advanced aerial threats. Some of those encounters may not be with extraterrestrials, but instead adversaries of America testing the nations defenses.What’s more, the report must detail what information has been previously gathered on UAPs, how the data is collected and published, and what risks UFOs could pose.In April, the Pentagon declassied and released three videos taken by US Navy pilots showing mid-air encounters with what appeared to be UFOs.One of the videos was reportedly shot in November  and the other two in January . But exactly how much will be revealed in the new report depends on what the Pentagon deems unclassied.If the bill passes, the Pentagon will have  days to submit the report to Congress.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Prime Minister announced that we were at last allowed out of our Great British Hibernation.We can go to the pub, buy useless tat in shops and queue up for plaster lawn ornaments from garden centres. We can have the in-laws round to visit! Yoot!⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news  updatesBoris says that his decision was made on good scientic advice. Hmm, maybe. It is true that the infection rate for Covid has been dropping rapidly for some time. But it’s still there, still hanging around with mischief on its mind. All it takes is one person in a gathering of  or  at some pizza joint and that infection rate will be up again quickly enough.In some of the countries that have released their people from lockdown, a second spike has occurred.In Germany the famous “R” rate for infection is well above the dreaded one. South Korea and Spain have seen new outbreaks, too.But the truth is Boris didn’t have much of an option. The public is bored stf and the economy is wrecked.I suspect the decision was arrived at on those grounds, rather than strictly on the science. Everyone wants to go out and spend money. I am not sure why they do.  There were good things about lockdown — and it taught us one or two truths about ourselves.It was a pleasure to hear the birds singing, for example. A real delight to see the roads free from traffic. The skies are full of swts and swallows instead of the incessant airline flights. The quality of the air we breathe improved hugely as a result. So did the water quality of rivers and streams.We went out much, much less. As a consequence, many people saved an awful lot of money because they weren’t wasting it on buying rubbish from shops.People learned to cook — and ate home-prepared meals with their families. The truth is, in normal times, we eat out far more often than is good for us, financially or otherwise. And we shopped locally — the corner stores did a roaring trade — and less often, thus saving carbon emissions.Employers discovered that people could work from home perfectly well. Hopefully this will persuade some to scale back their offices and give people the chance to work from home.Imagine how many homes could be created from disused offices! We wouldn’t have to pave over half the country to sort out our housing crisis. Imagine cutting out the daily commute for ever!We didn’t have to hug people. Indeed, we were barred by law from hugging people. Or kissing them on the bloody cheek, like everyone in the media world does. That, by itself, was a huge bonus for me.My wish is that we take some of that stuff from lockdown and make it the new normal. Live at a quieter, gentler pace. Continue to eat at home — and support our local corner shops. Use the car less. Spend less money on a whole load of b******s we don’t really need. Use aeroplanes not at all, preferably. Right now, the Government has given us licence to go out and do stuff.Here’s my plea. Let’s do a bit less stuff than we used to. Let’s remain kind of half in and half out of lockdown. Whether Covid is still around or not. We’ll end up happier as a result.ONE thing Captain Tom showed us, as he walked around his garden as he approached the age of , is that it’s never too late to make a dference.Bob Dylan is just a young whippersnapper by Tom’s standards.But at the age of  he has just made his finest album in at least three decades, and probably more.

Get your orders in now.The United Nations has decided to give them to Mauritius. That’s because the islands are nearer Mauritius than they are to the UK. On that basis we could have a good claim to owning Belgium. The islands are important to the UK militarily. And we should keep them. The UN has given us deadlines to hand them over to a country that never owned them. What we should do instead is leave the crooked UN.EXCLUDED from the Government’s loosening of lockdown are Britain’s vibrant community of werewolves and vampires.“It is all very well biting someone’s neck, or ripping their lungs out while howling loudly,” a scientist advising the Government probably said. “But when they do this there is the risk that the virus could be passed on via droplets from the creature’s mouth. Or indeed paws – werewolves do not have a good record of using hand-sanitiser.”By contrast, zombies were praised for their social-distancing technique. “Whenever you see them they are always walking two metres apart with their hands outstretched and bits of flesh falling off their faces,” the same scientist probably added.A spokesman for the National Association of Lycanthropescommented: “This is typical of the prejudice we werewolves face and amounts to discrimination. Actually, I thought I had the virus a few weeks ago. Nasty cough and so on.“But I’m all right nooooowwwwwwooooo.”THE day after the woke ninnies at Warners withdrew the great Hollywood film Gone With The Wind because of “race issues”, guess what happened  Yup, it became the No bestselling film on Amazon. Better still, it reached No in the AppleiTunes chart for TV and film. Not bad for a movie made more than  years ago, huh I suppose it could have been “progressives” buying the film so that they would have something to be outraged about. Or maybe the Ku Klux Klan Film Club has a bigger membership than we thought.More likely though is that people loathe censorship. They don’t like being told what they can and can’t watch. Truth be told it hasn’t been for a good  years. And the process accelerated under Magic Grandpa and his front bench of mouth-breathing dingbats. Now it’s the well-orf who support Labour. And the poor who vote Conservative.

And eager children have ed straight back into lessons under strict social distancing rules without hassle.Thecomes in spite of teaching unions pouring scorn over moves to get all kids safely back in class by September.Headteacher Ben Hulme said tonight: “Schools like us have shown it can be done safely for both children and staff.“This is a time when unions, schools and headteachers should all be pulling together to get children back in class. To be isive makes it really dficult to get back to some safe normality.“There have been many reports about how lockdown has affected children’s mental health and emotional wellbeing — and how there’s potential for damage to be donewe don’t move quickly. That really spurred us on to get something together — and it’s working very well.“We’re really pleased to be back and I’d encourage other schools to do the samethey can.”Under the new plans, the Government aims to form “year group bubbles” in secondary schools.This would stop pupils mingling with teenagers from other year groups, while allowing classes toto their normal size.Education Secretary Gavin Williamson hailed St Paul’s safe and swt— and called on others to take “full advantage” of the chance to open again.He told The Sun: “We have given primary schools the flexibility to bring back more children — where they can do so within our protective measures — and it’s fantastic to see some schools taking full advantage of that to maximise their capacity and invite back all pupils.”Anne Longfield, the Children’s Commissioner for England, heaped praise on St Paul’s — and urged other schools to follow its lead.She said: “This is a real achievement and great to see teachers working with parents to get the whole school open safely before the summer break.”The Government originally ­pledged to get all primary schools back in action for at least a month before June .

Some do not have the staff and others do not have the space.Current government guidance for schools does not require kids to socially distance within their bubble, but many schools are ignoring the advice, insisting on all pupils remaining two-metres apart.The rules planned for September would make clear that social distancing would not be required within bubbles.Instead, kids will be encouraged to limit contact with each other.Its Headmaster Ben Hulme used his imagination, created extra space on the school field and put other hygiene measures in place.Now, to the delight of parents, almost all his pupils started back on Monday.

The Seventies brought Led Zeppelin and countless rock bands, it gave us heavy metal and punk and Joy Division pretty much all at the same time.The biggest-selling album of the Eighties, Michael Jackson’s Thriller, was actually written by a bloke from Hull, while British greats as erse as Duran Duran and The Smiths ruled the waves.In the Cool Britannia of the Nineties, when Britpop was ringing out of radio networks worldwide, even American stars such as Madonna sought help from British producers such as Nellee Hooper and William Orbit.Then there were the Spice Girls. And Coldplay. Now we’ve got Ed Sheeran and Adele. And it doesn’t stop with artists. Love him or hate him, Simon Cowell’s TV programmes are another British global music phenomenon.But it’s live music where Britain really dominates today. Glastonbury should be taking place this weekend.I’ve played at just about every major festival on the planet, from Coachella in the US to Fuji Rock in Japan, but there is nowhere to touch Glastonbury.It is, quite simply, the greatest show on earth There is a massive ripple effect from Glastonbury. It sets a very high bar for the other  — that’s  — festivals that happen throughout the UK every single summer.And the same crews who build the stages, operate the sound systems, put up the fences and supply the bogs for Glasto are busy for the rest of the summer at other events.Now the independent festival sector is at risk of collapse thanks to the Covid shutdown.Last month, the Association of Independent Festivals , which represents  festivals in the UK, reported that  per cent of its members were facing costs that could ruin their businesses and . per cent were uninsured for Covid- related cancellations.Most of my time these days is spent planning and organising The Big Feastival, which was due to take place here on my farm in Oxfordshire this August Bank Holiday weekend.Of course I’m devastated it won’t be going ahead, but the really sad thing is that it looks like no one is going to hear any live music, new or old this summer.That’s a tragedy for the musicians who rely on gigging to make a living — as well as all the other people whose income relies on live music.The Musicians’ Union says its members have lost more than £million in income during the lockdown. Remember, that most musicians just scrape by at the best of times.Big stars are bigger than ever before, but they are the exception not the rule. When Adele releases another record there is a danger she will become so massive she will collapse into a black hole.But now bands need an audience to play to and also financial support, which used to come from record companies but now is hard to find.Records, or downloads, are basically free these days, so live shows are the only real way to make money.In the same way restaurants were already struggling before lockdown, many of Britain’s smaller live music venues were struggling too.So most of the places I played in the early days with Blur have already dis- appeared. They need to be able to open their doors again, as do festivals.It has to be possible to find a way. Just as with pubs, restaurants and cinemas, you could limit the number of people allowed into a venue.Perhaps more gigs could be seated to ensure social distancing. Not quite the same, but better than nothing.As far as the rest of the planet is concerned, Britain is represented pretty much by the Royal Family, football and music.We must keep our festival circuit alive and nurture new artists.That means we urgently have to find a way for music to be played to a live audience, evenit’s only a small one — so that we can keep meaning something to the rest of the world.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Consider it your solemn duty.THE survey saying a quarter of furloughed workers will lose their jobs is horrying.Nine million are being kept afloat by the bailout. But that ruinous cost will end.

But it doesnt affect your redundancy pay rightsyou are let go from your job amid the coronavirus crisis.Your employer should still carry out a fair redundancy process.You are also entitled to appeal the decision by claiming unfair dismissal within three months of being let go.If youre made redundant after your company has gone into administration you can claim redundancy pay \" href\"https:www.gov.uk claim-redundancy\" target\"_blank\" rel\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\"via Gov.uk. Employers will have to begin paying national insurance and pension contributions from August as the scheme is gradually wound down. Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced last month the scheme would be extended until October to help the economy survive the shock of the coronavirus crisis. You will be entitled to be consulted on the redundancy lay-off first and to receive a statutory redundancy payment, as long as youve been working somewhere for at least two years.Redundancy pay is capped at £ per weekHow much youre entitled to depends on your age andof service, although this is capped at  years. Youll get:Sadly, you wont be entitled to a payoutyouve been working for your employer for fewer than two years.There should be a period of collective consultation as well as time for inidual onesyour employer wants to make  or more employees redundant within  days or each other.The Office for National Statisticsestimates furlough costs around £billion a month.As bars, restaurants, pubs, hairdressers, cinemas and most other businesses in England are allowed to reopen on July , firms financial viability will be put to the test in a fight to survive after the lockdown. Businesses will have to follow strict social distancing rules -including limiting the number of people in venues at any one time, pushing companies on shoe-string budgets to the limit. According to the ONS, , people have already lost their jobs since the start of the lockdown. More than  million people have been forced to turn to Universal Credit to survive as job losses have swept the UK. Nine million are being kept afloat by the bailout. But that ruinous cost will end. At which point more than two million will be added to the dole queue.That will be a bitter blow for many who have enjoyed the lockdown — some packing the beaches yesterday on what would ordinarily be a working day.The bailouts’ end in October spells devastation in particular for the young and low-paid. And it falls to Chancellor Rishi Sunak to recreate the jobs boom of the last decade.At least, post-Brexit, he will have even more tools with which to do it.From September employers will pay  percent of furloughed workers salary, as the Treasury reduces their contribution from  per cent to  per cent. In the final month of the scheme, furloughed workers will be paid  per cent of their salary from the public purse - and employers will be expected to pay  per cent.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

People probably wont be allowed to pop into a museum or gallery on a whim, as these tickets may need to be pre-booked, according to guidance from the Government. Venues should also put in one-way systems where possible, to limit the number of people moving in and out of dferent rooms. The guidance suggests implementing wait or stop signs in busy areas. Foyers and assembly areas will be used for queuing, which will have to be socially distanced. Interactive exhibitions could also have to be ditched - meaning audio guides to museums could be banned. If museums want to keep them in place, the rules suggest thorough cleaning and quarantining them to limit the risk of germs lingering after visitors have used them. The guidance says: Museumsnew formats for the content such as apps that can be accessed on personal devices or quarantine periods for public handsets. Internal shops and cafes will have to follow the same social distancing advice as those outside of museums and galleries - including quarantining clothes which people have tried on, taking orders via apps, and putting screens in front of counters to protect staff. Visiting museums and galleries could mean a long hike up stairs, as venues have been advised to limit the use of lts to people with limited mobility. This is because lts are small, enclosed spaces where the risk of spreading coronavirus is higher. Where it isnt possible to follow the  metre social distancing rule, staff and visitors will have to follow the one metre plus rule which means staying  metre away and using extra precautions such as face masks.While the advice doesnt make face masks mandatory in museums or galleries, it advises managers to consider bringing them in for staff where they think it is necessary. Heritage sites will also be subject to the advice and will need clear floor markings showing visitors through via a one-way-system to stop crowds forming. The guidance also advised heritage sites to put in similar pre-booking systems in place to limit being flooded with visitors. All cultural attractions will have to reboot their cleaning regime and implement deep cleaning, but they will have to ensure it is completed in a way that does not damage the historic fabric of the buildings.  To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Boris Johnsonaposs spokesman refused to be drawn on the topic after it was missing from the PMaposs statement opening pubs, restuarants, bars, cinemas, hotels, campsites, hairdressers and places of worship.The reproduction number - aposRapos for short - is the average number of people who get infected by each person with coronavirus.If itaposs higher than one, the virus starts spreading exponentially and can run out of control.A month ago, when Boris Johnson schools and non-essential shops would reopen, he explicitly said the changes should keep aposRapos below one.But this time, when he revealed lockdown would ease on Tuesday, he did not repeat that claim. Instead the PM focused on the aposfive testsapos for easing lockdown to justy reopening huge areas of English society. Today Mr Johnsonaposs spokesman was askedhis scientic advisors had set out advice on how the new changes would affect aposRapos. But he refused to say. Instead he told journalists: As the PM set out, we believe the five tests continue to be met and that was the basis for reaching the decision.  “In terms of the R rate, the R rate for England under the most recently announced figures was . to ..” Asked again what the scientistsapos advice was, he told journalists: You don’t need to take my word for it - both Sir Patrick Vallance and Chris Whitty were asked extensively earlier this week for their views on the package and they articulated them in full. Told the pair had not been asked a specic question about aposRapos, he replied: What they said is it was a reasonable balance of risk informed by reasonable professional judgements.  It comes after a leaked Public Health England briefing suggested the R number could already be above one in parts of England.The document, obtained by HuffPost UK, said because of uncertainty in how accurate the figure is, “we cannot preclude R being above ”.A previous model suggested it was already at or above one in the North West and South West - but the government insisted that model was only one of more than ten. The R number was put at the centre of the governmentaposs communications about easing lockdown in May. When he reopened schools and non-essential shops, the PM told England on May : This package has been carefully designed so that we can ease the burdens of lockdown, while expecting to keep that R below one. I cannot and will not throw away all the gains we have made together. And so the changes we are making are limited and cautious.

Nadhim Zahawi made the frank admission in a bizarre bid to defend his party in a row about access to the highest levels of government. The Business Minister was asked by the BBC why aposRed Wallapos Tory voters in Doncaster or Ashfield don’t have the same access as billionaire Richard Desmond. He replied: If people go to a fundraiser in their local area in Doncaster for the Conservative Party they’d be sitting next to MPs and other people in their local authority, and can interact with dferent parts of the authority. The Tories have never made any secret of the fact people can buy access to the party - but it is rare to have such a frank statement saying so. By donating £,, donors can join the Leadersapos Group to dine in private with the PM and senior ministers. The party has always insisted there is no undue influence. Acting Leader of the Liberal Democrats Ed Davey said: It is scandalous to suggest that the most appropriate way for the public to lobby Conservative MPs is to pour money into Tory party coffers. Members of Parliament are there to serve all their constituents, not just those who can write them big cheques. The Prime Minister now must show leadership. He must sack Robert Jenrick. It comes as Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick faces questions over his decision to approve a £bn housing development in London against the advice of a planning inspector. He gave Westferry Printworks, planned by billionaire Tory donor Richard Desmond, the green light on January  - hours before a council levy kicked in that would have cost the developer around £m. Itaposs since emerged Mr Desmond showed the minister a video of the scheme on his phone at a Tory fundraising dinner in November, and texted him asking him to approve it before the deadline.  On November , Mr Desmond told him we donapost want to give Marxists in Tower Hamlets council loads of doe for nothing. In an e-mail dated January , a government official said Mr Jenrick was insistent that decision issued this week ie tomorrow - as next week the viability of the scheme is impacted by the levy. Mr Desmond is not accused of wrongdoing, and Mr Jenrick has insisted that while there could have been an appearance of bias, there was no actual bias. Even so, the minister cancelled his approval to avoid a perception of bias in favour of the scheme.  Mr Zahawi made his comments on BBC Radio aposs Today programme - where he insisted there was no wrongdoing. He said: “The important thing by the way is the access didn’t buy this billionaire a decision. “The Secretary of State very clearly said to Richard Desmond ‘I can’t see you, I cannot have this meeting’. “So you have to also be fair and make that clear that yes of course there was access, because there was a dinner party that Robert Jenrick didn’t know he was going to sit next to Richard Desmond in. But Robert Jenrick also said in those messages that he released… ‘I can’t have this meeting with you’.  Robert Jenrick last night agreed to release correspondence relating to the Westferry Printworks development after pressure from Labour. The messages suggest Mr Jenrick made first contact with the billionaire after the dinner in November, but later told Mr Desmond he could not discuss the scheme. However, officials in the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government made clear Mr Jenrick wanted to issue approval before the levy kicked in on January . After a frenetic exchange of e-mails within government, Mr Jenrickaposs office said he would be issuing his approval at .pm on January . The minister said yesterday: These documents show that contrary to the wild accusations and the baseless innuendo propagated by [Labour], and restated today in a series of totally inaccurate statements and comments, this was a decision taken with an open mind on the merits of the case after a thorough decision-making process.

Robert Jenrick tonight agreed to release correspondence relating to the Westferry Printworks development, planned by millionaire mogul Richard Desmond in East London. The redevelopment, said to be worth £ billion, was approved in January by Mr Jenrick against the recommendation of a planning inspector. The local council in Tower Hamlets were set to introduce a Community Infrastructure Levythe day after Mr Jenrick stepped in and approved the plan. The levy would have obliged Mr Desmond to contribute at least £ million to support projects in the area. The decision was reversed after legal action by Tower Hamlets Council and Mr Jenrick accepted his decision was unlawful by reason of apparent bias. In heavily redacted emails released by Mr Jenrickaposs office tonight, officials discussed the Secretary of Stateaposs sense of urgency in granting the approval. In one email discussion, an unnamed Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government official wrote: On timing, my understanding is that [Mr Jenrick] is was insistent that decision issued this week ie tomorrow - as next week the viability of the scheme is impacted by a change in the London CIL regime. Another email reads: The appellant [Mr Desmond] believes that the proposal would not be viableliable to CIL charges. Text messages between Mr Jenrick and Mr Desmond reveal conversations between the pair after they had sat at the same table at a Tory fundraiser. Arranging a site visit to view the development, Mr Desmond wrote: We appreciate the speed as we donapost want to give Marxists loads of doe for nothing. In reply, Mr Jenrick warned Mr Desmond it was important not to give any appearance of being influenced by applicants of cases that I may have a role in or to have predetermined them and so I think it is best that we donapost meet until after the matter has decided. In a later text message to which Mr Jenrick did not reply, Mr Desmond explicitly told the minister the urgency in having the development approved was to save money in taxes. Mr Desmond wrote: We have to get the approval before January  otherwise payment of  million pounds to Tower Hamlets, meaning we have to stop and reduce social housing. Thanks Robert, look forward to speaking soon, Best, Richard. According to the documents, the March site visit did not take place and no further communication followed because Mr Jenrick did not take Mr Desmondaposs  calls when he attempted to get in contact on a number of occasions. Thereaposs no record in any of the documents of Mr Jenrickaposs department taking an interest in the deal prior to the Minister and Mr Jenrick sitting at the same table at a Tory dinner in November . Mr Jenrick was the first to make written contact with Mr Desmond, sending a text after the event which read: Good to spend time with you tonight, Richard. See you again soon I hope. Mr Jenrick insisted the row over his involvement in the Westferry Printworks planning decision was politically motivated. But he agreed to release documents and correspondence relating to the decision in accordance with Freedom of Information rules. He said he would release all relevant information relating to the planning decision later today.It came after Labour warned the row had blown apart confidence in the planning system.Shadow communities secretary Steve Reed told the Commons: The only way to put that right is for the Secretary of State to publish the evidence about what really happened. If heaposs done nothing wrong then heaposs got nothing to fear. So I hope he will welcome this opportunity to restore trust in a sector that will be so critical in rebuilding Britain after the lockdown. Mr Jenrick told MPs: I will write to the chair of the select committee outlining the timeline of events and the rationale for my decision-making pertaining to the Westferry Printworks planning decision. Alongside this letter, and after a comprehensive review of what documents might be in scope of this motion, and of the letter that he sent me on behalf of his select committee, I will be releasing later today all relevant information relating to this planning matter using the Freedom of Information Act as a benchmark.

The site on Lynn Road makes canned foods and pouched grub for general sale. LincolnshireLive reports the site was closed for  hours for a deep clean but has since reopened. A Princes spokesperson said:Our first priority is the well-being and safety of our colleagues. We have been following government advice since the outbreak of Covid- and will continue to do so.“We can confirm fourteen of our Wisbech-based colleagues have recently tested positive for coronavirus. The total number of colleagues at Wisbech is . “As soon as these colleagues were symptomatic, they were asked to self-isolate and contact the health authorities to be tested, and to be logged as part of track and trace efforts. A deep clean of the facilities these colleagues used was also conducted, alongside further stringent cleaning across the site. As an additional step, we took the responsible decision to temporarily close the whole site for  hours so a further deep clean could be completed. The site has now reopened. The spokesperson added: “Throughout the period that Covid- has presented a risk, we have implemented social distancing measures and adapted our work environment in line with relevant guidance to minimise the chances of infection within the factory. All colleagues that are able to work from home are doing so and we have taken steps to ensure we have adequate supply of PPE for our colleagues. “We remain in close contact with Public Health England and Fenland Council so they are fully informed of our approach and developments at the site.” This marks the fourth factory to be hit by the worrying coronavirus outbreak in meat processing plants.  Close working conditions and cold temperatures are said to be at the root of the problem. The Kepak plant in Merthyr Tydfil has reportedly had eight cases of Covid- this month already. Scientists believe the cold air inside the food processing factories could make those inside more susceptible.

She said: No one wants to pay to hear them sounding off about gender equality and the environment. Harry and Meghan will really have to up their ante, and they will absolutely have to tell some stories about the Royal Family. Former President Barack Obama reportedly earned almost £, for one  speech, while the Clintons averaged almost £, per appearance in  thanks to the New York-based Harry Walker Agency. They have reportedly said they will now focus their efforts on social issues such as racial injustice, in line with the Black Lives Matter movement, while continuing to highlight subjects such as gender equality, mental health and environmental concerns.

A source close to Harry and Meghan reportedly confirmed the couple had signed with the agency, which industry insiders say will net them millions as they seek “financial independence” away from the royal family. It is expected they will offer their services as keynote speakers with big money corporations and community forums in future. In February, Harry spoke at an event hosted by investment banking giant JP Morgan where he revealed he had been in therapy for the past three years.

Henry Long along with Albert Bowers was found in a Fendt Diamond caravan in Plot  on the Four Houses Corner site. Neither man was found in possession of a mobile phone, and the police could not find any phone attributable to either defendant during their search of the caravan site.

A UV level of  is extremely rare, with levels  and  usually found in the Mediterranean, and  is considered aposextremeapos. UV levels could reach an all-time high in the UK as a result of clear skies and a lack of air pollution due to no flights amid the coronavirus pandemic.

He said: Thataposs about as high as it gets really in the UK. The sun is as strong as it gets at the moment because weaposre so close to the solstice.

Dr Michaela Hegglin, a professor in atmospheric chemistry at the University of Reading, said the UK could see some of the aposhighest UV levels ever recordedapos today. She told the Mail Online: This is because of a combination of factors. We are at the summer solstice, when the sun is almost directly overhead at one oaposclock. UV levels this high are rare in the UK, so people with light skin should be very careful to avoid getting burnt. While UV is important for getting vitamin D and keeping us healthy, too much of it can cause skin cancer or eye cataracts. The Met Office say precautions should be taken to stay protected. A spokesperson said: The highest levels look set to be in the south west today.  So people should avoid the sun at midday, cover up, and stay hydrated. What are UV levels  UV levels , are determined by three factors: the elevation angleof the sun in the sky, the amount of cloud, dust and pollution in the atmosphere, and the amount of ozone gas in the stratosphere. According to the Met Office, UV ray are present in sunlight, and when to many of the rays hit our skin, they can damage the DNA in our skin cells. It is the bodyaposs attempts to repair these cells that causes redness and pain, also known as sunburn.   The strength of UV ies depending on where you are in the world, the time of year and on a number of dferent weather factors such as the amount of cloud cover. Small amounts of UV exposure can be beneficial as it is essential in the production of vitamin D, however over exposure of UV can lead to serious health issues. It comes as the Met Office issued a level three heat-health warning for some parts of the UK. The amber warning advises Brits to look out for others, especially older people, young children and babies and those with underlying health conditions as temperatures rocket to the low-s. It is in place until pm on Friday. The level three warning covers the West Midlands and East Midlands, with the rest of England on a level two alert.

Temperatures soared to C in some parts of the UK yesterday and are set to be even hotter today as the sizzling heatwave continues. Popular beaches such as Brighton, Bournemouth and Southend were packed early on Thursday, but there appeared to be a lack of social distancing.Earlier today, Dr Hilary Jones warned Good Morning Britain viewers not to flock to packed beaches in the hot weather.He addressed the severe consequences of Covid-, especially on those above the age of , and his fear that cases could increase againpeople were to get complacent. It is feared more people will head to beaches and public areas asthe virus has gone - with Dr Hilary warning this is not the case. Telling GMB hosts Ben Shephard and Susanna Reid that people are abandoning the rules, he warned it could lead to a repeat of April when cases and even deaths from the virus soared above ,. Hilary advised those watching and those heading out to stick to the rules, in fear that the infection rate and the R number will rise as a result. He explained, after talk of the daily death rate and case rate reportedly dropping: Thataposs because lockdown has been successful. We are still seeing nearly , confirmed new cases a day after testing. If anyone could be a fly on the wall in critical care or in intensive care right now they would still see hundreds of people on ventilators and still being admitted to hospital. He went on: What we don’t want to see is the prevalence rise and the R number go up, and hospital admissions rise again.It comes as people were warned to stay hydrated while out and about in the hot conditions, with sunseekers flocking to beaches in huge numbers in recent days, despite social distancing measures still being in place.An amber level three heat-health alert, issued by the Met Office, was extended on Thursday to take in Yorkshire and the east and south of England as well as the West and East Midlands.The warning requires social and healthcare services to target specic actions at high-risk groups, according to the Met Office website. Health authorities have encouraged those most vulnerable - many of whom have been shielding during lockdown - to protect themselves amid the exceptionally hot weather forecast this week. Public Health Englandsaid older people, those with underlying health conditions, and very young children were all more at risk from the higher temperatures. It is expected temperatures in west London could reach C , while parts of Wales could see the mercury rise to C . The thermometer had already hit C at Porthmadog in Wales on Thursday morning. Temperatures reached .Cat Londonaposs Heathrow Airport at .pm on Wednesday making it the hottest day of the year so far. Met Office meteorologist John Grfiths said there was a low chance that the Welsh Marches - the area along the Welsh border - could see temperatures of Cvery locally.  Should that happen, it would be the hottest June on record in Wales, surpassing the previous peak of .Con June , . The Met Office said UV levels were expected to remain at eight across many parts of the UK on Thursday. Dr Michaela Hegglin, associate professor in atmospheric chemistry at the University of Readingaposs Department of Meteorology, said Thursday could see some of the highest UV levels ever recorded in Britain. She said: This is because of a combination of factors. We are at the summer solstice, when the sun is almost directly overhead at one oaposclock.  UV levels this high are rare in the UK, so people with light skin should be very careful to avoid getting burnt. While UV is important for getting vitamin D and keeping us healthy, too much of it can cause skin cancer or eye cataracts.Friends, family and neighbours have been urged to keep checking on the vulnerable, who might still be spending more time at home due to coronavirus, by keeping in touch on the phone.Shoppers have also been advised to be aware they could be forced to spend extra time in the sun as a result of social distancing measures, and warned to protect themselves by bringing water and wearing high factor sunscreen.Dog owners have been urged to avoid exercising their pets during the hottest part of the day, with Vets Now, a provider of emergency veterinary care, warning that the average survival rate of a dog diagnosed with heatstroke was %. Meanwhile, fire chiefs said they wanted to debunk this myth that hand sanitiser left in hot cars could pose a fire risk. Roy Wilsher, NFCC chair said: We want to reassure people that this product will not combustleft in a car - even on the hottest day. For hand sanitiser to cause a fire it would need to come into contact with a spark.

As the sun rose early this morning there were scenes of devastation on beaches such as Bournemouth and Brighton on the south coast. Tents were left on Bournemouth beach overnight along with piles of rubbish such as empty beer and cider bottles, takeaway food bags and discarded cans of Strongbow. A dog walker in Brighton wrote on Twitter: Went for an early morning walk with our dog. What is wrong with people  Loads of rubbish on the beach everywhere.  I feel for the street cleaners. Take your rubbish home or go to the next bin where it isn’t full, there’s plenty of them. It wasnapost just beaches with piles of rubbish left by revellers, similar scenes have been reported at the Meadows in Edinburgh, on Blackheath common in south east London and in Hyde Park in central London. At Hove Lawns, where pockets of violence broke out last night, rubbish was also left on the seafront, including dozens of metal cannisters used to inhale nitrous oxide - also known as aposhippy crackapos. Last night police estimated there were up to , revellers present at Hove Lawns when officers arrived after being called at .pm. Officers issued a dispersal order to clear the scene after fighting erupted among the huge group of teenagers.An eyewitness told  The Argus:  There are ten police cars and all the kids are walking around shouting at police – it’s like football chants.  All the police have pulled up and are walking along trying to get them to move. Another said: It was like a stand-off between hundreds of youths and police. Local councillor Chris Henry said: Hove Lawns tonight shows how badly solutions for young people are needed and how youth services are needed more than ever.The weather is set to be even hotter today with beaches expected to be packed again - with locals fearing similar scenes throughout the summer with people wary of going to pubs and preferring to drink in the sunshine.  Natalie Joyce wrote on Twitter : I am genuinely confused by the state of some of Dorsetaposs beaches today.I cannot get my head around why people would leave their rubbish and think that it is ok ! No one actually knowsit is locals or people who have travelled to the area, either way - it is bang out of order! Writing about the pictures from Bournemouth Angie said: And the downside of living in Bournemouth. Selfish, entitled humans. aposI want to go to the beach, I don’t careothers do too, I want to eat, get tanned and then leave my rubbish for someone apos. At famous beauty spot Durdle Door  bags of rubbish were reported to have been collected by volunteers. The rubbish included small suitcases, disposable barbecues and broken parasols.The Met Office said temperatures in west London could reach C today , while parts of Wales could see the mercury rise to C .However, the good weather is due to change on Thursday afternoon with thunderstorms forming across the west of the UK. Temperatures reached .Cat Londonaposs Heathrow Airport at .pm on Wednesday making it the hottest day of the year so far. Met Office meteorologist John Grfiths said there was a low chance that the Welsh Marches - the area along the Welsh border - could see temperatures of Cvery locally. Should that happen, it would be the hottest June on record in Wales, surpassing the previous peak of .Con June , . The public has been reminded to take care around water throughout the summer, amid concerns people might be tempted to take a dip to cool down.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who quit their royal le in Britain to set up home in Los Angeles, have struck a deal with the New York-based Harry Walker Agency. Former President Barack Obama reportedly earned almost £, for one  speech, while the Clintons averaged almost £, per appearance in . It is unclear what speaking fees will be for the Duke and Duchess, who will speak both together or inidually, the Los Angeles Times reported. A source close to Harry and Meghan reportedly confirmed the couple had signed with the agency, which industry insiders say will net them millions as they seek “financial independence” away from the royal family. It is expected they will offer their services as keynote speakers with big money corporations and community forums in future. Harry in February spoke at an event hosted by investment banking giant JP Morgan where he revealed he had been in therapy for the past three years. The Duke’s team had held discussions with Goldman Sachs about forming a partnership.  However, Majesty magazine editor Ingrid Seward has warned that Harry and Meghan may have to tell stories about their time in the royal family to justy their fees. She said: No one wants to pay to hear them sounding off about gender equality and the environment.Harry and Meghan will really have to up their ante, and they will absolutely have to tell some stories about the Royal Family. The have reportedly said they will now focus their efforts on social issues such as racial injustice, in line with the Black Lives Matter movement, while continuing to highlight subjects such as gender equality, mental health and environmental concerns. The Queen banned the couple from using their ‘HRH’ titles for their private work as well as stopping them from using the ‘Sussex Royal’ brand that had collected million followers on Instagram.The couple have set up a new enterprise called Archewell, named as the inspiration for their son Archie, but reportedly last week hit a stumbling block with the United States Patent and Trademark Office after submitting their application on March  who described the plans as “too vague”.

Temperatures are expected to his C this weeks, so Brits will be digging out the paddling pools, deck chairs and Factor . While we love soaking up those rays when we get to sit outside, itaposs not so much fun when weaposre stuck in our hot homes working from home - and itaposs resulted in many people missing their office air conditioning. So what can we do to keep  cool during the daytime and when weaposre trying to sleep  Lucy Askew from curtain and blinds company Hillaryaposs has shared a few tips to make the next week more bearable. She told : The weather is so up and down at the moment it can sometimes be hard to keep track. By the time the heatwave is upon us, everyoneaposs ran out and purchased a fan leaving shelves empty and others without a source of cool air. If the queues are too long and you’re worried about them being sold out of the items you are looking for, then these simple tips will help you to keep temperatures down when the weather is scorching. It is important to keep the house cool, especiallyyou have children or pets around, so they don’t overheat, and those who might be strapped for cash or counting their pennies can also use these tips without having to spend a penny.” Use blinds shutters curtains to block out any sunlight Keeping your house cool is essential during a heatwave and,you find that your house lets in direct sunlight, especially in the afternoon, you could find that conditions quickly become unbearable. If your house does experience more sunlight throughout the day then it’s recommended you keep your curtains, shutters and blinds shut to stop the sunlight from beaming into your home. This will keep things marginally cooler and slightly more bearable during heatwaves.    Stay hydrated It’s imperative that you drink plenty of water during any heatwave keep your fridge stocked up with bottled water and consider putting some in the freezer that you can use as ice blocks for when the temperature reaches its peak in the afternoon. It is important to keep your body hydrated so you do not end up suffering from heat stroke or dehydration headaches and migraines. Have warm showers    A lot of people think that cold showers will help to keep you cool but in fact, warm showers are actually far more effective in cooling you down when your body temperature is running hot.   A warmshower will initially feel worse than a cold shower but, because a freezing cold shower closes your pores shut, within a few minutes of taking the shower you will end up feeling warmer than you did beforehand as your initial core temperature releases.   Drink tea coffee Whilst you may crave a nice cold drink during a heatwave, it has been said that drinking hot drinks like tea or coffee will actually counteract the heat and cool your body quicker than cold drinks.    "},{"url":null,"title":"farmer baffled after sheep gave","story":"NewsFarmer baffled after sheep gave birth to mutant cyclops lamb with one eyePipih was left stunned after a lamb was born with just one eye on his farm in Indonesia, but it died two days after being born because it was struggling to eat properlyShareCommentsByJamie Hawkins:,  JUN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video cyclops-lamb-one-eye-born-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

I take care of my sheep and none of them have any diseases.aposapos The farmer was told that his lamb might be a demon disguising itself as a goat, a reincarnation of the religious character Dajjal. But the farmer believed otherwise. He added: The mother gave birth to two lambs. The other one is normal. I hope this will be a good sign and bring blessings to the family. Despite the extra attention given to the lamb, it died two days later on June  after it was born because it struggled to eat.  Village official Cucu Sunarya said they visited the farmhouse after hearing about the strange lamb to check for possible disease. They found that the lamb was healthy apart for its misshapen facial parts, which were the reason for its dficulty eating.  He said: There is no other factor for its death. It canapost be cold, because there was no rain yet. It canapost eat properly and was only given a few drops of milk at a time using a pacier.

As a result, Sara Aziz claims she spent hours scrubbing at the side of her face to try and get the orange stain off - all the while glugging white wine to calm herself.The -year-old said she was adding a couple of layers of fake tan on June  in order to look good in a selfie.She sat down to rest while the tan was drying, but ended up dozing off with the mitt still on her hand. As soon as she woke up, she said she knew something was wrong as she instantly spotted the mitt. Sara looked in the mirror and was horried when she saw her reflection.The events co-ordinator from, Colchester, Essex, used everything she could think of to try and remove the fake tan stain from her face, including face wash, cooking oil and a pumice stone. The outline eventually faded after kind pals online suggested she apply lemon juice to lt the colour. Sara said: I was scrubbing my face all night and drank copious amounts of wine to deal with it.  I did my first fake tan at .am then later that afternoon I tanned again just to give it a second coat and thataposs when it happened. I thought to myself aposooh letaposs have a little sit down and let it dry offapos and fell asleep for about  minutes. Iaposd only had two hours sleep the night before because a neighbour had music on all night so I was shattered. I realised something had gone wrong as soon as I woke up and saw the mitt was on my hand. I ran straight to a mirror and screamed. All I can say is thank god for Deliveroo who were able to drop some wine off. I didnapost have any in and I needed something to calm my nerves because I looked like an oompa loompa. The tanning fail was a first for Sara, who fake tans every Thursday with a dark mousse tan and in this instance was using the £. Solait ultra-dark mousse that aposlasts for daysapos from Superdrug. She continued: I love fake tanning because it makes me feel happy and skinnier, leaposs better with a tan and all that. Iaposve fake tanned since I was , so you could say Iaposm a fake tan addict. I tan on a Thursday night so Iaposm really tanned for the weekend. I wasnapost going anywhere, I tanned just to make a selfie look good.This one says to wash off within four hours but I always leave mine on for  hours and then wash it off. I know it wonapost accelerate much after four hours but I just want that darker tan.  While trying frantically to remove the dark splodge, Sara took a quick snap and shared it with pals online to get some advice - and spent £. on a wine order delivered to her doorI decided on ordering wine as soon as I woke up and saw my face, she said. I normally drink it with lemonade so I donapost get as drunk but this time I was drinking it straight, I needed the wine because it was awful to look at my face. After scrubbing at my orange skin for  minutes I then went red, I looked like a sunset effect.

Peter Grundy, who is aged , says he cannot believe his daughter is squatting in his apartment and he has tried everything to get her to leave. But -year-old Katrina will not budge from the pad in Melbourne and does not pay rent, Peter tells A Current Affair.The New South Wales man told the News current affairs show that Katrina has made his le a living hell.Peter said: Iaposm sure it has taken the bit of youth I had left in me. His we Margaret died recently, and Peter wants to move from his countryside home in Denilliquin into a care home for the final years of his le. He is not entitled to a pension and needs the funds from a potential sale of his Melbourne apartment to afford the move and the costs of the care. He has to pay up front for the retirement village but says Katrina placed a caveat on the apartment without him knowing, which stops him being able to sell it. He told News: Very clever and very clever in legal terms - and solicitors and the barrister said - she is someone Iaposve never met the like of - she has an enormous capability to come up with things we never hear of. A judge has reportedly dismissed Katrinaaposs claim that her parents gted her the apartment eight years ago. Peter says he has now spent eight years and , pursuing the matter via ious legal means, as well as calculating that he has lost almost , in rent and has paid for body corporate fees and rates. Katrina claims her parents gted her the Melbourne property eight years ago, a fantasy thrown out by a judge.  A Current Affair features property lawyer Justin Lawrence, from law firm Henderson and Ball, who says Peter has pursued every mechanism the law allows in the Australian state of Victoria. Yet his daughter remains, something the lawyer says is an injustice. Yet she remains, and it seems every day she remains itaposs another day of injustice for him.

They failed in the play-offs last year, of course, but this year they got the right signing in Lawrence Shankland to win the title.“That made all the dference for them, scoring those goals, and they did get a wee bit steadier at the back.“Robbie would’ve known they’d have needed two or three players more for going up but I thought he’d still be there for the fight.“He’ll just have it all to do with Hearts again in that league.”As for who will lead the Terrors into the top flight, McAlpine says it’s anybody’s guess.Whether it’s Tommy Wright, Craig Levein or Lee McCulloch, the former goalie reckons they’ll have a job on their hands.LEE WILKIE: Craig Levein and Peter Houston could steady the ship for Dundee United\" title\"#LEE WILKIE: Craig Levein and Peter Houston could steady the ship for Dundee United# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp lee-wilkie-craig-levein-peter-houston-dundee-united embed # secretiNuOtGIDF\" data-secret\"iNuOtGIDF\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"However, McApline insists the club remain in a strong, attractive position for a new man coming in.“There’ll be plenty folk out of a job who’ll be desperate to take it,” he added.“With the crowds they can pull in they can have success. There’s a potential for , home fans at every game.“That’s a big attraction to a manager, having the big crowd behind them, because there’s not many places like that.“There’ll be a lot of CVs being sent through and, with Tommy being installed as favourite, I wouldn’t be surprised to see him end up at Tannadice.“I know they’d spoken to him before back in  but I’m not sure of the ins and outs of what they’re thinking now.“Anybody moving to United will be rubbing their hands because it’s an attractive job.“It will still be a tough ask but at least they’re in the right place in the Premiership.“It’s a struggle for half the teams in that league so they won’t be any worse off than most after a couple of signings.“They’ll need somebody up front to help Shankland, some pace and width and maybe another experienced defender.”He continued: “Somebody mentioned Craig Levein and Peter Houston to me but, obviously, with the new regime that’s come in at United, you just don’t know what they’d be thinking.“They were both at the club before, of course, and have that connection.“Craig’s been in and out of it with Hearts the last few years, had a spell as manager that didn’t work out and moved upstairs before it changed again.“Houstie has been coaching and scouting so he might fancy it but you never can tell.“Whoever they get has a hard job but at least they’re starting off in the right league.“The club will need to get their finger out to get somebody in, look over the squad and see where they need to strengthen and how much money they can spend.“That’s going to take time to get it sorted out so I think they’ll be wanting somebody in sooner rather than later.“Robbie has started them on a journey and what’s not to say a new manager won’t come in, have a look at them and push them on “He’ll like some of what he sees, might have dferent ideas about things but will it work  You just don’t know.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited.

We stayed with Margaret and Iain McDonald at their home named Meadowview in Tarbert which was located near the school.We all enjoyed the area so much that we continued to visit every year for the next consecutive eight years.Margaret invited me to go out on the herring boats once or twice. One was named Village Maid and the other Village Belle and, needless to say, we often had kippers for breakfast, which were very nice. I remember there was a boat called the Southern Cross tied up to Cock Island # can anyone tell me any history of it and when it disappeared There also used to be a smokehouse for kippers along from Tarbert to Ardrishaig.Another fond memory I have is watching the logging trucks unloading on the quay and watching them get loaded on to large boats and I think then being shipped round to Sweden or Finland. Is that correct or not as I thought there was a paper mill at Fort William As mentioned earlier, I joined North West Ambulance Service in the s and Margaret used to send me the Argyllshire Advertiser and in one of them was an advert for recruitment to the Scottish Ambulance Service.I duly got an application form from Paisley and was all but sending the form in when I realised it would be very unfair to move so far away from our young children#s grandparents and for them to be unable to see them growing up. At the time your local pharmacist was retiring and my we Sue was a qualied pharmacist, but our children were both under school age so relied on her parents for child care. Ironically, I believe the job was filled with a Blackpool pharmacist whom I had met ocassionally.My love for Scotland continued, and we had our honeymoon travelling around Scotland and calling in at Tarbert for several days on the trip round.Our last trip up there was  in June as a treat from our daughter who accompanied us on this trip. The weather was glorious, and one day we caught the bus to Skipness and walked part of the Kintyre Way back.Another day we took the MacBrayne Ferry to Islay, which was again a glorious day out, also visited Crinan, Lochgilphead and Inveraray, followed by a couple of days fishing off the pier in Tarbert. We travelled back via Portavadie and Dunoon, and have in the past used the ferry to Arran, then Brodick, Ardrossan and home.Thank you for taking the time to read this.

But the COVID- lockdown interrupted proceedings.This season’s Scottish Cup was a bit of a disappointment with Star exiting the competition in the second round after losing out to a vastly improved Dumbarton United side -. On the plus side, the first round saw Star take on Paisley League team Pollok FC and an excellent performance saw Star run out convincing winners -, one of only four defeats suffered by Pollok in all competitions.In the West Region Cup, Star progressed to the quarter-final again. A first round bye, a convincing - win against Cambuslang FA then a walkover saw the Lochgilphead youths face Paisley League A Division team Erskine.In a hard-fought encounter, Star matched Erskine for most of the game but with only  players available they couldn’t get the breakthrough they needed and eventually lost -.Star started their league campaign in September with a competitive match against new team Thorn, who transferred from Paisley A Division. Star lost -.Two strong performances in October saw Star record  a terric - win over Shettleston, last season’s league runners up, and a - win against St Patrick’s Sports Academy # an entertaining but nerve-wracking game.A mid-season stutter in November saw the Lochgilphead boys lose out to Cathcart -, then Clydebank -, both newcomers.The losing run continued into early December as Star faced last season’s champions Drumchapel Amateurs ending up down - at half-time before recovering their form with a committed second half display to pull it back to -. Unfortunately they lost out to a fourth Drumchapel goal as they chased the winner themselves.This set Star back on track as they finished the year with a hugely convincing performance, demolishing Cathcart -.January and February proved a real battle with the weather with wind, rain and freezing temperatures # often all three # only allowing four games to take place. Star secured fine victories over Busby, -, and Glasgow Red Star, -, and fought back to grind out creditable draws with Shettleston, -, and Place Park, another new team, -.Star played one league game in March before lockdown and again it was another entertaining game with a rollercoaster feel to it. Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"sheena shows the way as tarbert tees off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf started again at Glenralloch as lockdown measures were eased slightly across Scotland.The first members were on the tee at am on Friday May  for the re-opening, followed by a steady stream as the day went on.

It shows contempt for those in the NHS who have risked their lives to save others. It shows contempt for those who have died without their loved ones by their side. It shows contempt for all of us who have stuck by the rules to protect our lives and the lives of others.Boris Johnson has asked us to #move on# but this issue will not go away.

single dose, astudy in pigs has revealed.The ChAdOx nCoV-vaccine -developed by the University of Oxford - is currently undergoing human trials and it is hoped an effective vaccine could be ready later this year.Previous research indicated that macaques were protected against lung disease after a single immunisation.Now the Pirbright Institute, working with the University of Oxford, has shown that two doses of the Covid- vaccine might produce a greater immune response in pigs and therefore be a more effective approach to developing a protective response.What did the study find In the study, researchers saw a marked increase in neutralising antibodies, which bind to the virus in a way that blocks infection.It is not yet known what level of immune response will be required to protect humans against SARS-CoV- .Researchers said the finding in pigs is important as it suggests that two doses of the new vaccine could potentially give signicantly more protection in humans than a single dose.But they said further research in humans is required.What has Professor Bryan Charleston said Professor Bryan Charleston, director of the Pirbright Institute, said: ldquoThese results look encouraging that administering two injections with the same vaccine boosts antibody responses that can neutralise the virus, but it is the response in humans that is important.ldquoThe pig has proved to be a valuable model for testing human vaccines for other diseases to give an indication of the type of immune response induced and testing dferent doses.ldquoPigs are more physiologically similar to humans than some other animal models ndash for example, their body weight and metabolic rate ndash and are more accessible than studies using non-human primates.In the research, the pigs were split into two groups, with both receiving an initial dose of the vaccine, and one group receiving an identical booster immunisation on day  of the study.Latest developments are very encouragingProfessor Simon Graham, the lead author of the study, said: ldquoWhile it remains to be determined what immune responses are required to effectively protect people against Covid-, the demonstration that ChAdOx nCoV- induces both neutralising antibody and T cell responses is very encouraging.ldquoIt is likely that a combination of these responses would act in synergy to prevent and control infection, as we and others have recently shown in the context of experimental flu vaccines.What has the reaction been to this update Dr Stephen Grfin, associate professor in the school of medicine, University of Leeds, added: ldquoThe work done at Pirbright is an encouraging advance in support of the Oxford vaccine on three important fronts.,params: .pushldquoFirst, it has been conducted in a large animal model, namely pigs, which we know recapitulate human-like responses to influenza vaccines better than many other systems.ldquoSecond, it shows that a second dose of the vaccine, a so-called lsquoprime-boostrsquo strategy, gives rise to far better responses than a single inoculation, which might allay concerns arising from some of the earlier work on this and other spike-targeting vaccines.ldquoThird, it shows that the prime-boost strategy may well be achievable using the same vaccine rather than having to switch to an alternative  for the second dose, which could conceivably delay roll-out of the vaccination programme.ldquoWhilst these studies will need to be repeated within human subjects, and the precise nature and longevity of the responses might require further investigation, this is a heartening study that can be built upon and ideally followed by other potential vaccine s for SARS-CoV-."},{"url":null,"title":"staycation-five-scotlands-photogenic-places-visit-lockdown-eases","story":"WITH lockdown measures slowly beginning to ease and the coronavirus continuing to be

In this monthly column, she shares her wildle diary ndash and pictures!THE day I first visited Musselburgh was not one to write home about.I came to town to see the house I had already agreed to move in to. Most people would organise a viewing before deciding to move in however, since it was my fianceacutersquos childhood home, I had simply said YES!Our move-in date was already confirmed, meaning this visit was just a formality.Upon seeing the amount of work the house still needed as it underwent considerable renovation, my initial reaction was one of utter petrication that it would not be completed on time.The weather was not particularly favourable either. Drenched in the cold September rain, I had lost my appetite to explore the area, which now seemed grim and gloomy.By contrast, my second visit to Musselburgh is one worth remembering.I had come to check on the progress of the house and to join a group of birdwatchers for a stroll around the Esk and the lagoons.The walk started at the river mouth, from where we watched a couple of cormorants sunbathing.It was not long before someone raised the cry: ldquoA kingfisher!I promptly directed my camera to where everyone was looking, and I saw him: a beautul, bright blue kingfisher.After that sighting I knew my le would change.Moving to Musselburgh ended up being one of the best decisions I have made .Since that day I have been studying this wee bird.Every spare moment is spent at the river watching for our kingfisher.It has become my all-encompassing obsession.Each encounter teaches me something new and I never stop learning.This one bird inspired me in many ways, such as helping me understand the importance of fieldcraft in wildle photography, and allowed for some unforgettable captures.So, without further ado, let me formally introduce Mr KingfisherhellipThe kingfisher is an unmistakeable bird, with its metallic azure blue back and bright orange breast.The bird is usually glimpsed, a sudden flash of glistening blue, flitting at the riverbank.If you are luckyenough, the bird may comfortably land near you.Usually, despite its exotic colouration, the bird is dficult to spot sitting on a branch surrounded by foliage, a kingfisher successfully blends into the landscape.I have spent hours in the field and can still struggle to spot a perching kingfisher.When I locate a bird, I identy the sex by the birdrsquos beak: the malersquos is completely black, whilst the femalersquos is orange underneath.Kingfishers are territorial and they will hold their ground against other iniduals.Breeding season is the only time when the male and female tolerate each other and share territory.The choice of feeding ground is extremely important as the bird is dependent on it all year round.Each area covers at least km of slow-flowing fresh water or lake, but this may extend anywhere up to km.The resident male I have been watching for almost three years exhibits slight migratory behaviour it travels upstream during the breeding season, whilst it spends the winter months near the river mouth. For its fishing ground, a kingfisher will often choose a shallow pool in the river bend.They are not titled ldquoking fishers for nothing and are experts in this field.Before ing, they sit patiently on a perch, bobbing their head back and forth to assess the exact position of a fish.Once it has spotted a fish, it es headfirst at speeds up to mph.The kingfisher enters the water with beak half open and eyes protected by its third, transparent eyelid.A split second later, the bird emerges, beak first, and flies back to the perch.Here, it twirls the fish so that it may be held by the tail, proceeding to bash it against the perch to kill it and break the spine, making it easier to swallow.If you have a favourite animal you would like me to feature next month, or are looking for advice on how to spot and photograph a kingfisher, contact me through my website or social media channels.

But the journey became more than I anticipated, and gave me a new angle on Einsteinrsquos theory of relativity.To reach the island I went on a cycle with my good friend Gareth. He is a keen cyclist, and in my early days I was too. I literally cycled hundreds of miles a week. It gave me freedom and a sense of adventure.Over the last couple of decades my cycling adventures have signicantly declined. Those long adventurous rides I used to go on, well they have been a thing of the past, especially after my beloved bike was stolen years ago.But then, during the lockdown, my wee daughter Skye decided she wanted to learn to cycle, and with gritty determination she did so, magically on the same path in the Greenhills at Prestonpans where I learnt so many years before.So another friend very kindly leant me a bike and I was able to accompany my daughter around the then quiet streets of our town as she developed her confidence.I enjoyed this, and it was good exercise, but it began to give me itchy feet and a nostalgic longing to re-experience some of the joys of my youth and head off onto the open road and go exploring on two wheels under my own steam.So when Gareth suggested we go for a ldquovery short cycle ride to visit Green Craig island that I had heard so much about, I gladly accepted.The destination was just beyond the big gates of Gosford House in total just under five miles away. And, of course, the road follows the coast, so no horrible hills to climb.So I set off, with my children waving at me asI was going to war, and met Gareth outside Cockenzie House as arranged.It was from here I became increasingly aware of the depreciation my body has suffered since my last long cycle.The road was, as far as I could ascertain, flat.There was a very slight breeze on my face to cool me, so in theory it was perfect cycling conditions.But something was wrong I was very quickly puffing and panting as I tried to keep up with my friend, who was coasting effortlessly in front of me.I could feel my face turning red and an old lady walking her small dog looked up and gave me a sympathetic glance as I passed her.I was cycling faster than she was walking but not by much.Then another cyclist passed me, at what seemed to be close to the speed of light, at least compared to the pathetic speed I was travelling.It was at this moment I noticed Gareth was well ahead of me, and talking to himself, as he believed I was still just behind him.So I called out, ldquoGareth, slow down a wee bit! He waited for me to catch up.ldquoSorry, I said, ldquofeel free to cycle ahead but I will have to go slower.ldquoYou want to go ahead  he asked.ldquoNo, I said, ldquo we do that we may be in danger of falling over due to lack of velocity!And so we headed out of town.My comment about velocity had put me in mind of Einsteinrsquos theory of relativity that speed is not absolute and objects move at a speed relative to one another, and that this affects the passage of time.My time was most certainly being slowed down. Never had that short journey felt so long.I discovered small hills I had driven over but never noticed. I became acutely aware of the power of gravity, and I lost count of how many stops I needed before we finally arrived at our destination.But what elation when we did arrive: I was shocked on one hand at just how unfit I was, but on the other I had a sense of achievement.We locked our bikes and headed along the coast to the island. The tide was out which meant we could reach it without getting our feet wet.Gareth was keen to find a trig pole which he had discovered was on the wee island. It was used by early map makers but we didnrsquot find it.We sat on a log, and Gareth offered me a cup of tea from his flask. Hersquod bought an extra cup, and we sat there, two metres apart on an old log looking out to sea, talking. It was the best cup of tea I can remember in a long time.The island isnrsquot much in itself, more like a tuft of land or gloried sandbank, just beyond the coast.But itrsquos the location and what you can see from it which makes it special, both in terms of wildle and landscape. And history too is all around.The sea comes in fast at this point and it was soon moving in a pincer motion, enveloping the wee tuft of land to make it an island once again.Itrsquos that which perhaps excites the childhood imagination in us, beating the tide before being marooned or maybe being marooned could be the best bit!But we left just in time. The sea lapped at our feet as we walked past the huge concrete blocks from wartime and we discussed the goings on in the world.As we reached our bikes I noticed some dens made by previous visitors.Impressive constructions, showing perhaps that the lockdown for many of us has given us an opportunity to explore and discover our own area in ways perhaps we never did before.Then we set off home. The journey back gave me a new phenomena to contemplate that a road can feel uphill both ways when you are an unfit, overweight man on a bicycle.Gareth insisted on cycling with me all the way home, you know, just in case.But I made it, and got a kind reception from my kids who asked me, ldquoWhere have you been all this time, you must have gone really far Well in one way I had. Not in terms of actual physical distance perhaps, but certainly in terms of having an unexpected and unforgettable adventure with a kind and understanding friend."},{"url":null,"title":"former-mens-club-become-four-flats","story":"East Lothian Council has given the green light to East Lothian Propertyrsquos plans to transform  Sidegate.The former Haddington Recreation Club closed its doors in the early s and will now become home to a ground-floor office and four flats.The three-storey property is currently used as bedsit accommodation.One member of the public objected to the proposals on grounds including road safety, the likelihood that ldquothe use of the building to accommodate an office and four flats will lead to a large number of cars parking on street at this potentially dangerous spot and that the proposals ldquodo not accommodate any dedicated off-street parking, the consequence of which would result in cars being parked on the narrow road outside the building which would result in dficulties for other road users and would create a road safety hazard.Despite the objections, the plans were given the go ahead, with the planning officer noting that colleagues in the roads services department raised ldquono objection to the plans.Billiards, draughts and table tennis were all played by male members of Haddington Recreation Club before it closed.

we knew that losing your sense of smellwas a signicant symptom of the disease.Now, after months of reports, both anecdotal and more rigorous clinical findings, we think we have a model for how this virus may cause smell loss.One of the most common causes of smell loss is a viral infection, such as the common cold, sinus or other upper respiratory tract infections.Those coronaviruses that donrsquot cause deadly diseases, such as COVID-, Sars and Mers, are one of the causes of the common cold and have been known to cause smell loss.In most of these cases, sense of smell s when symptoms clear, as smell loss is simply the result of a blocked nose, which prevents aroma molecules reaching olfactory receptors in the nose. In some cases, smell loss can persist for months and years.For the novel coronavirus , however, the pattern of smell loss is dferent. Many people with COVID- reported a sudden loss of sense of smell and then a sudden and fullto a normal sense of smell in a week or two.Interestingly, many of these people said their nose was clear, so smell loss cannot be attributed to a blocked nose.For others, smell loss was prolonged and several weeks later they still had no sense of smell. Any theory of anosmia in COVID- has to account for both of these patterns.This suddenof a normal sense of smell suggests an obstructive smell loss in which the aroma molecules cannot reach the receptors in the nose .Now that we have CT scans of the noses and sinuses of people with COVID- smell loss, we can see that the part of the nose that does the smelling, the olfactory cleft, is blocked with swollen soft tissue and mucus ndash known as a cleft syndrome.The rest of the nose and sinuses look normal and patients have no problem breathing through their nose.We know that the way SARS-CoV- infects the body is by attaching to ACE receptors on the surface of cells that line the upper respiratory tract.A protein called TMPRSS then helps the virus invade the cell. Once inside the cell, the virus can replicate, triggering the immune systemrsquos inflammatory response. This is the starting point for the havoc and destruction that this virus causes once in the body.Initially, we thought that the virus might be infecting and destroying the olfactory neurons.These are the cells that transmit the signal from the aroma molecule in your nose to the area in the brain where these signals get interpreted as ldquosmell.However, an international collaboration showed recently that the ACE proteins the virus needs to invade the cells were not found on the olfactory neurons.But they were found on cells called ldquosustentacular cells, which support the olfactory neurons.We expect that these support cells are likely to be the ones that are damaged by the virus, and the immune response would cause swelling of the area but leave the olfactory neurons intact.When the immune system has dealt with the virus, the swelling subsides and the aroma molecules have a clear route to their undamaged receptors and the sense of smell s to normal.So why does smell notin some cases This is more theoretical but follows from what we know about inflammation in other systems.Inflammation is the bodyrsquos response to damage and results in the release of chemicals that destroy the tissues involved.When this inflammation is severe, other nearby cells start to be damaged or destroyed by this ldquosplash damage. We believe that accounts for the second stage, where the olfactory neurons are damaged.Recovery of smell is much slower because the olfactory neurons need time to regenerate from the supply of stem cells within the lining of the nose.Initial recovery is often associated with distortion of the sense of smell known as parosmia, where things donrsquot smell like they used to.For many parosmics, for instance, the smell of coffee is often described as burnt, chemical, dirty and reminiscent of sewage.Physiotherapy for the noseOlfaction has been called the Cinderella of the senses because of its neglect by scientic research.But it has come to the forefront in this pandemic. The silver lining is that we will learn a lot about how viruses are involved in smell loss from this. But what hope is there for people with a loss of smell now The good news is that the olfactory neurons can regenerate. Theyrsquore regrowing in almost all of us, all of the time. We can harness that regeneration and guide it with ldquophysiotherapy for the nose: smell training."},{"url":null,"title":"headteacher-praised-leadership-style","story":"North Berwick High Schools head Lauren Rodgerwas described by Education Scotland inspectors as having a clear direction and being well respected.However while the inspection, carried out in February,praised the staff and leadership at the school and achievements of its senior students, it pointed to improvements required to enable more S-S pupils to learn a foreign language.The report called for more work to be done to ensure all younger students received their full entitlement to Broad General Educationin the first three years at the school.In particular it stated: \"Currently, a few young people are not experiencing a modern language until the end of S.\"Inaddition, the current arrangement is not sufficient for young people to receive their entitlementto a meaningful experience of a third language.\"Inspectors urged the school to ensure the focus was on ensuring younger pupils received full access to experiences across the curriculum and did not allow a focus on reaching exam levels to impact on them.The inspectors said: \"Teachers should ensure that learning at Sacross all curriculum areas remains focused on the experiences and outcomes of CfEanddoes not prioritise the requirements of National Qualications .\"Senior and middle leadersshould ensure that learning experiences in S provide those young people specialising atfourth level with appropriate depth in their learning to provide successful progression to thesenior phase.\"Inspectors visited the school in February  and assessed the schoolrsquos performance across four key indicators: leadership of change learning, teaching and assessment raising attainment and achievement and ensuring wellbeing, equality and inclusion.The school was evaluated as lsquovery goodrsquo in the first three categories and lsquogoodrsquo in the fourth.Headteacher Lauren Rodgerrsquos leadership style was described as ldquocharacterised by openness and by trust, promoting empowerment in a supportive ethos.

It can also cause confusion and cloud judgement. Sometimes the user can see or hear things that arenrsquot real.ldquoThe risks include it preventing the ability to breathe and, in extreme cases, death.ldquoIt can cause the heart rate to beat irregularly, increasing the risk of heart failure and heavy use has been linked to vitamin B deficiency which can cause nerve damage.ldquoAs well as these, the user can become confused and panicky which may lead to accidents.The gas is not illegal and can be bought widely online and is used by dentists and medical professionals to sedate patients for minor medical procedures.The officer stressed it was ldquonot something we want our children and young people experimenting with.A spokesperson for Midlothian and East Lothian Drugs and Alcohol Partnershipsaid: ldquoWe would like to remind the public that laughing gas might sound fun, but the risks are not.ldquoNitrous oxide slows down messages between the brain and body.ldquoNegative effects can include dizziness, headaches or fainting and dficulty in your ability to breathe.ldquoIt can also cause confusion and clouded judgement.ldquoThis may put you at higher risk of accidents.ldquoIt is best to avoid using nitrous oxide,

to contact MYPAS who provide a friendly, confidential and nonjudgemental drug and alcohol support for young people in East Lothian and Midlothian.Sharon Saunders, head of communities and partnerships at East Lothian Council, said: ldquoWe have had reports of the misuse of these canisters from a number of council services including Safer Communities, Countryside Rangers and MELDAP and, as leaders of services for children and young people, we are all concerned that people know of this developing trend and the signicant risks associated with use of these canisters.ldquoUsing these canisters poses signicant health concerns as itrsquos a harmful and potentially lethal substance and itrsquos important that young people and their families are aware of the real and signicant health risks associated with using these canisters.Kenny MacAskill, East Lothianrsquos MP, and Iain Gray, the countyrsquos MSP, backed plans for a multi-agency meeting to tackle the issue.Mr MacAskill said: ldquoOne of the main problems in this case is one of supply.ldquoThe substance can feel quite easy to get hold of, but this is absolutely no indicator that it is safe.ldquoIt is extremely dangerous, especially for those with undiagnosed or asymptomatic illnesses.ldquoYoung people who are abusing it are taking huge risks themselves and for their friends as well.ldquoOne of the problems is that there are legitimate uses for the capsules, especially in the catering industry.ldquoThere needs to be a well-rounded approach to tackling this latest trend, involving education, support from the police and responsible vendors.Mr Gray was similarly keen to see the issue tackled and encouraged anyone with information to contact the police.He said: ldquoThere have been widespread reports of large numbers of these discarded canisters being found in areas across the UK over recent weeks.ldquoThe fact that so many were found in one place here suggests that this is also a problem locally and one that will undoubtedly be of concern to parents.ldquoIrsquom pleased to see that a multiagency response is being pursued to help tackle the issue, and would certainly echo what has been said about parents discussing the potential risks with their children and reporting any relevant information to the police.Ch Insp Mitchell urged parents, writing in his Courier column: ldquoPlease do all you

He also contributed music features to The Herald, was a presenter with the BBC, wrote for the Edinburgh Evening News, The Scotsman and Scotland on Sunday, and also worked at the radio station, Scot FM, in the s.Between  and , he was a member of this papers reviewing team at the Edinburgh Festivals, covering Fringe comedy with a keen eye for new talent as well as incisive criticism of established acts, and making recommendations for the Herald Angel awards. In the fetid atmosphere of the capital in August, he took a delight in not being swayed by publicity hype, and recognising acts with the promise of a sustained career.Colin Somerville was born in Comrie, Perthshire, in October , to William and Jacqueline, who ran a local hair salon. He was educated at Christrsquos Hospital in Horsham, West Sussex , and from a young age he decided to become a journalist. He was writing concert reviews for an Edinburgh newspaper at  and, like hundreds of hopefuls before and since, went to study journalism, at Napier College, in Edinburgh.In  he started working as a trainee news reporter at Radio Forth. At one point he was invited to take over a local music show, which he eventually made his own. The music coverage was steadily expanded one of the new shows, Forth Street, was originally presented by Somerville with Muriel Gray. He also become the stationrsquos music controller.He interviewed many celebrities during his time at Forth, among them August Darnell, otherwise known as Kid Creole. The pair of them once went into the well-known Edinburgh pub, Matherrsquos, with Darnell resplendent in a full zoot-suit, says Neil Cooper, an arts writer on The Herald.Adds Cooper: ldquoColin was a mighty broadcaster and writer, whose musical antennae was genius. He got me into the Edinburgh Evening News to do theatre reviews in the late s when he was running the arts and entertainments page, and became a mate who got me into more scrapes than I can remember.ldquoHe was wonderfully deadpan, witheringly cynical and glorious company, with a story about anyone and everyone. He taught me a ton. Listening to war stories of Edinburghrsquos music scene in the s, or  ear-wigging in on him doing a phone interview with someone, was an education.For the Herald Somerville wrote album reviews and music features, his knowledge and his passion on full display, and he also reviewed comedy shows at the Edinburgh Fringe.David Belcher, formerly a rock and pop music writer on the Herald, says: ldquoHe was enormously knowledgeable about music and comedy, and about most things. He was very wise and enthusiastic, and great fun to be around. He recalls going to Moscow for a weekend on a promotional trip, along with Somerville and a planeload of other journalists, to see the Scottish band, Big Country.ldquoI would meet him periodically at ious events, and he was the calm man at the centre of any storm that might be going on, for example when you were trying to get your name on a guest-list or retrieve your guest-list tickets.Somerville, who had a golden retriever named Iggy, after the colourful rock singer, Iggy Pop, was an enthusiastic reader of such writers as Hunter S. Thompson, Iain Banks and Ian Rankin he loved cooking but was ldquorubbish at DIY, says his son, Joe, who adds, ldquoHe was very interested in people and their stories. He passed on his love of sport to Joersquos brother, Jake, and his love of music and comedy to Joe and his sister, Rachel. Before his untimely death he was able to meet his granddaughter, Norah, who is now  months.Colin, who was twice married, contracted early-onset dementia several years ago, was being cared for at Manor Grange Care Home, Edinburgh. Recently it was reported that Fe College is planning to create a scholarship for new and emerging radio talent in his memory.Dougi McMillan, director of the Faculty of Creative Industries at the college, described Colin as ldquovery well respected, knowledgeable and connected throughout broadcasting, publishing ...the radio students and his colleagues alike adored him, all his le stories, anecdotes and laughter."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-must-strive-ensure-new-normal-entails-fairer-safer-society","story":"ldquoNormal is most certainly not a state to which so many in our society and globally, for instance the children in pre-pandemic poverty and their families, would wish to .What the ldquonew normal will be for them depends on us, the privileged ones.

This involves welfare, becoming a statistic for the first time, trusting and hoping the place of last resort, that of social security, will be there in the hour of need.Applying for welfare is a very daunting experience and for many it is alien, because for most who join the workforce, there is no need to familiarise oneself with the ins and outs of the welfare system, that is for others. So this will be a whole new chapter and one that will be daunting.The current system of welfare involves applying for Universal Credit and your article highlighting the research by Bath and Oxford Universitiescertainly exposed the downfalls of this system. It pointed to an unfair and thoughtless system of payments, and ndash confirming what opposition MPrsquos have been telling the Government for years ndash the view that Universal Credit should be reviewed, even replaced, with immediate effect. Perhaps two million new applications for Universal Credit, consequences of Covid-, will once and for all expose the shortfalls of this system to a Government at Westminster who must tackle this sector of the economy going forward.Catriona C Clark, Falkirk."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-whole-truth-potatoes","story":"May I offer a solution Mr Gowie  Stop peeling your tatties, I have not peeled a potato, whether for boiling, baking, mashing, frying or soup, for more years than I can remember.

The First Minister insists she is putting safety first.Scotland will not be following the ldquoreckless relaxation of lockdown pursued by heartless English Tories, who are only interested in the bottom line. Such at least is the political message the Scottish government hopes to convey.In reality, itrsquos not entirely clear what is happening in Scotland about social distancing. Jason Leitch, the National Clinical Director, told BBC Radio yesterday that he expected the two metre rule to be relaxed very soon.:Scotlands two-metre social distancing rule will change, according to Jason LeitchAnd John Swinney later announced that he is aiming for schools to go back to full time teaching on th August, which also suggests lockdown is not long for this world. The Labour MSP Iain Gray called this the ldquomother and father of ministerial climb-downs.Only last week Mr Swinney had been talking about a year of ldquoblended learning and no exams. This was under his assumption that the two metre rule would be still be adhered to over the summer and into the next school year.His u-turn may also be a broad wink to the hospitality industry that Scotland will be following England in the not too distant future. They should plan for a one metre rule and not give up the ghost.Letrsquos hope they get the message, because only % of pubs and % of restaurants say they can survive with two metre social distancing, according to the Scottish Tourism Alliance.Ms Sturgeon says she is no longer bothered about the R number ndash the infection rate that she said last month was her guiding policy. The number of infections is now so small that R is largely meaningless.So,the disease is disappearing fast, and the infection rate is irrelevant, why is Scotland sticking with the two-metre rule at all  Are we following the science or not Nicola Sturgeon suggested yesterday that the scientic advice from SAGE may not entirely concur with Boris Johnsonrsquos decision yesterday to liberate the nation from its Covid ldquohibernation.The former government Chief Scientic Adviser, Sir David King, chair of the ldquoindependent SAGE group, is pretty sure that the official SAGE scientists are not on side. He says it is ldquofar too soon to ease the two-metre rule and that this will increase infections and lead to more deaths.However, the science isnrsquot exactly rock solid on two metres. The World Health Organisation, which government critics often claim is a better advice-giver than SAGE, suggests a one metre rule is safe. WHO says that the risk of catching the disease falls by % over that distance.China, Denmark and more importantly our nearest neighbour France are also in the one metre camp.There is evidence that risk falls by at least a further %you are standing two metres distant. But the risk of transmission depends on many factors: distance is only a part of it. Wearing masks, for example, almost certainly makes one metre equivalent to two. Outdoors, there seems little dference between one and two metres, and even indoors itrsquos no guarantee of immunity.A study cited by the BBC from the Chinese city of Guangzhou, looked at a cluster of infections in a restaurant which was using the one metre rule. Half of the people who came down with the disease were discovered to have been sitting more than two metres away from the primary source of the infection.:Sturgeon prepares to accelerate Scotlands exit from lockdown - but two-metre rule stays for nowAir flow and ventilation seem to be a big factor. Bad ventilation can super spread this virus. On the other hand, sophisticated air conditioning, such as on aircraft with HEPA filters, might actually suppress Covid , especiallypassengers are wearing masks.Theof time you are in contact with a person with Covid- also seems to be a major factor. Just donrsquot hang around, is the message. Indeed, wersquore told thatyou want to hold a conversation with someone you should really stand back to back.

There is just too much going on to make this into an inviolable rule ndash like the R number which politicians obsessed about until recently.This at any rate is the view of the UK government. Boris Johnson believes that the costs of relaxing the two-metre rule are far outweighed by the likely costs of not relaxing it. This isnrsquot just a financial calculus ndash putting profits before health.Not allowing the schools toto anything resembling normality is likely to have a signicant impact on the long term health and wellbeing of young people. Similarly, not opening bars, restaurants and leisure activities means depriving many more young people of jobs and security ndash major factors in mental health.It is simply not possible to conduct anything resembling normal le with a two metre rule. Public transport becomes unmanageable, tourism is undermined, shops and offices stay closed. We are a gregarious species and trying to keep two metres away from our fellow man and woman is extraordinarily dficult.Children are not observing anything like a two metre rule in parks and gardens, as is only too obvious. It seems absurd therefore that they should be prevented from attending well managed and clean schools where the risk will be very much less.:CMO warnshealthboards not to assume Covid antibodies provide immunityMany parents were outraged at Mr Swinneyrsquos ldquoblended learning plans, with some pupils getting as little as a day of teaching per week.

Flagging up the statement Nicola Sturgeon made yesterday, the PM gazed into his crystal ball and predicted it would be ldquouncannily similar to the one that Irsquove just given.He was right, to some extent. The beer gardens of Scotland shall, like those in England, open. Hairdressers will snip, friends and family will meet indoors, cinemas will screen films. While the FM did not go as far as Mr Johnson in lting the two metre rule, that looks likely to follow next week. Between this and the U-turn on schools, the pace of change is positively dizzying. It is like going on an extended ride on the waltzers.:PM takes a swipe at Sturgeon for uncannily similar briefingsEngland, under Mr Johnsonrsquos plan, will go further and faster. If anyone doubts how nakedly populist the PM is being, just take a look at the date for the easing of lockdown to begin ndash July , Independence Day in the US. When it comes to Scotland, independence remains a four letter word. Otherwise, Downing Street is delighted to celebrate the concept.But here we are, getting ahead of ourselves. As the Prime Minister made clear, the virus is still out there, andit becomes clear that there is a surge in new cases lockdown restrictions could be reimposed.Really, Mr Johnson, who do you think you are kidding  Now that people are only too aware of how miserable le in lockdown can be, it would take a brave and uniquely gted premier to persuade the public back into that jail cell, and we know Mr Johnson is neither.He is acting quickly because of the economic catastrophe we, and the rest of the world, are facing. And to please his own backbenchers and party backers, of course. One might have a sneaking admiration for himhe came straight out and admitted to the latter, instead of trying to convince us that he is acting according to a well-thought out plan. If the strategy was that oven-ready, businesses in England would not have been hammering on Downing Streetrsquos door on Tuesday seeking clarication.As the PM spoke at what was to be the last daily briefing, Chris Whitty, Englandrsquos chief medical officer, and Sir Patrick Vallance, chief scientic adviser, displayed obvious caution. When it came to the relaxation of the two metre rule they did not so much socially distance themselves from Mr Johnson as figuratively pick up their podiums and move to a neighbouring county. Professor Whittyrsquos assessment was frank. ldquoIf people donrsquot take the mitigation seriously,people hear a distorted version of whatrsquos being said that says lsquoThis is all fine, itrsquos gone away,rsquo yes we will get an uptick ndash for sure.He is not the only one concerned. A letter to the British Medical Journal, signed by the leaders of all the major medical and nursing bodies, warned that ldquothe available evidence indicates that local flare-ups are increasingly likely and a second wave a real risk. We know the truth of that already from the experiences of Germany and South Korea, two countries massively more successful than the UK in dealing with the pandemic.The letter urged the UK Government to look at how well prepared the country is for a second wave. That warning must be heeded. Much has been made by Governments across the UK of how they have been dealing with unprecedented and fast-moving events that they could not have seen coming.That was always debatable . As the virus spread from China to mainland Europe it was plain what was needed and what worked. Yet the lockdown came too slowly and the testing strategy was abandoned too quickly. Being unprepared for a second wave will be inexcusable, and that goes for Edinburgh as much as London, Belfast and Cardf.It is fear of a second wave that has been cited as the reason for Nicola Sturgeonrsquos more hesitant approach to easing the lockdown. The FM has indeed played cautious cop to Mr Johnsonrsquos all-over-the-shop cop, the Juliet Bravo to his Jack Regan of The Sweeney.Both have made mistakes. There has been too much hiding behind the skirts of science instead of taking the lead. Too many pronouncements made from podiums instead of finding out what it has really been like living in lockdown.:Guy Stenhouse:  Comparing Boris Johnson and Nicola Sturgeon is an interesting exerciseThat is why there was such anger over the travels of Catherine Calderwood and Dominic Cummings. It is also why the policy of blended learning was never going to survive contact with reality.From the start of this crisis people have wanted to be treated like grown ups. Edinburgh and London are finally catching up with that. There needs to be more straight talking about the risks and dangers that lie ahead. Key to charting a way through them, and getting ahead of a second wave, is a fully ing system to test, track and isolate. Let us not take our eye off that prize.Mr Johnson has more need for candour than the First Minister. Of the two, she has been the more forthright and credible. As such, only the wilder elements in her party would even think of calling for her to gothere is a second wave that could have been prevented.You can bet your last mask, however, that should the worst happen in England the Conservatives will dump Mr Johnson. They have never really warmed to him and they certainly do not trust him. He was sufficiently appealing to a large enough swathe of the electorate in England to win a General Election and save their seats, and that was what mattered to them.Then the virus arrived and showed that they had been right all along about his weaknesses. He was lazy, ill-prepared, and indecisive. A follower when a leader was needed.If there is one thing on which all sides can agree is that in time there must be an inquiry into the handling of this crisis. How much easier for Mr Johnsonrsquos partythey could blame their mistakes on someone who had departed for the backbenches.

If you were looking for an archetypal hard-bitten tabloid hack who embodied the highs and lows of the trade, then Iain Calder was your man.The former Daily Record reporter was something of a star in Scandalous! The Tabloid that Changed America, a look at the rise and plummet of the National Enquirer. Cynical, sharp, bursting with stories ndash had you requested him from central casting you would have sent him back for being too much of a cliche.But that was the Enquirer, according to this superb Storyville documentary: always too much for its own good.Mark Landsmanrsquos -minute film swung between two attitudes to the paper and what it had brought to journalism.The first, typied by Carl Bernstein, was censorious. The Enquirer should be looked at in the realm of popular culture rather than journalism, snfed the Watergate warrior by way of an introduction.But then the story of its origins and early operations began and the film was off to the races, half awed by the tale and more than a little amused.Bought in the s with mob money , the title was owned outright by Generoso Pope Junior, the son of an Italian newspaperman. Legend has it that ldquoGene was driving along a highway when he saw people rubbernecking an accident. The Enquirer had found the first of its specialisms: gore porn. Circulation went up to one million but Pope wanted  million. To do that the paper had to go where readers went, into the supermarkets. Out went the gore and in came celebrity news, gossip, dogs, medical oddities, psychics, UFOs and general wackadoodle doo. Stories were to be ldquoexploded, sensationalised, and for that Pope needed the best, some might say worst, in the business: Fleet and McFleet Streetrsquos finest.Calder led the exodus. By age  he had worked on the Falkirk Sentinel, the Stirling Journal, Falkirk Mail, and the Daily Record . Unable to find the skills and attitude he wanted among the American media, Calder recruited from home. It was a second colonisation of America, and the locals reacted about as well as they did the last time the Brits came.The main change ushered in by the Enquirer was that it paid for information. From this, the film argued, the rot set in. Irsquom not sure American journalism was always that holier than thou hitherto, but the Enquirer certainly encouraged others to follow its methods and madness. Why  Because it was phenomenally successful. The edition with a photo of Elvis in his coffin sold seven million.Some scandals were filed away, as when a female reporter found out about Bill Cosbyrsquos many infidelities. Calder spiked the story to get softer interviews from the star. ldquoI was making trades that would make our readers happier, said Calder today.For a time, where the Enquirer led the mainstream media followed, particularly on OJ Simpson.But when it got it wrong it got it dreadfully wrong, as when the paper ran a picture of Dianathe day before the Princess died in Paris. From there it was a quick slide into further infamy. And then The Donald showed up. The paper, under new ownership, began to ldquocatch and kill stories, a lot of them unfavourable to candidate Trump as he became. The cover up, says Bernstein, was the ldquoultimate corruption.Terric use of archive, a dream cast of talking heads, and a solid, clear narrative made Scandalous this weekrsquos must see documentary.The Enquirer would not touch The Great British Sewing Bee with a metre stick. The reality show, which reached its final last night, has been far too nice to attract tabloid attention. Why, these contestants even helped each other outthere was a problem.While it was short on anything approaching real drama, the GBSB had enough going for it in genial host Joe Lycett, a worthy winner in s enthusiast Dr Clare, and judges, Esme Young and Patrick Grant, who knew their stuff.

Current evidence supports the two-metre guidance in many locations, occupations and industries because of airborne as well as large droplet transmission. Past research underestimates viral airborne risks. Evidence from clusters supports more caution. The R rate is still not low enough across the UK for change but it is as low as it is partly because of the two-metre distancing.There is also still limited evidence to support a reduction below two metres and the latest WHO-funded study on one and two metres is not conclusive and has been attacked as inadequate. Yet even that acknowledges two metres is more protective than one.Current evidence supports the general importance of the combined use of social distancing, use of masks and other PPE and handwashing, not removing or reducing parts of this strategy. There must also be continued employment, wage protection and suspension of punitive sickness absence and performance management system, to encourage safe practices including self-isolation.We have not yet seen the review that the Prime Minister apparently used to make his decision.

We aim to change that.ldquoVisitors... are inclined to go to the Museum of Scottish Lighthouses and the Heritage Centre then carry on along the coast. We think the memorial garden will be enough of a distinctive attraction that people will stop in the town centre as well.Born in June , Glover spent the first six years of his le in Fraserburgh, at that time a rapidly expanding fishing and trading port.Upon leaving school in , he took a job as a shipping clerk with the Jardine Matheson trading company, later joining its Far Eastern operation and accepting a posting to Shanghai.There he sold opium to middlemen and traded in silks, tea and guns before relocating to Nagasaki as the old order disintegrated.He was a key figure in the Mitsubishi conglomeratersquos early growth, building links with Scottish shipyards and playing an instrumental role in bringing students to universities north of the Border.Echoing his achievements, proposals for the Fraserburgh memorial envisage a courtyard garden which will double as a community and interpretation space offering information about Gloverrsquos role in the creation of modern Japan.A monument and pine tree inspired by his famous Nagasaki garden, which he named ldquoIpponmatsua , are also planned, while low, evergreen ground-cover will reference the ldquomossy mounds characteristic of traditional Japanese horticulture.The memorial, designed with the help of RankinFraser Landscape Architects, is one of a range of projects being taken forward as part of a pound. million investment in the new Fraserburgh Central Conservation Area over a five-year period to March .ldquoThe wider regeneration project is very signicant because Fraserburgh, certainly over a long period, had become quite run down, said Ms Simpson.ldquoWhat we still have of Glover is the place he knew as a child and there are a great many buildings in the town that were part of the place when he lived there.ldquoWe are using modern conservation principles to make it quite clear where design is fresh and modern.

Many other parents worried schools might not be safe enough for .Teachers busied themselves getting their classrooms ready for social distancing.

Only a fool would think that this country ndash along with many other nations which have handled coronavirus much more successfully ndash isnrsquot heading for a second wave.

So, itrsquos little wonder that teachers are angry with the SNP.The SNPrsquos dithering, confused messaging on education appears simply cruel when it comes to teachers, parents and children.But the most repellent aspect of the whole fiasco is the crowing and gloating and politicking by our MSPs and their party apparatchiks. Once Swinney switched from the blended model to a straightforwardto school, opposition MSPs were up on their hind legs bragging about a \"u-turn\". They had won. The SNP had been humiliated.The SNP, of course, said it wasnrsquot a u-turn. The blended model remained as a contingency planthe infection worsened. There were caveats, the nationalists said, so therersquod been no volte faceHerersquos the truth: it was a u-turn ndash but nobody cares. The SNP did cave in to pressure from parents and opposition parties, and wersquoll all have to wait and seethat capitulation was safe and sensible. To claim this isnrsquot a u-turn is to reinvent the concept of geometry, and political language.However, outside the incestuous bubble of Holyrood no-one gives a damn. Parents care about their children. Teachers care about their safety and their pupils. Who would spare even a thought to the pride and ego of the political class And this is what sickens most of all. Our politicians think that moving the debate from the future of our childrenrsquos education to the issue of whether they got a political win out of this or not is acceptable. It shows how deeply these people are out of touch with the rest of us.Party politics in inimical to the interests of the people. Political parties take a position, their rivals take the opposite position, and they dig in. It doesnrsquot matter whatrsquos good for us. Like generals in the First World War, they draw their lines and the casualties are the little people, the rank and file.The only issue that matters is that our children get a good education, that parents feel their children are safe and prospering, and that teachers feel protected at work. Thatrsquos all we should care about. Politics should be inconsequential.Parents, teachers and, most of all, children are being failed by our political class.

Right across the game, people are making assumptions about what football is and what masculinity is and how the two interact and gay men are picking it up from a very early age.Take the players first. Thomas Beattie says that when he signed as a youth professional with Hull, the senior players took him to a strip club as an initiation. The other players assumed Thomas would enjoy a strip club they had assumed he was heterosexual. He also says he heard gay slurs in the changing room, although he doesnrsquot think the players were being malicious ndash they were saying it because they assumed there was no one in the room to be hurt or offended.Management is also a problem. Thomas says therersquos still an assumption that a gay player would disrupt the team, in the same way that the British Army used to assume a gay soldier would lead to the army losing wars because it was too gay. Thomas also believes that, because society generally is getting better, managers assume homophobia isnrsquot an issue in football either and therefore do nothing.Then therersquos the fans. Can we be confident thatThomas had stayed on at Kilmarnock or Hull or any other team and had come out as gay that he wouldnrsquot have faced abuse from the fans  Thomas says he felt like society was telling him the world of being gay and being a footballer were enemies andyoursquore a football fan, it might be worth asking yourself what assumptions you make. Have you ever thought, for example, thata man is gay he probably canrsquot kick a ball All of these assumptions played their part in making Thomas unhappy and, although they donrsquot necessarily translate into outright abuse, they do the job just as well. You canrsquot be gay and a footballer. Being gay will be bad for the team. Yoursquore a footballer therefore you love the ladies.The solution is for everyone in the game to check their assumptions. Thomas puts it this way: be conscious of the environment yoursquore creating and whether it lets everyone feel included. When a new player joins the team, do not assume theyrsquore straight. Maybe a few players will be offended by this, but gay players will feel more welcome and more able in the long run to go public.Everyone should also listen to what Thomas Beattie says about the longer term consequences of football failing to change. ldquoDo not fear the day where a gay athlete is wearing the badge on your shirt, he says. ldquoFear the prolonged period of time when there isnt. In other words, football could be missing out on great players, but even worse than that: as society and other sports progress, football is going to look more out-of-date on the issue of sexuality and ndash letrsquos just say it ndash homophobic.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

A storm in  showed something strange in the sand at the Bay of Skaill and the Laird, William Graham Watt, went on to excavate part of a , year old village. After reading the original reports, I now know that this isn’t true. The real story is more interesting.The Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, has three papers on Skara Brae. The first was by Samuel Laing, who visited the site in autumn .“Two chambers have been completely excavated, together with the passage and parts of the entrances to other chambers by Mr William Watt, a relative of William Watt, Esq of Breckness, residing at Skaill, to whose zeal the scientic world is indebted for the discovery and exhumation of this interesting relic of antiquity.#When I saw the credit being given to a relative of William Watt Esq, rather than the man himself, I remembered my father, Peter Leith, telling me that his father, also Peter, had told him that a dferent William Watt, known as Black Willie, had been the man responsible.In the  Census, I found the Laird living at Skaill, aged , with a son William, aged . His son and heir, William WG Watt was  and living at Kierfiold, so there were two sons called William.In James Irvine’s  book, ‘The Breckness Estate’, I read that William G Watt had a natural son, William, who in  was given £ a year and free board, “so long as he chose to remain a clerk in the house.”The story then turned into a neat circle. I followed up a reference in the book and found it was an Orkney Herald article written by my grandfather. It was about Hugh Miller’s book ‘Rambles of a Geologist’, in which Miller recorded his visit to Orkney in .My grandfather had written: “Another interesting person, who has already been mentioned, was William Watt of Skaill. This was not, as some readers may suppose, the laird of Skaill, but a distant relative who made his home there. He was well-known to everybody as “Black Willie” from his dark hair and complexion. Like Miller, he was a self-taught geologist, he always carried a little bag with a hammer and chisel to dig out any fossils he came across. He brought some of his more interesting specimens for Hugh Miller’s inspection and they had an interesting discussion. When Skarabrae was first dug into in the ’s, it is certain that Black Willie took an active part in the work and saw to it that anything found was safely preserved.”I looked up the references to William Watt in the book and found that Hugh Miller had come with a letter of introduction to him and described him both as an intelligent geologist and an intelligent palaeontologist. He showed Watt, along with Dr Garson of Stromness, where his famous discovery, the Astrolepsis fossil, lay.To read about the second and third papers on Skara Brae and what Patricia found out, see page  of this week#s edition of The Orcadian.Patricia Long is a tourist guide based in Stenness with a strong interest in social history.

Transport operators continue to play a key role in supporting essential travel and in ensuring passenger confidence in public transport while maintaining physical distancing. The use of face coverings forms a fundamental part of gaining that public trust.“We are asking people to take personal responsibility to do the right thing. Wearing a face covering while on public transport means you are playing your part in the collective effort to prevent the spread of coronavirus and reducing the risk to your fellow citizens.”In line with this, the council is asking people to provide their own face coverings when travelling by ferry, bus, plan, taxi or private hire cars. People who are not able to wear a face covering for specic medical reasons will be exempt, as will children under five.Orkney Ferries timetables are currently being revised in consultation with Community Councils in the North and South Isles. It is hoped that an enhanced service can be provided after Monday, June .Further information about this will be provided next week.In the meantime, the Council is asking public transport users to please be patient and consider others needs when planning future travel – and thanking people for their help and co-operation with this.Advice on face coverings, including how to make one and instructions for using one, will be available on the Transport Scotland website. This advice is being updated to include full details of the applicable exemptions.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

These include play areas within school grounds and the skate park in Kirkwall.From that date, the play area at the Pickaquoy Centre will be open, but the rest of the complex and surrounding grounds will remain closed.Gwenda Shearer, chairwoman of OIC’s education, leisure and housing committee, said: “I am very pleased that the gradual easing of lockdown allows us to reopen play areas throughout Orkney.“I am sure this will be welcomed by many children, young people and their families, especially as the summer holidays are fast approaching.“In line with Government requirements, we strongly advise that everyone follows hand hygiene and physical distancing guidance when visiting play areas. That will help ensure all of us stay safe.”The latest advice on this can be found here: https:www.nhsinform.scot illnesses-and-conditions infections-and-poisoning coronavirus-covid- coronavirus-covid--physical-distancingcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The Deputy First Minister said that, when the part-time #blended# plan for schooling had been developed, he and his colleagues could not have anticipated such an improvement in infection levels.

It is important that we face our fears and do not avoid them.“The enjoyment we might get from moving more freely outside, travelling and meeting friends and family is tempered when we are worried about the spread of infection. By sticking to the rules during the gradual lting of restrictions, we can be confident that risk won’t rise. Less virus around us can be matched with less restriction.“Although there are practical things we can do to help ourselves cope over the coming weeks, remember that help is availableneeded.  We’ve never had to deal with a situation like this before, so be kind to yourself and to others, and reach outyou need to talk to someone.  Support is there.”For practical tips, you can visit clearyourhead.scot.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It looks increasingly likely that any exit from lockdown and safe re-opening of tourism and hospitality businesses could be during the low season.#Without financial support to tide them over, that could be the nail in the coffin for many businesses.“In Shetland, like where in Scotland, earnings from tourism during the spring and summer months sustains people through the winter and it is a real worry that coronavirus hit just when the visitor season was starting.#It is clear that a -month plan, at least, is needed to ensure that viable businesses can survive to provide a living for their owners and be ready to safely welcome visitors again when the time is right.”Speaking via video link earlier this week, Mr Carmichael welcomed the Chancellor of the Exchequer#s announced extension to the furlough scheme to protect jobs – but added more was needed to help tourism.“Here in the Northern Isles we particularly see that in the visitor economy, which is crucial to us,# he added.#The assistance for bed and breakfast operators, or operators of self-catering accommodation, leaves too many people without the assistance they need.“A support scheme that finishes at the end of August, or September or whenever it will be, simply will not be adequate in parts of the country such as ours.#Those parts of the country that have seasonal tourism require a -month programme, or  the tourism industry that will be left to be resurrected at the end of this process will be that much weaker, and the rebuilding and recovery that much more dficult.” on Wednesday also heard from struggling tourism businesses.One BB owner said she had been unable to apply for support funds as they required applicants to have paid businesses rates, whereas she paid domestic council tax.Living Lerwick has also raised the plight of small tourism operators.Project manager Emma Miller said that as some did not have a business banking account they had been unable to apply for the Creative or Tourism and Hospitality Enterprises Fund, which opened in Scotland to support the industry. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"owners asked to let coastguard know if boats are left unattended ","story":"Boat owners are being reminded to please inform the coastguardthey will be leaving vessels unattended for any period of time.The Aith leboat was called out on Sunday evening after reports of a small boat lying empty near an uninhabited isle to the west of Scalloway.While no missing people had been reported in the area, the volunteer crew of the Charles Lidbury were asked by local coastguard officers to make their way to the scene and investigate.The call out came at .pm and the leboat team steamed south to where the skf had been moored – near the skerry of Sanda Stour at the entrance to Weisdale Voe.On arrival the small boat was recognised by a crew member – who then made contact with the boat#s owner to confirm that they were safe and well.

Lets hope I am proved wrong for the greater good of everybody  The way that poll is set up will skew the result in favour of the wind farm.WIth respect, a #gas-fired power station# on its own is not a possible option since a substantial amount of renewable energy is already installed and it won#t be going away, any time soon. Renewable energy, of course, must have a grid link and a fully-specied standbyplant to cover cable failures. Having two options involving a gas-fired power station obviously splits the vote for that option.Firstly:I am really confused about what this poll is supposed to achieve at this stage in the process and why,it#s important, the Shetland Times didn#t hold it  years ago.It seems that the Shetland public have already voted to reject the Shetland Times# wording of this question so I think it#s time to withdraw the poll and re-launch a new one.Might I suggest that the ST editors consult John Tulloch and an equally well qualied renewables engineer over the wording of the new question so that the public can vote on TWO clear options that are technically feasible, otherwise, it is a wasted exercise.

The auld yins used the on-course site while the large overflow parking space easily accommodated the youngsters.Hand sanitising gel dispensers were installed and made available outside the clubhouse which like all others in the land is closed for business for the foreseeable future.Fortunately, although our clubhouse generates a decent amount of money from sales of teas, coffees, confectioneries but most importantly club logo-ed items of clothing we will not suffer quite as much as the larger clubs who maintain essential bars and restaurants.On the actual playing surfaces greenkeepers were required to make provision for golfers to be able to #hole# their golf balls without requiring to touch either the cup, the flag or the pin.Creativity came to the fore and what would our fellow dream up for our edication and delight # but much more importantly for our health and safety Sadly, unlike our local dominies for this year#s SQA exam diet he wasn#t allowed to #mark his own homework# so his efforts were subject to public scrutiny.Effort #: He decided to insert some of his old CD#s just below the lip of the hole to prevent players having to touch the edges in order to retrieve their balls but this wasn#t a great success as his choice of music did not seem attractive to the Titleists and Callaways of this world.Born on the wrong side of the River Forth our man#s musical integrity was questionable to say the least and with the greatest respectyou were a golf ball would you rush to be anywhere in the vicinity of wee Clfie Richard#s Greatest Hits or Daniel O#Donnell Sings Sacred Songs Effort #: His musical theme continued as he experimented with plastic piping in the holes to make it #touch-safe# for players to retrieve their balls without fear of contamination # but methinks neither Fred Morrison nor Dr Angus Macdonald need have any fears there either And so with health and safety requirements plus traceability suitably concluded play duly started on Friday th May at am – prompt .Play would necessarily be limited to solo or dyads of players with  minute intervals between groups teeing off in order to maintain social distancing.Apparently there were some horror shots off the first tee and indeed #yours truly# playing that first morning as a #lone-ranger# was mightily relieved to see his opening bf # following an enforced  week lay-off # fly straight and true down the middle of the fairway.That doesn#t happen very often!Social media pictures provided evidence of a rich harvest of players theand breadth of the land sclaffing and indeed in some cases actually missing the ball completely much of course to the great amusement and consequent delight of their respective playing companions and assorted onlookers.With the restrictions on playing golf eased well before local football and with the shinty season already all but over before it has even started the golf club is delighted to see that some of their fellow sports enthusiasts in Skye and Lochalsh have decided to give their #second# game a wee bit more attention pending the resumption of their own particular athletic activity of choice.Many of the shinty and football boys have paid their green fees for a round on the course in the past to both stimulate their interest and improve their golfing skills in God#s own game but now that there#s no choice of sport the membership numbers at the club have started to grow and develop-and all are most welcome.Although it could still be a wee while before the #rubber once again hits the road# and the competitive golf resumes the situation could be much worse.Consider the dilemma facing a much larger Highland club with c. members and the problems associated with trying to accommodate these golfers desperation toto their #links# Teeing off from am till :pm in ten-minute intervals playing either solo or in pairs only c. players per day get the chance to grace their fairways.Whereas down Sconser way our members can now book their slot, play their game, savour the view, enjoy the company then travel but a short distance home only today-after-day should they so desire Stay safe, keep healthy and best wishes to you all from the Isle of Skye Golf Club.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until th July .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/home-farm-new.jpg","title":"skye nursing home worker positive for covid 19 for a second","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe news that a staff member had tested positive for a second time was confirmed by local MP Ian Blackford.Ten residents died at the nursing home after a major outbreak of the virus was detected there at the end of April.The Free Press understands all residents and staff at the home are to be re-tested as a precautionary measure today.The interim chief medical officer Gregor Smith was questioned about re-infection at today#s Scottish Government coronavirus daily briefing.He said that he could not comment on the inidual case, but added that the global evidence was that re-infection is #not a phenomenon we would recognise#.Dr Smith added that viral fragments can still be picked up in tests many weeks after the initial infection, and these highlighted the challenges which surrounds the testing process.Skye councillor John Gordon, whose father died at the home after testing positive for Covid-, said he was concerned families had found out about the new test via social media.He said: #Our thoughts are with families, residents, and staff who yet again have had to read about this on social media which has caused them more distress.#I can’t understand why a protocol has not been put in place to contact families before it’s in the media, and why management is not informing staff, despite assurances from NHS Highland and HC-Onethat this is happening.#Regular precautionary testing should be happening as a matter of course.#It’s a worrying time.#Mr Blackford said: #It has been confirmed to me that one of the staff members at Home Farm who had previously tested positive for Covid-, recovered and was tested negative twice has tested positive again.#The staff member concerned was re-rested on Sunday and received confirmation last night that they were positive.#It is important to stress that when someone does test positive having previously had Covid- that they may not necessarily be infectious.

ready themselves for re-opening in August.They had done so in the expectation that school capacity would be limited, with two metre social distancing rules remaining in place.Many parents has

While NIE Networks staff will still not be entering customers’ homes to obtain a meter read at this time, they will call at customers’ doors and ask them to read their meter while they wait. Meter readers will be able to take readings from meters located in outside positions as normal.NIE Networks is urging customers to protect its meter readers and themselves by continuing to observe social distancing protocols. Ben Cupples, Meter Reading Manager at NIE Networks, explained the importance of recording a precise meter reading for the customer.“Providing a precise meter reading will ensure that your electricity bills accurately reflect your consumption,” he said. “Our meter readers will call to your home and will record the reading you provide while we wait.“If you are unable to read your meter for any reason oryou are not at home when we call, we will leave a card with information on how to submit your meter reading online via the NIE Networks website, via email or over the phone.”Mr Cupples explained that while meter reading activity would resume it would only be carried out with the health and safety of the public and meter readers in mind.“The safety of our employees and customers is our utmost priority. “If you see our meter readers out and about, we would ask that you please help them by standing at least two metres away. Likewise, we will stand at least two metres from customers’ doors at all times.“We are continually reviewing how we undertake our meter reading activities in light of COVID- and we are looking forward to being able to resume our normal way of working with customers at some stage, but we will only make that decision when it’s safe to do so.” NIE Networks is reminding customers that you only need to submit your reading to either NIE Networks or your supplier – there is no need to do it twice. Customers unable to submit a meter reading will receive an estimated bill from their supplier based on their usage history.If a member of the NIE Networks team arrives at the door, they will always show identication. If a customer is concerned about the identity of a caller to their home they can call the PSNI ‘Quick Check’ service on .

Victor Leonard, chairman of the international youth football competition at which Rashford was twice a winner with Manchester United, has always been impressed with the manner in which the young England international striker has handled himself. As Rashford vowed to continue helping those in need after successfully forcing the government to reverse its decision not to provide free school meal vouchers during the summer, Mr. Leonard described the footballer as an inspiration to everyone. He added: “We first came across Marcus in the Manchester United squads that came across to Northern Ireland to compete in our tournaments. “He was a smash hit as United went on to win the Premier section in  and  but you could not help but admire the way, even at a young age, Marcus conducted himself. “We have been across to United many times and it was always very clear how highly regarded he was as a player and a person.” Rashford came off the bench in United’s  final victory over County Tyrone at Ballymena Showgrounds and started when the Red Devils triumphed  months later against defending champions Vendee from France. Victor added: “I think he is an inspiration to everyone. He has been so passionate about this issue but gone about attempting to bring change in a highly commendable manner. “He is a credit to his family and his club and we at STATSports SuperCupNI are privileged that he is one of our tournament graduates who has gone on to achieve greatness in his football career and also through his campaigning for something in which he believes so fervently. “Hopefully he will continue to be an inspiration to all of us.” Rashford has raised about poundm to supply around three million meals to vulnerable people while working with charity FareShare UK during the coronavirus lockdown. In an emotional open letter to MPs, Rashford drew on his own experience of relying on free school meals and food banks growing up. He said his story was all too familiar for families in England.

Photo by Kelvin Boyes  Press Eye.Claire McNeillyTwitterEmailJune   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailPrices in hairdressers, hotels, cafes and pubs are set to rise in post-lockdown Northern Ireland.Despite promises to keep them at pre-pandemic levels, key industry figures have warned customers of imminent hikes, to reflect increased costs and reduced capacity - and because they will struggle to offer deals across a range of services.Hairdressers said the price of a blow-dry, cut or colour was likely to rise by at least £ as salons offset extra costs.Belfast publican Willie Jack, owner of the famous Duke of York, the Harp Bar and The Dark Horse, said that punters can expect the price of a pint to rise to £, while Botanic Inns boss Stephen Magorrian warned that the cheapest wine on the menu could cost just under £ a bottle.Cafe owner Karen Grace, of Gwyn#s Cafe and Pavilion in Londonderry, said cafes may have to raise their prices to offset all the new health and safety costs.And while none of the hoteliers contacted by the Belfastadmitted there would be price hikes, Janice Gault from the Northern Ireland Hotel Federation indicated there are challenges ahead.There are additional costs for business: sanitation, new operational procedures and new equipment, she said.There are also issues around reduced capacity which brings into question the viability of some activities. Meanwhile, a number of income streams are effectively cut off as hotels are still unable to stage weddings and spas are restricted.Strict social distancing controls are likely to be reduced soon by the Executive from two metres to one, after Prime Minister Boris Johnston relaxed the rules in England earlier this week.It follows repeated calls from the hard hit hospitality, services and tourism sectors, as the roadmap to reopen the region gathers pace.Northern Ireland#s food-serving pubs, restaurants and hotels are gearing up to reopen on July , while hairdressers will have their scissors at the ready on July .Ken McClure, vice president of the Northern Ireland Hairdressers Association, said most salons would find price hikes unavoidable.Prices will have to go up by around £ per person to offset the additional costs we#ll incur to reopen safely, he told the Belfast .Owners will need to provide personal protection equipment , hand sanitisers, perspex screens and take other safety measures.Mr McClure, who owns Kenneth Michael International Hair and Beauty in east Belfast, said they would have to spread out appointments so that there will be fewer clients at any one time to comply with social distancing rules.There will be a very limited waiting area and we#ll be asking people to come alone, he added.We#ll also have to consider putting up extra pegs for clothes and wash gowns after every use.Colin Neil of Hospitality Ulster said it is hard to predict what effect increased costs and social distancing will have on pricing.He added: Pubs are looking at new business models and trying to work out how they break even.Mr Jack, a renowned publican, said the price of a pint will increase.I can see prices going up because of the cost of security required to keep numbers below a certain capacity, he said.The Duke of York and Harp Bar are both busy non-food, live music venues and I#ll have to operate at somewhere between % and % capacity.A pint might increase from £. to £. That#s also to avoid dealing with change. A glass of wine will probably stay the same price.Any publican who reopens will probably be losing money for the rest of the year.Mr Magorrian, whose bars include the hugely popular Northern Whig, said he was reviewing all prices both to reflect increased costs and for safety reasons.We need to move away from £. and £. and go to £. or £ to cut down on the level of change we#re carrying, he said.The cheapest bottle of wine in the Whig is £., whereas a glass is up by p to £. or £.He added: The major thing we#ll be doing is avoiding deals such as two courses for a set price mid-week, or kids eat free on a Sunday, or cocktail happy hour.Julie Hastings, marketing director at Hastings Hotels, whose portfolio includes The Europa and Grand Central in Belfast city centre, said prices will stay static.Prices at each of our seven properties are being kept very much the same as pre-lockdown to encourage as many bookings as possible, she said.Hospitality chief Michael Stewart, who co-runs House Belfast hotel, bar and restaurant, said it#s inevitable that a lot of venues will have to increase prices to sustain the costs they incur.He added: For hotels it#s a moving feast so nobody knows. If the Chancellor reduces VAT in the next budget it will give us room for manoeuvre on prices. Ms Grace, of Gwyn#s Cafe and Pavilion, said that price hikes are likely, although she pledged: I won#t be putting up mine.She added: Others may have no option but to increase their prices given all the extra costs incurred in complying with the new safety rules.

Patrick McGonagle, , whose address was given as Old School Lane in Shantallow appeared in court on June  charged with breaching his bail conditions on June  by ‘intentionally exposing his genitals’. The defendant had been released on bail on June  after being charged with common assault, namely throwing bread at a woman and attempting to grab her, and disorderly behaviour in a public place. A police officer said that on June  the PSNI became aware of a video circulating online showing a man acting in an ‘indecent manner’. googletag.cmd.push It was brought to the attention of police by community representatives and family members of children who witnessed it. McGonagle was identied in multiple reports. The officer said the incident took place at Old School Lane where the -year-old was seen ‘defecating in view of children’. A -year-old recorded the incident. The officer added: “He used chip shop wrappers to wipe himself. He was extremely intoxicated.” Police located the defendant at Old School Lane and he charged straight away. Objecting to bail, the officer said on June  McGonagle was warned about his behaviour and not to be intoxicated in a public place. googletag.cmd.push The court heard the -year-old has  previous convictions and two suspended sentences. There is an ‘extremely high risk of reoffending’, the officer added, ‘this man is incapable of not being intoxicated in a public place.’ Defence barrister Stephen Mooney said his client pleaded guilty to the offences before the court on Monday at the first opportunity and it was adjourned for a pre-sentence report. McGonagle was not in a position to be interviewed by the police due to his level of intoxication. Mr Mooney told the court that back in   the -year-old spent a ‘very signicant’ period of time in custody on remand. He was then found ‘unfit for trial’ because of his mental capacity and the prosecution was discontinued. The defence barrister said it is not so much a ‘fool’s pardon but a street drinker’s pardon’ as he is a well-known street drinker. His alcoholism is being criminalised because of his inability to stay sober, he added. Mr Mooney asked for bail to be granted with strict conditions attached. District Judge Peter King said ‘you’re absolutely correct’ and any bail conditions would have to include a prohibition on alcohol which would set him up for ‘spectacular failure’. He added that McGonagle may upset the ‘wrong person or group of people and find himself facing more dficulties’. The defendant was remanded in custody due to a ‘clear risk of reoffending’ to appear by way of video link on July .

Hannah Richardson has grown up in Derry and is well-known in the local rock music scene as lead singer guitarist in three-piece rock band CHERYM. Her mother is a white Irish woman and father a black Sierra Leonean. Until now the -year-old has found the topic of racism dficult to address. But she felt duty-bound to speak out following the Black Lives Matter protests and subsequent stories in the Derry News. Nurse Beverly Simpson addressed the rally in Derry on June  then shared her family’s experience of racism in the city. googletag.cmd.push Last week, pharmacist Nkele Mushapho said she has been subjected to racism in the workplace with people requesting an ‘Irish pharmacist’ and constantly questioning her advice. Ms Richardson was ‘shocked’ that people commenting underneath those stories seemed unaware of racism in the city and were in some cases denying its existence. She has encountered racism since the age of  in nursery school and can’t understand the dismissive attitudes of some people. “There are a lot of people who are in denial about the fact that racism exists here,” she said. “I’ve lived here my whole le, it is a lovely place to live, the people here are fantastic. googletag.cmd.push “However, yes, there are a lot of racist people that live in Northern Ireland and Derry as well. “Racism is so common that I now have a tendency to just get on with it because you know it’s going to happen again the next time you go out. It becomes normal.” She was raised by a white mother and all her friends are predominantly white. Until now, she has never felt the need to make public her views. But the experience of Ms Mushapho struck a chord and she couldn’t believe people were disregarding her account. “I was reading those comments going, ‘seriously, you don’t know how bad it is’. I know that not all people from here are racist, or have anything against black people, but a lot of people are ignorant to the idea of racism. “A lot of people here find it acceptable to use racial slurs or casual racism because there’s never really been that many black people about to correct them or tell them otherwise - that ‘yes, that is offensive’.” COMPASSION Ms Richardson has natural afro hair which has attracted negative attention in the past: “I used to be fine with wearing it out, loud and proud and happy days, but recently every single time that I would wear my natural hair as opposed to having weaves or wearing a hat, somebody would say something about me. “Whether it be, ‘are you on your holidays or where are you from ’ “I was walking through Foyle Street recently when some boy came right up to me and screamed Mo Salah in my face. “It’s every weekend, every single day I leave the house with my hair like that I would say it happens. “It’s really, really tough. So, it is shocking to see people being so dismissive of other people’s experiences because I assumed everybody knew that it was like this but they clearly don’t.” The -year-old believes that now is the right time for everyone to have conversations about race. She was dismayed by comments underneath a post by former politician Pat Ramsey a number of years ago in which he shared a story of racist abuse directed at a group of black people visiting the city. On nights out people are ‘the worst’ because they see a group of black people and approach them, she said. At times it can be positive but on other occasions ‘slurs are thrown about’. Looking back, Ms Richardson ponders whether she should’ve engaged with people commenting under Pat Ramsey’s post. However, the most recent comments with people saying Ms Mushapho was ‘lying’, ‘Derry is not like that’, ‘Irish people have history of oppression and wouldn’t act in such a way’ couldn’t go unaddressed, Ms Richardson said. “Your own experience of oppression should not ever take away from the experiences of black people,anything it should make you more compassionate towards another minority suffering from racism. “Is it because people can’t relate to black struggle that they have to turn the oppression back on themselves. “We need to take a look at what’s going on under our noses.” PROGRESSIVE In her view, it is right to shine a spotlight on injustices everywhere but she believes it is wrong to overlook what is happening in the city by directing comments at Ms Mushapho such as ‘racism exists in South Africa too’. “That’s like saying, ‘your experience doesn’t matter to me, take a look at your own people’”, Ms Richardson added. She despises use of the word ‘coloured’ saying it is completely inappropriate when describing a black person. Experts on racism say it is regarded as a highly offensive racial slur which recalls a time when casual racism was a part of everyday le. In the US, because of the countrys era of racial segregation, it is among the most offensive words for describing a black person. Ms Richardson believes some people in Derry are intentionally racist but many others are completely unaware, they lack a basic understanding of what terms are racist. She explained: “A lot of us are ignorant on the subject, you might have made racist remarks in the past but you yourself might not be racist. “As long as you learn from that racist remark, take what you can from it and accept you may have offended someone then that’s a good progressive way to be.” Reflecting on the way forward, she concluded: “Does racism exist in Northern Ireland  Totally. “Does it exist in Derry  Aye. “Don’t be afraid to ask questions, to ask other black people “Stop disregarding people’s experiences of racism. “Let’s think about what can we do to make sure Derry is anti-racist, as opposed to just being against racism, what can we do to make this a better place ”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Hannah Richardson has grown up in Derry and is well-known in the local rock music scene as lead singer guitarist in three-piece rock band CHERYM. Her mother is a white Irish woman and father a black Sierra Leonean. Until now the -year-old has found the topic of racism dficult to address. But she felt duty-bound to speak out following the Black Lives Matter protests and subsequent stories in the Derry News. Nurse Beverly Simpson addressed the rally in Derry on June  then shared her family’s experience of racism in the city. googletag.cmd.push Last week, pharmacist Nkele Mushapho said she has been subjected to racism in the workplace with people requesting an ‘Irish pharmacist’ and constantly questioning her advice. Ms Richardson was ‘shocked’ that people commenting underneath those stories seemed unaware of racism in the city and were in some cases denying its existence. She has encountered racism since the age of  in nursery school and can’t understand the dismissive attitudes of some people. “There are a lot of people who are in denial about the fact that racism exists here,” she said. “I’ve lived here my whole le, it is a lovely place to live, the people here are fantastic. googletag.cmd.push “However, yes, there are a lot of racist people that live in Northern Ireland and Derry as well. “Racism is so common that I now have a tendency to just get on with it because you know it’s going to happen again the next time you go out. It becomes normal.” She was raised by a white mother and all her friends are predominantly white. Until now, she has never felt the need to make public her views. But the experience of Ms Mushapho struck a chord and she couldn’t believe people were disregarding her account. “I was reading those comments going, ‘seriously, you don’t know how bad it is’. I know that not all people from here are racist, or have anything against black people, but a lot of people are ignorant to the idea of racism. “A lot of people here find it acceptable to use racial slurs or casual racism because there’s never really been that many black people about to correct them or tell them otherwise - that ‘yes, that is offensive’.” COMPASSION Ms Richardson has natural afro hair which has attracted negative attention in the past: “I used to be fine with wearing it out, loud and proud and happy days, but recently every single time that I would wear my natural hair as opposed to having weaves or wearing a hat, somebody would say something about me. “Whether it be, ‘are you on your holidays or where are you from ’ “I was walking through Foyle Street recently when some boy came right up to me and screamed Mo Salah in my face. “It’s every weekend, every single day I leave the house with my hair like that I would say it happens. “It’s really, really tough. So, it is shocking to see people being so dismissive of other people’s experiences because I assumed everybody knew that it was like this but they clearly don’t.” The -year-old believes that now is the right time for everyone to have conversations about race. She was dismayed by comments underneath a post by former politician Pat Ramsey a number of years ago in which he shared a story of racist abuse directed at a group of black people visiting the city. On nights out people are ‘the worst’ because they see a group of black people and approach them, she said. At times it can be positive but on other occasions ‘slurs are thrown about’. Looking back, Ms Richardson ponders whether she should’ve engaged with people commenting under Pat Ramsey’s post. However, the most recent comments with people saying Ms Mushapho was ‘lying’, ‘Derry is not like that’, ‘Irish people have history of oppression and wouldn’t act in such a way’ couldn’t go unaddressed, Ms Richardson said. “Your own experience of oppression should not ever take away from the experiences of black people,anything it should make you more compassionate towards another minority suffering from racism. “Is it because people can’t relate to black struggle that they have to turn the oppression back on themselves. “We need to take a look at what’s going on under our noses.” PROGRESSIVE In her view, it is right to shine a spotlight on injustices everywhere but she believes it is wrong to overlook what is happening in the city by directing comments at Ms Mushapho such as ‘racism exists in South Africa too’. “That’s like saying, ‘your experience doesn’t matter to me, take a look at your own people’”, Ms Richardson added. She despises use of the word ‘coloured’ saying it is completely inappropriate when describing a black person. Experts on racism say it is regarded as a highly offensive racial slur which recalls a time when casual racism was a part of everyday le. In the US, because of the countrys era of racial segregation, it is among the most offensive words for describing a black person. Ms Richardson believes some people in Derry are intentionally racist but many others are completely unaware, they lack a basic understanding of what terms are racist. She explained: “A lot of us are ignorant on the subject, you might have made racist remarks in the past but you yourself might not be racist. “As long as you learn from that racist remark, take what you can from it and accept you may have offended someone then that’s a good progressive way to be.” Reflecting on the way forward, she concluded: “Does racism exist in Northern Ireland  Totally. “Does it exist in Derry  Aye. “Don’t be afraid to ask questions, to ask other black people “Stop disregarding people’s experiences of racism. “Let’s think about what can we do to make sure Derry is anti-racist, as opposed to just being against racism, what can we do to make this a better place ”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Of their seven titles, Fergal Moore was involved in five, while Conrad McGuigan, their  winning captain, has six winners medals. Michael McMullan spoke to them about their memories. ***If you build it, they will come. The ghostly words inspired Ray Kinsella to build a field of dreams in the middle of his Iowa corn field in Kevin Costners  film of the same name. Craigbane also built for the future. A sharp left turn off the Slieveboy road and Gerry Crossan Park edges into view at the foot of Glenrandel brae. A state-of-the-art hall and gym. A fully floodlit pitch and one with training lights. A running track and a windmill spinning in the background. Its well used, worth every penny and the hours of planning. googletag.cmd.push Gavin Conwell, Ulster winning captain in , is the clubs Youth Officer and is passing on his knowledge to the next crop. Alfie Dallas, George Sharkey and Brian Conway also used the hall to the max. The future is in safe hands. Former senior manager Kevin Moore and Kieran McElhinney manage the minors. Ryan McDaid is involved with the Us. John Oacuteg Donaghy is Chairman. Former goalkeepers Paul McLaughlin and Gerard McLaughlin are on the committee. Its their turn to put a dferent stamp on the club. Next month, Craigbane will continue their rebuilding process in the unfamiliar surroundings of junior, almost  years since they were fingertips away from knocking Ballinderry out of the  Derry championship. The same season the Shamrocks ended as All-Ireland champions. googletag.cmd.push The last decade ravaged Craigbanes senior team of physicality and experience. Year by year, the youth has been thrown in. Now, theyre finding their feet. St Columbs Derry and Cathair Dhoire school teams have emerged with a Craigbane imprint. When St Patricks and St Brigids Claudy school team, under the guidance of current senior player Brian Rainey, there was also a strong Craigbane core.  Craigbanes  U championship winning team All coming from their U championship winning team of , when they beat a fancied Kilrea. “We, as a club, needed it,” manager Conrad McGuigan said after the game. “At the start of the year they beat us by  or  points, but I saw something in our boys in the second half – they didn’t lie down.” By September, they overturned the Pearses to land the silver. *** After early signs of football in the area during the s, St Josephs Craigbane wasnt founded until  and after a Division Three title, the  reserve success was their first championship. “We were starting to get to finals at that time,” Conrad McGuigan remembers of the beginning. “In , it was the th year of the Dr Kerlin Cup, it was our first final and we won it.” McGuigan, not yet , was beginning to cut his teeth in the senior team. After an appearance in the semi-final, he didnt play in the final against Loup. “The team included more of the older hands, it was a very settled team,” McGuigan outlines, before rattling off some of the names. “Noel Moore, Gerard McLaughlin, Shane Lynch, Harry Roe McLaughlin, Paddy Cartin, George Sharkey, Dermot Gormley and Damian OKane. “There were four Gormley brothers, Peter, God rest him, Colm, Leo and Brendan,” he adds. With the clash of green, Loup played in Ballinderry colours and Craigbane purchased a set of Down jersies for the game. “I also remember Loup taking home Martin OBrien from England for the game,” Conrad recalls. “He was a big player for them and that was the worry. Loup were favourites, but it worked out okay for us in the end.” With a first championship in the bag, McGuigan also hails Paul Dixon as being a huge influence on the team. He had ed from a stint with Burnley and was playing with Glentoran at the time. In , it took a replay to get over reigning junior champions Greenlough in the semi-final. Injury to Peter Gormley and his brother Colms sending off robbed them of their midfield pairing, remembers goalkeeper Gerard McLaughlin. Gerry McElhinney came home from England to answer the call. Craigbane found themselves seven points down in the latter stages of the final to Claudy. Earlier in the game, Dixon missed a penalty and turned down the chance to take Craigbanes second penalty. Nobody  fancied it and up stepped McGuigan and his goal sparked their comeback.  The Craigbane team pictured before the  replay win over Claudy Still Claudy held the upper hand and it look a last throw of the dice, Conrad remembers. “There was about two minutes left and I put a ball into the square, it was more of a Hail Mary and hepunched it into the net. The goal earned a replay, which Craigbane won, - to - and retained their title, leading to a four-year stint in the senior championship. Away from the clubscene, McGuigan played in St Marys Belfasts  Sigerson Cup win over UCC. He was also playing with Derry Us and Tommy Diamond had called him into the senior , where he saw some initial action. While success followed his career path, so too did injury. If two leg breaks werent enough, a dislocated elbow and putting out his shoulder a few times added to the woe. *** Tyrone has played a central part in Fergal Moores le. As a corner forward, he played up front with Geoffrey McGonigle on the Derry minor team, beaten by the Red Hands at Omagh in . Married and living close to Errigal Ciarans home in Dunmoyle for the last  years, saw him faced with a  milejourney to train and play with Craigbane. Despite being approached by the Tyrone giants to transfer and the lure of senior championship football, he stuck with his roots. “We wouldve been training twice a week and maybe three times coming up to championship,” Moore outlines. “I was asked to joinbut I never really thought about it. If Craigbane didnt have a game, I would go and watch Errigal.” Loyalty to home club was too much, though he has helped coach his daughter Michealas ladies team. “I have been at Tyronegames, but I have just been shouting her name,” he jokes. “Youll not get me cheering come on Tyrone or anything like that.” After starting on the Craigbane senior team as an U in , it was  before he made his championship debut, coming on as a sub in the final against Magilligan. “It was easy enough in the finish,” he outlines of Craigbanes win. Through the minors, he was corner forward, but after Leo Gormley hung up the number three senior jersey, Moore stepped into the berth he would hold during Craigbanes golden era. An influx of young players came through, inspired by the teams of the s. “Everybody came in around the same age and everybody was battling for places then.” Fergal remembers. “A lot of the young boys in thephotographs, or that were mascots were now breaking into the senior team,” adds Conrad McGuigan, who was named as  senior captain. “Boys were saying I want to play with our senior team and it was a spur for the parish.” Gerard McLaughlin, Conrad McGuigan, Kieran and Eddie McElhinney, Kevin and Fergal Moore gave a solid spine of experience. “The boys who came in, Alfie Dallas, Jude Dooley , Damien and Gary McLaughlin, they all had pace. At that stage, we wouldve given anybody in the county a good game for it,” McGuigan stresses. By the end of the decade and up in senior football, they clapped county champions Bellaghy on the pitch before drawing a game they couldve won. Later that year, only for uncharacteristic slip from Kieran McElhinney on a wet night, to allow a  to slip to the net, they had Ballinderry beaten before their   All-Ireland campaign even got off the ground. The whirlwind story began against Banagher in the  final. First of all, they needed to survive a storming Limavady comeback in the semi-final and Craigbane were lucky to hang on for a replay, which they navigated without any fuss. “It was a wake up call for us going into the final,” McGuigan states. Banagher had only been relegated from the first ision, and were billed as favourites. The cream against the second ision team. “There were families with cousins involved in both clubs and the rivalry was unreal. A lot of us grew up in Craigbane and had moved back into the new housing developments in Park,” he adds. After the influx, it raised the contentious issue...was Park in Banagher or in Craigbane  In the league, Banagher had won close games between the clubs and it was little surprise when an attendance of nearly , flocked to Drum for the final. “We knew it would take a good display from them to beat us,” Conrad continues. “We were a hard team to beat when the championship came along. Self belief was starting to seep into the team and you felt you were never going to lose. “Another influence at the time was Paddy Cassidy, who wouldve been Derry Citys fitness trainer. Francie Deeney, who was managed the team with Eddie McElhinney, got him in. “It was a new voice and it was a more dedicated approach to training and it all just started to gel.” Within minutes of the throw-in, Gavin Conwell had blood gushing out of his nose and Craigbane had a penalty, which McGuigan missed. Eddie McElhinney, who came on for Conwell, slipped home a th minute goal to put them in the driving seat.  Paddy Cassidy and Maurice McElhinney help Gavin Conwell from the pitch during the  final Banagher lost Patrick ODonnell to a shoulder injury and when McGuigan tagged on three points, Craigbane were on track for victory. “It was close in the end, but it didnt reflect our superiority,” McGuigan adds. Banagher grabbed a late goal, but Craigbane held on for a - to - win and title number four. “I just remember the supporters going mad and streaming onto the pitch after the game,” was Fergal Moores memory of winning the game. “Going into those games, at that time, there was excitement, you knew there wasnt going to be much in it and everything was left on the pitch.” “The boys went over to Farahsafter the game and probably drunk the place dry,” McGuigan recalls. “It wouldve have been the main place,. The craic was great and there was always a Monday club,” Fergal Moore adds. There were no trips back to Tyrone on county final nights. *** The  chapter was dferent. Craigbane were in five finals and lost all five by a point. In the same week of the Dr Kerlin Cup defeat to Banagher, they overturned the result to beat them in the championship, before going down to Faughanvale in a replay. By , Craigbane were top dogs again. After securing the Dr Kerlin Cup, it was like a fair day in Farahs. The story at the time was about the situation at Drumcree and local police resources were stretched. The bar was buzzing and it was the daylight hours before revellers spilled out on their way home. There was an interesting angle in the championship final that season. Alfie Dallas, Craigbanes  winning manager, was now in charge of Claudy. Low and behold, they met Craigbane in the final, with his son, Alfie junior, in fine fettle with seven points to his name in a comfortable win. “I have more memories of beating Banagher, because it meant more to us and we had already beaten Claudy,” Conrad McGuigan commented of the  success.  Sean Crossan, Shane Lynch, Gergal Moore and Gavin Conwell look on as Conrad McGuigan lts the  championship It was  before the next championship title, again under Deeney and McElhinney. They needed a stroke of luck in the last minute against Slaughtmanus in a topsy turvy round one game. The sides were level when Sean Currans shot hit the crossbar and came out, only to be greeted by the final whistle. “We shouldve been out,” Fergal Moore admits. “They were straight through,it had went over the bar, we were out.” A suspension kept Gavin Conwell out of most of the championship. A re-fixed semi-final to a Friday night, hours before his ban ended, ruled him out of the win over Claudy. Fergal Crossans alsofor the final, after a summer in Chicago that saw him win North American Player of the Year and later a call to the Derry senior team. Victory over Newbridge in the final, who had just dropped down from senior, took Craigbane to six on the roll of honour. Before the official Ulster championship, Clontibret ran Ulster tournament and this was Craigbanes first venture following delay because of foot and mouth. “I remember us going over the border and having to go across a sheep-dip type thing, where everything had to be washed,” McGuigan remembers. It was new ground, new teams, food on the way and a bus journey to the game. With every round, they grew as a team. “We beat Belcoo, Termon, Beragh and Inniskeen,” came the list of the teams rolling off Fergal Moores tongue, of their passage to glory. “Inniskeen was a right hard game,” he remembers of their - to - win. “We beat Beragh - to five or six points. The Tyrone teams were always good and Beragh werent long down from senior...it was probably the easiest game we played.” Fergal retired five years ago from reserve football at the age of , having picked up a fth medal and a second Ulster in , as part of a  managed by his brother Kevin and containing nephews Lee, Ryan and Rory. Conrad finished up in , aged , but after having a great innings, he has a regret not to have hung on longer for the clubs seventh championship. “I had played a bit of reserve football. The legs were starting to go, my game was based on pace. I was so lucky and looking back it was the right time for me to stop. I wouldnt have been playing , but just to be part of it and missing the the buzz of being involved when the club is on a run.” Now, it is all about the next generation and McGuigan, like many around the club, is confident. If they can avoid a swathe of emigration, the future is bright. “There is enough talent within our club,we can get over the next few years, to win something at another level, whatever grade that might be.” When Gavin Conwell lted the Ulster Cup on a magical  night in Omagh, he called for a gathering the next day in the clubhouse. So all the young weans could see all the cups. It sounded impulsive, but it wasnt. It was time to strike when the iron was hot.

Of their seven titles, Fergal Moore was involved in five, while Conrad McGuigan, their  winning captain, has six winners medals. Michael McMullan spoke to them about their memories. ***If you build it, they will come. The ghostly words inspired Ray Kinsella to build a field of dreams in the middle of his Iowa corn field in Kevin Costners  film of the same name. Craigbane also built for the future. A sharp left turn off the Slieveboy road and Gerry Crossan Park edges into view at the foot of Glenrandel brae. A state-of-the-art hall and gym. A fully floodlit pitch and one with training lights. A running track and a windmill spinning in the background. Its well used, worth every penny and the hours of planning. googletag.cmd.push Gavin Conwell, Ulster winning captain in , is the clubs Youth Officer and is passing on his knowledge to the next crop. Alfie Dallas, George Sharkey and Brian Conway also used the hall to the max. The future is in safe hands. Former senior manager Kevin Moore and Kieran McElhinney manage the minors. Ryan McDaid is involved with the Us. John Oacuteg Donaghy is Chairman. Former goalkeepers Paul McLaughlin and Gerard McLaughlin are on the committee. Its their turn to put a dferent stamp on the club. Next month, Craigbane will continue their rebuilding process in the unfamiliar surroundings of junior, almost  years since they were fingertips away from knocking Ballinderry out of the  Derry championship. The same season the Shamrocks ended as All-Ireland champions. googletag.cmd.push The last decade ravaged Craigbanes senior team of physicality and experience. Year by year, the youth has been thrown in. Now, theyre finding their feet. St Columbs Derry and Cathair Dhoire school teams have emerged with a Craigbane imprint. When St Patricks and St Brigids Claudy school team, under the guidance of current senior player Brian Rainey, there was also a strong Craigbane core.  Craigbanes  U championship winning team All coming from their U championship winning team of , when they beat a fancied Kilrea. “We, as a club, needed it,” manager Conrad McGuigan said after the game. “At the start of the year they beat us by  or  points, but I saw something in our boys in the second half – they didn’t lie down.” By September, they overturned the Pearses to land the silver. *** After early signs of football in the area during the s, St Josephs Craigbane wasnt founded until  and after a Division Three title, the  reserve success was their first championship. “We were starting to get to finals at that time,” Conrad McGuigan remembers of the beginning. “In , it was the th year of the Dr Kerlin Cup, it was our first final and we won it.” McGuigan, not yet , was beginning to cut his teeth in the senior team. After an appearance in the semi-final, he didnt play in the final against Loup. “The team included more of the older hands, it was a very settled team,” McGuigan outlines, before rattling off some of the names. “Noel Moore, Gerard McLaughlin, Shane Lynch, Harry Roe McLaughlin, Paddy Cartin, George Sharkey, Dermot Gormley and Damian OKane. “There were four Gormley brothers, Peter, God rest him, Colm, Leo and Brendan,” he adds. With the clash of green, Loup played in Ballinderry colours and Craigbane purchased a set of Down jersies for the game. “I also remember Loup taking home Martin OBrien from England for the game,” Conrad recalls. “He was a big player for them and that was the worry. Loup were favourites, but it worked out okay for us in the end.” With a first championship in the bag, McGuigan also hails Paul Dixon as being a huge influence on the team. He had ed from a stint with Burnley and was playing with Glentoran at the time. In , it took a replay to get over reigning junior champions Greenlough in the semi-final. Injury to Peter Gormley and his brother Colms sending off robbed them of their midfield pairing, remembers goalkeeper Gerard McLaughlin. Gerry McElhinney came home from England to answer the call. Craigbane found themselves seven points down in the latter stages of the final to Claudy. Earlier in the game, Dixon missed a penalty and turned down the chance to take Craigbanes second penalty. Nobody  fancied it and up stepped McGuigan and his goal sparked their comeback.  The Craigbane team pictured before the  replay win over Claudy Still Claudy held the upper hand and it look a last throw of the dice, Conrad remembers. “There was about two minutes left and I put a ball into the square, it was more of a Hail Mary and hepunched it into the net. The goal earned a replay, which Craigbane won, - to - and retained their title, leading to a four-year stint in the senior championship. Away from the clubscene, McGuigan played in St Marys Belfasts  Sigerson Cup win over UCC. He was also playing with Derry Us and Tommy Diamond had called him into the senior , where he saw some initial action. While success followed his career path, so too did injury. If two leg breaks werent enough, a dislocated elbow and putting out his shoulder a few times added to the woe. *** Tyrone has played a central part in Fergal Moores le. As a corner forward, he played up front with Geoffrey McGonigle on the Derry minor team, beaten by the Red Hands at Omagh in . Married and living close to Errigal Ciarans home in Dunmoyle for the last  years, saw him faced with a  milejourney to train and play with Craigbane. Despite being approached by the Tyrone giants to transfer and the lure of senior championship football, he stuck with his roots. “We wouldve been training twice a week and maybe three times coming up to championship,” Moore outlines. “I was asked to joinbut I never really thought about it. If Craigbane didnt have a game, I would go and watch Errigal.” Loyalty to home club was too much, though he has helped coach his daughter Michealas ladies team. “I have been at Tyronegames, but I have just been shouting her name,” he jokes. “Youll not get me cheering come on Tyrone or anything like that.” After starting on the Craigbane senior team as an U in , it was  before he made his championship debut, coming on as a sub in the final against Magilligan. “It was easy enough in the finish,” he outlines of Craigbanes win. Through the minors, he was corner forward, but after Leo Gormley hung up the number three senior jersey, Moore stepped into the berth he would hold during Craigbanes golden era.

A lot of us grew up in Craigbane and had moved back into the new housing developments in Park,” he adds. After the influx, it raised the contentious issue...was Park in Banagher or in Craigbane  In the league, Banagher had won close games between the clubs and it was little surprise when an attendance of nearly , flocked to Drum for the final. “We knew it would take a good display from them to beat us,” Conrad continues. “We were a hard team to beat when the championship came along.

Francie Deeney, who was managed the team with Eddie McElhinney, got him in. “It was a new voice and it was a more dedicated approach to training and it all just started to gel.” Within minutes of the throw-in, Gavin Conwell had blood gushing out of his nose and Craigbane had a penalty, which McGuigan missed. Eddie McElhinney, who came on for Conwell, slipped home a th minute goal to put them in the driving seat.  Paddy Cassidy and Maurice McElhinney help Gavin Conwell from the pitch during the  final Banagher lost Patrick ODonnell to a shoulder injury and when McGuigan tagged on three points, Craigbane were on track for victory. “It was close in the end, but it didnt reflect our superiority,” McGuigan adds. Banagher grabbed a late goal, but Craigbane held on for a - to - win and title number four. “I just remember the supporters going mad and streaming onto the pitch after the game,” was Fergal Moores memory of winning the game. “Going into those games, at that time, there was excitement, you knew there wasnt going to be much in it and everything was left on the pitch.” “The boys went over to Farahsafter the game and probably drunk the place dry,” McGuigan recalls. “It wouldve have been the main place,. The craic was great and there was always a Monday club,” Fergal Moore adds. There were no trips back to Tyrone on county final nights. *** The  chapter was dferent.

Sean Crossan, Shane Lynch, Gergal Moore and Gavin Conwell look on as Conrad McGuigan lts the  championship It was  before the next championship title, again under Deeney and McElhinney. They needed a stroke of luck in the last minute against Slaughtmanus in a topsy turvy round one game. The sides were level when Sean Currans shot hit the crossbar and came out, only to be greeted by the final whistle. “We shouldve been out,” Fergal Moore admits. “They were straight through,it had went over the bar, we were out.” A suspension kept Gavin Conwell out of most of the championship. A re-fixed semi-final to a Friday night, hours before his ban ended, ruled him out of the win over Claudy. Fergal Crossans alsofor the final, after a summer in Chicago that saw him win North American Player of the Year and later a call to the Derry senior team. Victory over Newbridge in the final, who had just dropped down from senior, took Craigbane to six on the roll of honour. Before the official Ulster championship, Clontibret ran Ulster tournament and this was Craigbanes first venture following delay because of foot and mouth. “I remember us going over the border and having to go across a sheep-dip type thing, where everything had to be washed,” McGuigan remembers. It was new ground, new teams, food on the way and a bus journey to the game. With every round, they grew as a team. “We beat Belcoo, Termon, Beragh and Inniskeen,” came the list of the teams rolling off Fergal Moores tongue, of their passage to glory. “Inniskeen was a right hard game,” he remembers of their - to - win. “We beat Beragh - to five or six points. The Tyrone teams were always good and Beragh werent long down from senior...it was probably the easiest game we played.” Fergal retired five years ago from reserve football at the age of , having picked up a fth medal and a second Ulster in , as part of a  managed by his brother Kevin and containing nephews Lee, Ryan and Rory. Conrad finished up in , aged , but after having a great innings, he has a regret not to have hung on longer for the clubs seventh championship. “I had played a bit of reserve football.

If they can avoid a swathe of emigration, the future is bright. “There is enough talent within our club,we can get over the next few years, to win something at another level, whatever grade that might be.” When Gavin Conwell lted the Ulster Cup on a magical  night in Omagh, he called for a gathering the next day in the clubhouse.

Through the minors,he was corner forward, but after Leo Gormley hung up the number three senior jersey, Moore stepped into the berth he would hold during Craigbanes golden era.An influx of young players came through, inspired by the teams of the s.“Everybody came in around the same age and everybody was battling for places then.” Fergal remembers.“A lot of the young boys in thephotographs, or that were mascots were now breaking into the senior team,” adds Conrad McGuigan, who was named as  senior captain.“Boys were saying I want to play with our senior team and it was a spur for the parish.”Gerard McLaughlin, Conrad McGuigan, Kieran and Eddie McElhinney, Kevin and Fergal Moore gave a solid spine of experience.“The boys who came in, Alfie Dallas, Jude Dooley , Damien and Gary McLaughlin, they all had pace.At that stage, we wouldve given anybody in the countya good game for it,” McGuigan stresses.By the end of the decade and up in senior football, they clapped county champions Bellaghy on the pitch before drawing a game they couldve won.Later that year, only for uncharacteristic slip from Kieran McElhinney on a wet night, to allow a  to slip to the net, they had Ballinderry beaten before their   All-Ireland campaign even got off the ground.The whirlwind story began against Banagher in the  final.First of all, they needed to survive a storming Limavady comeback in the semi-final and Craigbane were lucky to hang on for a replay, which they navigated without any fuss.“It was a wake up call for us going into the final,” McGuigan states.Banagher had only been relegated from the first ision, and were billed as favourites.The cream against the second ision team.“There were families with cousins involved in both clubs and the rivalry was unreal.A lot of us grew up in Craigbane and had moved back into the new housing developments in Park,” he adds.After the influx, it raised the contentious issue...was Park in Banagher or in Craigbane In the league, Banagher had won close gamesbetween the clubs and it was little surprise when an attendanceof nearly , flocked to Drum for the final.“We knew it would take a good display from them to beat us,” Conrad continues.“We were a hard team to beat when the championship came along.Self belief was starting to seep into the team and you felt you were never going to lose.“Another influence at the time was Paddy Cassidy, who wouldve been Derry Citys fitness trainer.Francie Deeney, who was managed the team with Eddie McElhinney, got him in.“It was a new voice and it was a more dedicated approach to training and it all just started to gel.”Within minutes of the throw-in, Gavin Conwell had blood gushing out of his nose and Craigbane had a penalty, which McGuigan missed.Eddie McElhinney, who came on for Conwell, slipped home a th minute goal to put them in the driving seat.Banagher lost Patrick ODonnell to a shoulder injury and when McGuigan tagged on three points, Craigbane were on track for victory.“It was close in the end, but it didnt reflect our superiority,” McGuigan adds.Banagher grabbed a late goal, but Craigbane held on for a - to - win and title number four.“I just remember the supporters going mad and streaming onto the pitch after the game,” was Fergal Moores memory of winning the game.“Going into those games, at that time, there was excitement, you knew there wasnt going to be much in it and everything was left on the pitch.”“The boys went over to Farahsafter the game and probably drunk the place dry,” McGuigan recalls.“It wouldve have been the main place,.The craic was great and there was always a Monday club,” Fergal Moore adds.There were no trips back to Tyrone on county final nights.*** DROP CAPITAL ***The  chapter was dferent.Craigbane were in five finals and lost all five by a point.In the same week of the Dr Kerlin Cup defeat to Banagher, they overturned the result to beat them in the championship, before going down to Faughanvale in a replay. By , Craigbane were top dogs again.After securing the Dr Kerlin Cup, it was like a fair day in Farahs.The story at the time was about the situation at Drumcree and local police resources were stretched.The bar was buzzing and it was the daylight hours before revellers spilled out on their way home.There was an interesting angle in the championship final that season.Alfie Dallas, Craigbanes  winning manager, was now in charge of Claudy.Low and behold, they met Craigbane in the final, with his son, Alfie junior, in fine fettle with seven points to his name in a comfortable win.“I have more memories of beating Banagher, because it meant more to us and we had already beaten Claudy,” Conrad McGuigan commented of the  success.It was  before the next championship title, again under Deeney and McElhinney.They needed a stroke of luck in the last minute against Slaughtmanus in a topsy turvy round one game.The sides were level when Sean Currans shot hit the crossbar and came out, only to be greeted by the final whistle.“We shouldve been out,” Fergal Moore admits.“They were straight through,it had went over the bar, we were out.”A suspension kept Gavin Conwell out of most of the championship.A re-fixed semi-final to a Friday night, hours before his ban ended, ruled him out of the win over Claudy.Fergal Crossans alsofor the final, after a summer in Chicago that saw him win North American Player of the Year and later a call to the Derry senior team.Victory over Newbridge in the final, who had just dropped down from senior, took Craigbane to six on the roll of honour.Before the official Ulster championship, Clontibret ran Ulster tournament and this was Craigbanesfirst venture following delay because of foot and mouth.“I remember us going over the border and having to go across a sheep-dip type thing, where everything had to be washed,” McGuigan remembers.It was new ground, new teams, food on the way and a bus journey to the game.With every round, they grew as a team.“We beat Belcoo, Termon, Beragh and Inniskeen,” came the list of the teams rolling off Fergal Moores tongue, of their passage to glory.“Inniskeen was a right hard game,” he remembers of their - to - win. “We beat Beragh - to five or six points.The Tyrone teams were always good and Beragh werent long down from senior...it was probably the easiest game we played.”Fergal retired five years ago from reserve football at the age of , having picked up a fth medal and a second Ulster in , as part of a  managed by his brother Kevin and containing nephews Lee, Ryan and Rory.Conrad finished up in , aged , but after having a great innings, he has a regret not to have hung on longer for the clubs seventh championship.“I had played a bit of reserve football.The legs were starting to go, my game was based on pace.I was so lucky and looking back it was the right time for me to stop.I wouldnt have been playing , but just to be part of it and missing the the buzz of being involved when the club is on a run.”Now, it is all about the next generation and McGuigan, like many around the club, is confident.If they can avoid a swathe of emigration, the future is bright.“There is enough talent within our club,we can get over the next few years, to win something at another level, whatever grade that might be.”When Gavin Conwell lted the Ulster Cup on a magical  night in Omagh, he called for a gathering the next day in the clubhouse.So all the young weans could see all the cups.It sounded impulsive, but it wasnt.It was time to strike when the iron was hot.A decade on, those youngsters are now the tools to build Craigbanes next team to challenge for a championship.\"More...

As more and more companies continue to get back to work, we look at how the financial support is helping firms across the nation to adapt, innovate and protect jobs. Here is an example of how companies have been helped, and what support is available. Business Lenders like Danske Bank in Northern Ireland have been working with the UK Government to provide vital financial support to companies experiencing lost or deferred revenue as a result of the pandemic. googletag.cmd.push They have appointed a dedicated head of business sector engagement to lead proactive engagement with businesses, raising awareness of the support available. Robert McCullough has taken on the important role. Speaking last month, he said: “Since the beginning of March, Danske Bank has provided poundmillion in overall business lending, including poundmillion through the UK government-backed Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme and poundmillion on the Bounce Back Loan Scheme.” The UK Government’s Bounce Back Loan Scheme grants finance of up to pound, to small and medium-sized businesses, interest-free for the first  months. Meanwhile, for companies with a turnover of up to poundmillion, the UK-wide Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme allows them to access up to poundmillion where the UK Government will pay interest and any fees for the first  months. googletag.cmd.push Danske Bank has also been able to provide relief of up to poundmillion to large businesses via the Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme. As the largest bank in Northern Ireland, Danske Bank supports companies in a wide iety of sectors, such as retailers Lunn’s Jewellers, manufacturers The Signature Works and in tourism, family-run bus company Airporter.  poundM LENDING: Danske Bank’s Robert McCullough Robert said: “Businesses in some industries have managed to adapt quickly to a new reality of remote working and social distancing, while others have regrettably seen trade grind to a halt. “The unprecedented measures announced by the government will help a lot of companies to survive and we are hopeful the majority will ultimately recover.” The bank was able to launch each of the Schemes on day one, the majority of applications being approved through an easy, automated process. “Getting this financial support in place in Northern Ireland was the result of a huge effort from teams across the Danske Bank and we continue to work hard to make sure the process is as good as it should be and that we can get money to our customers quickly. “There is no doubt that we have an important role to play in the weeks and months ahead to get Northern Ireland moving again. “We have the commitment and the capacity to continue to support customers, the community and the wider economy.”  FINDING A SOLUTION: Staff working at the Sunamp site in East Lothian When the Covid- pandemic arrived the chief executive officer of East Lothian firm Sunamp, knew the company could respond. Andrew Bissellsaid: “A week into lockdown I woke up in the middle of the night and just thought ‘we have to do something that makes the business relevant in this crisis’.” Mr Bissell turned to Sunamp’s innovative technology, developed in partnership with the University of Edinburgh. The company has led the way in the manufacture of heat batteries that store heat energy rather than electricity like conventional batteries. The applications of the technology span several industries, but the company’s focus has so far been on offering a product that replaces the hot water tank in heating systems with something smaller and more efficient. Recognising the potential of the technology in the context of Covid-, Sunamp was one of more than , companies to apply for grant funding from Innovate UK, the UK Government’s innovation agency. In April, Innovate UK launched the Fast Start initiative, with poundm of funding available to companies responding to the pandemic with some form of innovation. In the end, Sunamp was one of  companies to secure a grant.  The pound, award is being used to develop mobile handwash units that can be installed in locations where people lack access to hygiene facilities that can help prevent the spread of Covid-. Mr Bissell said: “You don’t need hot water to wash your hands, but it is much more comfortable. “Right now, we’re dealing with the virus in the summer time, but as we head into winter,you have to wash your hands outside a railway station or supermarket or vaccination centre, it will be much more pleasant to have warm water.” The idea has gained traction with Sunamp’s clients, with inquiries coming in rapidly even though the finished product is still in development. Mr Bissell said: “Covid- is a global problem so there’s widespread interest. “Sunamp has partnerships and licensing arrangements with businesses all around the world through which it sells its heat batteries, so the ambition for the mobile units is international.” For Mr Bissell, the appeal of the project is that in addition to its obvious commercial potential, there’s a real societal benefit. “There is no minimising the negatives of Covid-,” he said. “But there are many people stepping and doing amazing things.” Working with everything from gas boilers to solar and heat pumps, Sunamp says its Heat Batteries deliver hot water with efficiency and proven savings of up to  per cent on utility bills in residential, commercial or industrial settings. The types of support on offer to help your company… Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers. middot The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has enabled businesses to put employees on a period of temporary leaveand apply for a UK Government grant to cover  per cent of those workers’ usual monthly wage costs, up to pound, a month. middot The Self-Employment Income Support Scheme will allow eligible self-employed iniduals to claim a taxable grant of  per cent of their average monthly profits, up to pound,. middot UK VAT-registered firms have been given the option to defer VAT payments until the end of June.

The UK Government will provide the lender with an  per cent guarantee to support the lending. middot The Coronavirus Statutory Sick Pay Rebate Scheme will repay employers the current rate of Statutory Sick Pay they pay current or former employees for sickness starting on or after March , . middot The Future Fund will issue loans between pound, to pound million to innovative companies which are facing financing dficulties due to the coronavirus outbreak. , jobs in Northern Ireland have been furloughed through the Coronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme up to May . , claims amounting to pound million through the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme up tp May . %of those eligible for SEISS made a claim. The average value of a claim is around pound,.

The management at Foyleside, The Richmond Centre and Debenhams have clearly put a lot of timeand effortinto establishingand marking out one-way systems and there are plenty of signs in place reminding people to keep to the two metre social distance rule. You do be a bit nervous because youre looking at the floor, trying to make sure you are going the right way, said Mrs McLaughlin. Everything is well spaced out and the floors are all marked out.

Derrys small independent retailers are also slowly getting back to business after getting the go ahead this week, David Thomas, whose jewellery shop and workshop Thomas Goldsmith has operated from Pump Street for over  years, has been surprised that some of his fellow small traders havent reopned yet.  Ive just been for a walk round and Ive noticed that a large number of small independents arent openat the minute. This is the second dayinto it and they are taking their time to get back to work. Maybe thats their own choice. It surprisedme because to rebuild businessagain is important. For a lot of them who have furloughed staff and who are self employed as it were and are receiving payments they are thinking I wont risk it because theres a safety net there. But obviously that safety net is going to start disappearing. Business has been quite slow this week, but MrThomas is hopeful that shoppers will be back. We arecompleting the work we werent able to complete in March after the guillotine came down and we werent able to finish. And then we were hit by problems in the supply chain but that has started to ease up. In the last two weeks it has relaxed and things are filtering thoughnow. Were now able to complete things we should have done in March so weve stillgot that momentum from then, but in terms of work coming through its going to be a bit slow. There are a lot of people are being made redundant or who havent been able to claim grants and things like that. But on the other hand there are people who were furloughed and had to stay at home and werent able to spend money and they should have a fairly healthy bank account and they are desperate to get out and buy stuff. Mr Thomas has made changes to the way the shop operates in order to comply with the new regulations. Only one customer is admitted at a time, staff are usingfacemasks and hand sanitiser, and jewellery that has been tried on is being cleaned before it goes back on th shelf. People are understanding and respectful, remarked Mr Thomas. He feels that lockdown has given people time to reflect on their work le balance and lestyle. People are saying it will never be the same, he said. We were all chasing our tails a bit, workingvery hard. Does it have to be like that  Can we take things a bit easier  Do we have to be rushing off to Portugal on cheap flights  It has been strangeto sit at home in the garden and look up and see the skies totally clear. Many of Derrys charity shops have also reopened their doors, with Oxfam, Kinship Care, the Red Cross and Cancer Focus back in businessearlier this week. However, the three month closure has meant some stores are struggling with low stock levels. Deborah Tracey is the manager at Cancer Focus on Shipquay Street, which opened in May .  The shop reopened last Friday after a week of cleaning and preparation and have been busy ever since. Inside there is hand sanitiser at thedoor and a one-waysystem in place. Most people have been using the hand sanitiser before they come in, said Ms Tracey. We have been busy with people bringing stuff in and buying stuff too. People seem to feel confident coming out to shop now and theyare glad toget back to a bit of normality. Cancer Focus has amanager and deputy manager but all the other staff are volunteers. Some of our volunteers have been worried about coming back because they are older and more at risk, said MsTracy. So weare lookingfor newvolunteers now. We provide everyonewith shields, masks and gloves for their safety. Cancer Focus has also launched an appeal for donations. Any donations to the shop must be quarantined for  hours when we receive them, said Ms Tracy. We are looking for donations of clothes, bric-a-brac, shoes, bags and books. If you would like to make a donation to Cancer Focus or to enquire about becoming a volunteer telephone .

At present, hospitality businesses have to adhere to strict licensing laws in terms of serving outdoors. However, local councils have been encouraged by the Northern Ireland Executive to take a flexible approach to the situation to support the sector as it emerges from the coronavirus lockdown. Derry City and Strabane District Council is currently looking at ways it can help local businesses. They have launched a short survey asking for peoples opinions on the matter. The survey can be filled in here -https:bit.ly eohTnm googletag.cmd.push A council spokesperson said: The hospitality and retail industries have been some of the hardest hit in terms of lost revenue during COVID-. They will also be one of the last to fully emerge from the lockdown. With the impact of the pandemic and the resulting social distancing measures that must continue when businesses reopen it is essential that we start to reimagine how theservice industries can adapt and operate in the current circumstances.New business models and taking hospitality and trade outdoors will play a signicant part in the survival of the service industry locally. Using private and public spaces such as pavements, car parking spaces and events spaces such as Guildhall Square, Waterloo Place and the Canal Basin in Strabane could be part of the solution. googletag.cmd.push To achieve this, Council and key stakeholders including Department for Infrastructure and the Department for Communities will be adopting a flexible approach that seeks to facilitate innovation - whilst ensuring appropriate controls such as Insurance, disability access, enforcement and public health are in place.

Baby Michael MacHugh shocked his mum Sara and dad Conall in January of this year by arriving  weeks early. His parents were told that he had a % chance of survival. Michael ended up having to spend  weeks in hospital. During this time, Tinyle, a charity which supports families of premature babies, was a vital help to Sara and Conall. Michael is now at home and doing well but his family were keen to raise money for Tinyle. googletag.cmd.push Michael’s uncle Caolan , his dads identical twin, agreed to shave off his fair to support the charity.  Caolans friend, Owen Brady, also agreed to so the same thing, and, between them, the two men have managed to raise more than pound, for the charity. Michaels mum said it had been dficult time for their family. “Michael was born on th January  at  weeks + days gestation,  weeks early, weighing just lb oz. “He is now over lb at  weeks old. “His due date was th of April . Michael was born in Altnagelvin at .am and transferred to The Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast at pm that same day. googletag.cmd.push “He spent five and a half weeks in the Royal where he received four of his five blood transfusions and spent the last seven and a half weeks back in Altnagelvin, where he got his last blood transfusion. “During this hospital stay I was also told that a baby born at  weeks has a % survival rate, defying all the odds Michael is with us now, thankfully a happy healthy  week old. “He is smaller than other babies his age and developmentally has some catching up to do but he is a little fighter.” Sara said Tinyle had been a great support to them. “During our stay in hospital TinyLe were a huge support and continue to be there for us, by way of thanks we wanted to raise funds for the charity and so lockdown presented the perfect opportunity. “As lockdown has rolled on Michael’s uncle Caolan, his dads identical twin became increasingly in need of a visit to the barbers, we used this to our advantage and challenged Caolan to a head shave. “Caolan’s friend Owen Brady also braved the shave,” she added. “Our family and friends rallied their support and I’m delighted to say we have raised over pound, for for TinyLe.” Valerie Cromie, Head of Fundraising for TinyLe , said the funds raised would be put to good use. “We are greatly indebted to the MacHugh family for their generosity and to Caolan and Owen who were brave enough to take on the head shave challenge. “Funds raised will ensure families who experience the birth of a premature baby receive the practical and emotional support they need.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Dean O’Neill, from Drumsurn, died suddenly last week and mourners at his funeral yesterday heard how the news had left the community in shock. “The church would be absolutely packed todaythings were normal,” said Fr Seamus Kelly, officiating at the funeral. “The tragic news that spread throughout the area on Thursday morning stunned the whole community. “He was one of the most gted sportsmen to emerge in Drumsurn in recent years and it was lovely to see all the young people with their shirts on as his remains were being carried in.” googletag.cmd.push  Dean, known around the community as ‘Floater’, excelled on the sports field and Fr Kelly described him as ‘one of the most gted sportsmen to emerge from Drumsurn in recent years’. In the colours of St Patrick’s College, Dungiven, he was outstanding and won a Derry vocational schools’ All-Star award in . He represented St Matthew’s GAC and Kevin Lynch Hurling Club and carried his talent with modesty. Fr Kelly recalled how he deflected praise after a notable victory at minor level. “He covered every blade of grass in defence and attack but didn’t want any great glory,” he told the congregation. googletag.cmd.push “When Drumsurn and Drum amalgamated as St Patrick’s at minor level a few years ago, he gave an exhibition of football as he dragged his team back into contention and eventually saw them defeat Glenullin having been nine points down at half time. “He declared humbly, ‘sure Micheacuteal Archibald deserves praise more than me’. He loved sport and played Gaelic, soccer, hurling and basketball with distinction for the school.”  Dean in the colours of Kevin Lynch Hurling Club. Off the pitch, Fr Kelly told mourners how Dean had a great sense of fun and spoke of his great love for his family and friends. “He tortured friends and relations with pranks and jokes. He was very close to all his cousins and friends and kept in touch with them,” he said. “When his brother, Justin, go married, he was best man for him and was godfather to their first child, Taylor. He absolutely doted on her, as indeed he did on all his nephews and nieces. “I know how proud Justin and Jordan were of their brother Dean, but they all have wonderful memories as have Gertie, Rory and wider family and friends. “He met a lovely girl in Amber and it looked like they would settle down for good. Of course, he was not known as Dean, it was just ‘Floater’ to all his friends who loved him so much. “In recent times, he had settled a lot and went to live in Dungiven, although, he always insisted, he was a Drumsurn man.” Fr Kelly spoke of the great sadness within the community following his passing. “I’m well aware that Drumsurn is in a state of mourning, as Dean was so well-known and loved here,” he said. “However, we have a promise that death is not the end, but another step on the journey to eternal le. “Everyone who knew him, or even met him, loved him. He had an amazing personality that endeared him to all and had a relentless sense of fun. “To young and old, he was a legend. It has been the most common remark uttered over the past few days. What a character.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The funding is part of the Departments Major Capital Works Programme which will see nine schools in total benefit from improvements to their sites. St Patricks College, Maghera, and St Conors College, Kilrea and Clady are the two County Derry schools who will receive funding. Speaking today in the Assembly, Education Minister Peter Weir said the investment showed the Department was planning for the future. Improving the schools’ estate is one of my priorities and in the current unprecedented and dficult times, he said. googletag.cmd.push I hope this will send a strong signal to the local construction industry and local communities that the Department of Education is planning for the future and is committed to supporting the local economy and the wider community through the delivery of our capital programme. My Department’s capital programme aims to ensure that all our young people are educated in school facilities which are safe, secure and fit-for-purpose, enabling them to receive the quality education experience required to help them to fulfil their potential. St Conors College had been operating over two sites, in Kilrea and Clady, and principal Aine Bradley says the funding will help the transition to one site. googletag.cmd.push Our school community is thriving - since September  we have been living, learning and excelling together in the classroom and on the sports field, she said. Coming together in one building will give our school community even greater opportunity and a common goal. Our pupils will finally have access to the state of the art facilities and resources they deserve. I want to say thank you to the Governors, Staff, Pupils and School Communities in Kilrea and Clady for your patience, support and steadfast belief that we could achieve greatness together. Mid Ulster MLA Patsy McGlone welcomed the inclusion of St Patricks College, Maghera in the Departments plans. I have been in regular contact with St Patricks College, Maghera on the need for improvements to the school estate over recent years. I have had visits with Department officials, the school principal, the chair of the board of governors and Councillor Martin Kearney on site to see the school facilities. While the major capital works projects for St Patrick’s College will now progress to the design stage, work will not likely commence until the   financial year. When completed, pupils and staff at St Patrick’s College will benefit from the provision of modern, fit-for-purpose facilities.

Castledawson man Joe O’Kane posted a photograph online last week revealing a message his son had discovered while working on his aunt’s house in the Ballymena area. The message, decoratively presented in a sketched scroll, read: “Papered by Jack Kerr, King St Magherafelt. Painted by Joe Hughes of Moneyglass. The message also states that the named final member of the decorating crew done sweet f**k all! Jack Kerr was a painter who lived in King Street in the town and worked at the time for Seamus Keenan of Castledawson. He also ran a shop for a period on the street where he lived. googletag.cmd.push  Jack Kerrs shop on King St in Magherafelt. His brother, Dermot, said the practice of leaving a message was common. “That was a favourite thing to do down the years,” he told the County Derry Post. “I mind working in the Rectory in Magherafelt when I was at the painting too away in ’. Reverend McGonagle was coming in. “I came on a boy’s name from Aghagaskin, Surgenor I think it was, and it was written way before the turn of the century.” The practice led to Dermot making a remarkable discovery of coincidence as he peeled back some wallpaper in the late s. googletag.cmd.push “I was working on a job near the Loup – they were doing repairs and I was doing the painting for it. I started digging off the wallpaper in the hall of this farmhouse,” he said. “It was big, respectable farmhouse, about  acres. I wasn’t there an hour until I came across names on the ceiling, under the ceiling paper. “It was my father’s name. I was doing the job on Monday, May  in  and I came on my father’s name from May , .” Jack Kerr, second from the right in this  ODonovan Rossa Old Crocks team. The Kerrs were also a musical family, with one particular instrument appealing to the brothers. “Jack played the trumpet and saxophone and his brother Desmond played the saxophone and clarinet. Another brother, Albert, in Castledawson, played the saxophone too,” said Dermot. “Jack played in the Northern Swing Orchestra and they were always on that pantomime in the town, but it stopped in  when Fr Owen died. “I started with the brass band when I was  in the town, an independent brass band, but then I started to play football and forgot about the brass band.” Dermot Kerr was also able to shed some light on the identity of his brother’s colleagues and said Leslie Hepburn did a little more than the pencilled message suggests. Joe Hughes was originally from Moneyglass but now lives in Dunloy, County Antrim, and told us about the process of leaving their mark. “You went in and stripped the wall and before you papered it, you put a scroll on it and wrote the names on it,” he said. “I would have worked with Jack at the time, but It was Seamus Keenan we worked for and that was our trademark when we were in doing them up. It’s many a house you would see that on!”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Reverend Katie McAteer’s appointment to the Chapter of the Cathedral Church of St Columb is one of two announced today by the Bishop of Derry and Raphoe, Rt Reverend Andrew Forster. Reverend Robert Boyd, the Rector of Glendermott and Newbuildings Parish, has also been appointed a Canon.By happy coincidence, today - the Feast Day of St John the Baptist - is the anniversary of both new canons’ ordinations. Rev Boyd and Rev McAteer will fill the positions left vacant following the departure of the Ferry brothers – Rev Canon David, who has retired, and Rev Malcolm, who has become the Rector of Agherton Parish in Portstewart. googletag.cmd.push Rev McAteer, who is the Pastoral Director of the Christ Church, Culmore, Muff and St Peter’s Group of Parishes, said she was humbled and honoured by the appointment.“When Bishop Andrew first asked me, I was totally taken aback,” Rev McAteer said. “It was never on my radar, never in a million years – or even  years – would I have expected the Bishop to ask me to accept this appointment. “St Columb’s Cathedral, probably more than any other cathedral, has been a history-maker – the first cathedral built in these islands after the Reformationplaying a leading role as a place of reconciliation – and now another brick is being laid in its rich history. googletag.cmd.push “I still keep thinking, ‘No, not me. It can’t be me.’ It’s exciting. It’s quite daunting. I’m humbled and honoured.” Rev McAteer, whose father was a Canon of Chester Cathedral, evoked the words of the Ordination Service. “Throughout ministry, whatever God calls us to do, we pray that He will give us ‘the needful gts of grace’ to fulfil that ministry. I’m hoping that this is at God’s direction I can only do this in God’s strength.” While this isnew territory for Rev McAteer, the second new canon is on familiar ground. Rev Boyd, was a Canon of St Patrick’s Cathedral in Armagh until three years ago, a position he relinquished when he was appointed incumbent of the Parish of Glendermott and Newbuildings. He has since taken up the role of Diocesan Director of Ordinands for Derry and Raphoe. “I feel very privileged and very honoured by the appointment,” Rev Boydsaid.  “I’m extremely grateful to Bishop Andrew for having the confidence in me to appoint me to this role and for thinking me worthy of it. I think it’s an honour, too, for the Parish of Glendermott and Newbuildings, so I’m very pleased that our parishioners are also being acknowledged and recognised by the Bishop.” The installation of a new canon is a signicant and joyful occasion for any cathedral but given its uniqueness, the forthcoming Service of Installation in St Columb’s – with its historical first – will arouse considerable interest within the Church of Ireland and beyond. A date has yet to be fixed for the Service but it is hoped it will take place in the early autumn. St Columb’s Cathedral, which was completed in , was the first Anglican cathedral built in the British Isles after the Reformation in .

Void Gallery is ‘delighted’ to announce artists Alan Phelan and David Beattie as the recipients of the Plinth Commissions for  and . The Walker Memorial Plinth was built in  - a  metre high column topped by a five metre high statue of the Reverend George Walker who was Governor of the city during the siege of Derry in . The column and statue were blown up by the IRA in . googletag.cmd.push The remaining plinth and its historical signicance have meant it has been a contentious space in the city. Funded by the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Plinth Commissions is a collaboration between Void Gallery, The Siege Museum and Friends of the Derry Walls. The ambition of the commission is to reclaim the space as a public area for collaboration and collective participation. Through an open call, artists both North and South of the border were invited to propose a project involving the community that surrounds the Plinth, creating sculptural interventions as part of the collaboration. The first commission by Dublin-based artist Alan Phelan will launch in September . googletag.cmd.push Phelan’s project is a crowd-sourced sculpture made by inidual participants in isolation, then assembled together to create the final artwork. This collective making process acknowledges and commemorates the COVID- crisis. The sculpture will be of a hyacinth flower using the red, green and blue colours with petals made in papier-macirccheacute, based around a small similar work due to be exhibited at Void Gallery as part of Phelan’s exhibition ‘echoes are always more muted’ which launches at the same time. Alan Phelan commented: “I am delighted to be part of the Plinth Commissions for . “My idea is to work with the community to mark this strange time we have all experienced and harness the people power of socially distanced activity to make this public sculpture. “I look forward to working with Void Engage and bringing people together by staying apart, as they say, for this project.” Launching in , David Beattie proposes a project that will unfold as an invitation to the community to collectively examine the River Foyle as an interconnecting body of water, a richness of bioersity, and a measure of perpetual time. Participants will be invited to connect with the river through a series of engagements that record their experiences and allow them to rethink their relationship with the river and their natural environments. The project will culminate in a sound recording that will be played from the Plinth and will mark the high and low tide of the river, bringing awareness of the rhythm of the river, and movement of time to people within the city. David Beattie, who is also from Dublin, said he was delighted to be selected for this unique commission. “It feels extra special to be supported to produce new artwork during a precarious time for artists and art workers. “I look forward to working alongside the team at Void and the communities on both sides of the River Foyle to realise the project for the Walker Plinth.” Void Director Mary Cremin added: “We are very excited about this public art programme that we have been developing in partnership with The Siege Museum and the Friends of the Derry Walls. “It is a signicant moment to have this plinth reclaimed as a public space when you consider how contentious public monuments and memorials are in this current moment in time,” added Ms Cremin.

Those behind the ambitious project are confident that the ious stories will appeal to both locals and visitors alike.Other interpretative  will tell of the emigration of families from Saintfield to the United States over the last  years, using the example of the three Maffett brothers who left Leggygowan for America, the first in , followed by a further two brothers in .It is one of their descendants, David Moffett, who has made this precious community asset possible.Saintfield Development Association officials, who played a lead role in securing the new community centre, approached the owners of the Windmill Road field and began protracted negotiations to secure the site, with the all-important funding to acquire the land obtained through Mr Moffettrsquos generous donation.A successful business executive with a well-known company in America, his family had links with the area dating back to the early th century, with Mr Moffettrsquos ancestral, family including James and Isabella Maffett and their children, buried in the graveyard at Saintfield Parish Church.Explaining the background to the heritage park proposal, a spokesman for the Development Association explained that a successful funding bid was submitted to the Heritage Lottery Fund for money to carry out necessary feasibility studies on the field.ldquoThese studies have since been completed to the satisfaction of the funder and have shown that there are no impediments for the field to be developed as a community heritage park, he explained.ldquoThese studies will also provide evidence for the necessary planning application for the change of use of the field from agricultural to community use.The spokesman also confirmed that consultants who carried out the feasibility studies of the field also compiled a list of proposals for the development which include measures to obviate as much as possible any disruption or annoyance to neighbouring residents through noise or anti-social behaviour.Public consultation on the proposals will be undertaken once the current pandemic restrictions are sufficiently eased and, following this process, the Development Association intends to raise the funds needed to implement the agreed proposals by applying for suitable grants.There will also be community fundraising.In addition, Newry, Mourne and Down Council has been asked to approve a new link being created between the community centre and proposed heritage park. The issue was under discussion prior to the coronavirus pandemic.Rowallane councillor Robert Burgess has praised all those involved in the project and hopes that the remaining pieces in the development jigsaw fall into place.ldquoThis is a terric development that not only local people can enjoy, but one which visitors to the town can also enjoy and learn so much about Saintfield and its people, he said.ldquoWe are fortunate to have the new community centre up and running and developing a new heritage park would represent further success for the town. Great credit must go Saintfield Heritage Society and townrsquos hardworking Development Association.Cllr Burgess added Saintfield was ldquovery fortunate to have extremely committed community iniduals who have the town and its people very much at heart.Full details of the proposes heritage park proposal are available at discoversaintfield..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Butler look after royalty and presidents  ","story":"FRANCIS McBriar has been a butler to four generations of the Royal Family, served US and Irish presidents and Northern Ireland Secretaries of State.However, he has only one mantra in his mind every time he dons his smart unorm mdash and that is he treats everyone the same.The farmerrsquos son who lives just outside Saintfield with his we Heather has butlered for  years. For those in the know, hersquos the man to reach out foryou have a special occasion or dinner event coming up.Regularly employed by the Earl of Erne at his Fermanagh residence, Crom Castle, Francis was recently featured doing what he does best in the RTE food series, Lords and Ladles.The  year-old was introduced to Hillsborough Castle, the Royal Familyrsquos official residence when they are in Northern Ireland, by the castlersquos late and highly regarded former house manager, David Anderson.ldquoI wouldnrsquot be where I am today without David Anderson, itrsquos as simple as that, said Francis.ldquoWe met through First Saintfield Church which David joined when he moved into the area. We were part of a group looking after senior people of the congregation and we would have worked together hosting dinners and bus outings and so on.ldquoOne day David turned to me and said, lsquoFrancis you are a very adaptable person, you could be a great help to meyou would like to bersquo.ldquoI was invited up to Hillsborough Castle to work with him and things just took off from there. I enjoy working with people and always went out with the intention of helping others and to make sure that they enjoyed their day, or their dinner. I also always found it easy to chat away to people.At that time, Francis was working as a distribution manager for a group of fashion shops and was the father of three young children with no thoughts of a future career in butlering.Today, he works mostly at Crom Castle and, closer to home, at Montalto House in Ballynahinch, but also looks after an American family when they travel to the British Isles.They take Francis wherever they go, sometimes to the Scottish Highlands and hopefully inSeptember to their Dorset property.ldquoIrsquom hoping that it still happens, admits Francis, whose work, like many others, has been affected by the Covid- pandemic.ldquoI really enjoy it and I love to travel. It doesnrsquot bother me being away from home for maybe several weeks at a time. My family are grown up with families of their own and I think my we is quite content to see me going out and about as she gets her head showered.He and Heather have three children, Robert, Anita and James, and a grandchild, George, who will be one year old soon. A second grandchild is due any day now.Having, in his words, ldquolooked after the late Queen Mother, the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh, their children and Prince Charlesrsquo children, the likes of President Bush, Irish presidents Mary McAleese and Michael D Higgins, Francis admits his disappointment at missing out on meeting Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge.He said: ldquoItrsquos been lovely to look after the Royal Family and a few years ago I was invited up to look after Prince William. I was so looking forward to looking after the couple but unfortunately that was the day the Duchess announced she was pregnant with Prince Louis and couldnrsquot fly over. So I missed that opportunity and would have loved to have met Kate.He believes that having served royalty, he can serve anyone and his nerve has never let him down so far.ldquoI think perhaps once you have attended to the people at Hillsborough Castle, it takes any nerves away, said Francis. ldquoYou think wellI can serve the Queen, then I can serve anyone. No-one is better than anyone  in my eyes. I just go in and do my best for whoever Irsquom looking after.For most people, the role of butler is quite rare today but in the days of stately and larger homes a bulter was the head male servant in a large household and his job was to manage the work of all the other servants.Francis agrees that his role is similar to that of the most famous butler in recent times, Carson, from the hit TV series and movie, Downton Abbey.ldquoThe whole point of being a butler is be unobtrusive but close at hand in the backgroundyou are needed. You need to judge when not to overstay your welcome when you are at the table.ldquoWhat happens there, stays there. I suppose I have developed a reputation for being discreet and I try to be. I would never tell others the conversations I hear around the table. As far as Irsquom concerned, everything is private.ldquoI treat everyone the same, no matter what their position in le, These people are paying my wages. I believe that nobody is better than anyone . If they are there at the table, then Irsquom there to look after them.Unlike Carson, who had to extract Lady Mary out of a number of compromising situations, Francis has never come across anyone who was the worst for wear for drink or found in an embarrassing situation.ldquoI must admit that in the circles I would be in, Irsquove never come across anyone over-indulging. My job is really to be able to turn my hand to anything and to look after people. The butler is really in charge of the household. When I go to work at Crom Castle, the Earl tells me lsquoFrancis, yoursquore in charge, itrsquos over to yoursquo.Working with some of the best chefs around, Francis admits that hersquos been treated to some delicious dining experiences through his work.ldquoI honestly donrsquot see what I do as work. Itrsquos not workyou love what you do, he said..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Developers asked to show interest in Irish Street site  ","story":"DEVELOPERS will shortly be asked to submit expressions of interest in transforming a major site in the heart of Downpatrick to help bolster the townrsquos economic recovery.The Department for Communities and Newry, Mourne and Down Council are driving ambitious plans to redevelop a near two acre site encompassing the former Irish Street police station, a number of adjacent empty buildings and the local authority-owned car park.While it was feared that the coronavirus pandemic could delay plans to redevelop of the huge site, work has continued on the project with a new brochure produced to provide would-be developers and other interested parties with an overview of the sitersquos potential and secure expressions of interest.The development site stretches as far back as St Patrickrsquos Avenue and is also adjacent to the Irish Street car park, with council officials looking to make the brochure available to the public virtually.Described as a ldquostrategic and prominent location in the heart of Downpatrick, senior council officials, politicians and members of the business community are excited at the Irish Street sitersquos development potential and are working towards drawing up a development brief.While the former police base enjoys protected status, it is hoped that potential developers will be able to come up with an imaginative plan for the historic building and that a preferred bidder will be appointed as early as October and as late as the end of the year.The council and the Department for Communities are keen to revitalise Irish Street and hope its redevelopment will act as a catalyst for the wider economic and social regeneration of the town.Council officials say that the Irish Street project is vital to the recovery of the local economy, improving the wellbeing of the community and a welcome confidence boost for the construction sector.In addition, they insist that theyrsquore committed to working with the Downpatrick business community, residents and other stakeholders on the redevelopment of the site and want to hear their feedback on the way forward.The steering group set up to oversee the Downpatrick scheme held a recent progress meeting and council chairwoman Laura Devlin said she was delighted with the projectrsquos momentum.She confirmed that councillors and local authority officials have been working with the Department for Communities and local stakeholders to develop an lsquoonline engagement processrsquo.She explained this is designed to inform the preferred end uses for the Irish Street site and allow key stakeholders to have input into the development brief which is critical to the success of the project.ldquoWhile the Downpatrick regeneration scheme is in the early developmental stages, it will also stimulate signicant investment for the local economy, she added.John Armstrong, from the Construction Employers Federation, said the scheme and a number of others the council is planning for the Newry area, will provide a boost for the local construction sector.South Down MP Chris Hazzard and Downpatrick councillors Dermot Curran and Oonagh Hanlon have welcomed the progress being made on redeveloping he site.Mr Hazzard described the regeneration project as a ldquounique and exciting opportunity, one which has the potential to unlock much-needed economic and social opportunity for the town centre and wider community.ldquoThis regeneration project must act as a catalyst for the long overdue expansion of the townrsquos evening and weekend economy its new heartbeat in some respects, he continued.ldquoGiven the sitersquos close proximity to nearby homes, the project must also be viewed as more than a commercial development. It must seek to bind together the town centre with the outlying housing developments and consequently look to improve the economic and social wellbeing of the local community.Cllr Curran agreed that the Irish Street site offered a ldquounique opportunity for the development of business, employment and tourism.He thanked council committees and Department for Infrastructure for supporting the project.He said: ldquoThe Irish Street project represents the single biggest change to the town centre in a generation. It has the potential to transform Downpatrick and itrsquos vital everyone works together to make the regeneration proposal a major success.ldquoThe planned redevelopment is one of the most important projects ever proposed for Downpatrick and it is vital to make the most of the opportunities it presents. The proposal has the potential to add a new vibrancy with local people helping shape how this key site will be transformed.Cllr Hanlon said she was pleased that the next stage of the sitersquos redevelopment is ready for launch, allowing potential developers and interested parties an opportunity to view the site online, with feedback from the local community welcomed.ldquoPeople will be able to give their views on the potential for the site and the likely constraints within any proposed project, she explained. ldquoAny feedback would be used to assist both the council and Department for Communities to prepare a development brief for the site.Cllr Hanlon added: ldquoThe project to redevelop the former police base and surrounding area provides an opportunity to reinvigorate the Downpatrick town centre. This is the opportunity of a generation to restore a vibrant town centre and will build on the ongoing regeneration of the Irish Street area..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"DNA testing plans to catch owners over dog fouling  ","story":"DOG owners who fail to clean up after their pets could soon find themselves in court after local politicians agreed to investigate the potential of using DNA testing to catch offenders.Newry, Mourne and Down Council officers have been instructed to examine the merits of testing dog dirt in a bid to trace animals whose owners allow them to use public areas as open air toilets.Under the scheme, a sample of dog dirt would be taken for analysis to trace the identity of the animal, with the owner being subsequently prosecuted.Agreement for officers to research the DNA issue was given at last weekrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Neighbourhood Services Committee following a proposal tabled by Rowallane councillor Patrick Brown.Dog dirt poses a major health risk, especially to children, who could potentially lose their sight as a result of coming into contact with it.Cllr Brown said there was a need to consider innovative ways of tackling the issue which has been raised on a regular basis by elected representatives across the local authorityrsquos seven DEAs.He is keen for the local authority to investigate the viability of using DNA testing in a bid to identy offenders and aid enforcement officers to dish out fines, suggesting that council officers draw upon best practice from other organisations who have introduced such a scheme in a bid to crack down on the dog fouling issue.Council officials say they will need to understand the time and resources required to implement such a scheme before compiling a report on its potential implementation.Cllr Billy Walker has welcomed the decision to investigate the DNA issue and says he cannot understand why dog owners to do not clean up after their pets.He said that the problem was district-wide and hoped that offenders will end up being prosecuted.ldquoI am an advocate of naming and shaming people on this particular issue but it is not a road which the council has been keen to go down. However,we use DNA technology to catch dog owners who allow their pets to foul public areas, their identity will be made publicthey end up in court, he continued.ldquoDog fouling problem is a highly contentious issue and, without doubt, one of the single most complained about problems across our district.

Powys.NRW proposed the dam as one option to alleviate potential flood risk.More NewsVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldMillions become unpaid carers due to coronavirus crisisPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownThe campaign by the Save Dinas Powys Woods and Protect Homes from Flooding group was launched in March  after the Woodland Trust said NRW was proposing to build a dam within its site of Cwm George and Casehill Woods.The group said the proposals would involve cutting down  square metres of trees including  square metres of ancient trees and regular flooding upstream during high rainfall would result in further destruction of ancient trees, hedgerows, wildle, and plants.Dormice and other protected species like bats were at risk, the group said.The woods, much-loved by the community, attracts visitors from other areas and is the Woodland Trustrsquos most visited site in Wales with more than , visitors.Hundreds of people took part in marches in  to oppose the dam.NRW released its draft Outline Business Case in February  and a consultation period with the local community took place.Hundreds of people attended a meeting in February to oppose the dam and they wrote to NRW, with their views, during the coronavirus lockdown.Chairman of Save Dinas Powys Woods  Protect Homes From Flooding, Peter Smith said the group welcomed the announcement that NRW will not develop a dam in the Dinas Powys Woods.ldquoLocal people recognise the flood risk in the village, but are overwhelmingly in favour of a natural flood management programmein the Cadoxton River and Eastbrook catchments, plus improved channel maintenance andrequired local hard defences, rather than an environmentally unfriendly dam, Dr Smith said.ldquoOur proposals will slow the flow of the rivers upstream thus reducing the risk of flash flooding, and by removing obstacles improve flow downstream.ldquoWe now look forward to working with NRW and The Woodland Trust to design an effective NFM scheme.ldquoBoth have expertise in this area, and, having made funds available for NFM projects, we know that the Welsh Government is keen for Wales to become an exemplar of good practice. community involvement and support will remain key features of our campaign.He added: ldquoWe are grateful to people far and wide who have supported our campaign, including the Woodland Trust, our local community councils, and county councillors.ldquoWe extend our particular thanks our local MS, Jane Hutt, for her advocacy and support.Community councillor, Chris Franks said NRW must not now ignore any problems.ldquoClearly over the years there has been reduced spending on maintenance of the stream through Dinas Powys and towards Barry, he said.ldquoThe public has said that the NRW must improve monitoring of flows on the Cadoxton River, implement natural flood management measures and improve flow at Cardf Road bridge where the stream passes under the A to reduce flood risk.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquolsquoFollowing our meeting on May  Sir David Henshaw chairman of NRW wrote to me on May  to say that NRW received almost  responses to our consultation on the Outline Business Case with the vast majority being opposed to the upstream storage option on the Cadoxton Brook.NRW chairman, Sir Henshaw said: ldquoWhen we consider the marginal case for this option, it is therefore clear that we will not be pursuing an upstream storage scheme. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url

has spoken of the plight of rural communities during lockdown in Uganda.Three months ago, Jenipher Wetaka Sambazi, a Fairtrade coffee farmer from the Mt Elgon region in Uganda, was sharing her experiences of the benefit of Fairtrade in Penarthrsquos Tabernacle Baptist Church.More NewsVictory in campaign to save Dinas Powys ancient woodland as dam plan is abandonedVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownNow she and her family, like communities around the world, are under lockdown.In March, campaigners, businesses, supporters, and students from around Wales heard Jenipherrsquos story, face to face.Now she is unable to travel or even meet with her neighbours.This means the coffee picked at the end of the last harvest remains on the mountain and Jenipher and her fellow farmers are prohibited from travelling to gather it for processing under the current lockdown rules.There are currently several hundred known cases of covid- in Uganda, but none in the Mount Elgon region and no fatalities in Uganda as yet.Farmers want to keep it this way, but lockdown is causing other concerns such as limiting access to food and healthcare.This is the time of year when there is the least amount of food available, and the closing of markets and freedom to travel for farmers to source food and water means that times are exceptionally hard.Jenipher as vice-chairwoman of a Fairtrade coffee cooperative, is responsible for many who rely on the cooperative for work.The expert hand-sorters who are seasonal workers and rely on this part of the coffee chain to feed their family at this time, have no coffee to sort.While they may have some spare eggs, vegetables or matoke to trade, the threat of soldiers prohibiting them from doing so is too much for them.Farmer co-operatives, an essential element of Fairtrade, enable and encourage communities to work together.Fairtrade also requires an extra amount of money, the Fairtrade premium, to be paid to producers.Fairtrade farmers like Jenipher are struggling, but they have the benefits of a strong local community as well as the backup of the Fairtrade premium.Fairtrade International have announced a .m euro Fairtrade Producer Relief fund targeting the immediate needs and Resilience Fund to help producers rebuild their businesses after Covid-.Jenipher Wettaka Sambazi said: ldquoLe is hard.ldquoThe markets are shut so there is nowhere to sell or earn money, or to buy food and basic essentials.ldquoLocal health centres have been shut to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, but since all transport is banned, those who need operations, treatment or antenatal care need to walk  km to the nearest hospital.ldquoTwo women and their unborn babies have died on the way.\"Roger Casey, who attends Tabernacle Baptist Church said: ldquoIt was wonderful to meet Jenipher and hear her story.ldquoWe get through a lot of coffee in our office and meeting a real coffee farmer from Uganda makes you think about the real people and real lives behind that Fairtrade logo.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquoMeeting Jenipher during her visit to Wales earlier this year was inspiring.ldquoThe increasing dficulties facing rural farming communities because of the pandemic has shown how important Fairtrade cooperatives continue to be and I am glad that leaders like Jenipher continue to promote the benefits of Fairtrade and to support communities.National co-ordinator of Fair Trade Wales, Aileen Burmeister added: ldquoFair Trade producers are being impacted by covid- restrictions.ldquoGlobal stock markets are falling, meaning that farmers and workers are receiving far less for their produce.\"It is in these times that we can really see how important the Fairtrade minimum price is. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

ldquoThe best part of le-boating is working well as a team.ldquoWe maintain this team spirit by regularly exercising and training both ashore and afloat.ldquoSince opening our new station at the south

favourite rsquoshoutsrsquo are oddly those which occur in the early hours of the morning on a spring day.ldquoBy the time the job has been completed and the boats are washed down and prepared again

These include:Communication of health information, and how effective it isCultural issues relating to the suitability of health and social services for BAME communitiesIncome and employment insecurity, which is experienced disproportionately by BAME communitiesPoor quality of ethnicity data, which is preventing accurate analysisHousing overcrowding and environmentThe financial burden created by migration statusThe role of structural and systemic racism and disadvantage.The report is by the BAME Covid- expert advisory group, set up by First Minister Mark Drakeford to look at the reasons why people from BAME communities were more likely to be adversely affected by coronavirus.:One of its two sub-groups was tasked with examining the socio-economic factors, chaired by Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna, professor of management and organization at Cardf Business School, Cardf University.\"Therersquos an overall theme running through our research for this report. It centres on long-standing racism and disadvantage, and the lack of BAME representation within decision-making processes,\" said Professor Ogbonna, who is also a trustee and vice-chair of Race Council Wales.ldquoThe coronavirus pandemic is, in some respects, revealing the consequences of a lack of action on race equality.ldquoMany of the issues wersquove highlighted have been identied and discussed previously, but they havenrsquot been addressed in any systematic and sustained way.Analysis of Covid- related deaths across England and Wales by ethnicity showed that people from a black ethnic background are at a greater risk of death involving COVID- than all other ethnic groups.The Office for National Statistics study showe that the risk for black males has been more than three times higher than white males, and nearly two-and-a-half times higher for black females than white.Adjusting for socio-economic factors and geographical location partly explains the increased risk, but there remains twice the risk for black males and around one-and-a-half times for black females. Signicant dferences also remain for Bangladeshi, Pakistani and Indian men. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Despite the fact she admits she hated running, she decided to undertake a huge challenge when the lockdown started – km in  days.The -year-old wanted to do something to motivate herself, improve her emotional wellbeing and remind people that the service centre was still there for children even during the lockdown. Importantly, it would also raise much needed funds for NSPCC Northern Ireland’s Childhood Day.The service centre where Michelle works, is based at Carn Drive in Craigavon and delivers NSPCC’s Letting The Future In and Turn the Page services.Letting the Future In focuses on helping children and young people recover from the traumatic and negative effects of sexual abuse and to rebuild their lives, while Turn the Page helps children and young people overcome the experiences and feelings that have led tothem displaying harmful sexual behaviour towards others. Covid- has caused huge dficulties for the team in Craigavon because it is vital to maintain contact and the all-important relationship between the treatment workers and the young people but face-to-face contact wasn’t possible because of the lockdown. The centre has adapted to the situation by keeping in touch with appropriate apps and video calls which offer young people an opportunity to access support in their own environment but still maintain relationships with their workers.Michelle also has her own personal reasons for wanting to raise funds for NSPCC Northern Ireland.She said: “As a survivor of sexual abuse myself, I realise that the lockdown is a particularly dficult time because it can trigger traumas from the past such as the feelings of powerlessness, fear of threat to le and being ‘held captive’ by the virus through isolation and reduced connection to other people.“It can be hard to get motivated during such strange times so I decided to do something positive that would improve my overall emotional wellbeing whilst also raising money for NSPCC Northern Ireland and creating awareness of some of the work we do.“As a child I benefited from support from The NSPCC at a time when no one  believed in me and this has given me a real passion for the work I do now. It is so important that children who have been affected by child sexual abuse get all the help and support they need to help them recover and I can see that the staff at NSPCC still carry the same belief that children can and do survive the trauma of sexual abuse.”Michelle’s event has been a huge success.She said: “I have to admit, it has been tougher than I thought initially. As someone who hates running and has done very little, I think I underestimated it! However I have noticed a big improvement in my emotional wellbeing and sleep since beginning the challenge. I have definitely felt motivated by the support and all the generous donations and this has really spurred me on.“Above all, I just wanted to give something back to NSPCC as I believe I wouldn’t be where I am today without their support in the past. I also wanted to raise awareness about the taboo in our society surrounding sexual abuse and topromote our belief that children can and do recover with the right support.“Joanne McMaster, Supporter Fundraising Manager for Northern Ireland, added: “We are hugely grateful to Michelle for undertaking this wonderful fundraising initiative for NSPCC’s Childhood Day. “This is NSPCC Northern Ireland’s third Childhood Day and is taking place on June  and in the run up to the day, we are asking peopleto stand with us and support our work - there are lots of fun and simple ways toget involved. “This year, Childhood Day is encouraging the peopleto ‘Be a big kid’ and raise money to help us be here for children. This could include organising a childhood themed quiz night, getting sponsored to dress up for the day or holding a mini sports day in your back garden but in all cases, remembering to follow the latest social distancing rules. There are lots more ideas on how to get involved and suggestions for fun events on our website www.nspcc.org.uk childhoodday“Funds raised by the day could not come at a better time because we are growing increasingly concerned about the number of children who will experience abuse or neglect due to the impact of coronavirus, with families struggling with lockdown, job losses and school closures. By supporting Childhood Day you are raising awareness and crucial funds to enable us to keep children and young people safe.”If you would like to contribute to Michelle’s fundraising, go to www.justgiving fundraising Michelle-Duffy For further information on how you can get support NSPCC’s Childhood Day, visit www.nspcc.org.uk childhoodday or contact the NSPCC Northern Ireland Team at northernirelandappeals@nspcc.org.uk or   .--A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

take our environmental responsibilities into account,” said the Deputy Lord Mayor.“For example, this council is currently buying flowers from outside Northern Irelandbut we have a number of large nurseries within our own borough.“We should also bear in mind that that transport and energy costs are major contributesto green house gas emissions.“We need to look at the wording of framework for contracts and to be more proactive in encouraging local companies to apply for contracts.“As a farmer, I can see first hand the pressure that is facing our industry with the AgricultureBill andthe prospectof food imports of chlorinated chicken and hormone beef which are illegal to produce in Northern Ireland.”The motion was adopted by the Chamber and a report on the issues will be brought forward in due course.Adam Morton , Local Democracy Reporting Service\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\"
