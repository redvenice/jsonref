We’re learning to live with Covid.’The move will see Covid-19 treated in a similar way to other infectious diseases such as flu, with people encouraged to stay at home if they were ill.The Prime Minister\u0027s official spokesman said: ‘We would never recommend anyone goes to work when they have an infectious disease.’The prospect of the removal of the remaining restrictions, which also include the ability for councils to order the closure of premises where the virus could be spreading, has caused unease for some of those most at risk from the disease.Phillip Anderson, head of policy at the MS Society, said ending the restrictions will ‘heap yet more worry and confusion on thousands of immunocompromised people’. James Taylor from disability equality charity Scope, said: ‘Scrapping self-isolation will mean that some disabled people will be feeling very anxious and could potentially be placed in situations that could prove deadly.’The Government\u0027s plan is expected to set out further information for vulnerable groups but officials also believe ‘cutting edge treatments’ will also mitigate some of the risks.Paul Hunter, professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, said while there were grounds for optimism in the overall data on deaths and hospital admissions, he had concerns about the vulnerable and people who may not have responded as well to the vaccines.Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading said: ‘If the requirement on infected iniduals to isolate at home is lifted as indicated, it will be an experiment which will either be shown to be very brave or very stupid, but nobody knows for sure what the result will be.’Professor Peter Openshaw, who advises the Government on Covid through the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group, said he would be ‘very reluctant’ to suggest this was the end of Covid, adding it was ‘still a very nasty virus’.Figures published on Wednesday show Covid-19 infection levels have risen in three of the four UK nations, with only Wales showing a fall.Scotland and Northern Ireland both saw an increase last week in the number of people in private households likely to have coronavirus, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). England also saw a rise, though the trend here is ‘uncertain’, the ONS added.The figures show there is still a high prevalence of the virus across the country, with infections remaining well above pre-Christmas levels.Around one in 19 people in private households in England had Covid-19 in the week to February 5, or 2.8 million people, up from one in 20, or 2.6 million people, in the week to January 29."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8da30c5878933de7ee13b9c054591a20ae5b35a/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=a15b5d364bcaeea4c9e2207d8856df6c","title":"manchester city v brentford tottenham v southampton premier league live","story":"The surprise leaders extend their advantage at the top to five points, thanks to a last-gasp penalty.Bournemouth leapfrog Blackburn to get back into the top two, while Forest make the top six for the first time this season.Leaders Celtic survive an Aberdeen comeback, Rangers stay on their tail, and Dundee leapfrog St Johnstone at the bottom.A routine win for the leaders, a precious point for Norwich, and a spectacular comeback win for Saints, who put a dent in Tottenham’s top-four hopes."},{"url":null,"title":"college","story":"Options to consider \u0026ndash and reasons to be cheerful \u0026ndash when selecting your move after the examJunior Cycle and Leaving Cert exams to commence on Wednesday, June 8thThe fairness of some aspects of the college application system is open to questionMinister for Education confirms move for Leaving Cert and Junior Cert studentsSudden shift to pre-pandemic standards is not expected, says Department of EducationYou need to register now to apply for college through the CAO, but you have until July 1st to make a final decision on your course choiceCAO 2022: Most applicants get an outcome which enables them to successfully progress to the next stage of their educational journeyFrom nursing to engineering and environmental studies, there\u0026rsquos plenty of choiceThe Higher Education Access Route and Disability Access Route to Education schemes offer equitable access to higher education."},{"url":null,"title":"dublin city chief does not believe figures on vacant units","story":"Owen Keegan, chief executive of Dublin City Council. File photograph: Cyril ByrneThe number of vacant properties in Dublin City has been overblown, and in a high proportion of cases there are legitimate reasons for them to be empty, Dublin City Council chief executive Owen Keegan has said.Taking part in a panel discussion on the future of Dublin City, organised by Trinity College, Mr Keegan said he was in “no doubt that the city has paid a high price for decades of suburbanisation”.On housing, Mr Keegan, who said he was speaking in a personal capacity, disputed a contention from the Central Statistics Office that there are 30,000 vacant units in the city.“There is an urgent need to tackle the factors that prevent the refurbishment of upper storeys,” he said. “There are significant extra costs associated with that compared with new builds, and I think it’s going to call for a higher level of financial incentive to reward that.“On the issue of the 30,000 vacant properties, we took the census figure in one local electoral area and went to all the properties that had been reported as vacant, and in a very high proportion of those there were legitimate reasons why the houses were vacant.‘Bandied around’“They were not available to be reused. So, I think that figure is constantly bandied around. I just don’t believe there is that number. We tried to find out by interviewing neighbours why properties were vacant, and there were people in hospital, people away, people studying. “There were a whole range of quite legitimate reasons why the houses would have been vacant for a short period when the census enumerator visited.”Mr Keegan also said there was a need to tackle the “proliferation” of built-to-rent developments.“In the city council area, nearly all planning applications for apartment development are built to rent schemes, most of which are built to minimum national standards,” he said.“While built-to-rent development certainly has a role, the near total dominance of this has adverse long term consequences for the creation of sustainable communities, which the city council considers requires a wider choice of housing types and mixed tenures in the city.”Another issue he said, is “the loss of cultural venues” in the city. “Culture is a universal and fundamental part of human experience and plays a central role in defining us a society, and indeed in defining Dublin as a city,” he said.“However, rapid economic growth is having a negative impact on the affordability and accessibility of spaces to undertake art and cultural expression.“The city’s development plan seeks to counteract this by promoting the development of a number of cultural clusters across the city, and requiring that new large scale developments provide at least 5 per cent floor space for community, arts, and cultural uses.“It also requires where demolition or replacement of a cultural space is proposed, that any new development must accommodate a cultural use with the same or increased area of space.”Mr Keegan said the extent to which the plan would be realised depends on a number of factors, including the role of An Bord Pleanála, which he said has “shown an increasing disregard” for the provisions of the city development plan.It has done this, he said, “in exercising its very considerable planning functions generally, and especially in assessing strategic housing development applications”.He added: “Thankfully however, the board’s approach appears to have come at least partially unstuck, as indeed has the whole SHD process, as a consequence of the very significant increase in recourse to judicial review of the board’s decision.”"},{"url":null,"title":"loneliness should be a political priority says public health expert","story":"According to the analysis by Australian researchers, which examined 212 estimates for loneliness in 106 countries from 24 studies, there is substantial geographical variation in loneliness. Photograph: iStockLoneliness is costly to iniduals and society and needs to be a political priority, a leading expert in public health has said. Prof Roger O’Sullivan, from the Institute of Public Health in Ireland, said the Covid-19 pandemic has dispelled the myth that loneliness is just an older person’s problem, and that measures to address it must now take a life course approach.Prof O’Sullivan’s comments were contained in an editorial published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) on Wednesday.It accompanied an analysis which found that loneliness at a “problematic level” – chronic, moderate to severe loneliness – is widespread in many countries.Existing evidence has found that loneliness not only affects mental health and wellbeing, but is also linked to a range of physical health problems and early death.According to the analysis by Australian researchers, which examined 212 estimates for loneliness in 106 countries from 24 studies, there is substantial geographical variation in loneliness. The lowest prevalence of loneliness was consistently seen in northern European countries (2.9 per cent for young adults 2.7 per cent for middle-aged adults and 5.2 per cent for older adults) and the highest in eastern European countries (7.5 per cent for young adults 9.6 per cent for middle-aged adults and 21.3 per cent for older adults).Data was insufficient to make conclusions about trends of loneliness over time on a global scale during the search period between 2000 and 2019, the researchers acknowledged. However, they added that Covid-19 might have had a profound impact on loneliness.In the linked editorial, Prof O’Sullivan, said a “key challenge” is not only to understand the prevalence of loneliness but to “segment” the experience of it for groups who are at risk. “Not everyone has the same risk of becoming lonely: poverty, poor physical or mental health, few community connections, and living alone have been shown to increase the risk of loneliness, both before and during the pandemic,” he said.“A better understanding is required of the intensity and impact of the experience of loneliness, as well as cultural differences and geographical variations.”He called for a public health approach to tackle the issue, which means confronting social and structural factors that influence the risk of loneliness.“It is important to facilitate healthy social choices, making it easier to connect with others in the community, change work environments, and increase opportunities for building trust and social capital,” the editorial states.“Importantly, protective interventions must be increased, such as public awareness campaigns that deal with stigma and stereotypes around loneliness, valuing community involvement and participation.”It added: “Finally, governments must recognise the personal, social, and economic costs of loneliness and prioritise both political and financial support for specialised programmes to address it.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"how ireland s military would look under proposed overhaul","story":" The commissioning ceremony of 68 new Army Officers, 2 Air Corps Officers and 8 Maltese Officers at the Defence Forces training centre at the Curragh Camp in 2018.

The syndicate, who have not been identified, won the prize on January 15th after buying a quick pick ticket at Laura’s XL store in Castlebar. The jackpot had been rolling over since early June. After claiming their prize at National Lottery headquarters in Dublin, a member of the group recalled the moment they realised they had won. “That Saturday night back in January is still a blur and even though we’re finally collecting a cheque for over €19 million, we’re still waiting for somebody to tell us that we made a mistake and we’re not the winners at all,” a spokesperson for the syndicate said.“I had the ticket in my hand and to see the six numbers come out one after another was like an out of body experience – it’s impossible to explain.”They added: “We didn’t get carried away one bit because we thought that there was no way we could have won it. We got the phones out and frantically started scanning (the ticket) on the National Lottery App.“After about 20 minutes, the ticket scanned and a message popped up that will live with us all for the rest of our lives. It said, ‘You’ve won big!’ It was such an incredible moment.” Excitement growingThe spokesperson said the family came to terms with the win away from Castlebar.“In the days after the draw, it wasn’t publicly known where exactly the win was, so it was funny to see the excitement growing when it was announced in Mayo and then in Castlebar,” they said.The group members said they would be seeking out guidance before making any big decisions on what to do with the money. “While we all will have our own inidual plans, the big thing we want to do is help our wider family, close friends and indeed our community in any way we can,” the spokesperson said.“Of course, we will be paying off whatever mortgages and loans that we have but we have also drawn up a list of people to help in our communities and we look forward to helping out some charities and organisations in the coming months. “It really is such an exciting time in our lives and we can’t wait to get started to changing peoples’ lives.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"miriam lord miche%C3%A1l s field of dreams for housing faces some ugly home truths","story":"Sinn Féin housing spokesperson Eoin Ó Broin has been reprimanded in the Dáil after he accused Taoiseach Micheál Martin of downright lies during a debate on rent prices and housing supply. Video: Oireachtas TVTaoiseach Micheál Martin cited a Daft report in defence of the Government’s housing strategy on Wednesday. File photograph: Laura HuttonThe Micheál’s Field of Dreams: Build it and they will come.But who will come?First-time buyers desperate to escape crippling rent or property investors keen to cash in on their misery?In the Dáil, the hamster wheel of housing keeps on spinning. Round and round it goes with the same arguments from the Opposition and the same answers from the Government.The frustration on both sides is obvious.The Taoiseach stands by his single-word remedy: supply. The only way to solve the housing crisis – and Micheál Martin has no difficulty agreeing with his critics that we are in the middle of a crisis – is by building loads more houses as quickly as possible. Thirty-three thousand “starts” needed every year for the foreseeable.But what happens in the meantime?The ugly gap between identifying the problem and fixing it formed Wednesday’s Dáil battleground. The Sinn Féin leader and the Social Democrats co-leader zoomed in on the well-documented predicament of renters stranded in a cutthroat zone with no means of buying their way out.Mary Lou McDonald and Catherine Murphy began with a clear advantage. They know younger people (along with family and friends who care about them) are in deep despair over housing. This is the burning issue of their time and they want their politicians to help.So both women pleaded with the Taoiseach to take urgent short-term action to curb spiralling rent and house prices. In response, Micheál almost sounded apologetic when referring them for the umpteenth time to his Government’s cure for the current sickness in the market – it’s called supply.As for those “desperately seeking to put a roof over their heads” (as McDonald said) or “desperately trying to buy their own houses” (Murphy), what can be done for them now?For they are out there in their fuming droves. Waiting and listening.Instagrammable indignationIf ever there was an occasion for Mary Lou and her scriptwriter to plunder their extensive and extensively relied upon soundbite locker, it was now. Mary Lou rose to the challenge, producing a bravura performance of Instagrammable indignation.And where is all this happening, Taoiseach? On your watch.Cut rents by means of a tax credit, demanded an impassioned McDonald. Put a ban on runaway rent increases, “and for God’s sake do these things for the renters of this country!”Slowly, patiently, Micheál Martin explained about the need to increase supply above all else. He flourished the Daft report the Sinn Féin leader cited when quoting the alarming figures for rent rises – with average rents in parts of Dublin over the €2,000 threshold now.He read a line from the report’s key conclusions. “‘As ever, the solution remains in the construction of large numbers of market and cost-rental housing to cater for tenants of all incomes.’ That is THEIR conclusion.”“Twang!” He flicked his fingers off the pages.The Government’s Housing for All strategy is the right one, he said. “We now need to get on with it and allow the houses to be built.”Yet what happens in the meantime to renters languishing in the cutthroat zone? What about that ugly gap?Quiet desperationCatherine Murphy left the punchy video-clip flourishes to her Sinn Féin counterpart and she spoke quietly, more in sorrow than anger. She was equally if not more effective, her words capturing the sense of frustration and quiet desperation felt by so many caught up in this crisis.What did the Taoiseach have to say to people trying to buy a house? “Tell them to stop complaining or to shop around?”While he said bulk-buying of private homes by investment vehicles has been blocked, she told a different story. “Ordinary workers can shop around for an eternity but increasingly they feel they are chasing shadows. ”So, while accepting “rents are too high for people”, Micheál repeated that only building more houses will end this mess. And while the Government is powering ahead with the biggest building programme in the history of the State, there is also a place for private sector investors in bringing about the solution.An exasperated Murphy, who represents the commuter-belt constituency of Kildare North, did not disagree. “It’s a big part of the solution, but it has to have constraints put on it.”She put her hands out and asked the Taoiseach: “Do you ever question that you could be getting this wrong? Like, Fianna Fáil have got it wrong before. ”No surprise in a reply going back to supplies. Housing supply is the key. “It’s happening. Thirty-one thousand starts . . .”“I know we need supply. But affordable supply,” said the Soc Dem co-leader.

The graph below shows the position by age group in November.Other countries including France, Spain, Italy and the United States have been vaccinating children aged five to 11 with the PfizerBioNTech jab.Some parents have complained that attempts to plan holidays abroad have been made more difficult because Britain is out of line with other nations. While most will accept under-12s who are unvaccinated, some holiday and ski resorts will either not or will insist on tests, leaving parents facing logistical difficulties.Justine Roberts, the chief executive of Mumsnet, said the problem had cropped up on the parenting website a number of times.She added: There is certainly a view that people are keen to get away, especially if they have had two years of staying at home, and they are finding a whole new set of logistical problems.Ms Roberts said the majority of the site\u0027s users backed the vaccination programme in general and would be likely to want to see jabs rolled out for younger children.I think, broadly, our users are very supportive of the vaccination programme, not just for themselves but for the safety of others, such as older people and grandparents, and I think they would be broadly supportive of vaccines for younger children, she added.He said vaccines for children below 12 should only go ahead if there was crystal clear, clinical advice that the benefits outweigh the risks and more dangerous to get Covid than it is to have the vaccine.On Wednesday, Dr Elizabeth Mann, of the University of Manchester, said that although the risk of severe disease in children was low, Covid is not something that\u0027s going to go away, with future strains and waves expected.She said evidence about the impact of long Covid on children had swayed her in favour of vaccination, with studies showing that even those with mild virus could end up suffering in the long-term.More from NewsEnd of fracking as Cuadrilla ordered to abandon last two viable wells despite energy crisisBoris Johnson puts more troops on standby and tells Russia to show ‘real diplomacy’ over UkraineWe should restore tax relief on private healthcareBritish police deserve state of the art trainingFaceless painting worth £750k ruined after \u0026#39bored\u0026#39 security guard draws eyes on itNicola Sturgeon admits an independent Scotland would have to fund its state pensionsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"let children play 10 minutes longer lockdown isolation ministers","story":"Children should be given ten minutes extra play time each day to make up for the loss of socialising during the pandemic, the Royal College of Psychiatrists has urged the Government.Play has been “eroded” in recent years and must be prioritised to reverse the negative impact of lockdowns on children’s wellbeing and development.The British Psychological Society and several children’s charities - including Young Minds and Save the Children - are also backing calls for extra play to be added to the school day.In a joint letter to Robert Halfon, the chair of the education select committee which has launched a new inquiry into children’s mental health, they say the Government should “put back an additional 10 minutes of play into the school day”.They also argue that children’s mental health and wellbeing should be a priority in the catch-up efforts following the pandemic.Schools are legally required to ide each day up into two sessions, with a break in the middle between the two. But there is no national guidance on how long this break should be. It is instead left up to each school’s headteacher to decide.A recent study by University College London’s Institute of Education found that just one per cent of secondary schools now have afternoon breaks compared with 41 per cent almost three decades ago.Researchers examined how school breaks and children’s social lives have changed over time by comparing data from more than 1,000 primary and secondary schools in 2017, 2006 and 1995.The study, published in 2019, showed there had been a “marked reduction” in the total amount of break time children are allowed, with 11 to 16-year-olds now having 65 minutes per week less than they did a quarter of a century ago.During the pandemic, ministers raised new concerns over schools slashing children’s break times when they reopened after the first national lockdown.When the bubble system was in place, official advice from the Department for Education said that schools should consider staggered break times and lunch times so that different bubbles do not mingle with each other.In some cases, this led to breaks being shortened while in other cases, children were told they were only allowed to use a small section of the playground to ensure they did not come into contact with pupils from other classes.More from NewsEnd of fracking as Cuadrilla ordered to abandon last two viable wells despite energy crisisBoris Johnson puts more

designated bathing spot.The spot near Wolvercote, Oxford, would be monitored regularly during the spring and summer months for bacterial levels that could harm human health.The river sees an average of 46 swimmers a day during the peak season, but tests have found levels of E. coli bacteria exceeding the threshold level for safe bathing water quality.The bid for the spot to achieve “bathing water” status, which has been led by local campaigners, requires proof that the water is used regularly for swimming and such activity is backed by the council, rather than proof that it is safe to swim.If it is successful, then local campaigners hope that the regular testing between May and September by the Environment Agency will put pressure on Thames Water and local landowners to keep the stretch of river clean.Last month, locals held a protest after they said that the water company failed to inform them about a sewage release from the nearby treatment works on Christmas Day until 24 hours after it had taken place, despite the spot being popular during the season.England has only one other river with designated bathing status, a stretch of the River Wharfe at Ilkley, West Yorkshire, which was rated “poor” for water quality after tests in January found evidence of human and animal bacteria. The tests were the first since the Ilkley site was granted bathing status in 2020, after efforts by local campaigners who hope it will lead to the waters being cleaned up.The Government is under pressure to improve the quality of England’s rivers, after a report by MPs found none were free from a “chemical cocktail” of sewage, slurry and plastic pollution that is putting human and animal health at risk.Rebecca Pow, the environment minister, said: “It is great to see people getting involved in efforts to increase the number of designated bathing sites and I encourage local residents and swimmers to take part in these consultations so we can have as many views as possible to inform our final decision.”Claire Robertson, the Thames21 Oxford Rivers Project officer who submitted the application, said: “It’s self-evident that such a well-loved and well-used site should have water quality testing to help people enjoy the river safely and healthily.“It’s even more self-evident that raw sewage discharges should not happen anywhere near this site, for peoples’ health, but also for the many wildlife species that live in this stretch.”More from NewsEnd of fracking as Cuadrilla ordered to abandon last two viable wells despite energy crisisBoris Johnson puts

than the nightmarish rollout of smart meters.What should have been a sensible, rather trivial upgrade has turned into a flashpoint of the culture wars, an allegory of all that has gone wrong: the breakdown in trust between Middle England and technocratic elites, the decadent, ruinous absurdity of our energy policy, the perversion of technology and market mechanisms to undermine genuine capitalism, and the imposition of a new secular morality against the wishes of the majority.There was a time when mainstream Left and Right agreed on ends but differed on means. Both wanted to build a world in which the poor and the middle class could aspire to the goods, services and lifestyle previously only enjoyed by the rich. The Left’s favourite tools were redistribution, union power and state direction the Right’s privatisation, supply-side reforms and a tide that lifted all boats.The green and woke revolutions have shattered this democratising consensus, and, in a bizarre turn of events, the modern Left has embraced the sort of neo-feudalism that went out of fashion on the Right in about 1846.Instead of wanting to help the poor and the middle class, this newly “awakened” millenarian Left distrusts their cultural conservatism and materialistic instincts. They are revolutionaries who dream of a green year zero, a tabula rasa brought about by rationing, radical social control and material regression, all underpinned by a post-Christian ethical system obsessed with oppression, guilt and an inevitable day of reckoning.Tragically, this regressive faux-religion – not to be confused with the sensible environmental protection that most people support – has permeated our ruling class, including a Conservative Party that appears to be afflicted with a political death wish. This is why behaviour or aspirations that were entirely uncontroversial a few years ago – heating or cooling one’s home, travelling to Australia or India, driving to the shops or to see family, living in a quiet suburb far from one’s place of work, even having children – are now suddenly being portrayed as not merely vulgar but damaging and immoral. This, needless to say, only applies to ordinary people: double standards are baked into woke and green activism. Its leaders can do no wrong: virtue signalling matters more than actual behaviour.This ideology is becoming embedded in the machinery of state, in legislation, in urban planning, in our culture, in the mission statements of investment firms and the multinationals they own, in the work of charities, in the universities and of course is being taught to our children.The result has been a collapse in ambition. There was a time when the West aspired to flying cars, jetpacks and hypersonic travel, where the rise of cheap flights, central heating and the mass adoption of the private motorcar were seen as immensely liberating. Today, we are instructed that walking and cycling are the only truly moral means of transport, and that “every trip counts” (and should therefore be minimised).Progress and innovation are frowned upon, apart from in sectors such as environmental technology, entertainment or medical research, the latter two being today’s panem et circenses. Regular people are told that they need to use less energy, eat less meat and fewer imported fruit and vegetables, as in the 1950s, and above all to stop complaining, give up on traditional consumerism and make sure not to have ideas above their station.Smart meters have been caught up in this clash of values. In theory, they make a lot of sense: it is good to encourage people to run dishwashers or charge electric cars at night to reduce the pressure on the grid. This lowers overall prices by reducing the need for as much generating capacity. Surge pricing – where customers pay more when demand is high, and which could soon be coming to our energy bills thanks to smart meters – is merely a reflection of reality and scarcity.In practice, however, energy supply has been trashed by the green blob, and the price we pay bears no relation to what a real free market would deliver. The original 20th century dream – plentiful, cheap energy on tap for all, powering a miraculous suite of home appliances, with consumers free to choose when and how much they enjoy it – has been wrecked. Green policies such as the ban on fracking have drastically reduced the availability of energy, and there has been no countervailing investment in nuclear to counter the intermittency of renewables. The lights could go off.In a world where it is deemed immoral to consume too much, and where political idiocy has caused a crippling shortage, higher prices will be like a “sin tax” imposed by smart meters, a bullying “nudge” mechanism to punish and redistribute from those who cannot or don’t want to change their ways. No wonder so many already hate them.This is not a rant against market prices: we need more of them. It is madness for everything in the NHS to be “free” for everybody all of the time. My frustration is with the social engineers who want to use a perversion of the pricing mechanism to control people and to add to the profusion of politicised, administered, pricing – taxes by another name.I’m a libertarian who believes in genuine competitive capitalism and freedom, not a technocrat who wants to use economic weapons to manipulate society.Take road pricing: the positive version would allow not merely the elimination of several taxes and a smoothing of traffic but also the creation of a revenue stream which would allow the financing of new roads. That is how supply and demand is meant to work: if high demand pushes up prices, extra supply is added. This was the original thinking behind French motorway péages.In practice, in the UK, road pricing will be used as a tax, a tool of cultural warfare, a punishment to restrict mobility. There will be no new roads. This fake pricing will also eliminate privacy, and hand the state – and hackers – too much information about citizens’ lives.The row over smart meters goes to the heart of the society we want to live in: do we want to be free and prosperous, or poor and submissive? It beggars belief that a government that understood Middle England so well on Brexit has got it so wrong when it comes to net zero.More from NewsEnd of fracking as Cuadrilla ordered to abandon last two viable wells despite energy crisisBoris Johnson puts more troops on standby and tells Russia to show ‘real diplomacy’ over UkraineWe should restore tax relief on private healthcareBritish police deserve state of the art trainingFaceless painting worth £750k ruined after \u0026#39bored\u0026#39 security guard draws eyes on itNicola Sturgeon admits an independent Scotland would have to fund its state pensionsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sorry justin welby rewriting history should difficult","story":"The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, has shared his thoughts on the ecclesiastical court case concerning the request of Jesus College, Cambridge, to remove from its chapel an artistically important memorial sculpture. The plaque in question commemorates Tobias Rustat, a 17th century benefactor of the College and a participant in the Royal African Company, a major part of whose business was trading slaves.That the Archbishop should comment on a controversy within his Province may seem natural, though whether it is wise when the matter is still sub judice is perhaps questionable. His view – that the memorial should go – agrees with that of the Bishop of Ely, the Dean and Chaplain of the College, and its Master. All, including the Archbishop, seem surprised that anyone could disagree.This has been part of the problem, as the College authorities seem throughout to have disregarded contrary views and taken little or no trouble to engage with them. The Archbishop, oddly, implies that even the Church’s own courts should have no say, asking: “Why do they have to go through hearing how it ‘doesn’t really matter’ or it is ‘not strictly accurate’ and so on?”The simple answer is that some people think that being strictly accurate is important in a university. When the Archbishop calls the sculpture “a memorial to slavery” he himself is not being accurate. Those opposing its removal say that it was carved before Rustat profited from the slave trade. Moreover, the likelihood that the money he donated to the College came from that tainted source, they argue, is “vanishingly small”. But the College is not interested, and some of the testimony given on its behalf was scathingly described by the opposing barrister as “not frank” and “not truthful”.If the case against Rustat is dubious, why the “agony” (as the Archbishop put it) gone through to remove it? Because the Master of the College, Sonita Alleyne, born in Barbados, has to “look at it every time she sits in her stall”, says the Archbishop, and this she finds painful. So, adds the College, do many of its students, one third of whom are from ethnic minorities.Clearly, some members of Jesus College are people of exquisite sensitivity. Fortunately, most people are pretty stoical about historic crimes, or else life would become impossible. Volkswagen cars would have to be boycotted because the company used slave labour within living memory. Archbishop Welby’s own cathedral was built on the coerced labour of Anglo-Saxon serfs following the Norman Conquest and there are studies showing that compared with the descendants of the Normans, people of Anglo-Saxon heritage still suffer economic disadvantage today. Furthermore, Jesus College accepts money from the People’s Republic of China, which lays its Master and Fellows open to the same condemnation they apply to Rustat.But some historic wrongs are clearly more emotive than others. As the Bishop of Ely, Rt Rev Stephen Conway, put it in his testimony, the Reformation had destroyed a lot (including not a few Catholics, one might add) so why were we worrying about one memorial plaque? He answered his own question: at stake was “who owns our history”, what we “hold to be true”, and what in our history is for “celebration”.So the Rustat plaque is one more skirmish in a campaign to recast our history as centred on slavery and colonial oppression. “How Slavery Built Modern Britain” is the sub-title of a recent academic monograph being discussed in Cambridge. Critical Race Theory – in reality neither critical nor a theory – builds on this to accuse our society of being systemically racist. As with the Rustat memorial, reason and evidence are swept aside by the imperious demands of victimhood and self-described emotion.Who owns our history? All of us. Archbishop Welby lamented the fact that it has proved “so difficult” to remove Rustat. Yet Church law, however arcane, has in this case required all views to be listened to. I hope his comment that “we need to change our practices” will not be heeded.Robert Tombs is the author of The English and Their History and co-editor of the website History ReclaimedMore from NewsEnd of fracking as Cuadrilla ordered to abandon last two viable wells despite energy crisisBoris Johnson puts more troops on standby and tells Russia to show ‘real diplomacy’ over UkraineWe should restore tax relief on private healthcareBritish police deserve state of the art trainingFaceless painting worth £750k ruined after \u0026#39bored\u0026#39 security guard draws eyes on itNicola Sturgeon admits an independent Scotland would have to fund its state pensionsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sturgeon cant apologise covid mistakes","story":"Scrolling through Facebook the other day I came across an advert paid for by the Scottish Government advising tenants that they cannot be moved out of their accommodation without written notice. At the corner of the advert – too large to be inconspicuous – was the familiar blue and white saltire featuring the legend: “Fairer Scotland”.Huge amounts of tax-payers’ money is used every day, not primarily to promote public information messages about tenants’ rights, but to hammer home the message that Scotland is fairer, healthier, friendlier, better than… well, you can guess who.It’s all part of a grand, publicly-funded strategy aimed at convincing undecided Scots that independence really would result in more “progress” towards a society that most of them would want to see. But a vital plank of the strategy is to convince voters that those in charge – Nicola Sturgeon and her lieutenants – are not just up to the job of forging a new nation but are unimpeachable embodiments of political perfection.Boris Johnson may find it difficult to say the word “sorry”, but the word seems to have been completely expunged from the Scottish dictionary. Take two recent and obvious examples.Last week MSPs at Holyrood demanded to know how money set aside by the Scottish government would be used to improve air circulation in schools and consequently reduce the incidence of Covid. Scottish Conservative leader, Douglas Ross, said: “The Covid pandemic began more than two years ago. The Scottish government has had all that time to make our schools fit for use. Why then, First Minister, are we in the position, after all this time, that one of your Government’s ideas to protect kids and teachers is to chop the bottom off of classroom doors?”In dismissive tones, the First Minister replied: “If doors or windows are not enabling that natural flow of air in the way that is wanted, it strikes me as basic common sense to take measures to rectify that.”This caused much amusement in the political sphere, and much consternation among those who could see the risks from having fire doors that didn’t stretch all the way to the floor. The Fire Brigades Union demanded an emergency meeting with ministers to discuss the plan, and parents were understandably worried.Yet no minister has actually admitted that the plan was a stupid one. Indeed, one of them, Shirley-Anne Somerville, has doubled down and insisted that “undercutting” would be needed if new extractor fans changed the air pressure in classrooms – an argument that was entirely missing from the First Minister’s argument just days earlier.This follows another public spat involving the question as to which government – Scottish or UK – would be responsible for paying pensions in an independent Scotland.Politicians across the globe are known for their reluctance to admit when they have said something wrong. In Scotland that reluctance has become unhealthily obsessive. The independence project is built on the precarious assumption that its leaders are never wrong about anything, and so whatever the First Minister says must be right, always. The aim is to instill in voters an unquestioning confidence in the SNP, a belief that they are people in whom the fate of a nation can be placed without concern that they will stumble or fumble like other, less perfect political leaders would. If they started going around admitting they had got something wrong, then such confidence would take a serious hit.The problem is that voters can make their own judgement about whether it would be safe to start cutting up fire doors in schools or demanding that English tax-payers start funding the pensions of a foreign country. A public admission of fault could be forgiven. An insistence on pursuing a policy that makes no sense or is deliberately dangerous would be unforgivable.More from NewsEnd of fracking as Cuadrilla ordered to abandon last two viable wells despite energy crisisBoris Johnson puts more troops on standby and tells Russia to show ‘real diplomacy’ over UkraineWe should restore tax relief on private healthcareBritish police deserve state of the art trainingFaceless painting worth £750k ruined after \u0026#39bored\u0026#39 security guard draws eyes on itNicola Sturgeon admits an independent Scotland would have to fund its state pensionsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"conservative partys christmas quiz team","story":"Conservative Partys Christmas quiz team name choices slammed as massive jokePrime Minister Boris Johnson faces fresh backlash today after another picture emerged from the virtual Christmas quiz in  - and people arent happy about the team names eitherPrime Minister Boris Johnson is facing fresh backlash today Image: Getty ImagesByJohn BettAudience WriterCourtney PochinSenior Audience Writer:,  Feb |comments Prime Minister Boris Johnson faces fresh backlash today after a new picture emerged showing him at a No  aposvirtualapos Christmas quiz.The new image shows the Prime Minister flanked by three members of staff, one wearing tinsel and another a Santa hat, at the event on December , .

The Test and Trace Support Payment was introduced in September  to help low-wage workers afford to self-isolate for up to  days.But Boris Johnson today announced he plans to end all domestic legal restrictions in England on February , a month earlier than planned.That means for the first time in almost two years, England will have no legal requirement to self-isolateyou test positive for Covid-.The announcement has raised questions over the future of the £ payment, available to low-income people who are given legal orders to isolate. While isolation will not be a legal requirement, Downing Street said today: “We’d expect anyone with an infectious disease to take steps not to spread that disease further - a colleague at work with flu, for example.  It is understood no final decisions have been made over the future of the £ payment, and its future will be considered by the government next week. Boris Johnson will then announce a full ‘living with Covid’ plan and document on Monday  February, which is expected to confirm details. The document could also set a timetable for the end of free lateral flow tests, which will carry on beyond the February  cut-off date. And it is likely to make a statement on the future of the multi-billion pound contact tracing system, which was largely outsourced to private firms. Mr Johnson said: “It is my intention toon the first day after the half term recess to present our strategy for living with Covid. “Provided the current encouraging trends in the data continue, it is my expectation that we’ll be able to end the last domestic restrictions, including the legal requirement to self-isolateyou test positive, a full month early.”The legal change will also end powers which councils had under the Coronavirus Act in England to close some venues. However, these powers were barely ever used.Mandatory self-isolation was already scrapped last year for close contacts of Covid cases. However, people who test positive for the virus must still go into self-isolation for five full days in England, a period that has been repeatedly cut from  days and seven days. Unions blasted the decision, saying it would leave low-income workers and schools high and dry - while Covid bereaved families blasted the PM when  people died in the last  hours. UNISON general secretary Christina McAnea said: “Everybody wants to get back to normal, but Covid risks haven’t disappeared. This is going too far, way too soon. “Infections are still re in schools.

Heres everything you need to know about the DWP rule changes for jobseekersJobseekers are about to have the amount of job-seeking time they have slashed from today Image: Getty ImagesByHarry ThompsonTrends Writer:,  Feb |comments Following a key change to the Department for Work and Pensionspolicy last month, jobseekers will have less time to find a position in their chosen field or risk endangering their Universal Credit claim.The brutal change, which is likely to leave jobseekers feeling increased stress and pressure, means that people looking for work are now expected to broaden their job search. The government says it has introduced the measures in an attempt to get , benefit claimants into jobs by June. But some of them might remain claiming Universal Credit even when they find work,they work part-time or for low wages.According to the latest data from the Office For National Statistics , unemployment rates in the UK have been falling.As of Autumn , the number of over s classed as unemployed had fallen to .%, a .% drop from the pandemic-related spike in late , which saw .% of the workforce without a job. How will the changes to the jobseekersapos allowance affect me   Previously, people were given three months to find a role in the sector they wanted to go into. They are then expected to broaden their search and consider looking at other sectors outside of their preference. However, under new DWP rules they will have less time to find a new job in their chosen field. The three-month window has now been brutally slashed to just one. In a statement, the government said: After four weeks, claimants who refuse to widen their job search, attend interviews or take up paid work in roles outside of their preferred sector may be referred for a sanction. The programme, labelled aposWay to Workapos by the government, says it wants to get half a million people into jobs by the end of June. However, it has faced severe backlash from charities and experts. The plan has come from the DWP, which claims that ONS data reports a % increase in the number of vacancies available compared to pre-pandemic levels. This equates to . million jobs to fill. They say the project will primarily target people who are inside the intensive work search group on Universal Credit.  The DWP say: To support people into work faster those who are capable of work will be expected to search more widely for available jobs from the fourth week of their claim, rather than from three months as is currently the case. This clearer focus will ensure that,people are not able to find work in their previous occupation or sector, they are expected to look for work in another sector and this will be part of their requirements for receiving their benefit payment. For the vast majority of people who are already engaging fully with Jobcentre Plus, this could be the extra support they need to secure a job. However, for the small minority who do not engage, the sanctions regime will operate as usual. The sanctions discussed are likely to be reductions in benefits, rather than total cut-offs, however, there could be scenarios where the money is halted altogether. With job seekers potentially being forced to dash hopes of working in their sectors of choice and taking on an ill-suited role, the benefits of the rule change remain in question. Stephen Evans, Chief Executive of the Learning and Work Institute, said: “This ‘crackdown’ won’t make a signicant impact on those numbers and it’s not where the real challenges lie. “People who’ve recently lost their jobs are the most likely to find work quickly. To tackle current labour shortages, we need a more ambitious plan for people who have left the labour market, with support increasing the longer someone is out of work.” Anastasia Berry of the MS Society added: “Taking a forceful approach will not help everyone, especially disabled people, get into and remain in high quality and appropriate work.Speaking to YourMoney head of policy at Citizens Advice, Morgan Wild, said: “This plan to potentially increase sanctions to get claimants to take any job going might reduce unemployment in the very short term, but really risks the recovery long-term.“When pushed like this, people earn less, work fewer hours and end up quitting sooner. People know what work they’re good at. The state pushing them to take anything will look like a short term win, but ends up hurting productivity because people waste time in the wrong jobs. “And to a large extent it just moves the problem around – people slip out of the benefits system and into being economically inactive altogether. Government should focus on proper re-training etc.rather than this kind of harmful approach.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Department for Work and Pensions\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But they will be axed at some point, and the timescale could become much clearer by the end of the monthThe government has previously said free tests will be ended at some point in the future Image: Matt Cardy Getty ImagesByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  Feb Updated:,  Feb |commentsCovid lateral flow tests will continue to be free beyond February  despite all domestic Covid laws being axed. Downing Street confirmed people will not yet have to pay for the rapid tests, in order to give people confidence to go out and see friends and family.But the Mirror understands a timescale for phasing out free testing could be addressed in a “living with Covid” document, to be unveiled by Boris Johnson on February .The government has previously said free tests will be ended at some point in the future, and leaked documents last month suggested the switchover could happen in June.Papers seen by Reuters claim the timetable was due to be earlier in  - but was pushed back to the summer due to the Omicron iant.According to the document, shared between health agencies to prepare scenarios, officials are working on the basis that an online ordering system should be ready for Brits to order paid-for tests from the end of June.  But that could move againthe virus throws another curve ball into the works, an official said. The government has declined to say what the tests cost, with one source suggesting it is £ for a seven-pack. Boris Johnson today announced he plans to end all domestic legal restrictions in England on February , a month earlier than planned.That means for the first time in almost two years, England will have no legal requirement to self-isolateyou test positive for Covid-. The legal change will also end powers which councils had under the Coronavirus Act in England to close some venues. However, these powers were barely ever used. The announcement has raised questions over the future of the £ self-isolation payment for poor workers with Covid While isolation will not be a legal requirement, Downing Street said today: “We’d expect anyone with an infectious disease to take steps not to spread that disease further - a colleague at work with flu, for example. It is understood no final decisions have been made over the future of the £ payment, and it will be considered by the government next week. The living with Covid plan is also likely to make a statement on the future of the multi-billion pound contact tracing system, which was largely outsourced to private firms. Mr Johnson told MPs: “It is my intention toon the first day after the half term recess to present our strategy for living with Covid. “Provided the current encouraging trends in the data continue, it is my expectation that we’ll be able to end the last domestic restrictions, including the legal requirement to self-isolateyou test positive, a full month early.” Mandatory self-isolation was already scrapped last year for close contacts of Covid cases. However, people who test positive for the virus must still go into self-isolation for five full days in England, a period that has been repeatedly cut from  days and seven days. Unions blasted the decision, saying it would leave low-income workers and schools high and dry - while Covid bereaved families blasted the PM when  people died in the last  hours. UNISON general secretary Christina McAnea said: “Everybody wants to get back to normal, but Covid risks haven’t disappeared. This is going too far, way too soon. “Infections are still re in schools. Large numbers of pupils and staff are off. Allowing a prematurecould lead to a further jump in infections and disrupt learning for thousands more.” TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady said: “It’s also vital that ministers fix our broken sick pay system once and for all.

On the desk in front of him - from where he read out quiz questions to teams across the building - is what appears to be champagne and a half-eaten packet of crisps. Mr Johnson was accused of personally breaking Covid laws by hosting the festive event after the Mirror revealed last year that it had taken place. At the time London was under Tier  regulations banning any social mixing between two or more people from dferent households.  Official guidance also stated: “You must not have a work Christmas lunch or party, where that is a primarily social activity and is not otherwise permitted by the rules in your tier.” Just two days after the Mirroraposs initial story, the PM said: “I can tell you once again that I certainly broke no rules. But the Christmas quiz is not one of the dozen No  gatherings under investigation by police. This is despite a smaller festive quiz held in the Cabinet Office just two days later being looked at. One Covid laws expert said that Scotland Yard should now add the Downing Street Christmas quiz to the list of events it is probing. Barrister Adam Wagner told The Mirror: The previous photograph of the Prime Minister showed what could have been a meeting briefly interrupted by a Zoom call. However, the new photograph shows four people with alcohol and food, as well as a Christmas hat and tinsel, which suggests a Christmas party. This was held at a time when indoor social gatherings of two or more people were banned and the Government had told people they must not have a Christmas party. The top lawyer added: In light of the new evidence it now makes no sense for this gathering not to be investigated by the police given that an almost identical gathering in the Cabinet Secretary Simon Caseaposs office two dayaposs later is being investigated. In the new image, Mr Johnson appears to be putting a badge on his suit jacket.  Later that evening, No  pins were distributed to Downing Street staff as a Christmas present from the PM. Downing Street has insisted the event was a “virtual quiz”, but admitted “those who were in the office for work may have attended virtually from their desks.” Labour MP Fabian Hamilton raised the photo in PMQs - and contrasted the merriment to a constituent who was unable to have visits from her family while having cancer treatment. He said: For the sake of my constituent and the sacrices she made, will the PM be referring this party to the police as itaposs not one of the parties being investigated  But the PM hit back, saying: He is completely in error. He later said the event had been submitted for investigation. Former No aide Dominic Cummings warned: Thereaposs waaaaay better pics than that floating around, incl in the flat. No pointed out the event itself had already been considered by Scotland Yard, which decided not to investigate it further. But the PM’s Press Secretary could not say whether the newly-revealed photo had been sent to the Met, saying: “I’m not aware of that and it wouldn’t be appropriate for me to comment”. Of Sue Gray, the Press Secretary added: “She has had access to all information that is relevant and required.” Asked what was happening in the picture, she said: Weaposve talked about this one before, it is a virtual quiz. The Mirror revealed last year that dozens of staff had spent the evening huddling in groups around their office computers rather than dialling in from home. In one office, the insider said, there were four teams, each made up of six people. Sources said staff had knocked back fizz, wine and beer - and some stayed in Number  socialising and drinking for hours after the quiz finished at .pm. Team names included Professor Quiz Whitty, Next Slide Please, Weaposve Been Clear”, “The  Masketeers” and Hands, Face, First Place - a reference to the slogan introduced to encourage social distancing and mask wearing.  The Mirror also revealed an email showing organisers had planned days in advance for some staff to enjoy the quiz in person, from the office. A senior official even urged staff, including teams from the PMaposs private office, the policy unit and the press office, to leave No  through the back door at the end of the night. Mr Johnson has spent the last few days trying to shore up support after mass resignations from No  last week raised further questions about his authority. Downing Street is hoping his defensive mini-reshuffle to promote loyalists - and the promise of a bigger reshuffle in early summer - will be enough to keep mutinous Tory MPs at bay. But many Tories are privately saying they are waiting for the result of the Met investigation and the full Sue Gray report to decide whether to trigger a confidence vote. The PMaposs allies have claimed that he will not resign evenhe is fined by the politan Police for breaching Covid rules. One former Cabinet minister told the Mirror: “If Sue Gray finds he lied to parliament unequivocally, or depending what action police take - that’s it. Either of those two things would be terminal.

Small loans announced by the Government – that must be repaid by us – are cold comfort after the energy price cap was lted £. Labour deserves congratulations for backing a windfall tax and suspension of VAT. Even Margaret Thatcher and David Cameron imposed one-off levies on North Sea producers. The resistance of Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Chancellor Rishi Sunak to a similar move means this Government is siding with big corporations against working people.  Sinking ship Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle rebuked lying Boris Johnson over his Jimmy Savile smear against Keir Starmer He showed how an unprincipled Prime Minister exploits Parliament loopholes. The Speaker judging the slur inappropriate rather than disorderly showed how Johnson will be dishonest but avoid punishment. What’s more, his incitement fuelled a mob to abuse the Labour leader. The PM’s desperate mini-reshuffle was a reshuffling of diehards in the deckchairs on board his sinking Government ship. Unconditional support isn’t repaid by Johnson when he demoted fanatical defender Jacob Rees-Mogg from Leader of the House to an invented Brexit Opportunities post as a middle-ranking minister of state, albeit invited to sit in the Cabinet room with his superiors. Once again we witness Johnson caring only about himself. Conservative MPs should throw him overboard to save themselves.

It came after Ms Coffey was slammed for failing to pledge any new help for the poorest to afford energy bills.That was despite Citizens Advice warning poor Brits are “already drowning” with food bank demand at an “all time record”.  The charity’s Morgan Wild told MPs a £ pledge had not “grasped the challenge” and more help is needed “over the coming months”. He said: “Over the past month Citizens Advice has seen a record demand since the pandemic began of people coming to us for advice. “We’re seeing all time records for crisis support - referrals for food banks and other charitable support - and record numbers for fuel debts.” Yet Ms Coffey said: “There’s already been a signicant increase into the level of support, I’m not aware any more plans are there. That’s not my decision.” She distanced herself from the decision, saying: “I think they think the £bn, the Chancellor thinks £bn of support to people in the country is a substantial element.” Ms Coffey also rebuffed calls from the IFS think tank to lt benefits by more than .% in April - which is a below-inflation rise.  She said: “Sometimes that will be up, sometimes that will be down.” Ms Coffey was also unable to answer a series of other questions about welfare policy. The Cabinet minister said she either did not recall some details or was being asked about other departmental briefs. But Mr Coyle said it was really disappointing” and “embarrassing” adding: “There was a rumour the Secretary of State is going to resign. Is that the reason you canapost answer any questions today, because youaposve got one foot out the door  Ms Coffey snapped: “No, donapost be ridiculous Neil. “You know,you want to bring up gossip, I could bring up other stuff that happened downstairs.” Committee chairman Stephen Timms added: “The lack of detail that the Secretary of State was able to give us on what the Government is doing to support the many people currently struggling to get by was hugely disappointing.”  Earlier, the minister revealed she had complained to her own energy supplier that her household bill is too high. Therese Coffey accused energy firms of using rate-payers “as their cash flow” ahead of a £ annual bill rise in April. The Work and Pensions Secretary, who earns £,, told MPs: “I don’t pretend in any way to be poor, I’m not trying to suggest that at all. “But I did notice very signicantly my utility suppliers all of a sudden increased my standing order, anticipating perhaps rises.  “I’ve had to go back and get them to bring back down my standing order because it’s not in line with my bills.” She told the Commons Work and Pensions Committee people could “ask for that to be reviewed” or even go to Ofgem. Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Jonathan Ashworth branded her remarks “tone deaf”. He added: “On top of rocketing heating bills, price going up, wages stagnating and Tory tax rises working people, families and pensioners need real help now like Labour’s £ reduction in energy bills.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Jonathan AshworthStephen TimmsDepartment for Work and PensionsOfgemCabinetConservative PartyCitizens Advice BureauEnergy billsPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Max Thurnell-Read was investigated by police who concluded he was not guilty aposin any way shape or formapos and the complaint was dropped, the hearing was told. But despite this, the teenager was vilied on social media and sent apostoxicapos and aposvileapos messages from fellow pupils. His mother, Tracy Stevens, sobbed as she told the inquest how her son was aposfrightenedapos of going to school as the situation was like a aposwitch huntapos. She said: The four weeks leading to his death with the messages he received ultimately led to his decision to take his own le.The month before his death, Max told a doctor he was feeling aposreally low in moodapos and aposnot  per cent himselfapos. Although he had been joking with his father, Jonathan Thurnell-Read, just an hour earlier, he was found dead in his bedroom by his parents on May  last year. The couple were left apostraumatisedapos after trying to resuscitate him for ten minutes before an ambulance arrived at their semi-detached home in Hampshire. He was later pronounced dead at Southampton General Hospital. The Year  pupil was described by his teacher, Michael Biles, as a aposbrilliant student - someone you would want to have in your classapos. But Max became apossad and withdrawnapos after the accusation was made following a sleepover in October , the hearing was told, and in December he admitted to self-harming.  The matter was reported to police but DI Robert Harrington told Winchester Coroneraposs Court: Nothing has been proven at all. Max was not found guilty in any way shape or form. My colleagues were satisfied that no further actions were to be taken. [Those involved] were updated of this. He acknowledged that there were some things he could have done dferently but it was something he could learn from and move forward from. They were recorded as crimes but it wasnapost appropriate to take further action. With regards to the allegations made towards Max, in some cases, even when the complainant does not want to take further action, the police will still take that action. That was not the case here and we were aware of that context.Despite this, Max continued to face aposharassmentapos. Ms Stevens added: He was treated like a monster. They had him dressed in a corset that evening and said Max wanted to touch a boob. But they were all sexualising each other. He said aposI have clearly upset them. Yes the context is all wrong but I do not want to hurt them any moreapos - and I did not think the girls got that. Distraught was not a strong enough word to describe how he felt. He just wanted his le back. They never saw the affect those messages had on him. He would put off reading these messages for days until he was with us. She added that he was a aposproud memberapos of the LGBTQ+ Community and first went to a Pride march in Southampton in . On the day of his death, Max had a aposfull day plannedapos of counselling and drama. And despite being reassured that the head teacher would meet him at the school gate to accompany him to class, he became aposincreasingly anxiousapos and did not go in. His counselling was also cancelled by the counsellor at the last minute. Hampshire Area Coroner Rosamund Rhodes-Kemp said: [Max] had been experiencing problems with a small peer group at school and had become very troubled by this during April . Hopefully they will all reflect on the power of their words. It is important that people realise the consequences of a social media culture. I donapost think Max did anything wrong and things got out of hand. Iaposm so sorry - I donapost think his death was necessary. The only good that has come out of it is that there has been reflection on the power of words and the need to use them carefully, and that those involved in the future will be less quick to turn on someone and gang up. A post mortem examination revealed his cause of death was asphyxiation. A Go Fund me page was set up for donations to Young Minds, a charity which supports young people, which has raised almost £,. A bench in Maxaposs memory is at Ballardaposs Lake, where his family go to think about him, and his mother said she was comforted by seeing other young people there, an inquest heard.

The bizarre dispute, branded aposFence-gateapos by locals, went viral around the world last September. But as the row intensied, Stephen, , claimed an outraged man aimed an airgun at Christine before firing.  The couple, who used to run a sweet shop from the property, were so spooked they removed the fence a week later. They are now selling the three-bed semi-detached house for £,. Land Registry records show the house was bought for £, in  - a whopping £, more than the current asking price. Christine, , who works in a nursing home, said relations with her neighbours had gone sour since the fence row. She said: We were going to sell the house beforehand but whataposs gone on has soured it a bit. We were going to sell the house but it brought it all forward.  We took the fence down th September, it was up for a week. We just want to move on with it.I got trolled on Facebook. Some of the comments we saw were awful.Recalling the moment a yob fired an air rle at Christine, she said: To think the guy who shot at me got away with that. I said to my husband aposthat guys got a gunapos The minute he aimed at me, Stephen dragged me inside. Stephen added: Weaposve had people eating their chips on our windowsill and looking through the window while we are trying to relax. Itaposs not on. Most people wouldnapost want people using their land as a footpath and neither do we. We just wanted to protect our property. The couple ran a sweet shop up until , but closed and converted it into a living room. Estate agent Pattinson, who are selling the house, say the property has so many potential options. In the particulars, they say: Perhaps it will become a beautul and substantial family home, maybe with a separate granny annex, or split into two separate dwellings. Maybe the former shop could once again be put back into service, and what could be done with the garage...  The mind boggles. Mr and Mrs Williams are hoping to move  miles away to the idyllic village of Rothbury, where notorious killer Raoul Moat shot himself after being cornered by cops.

Bash, bash it, ooh, it’s biting.”The teaching assistant, of Wythenshawe, Greater Manchester, was found guilty of wildle offences following a joint investigation by RSPCA and Cheshire Police. Her boyfriend, Grant Leigh Jnr, , of the same address, was also found guilty, reports Manchester Evening News.Shocking footage reveals Leigh Jnr showing the toddler how to hit a badger with a spade. In another clip, Carding encouraged the toddler to get a lurcher dog to attack a badger den saying aposaposher face is going to be smashed. Good boy, get him out. Look at them fighting.aposapos  She further baited three dogs into aposapospulling a fox to pieces.aposapos Inquiries revealed Carding had been joined on the family expedition by her boyfriend and his ex-huntsman father, Grant Leigh Snr, , of Tameside. One picture showed Grant Jr holding a dead fox with a child accompanied by the caption family day out, learn these kids young. Hunting mad. Carding, who worked at a primary school in Manchester for six years until , was found guilty of five cruelty charges under the Protection of Badgers Act  at Tameside Magistratesapos Court. Grant Sr was found guilty of two offences under the Animal Welfare Act. Grant Jr changed his plea to guilty at the start of the trial, admitting to seven cruelty offences. The joint investigation began in October  after a police wildle crime officer was tipped off about a private Facebook group called The Real Terrier Men and Lurcher Men.Photos and videos of illegal fox hunting and badger baiting were shown in the group. Grant Sr operated as a group administrator and posted messages including anybody up for a few dogs. He also boasted about taking his son badger baiting as a way of celebrating his recent prison release.Another picture he posted showed his partner with a fox and another of a black and white dog with blood on its face. Officers traced the three suspects and seized seven dogs including two Lurchers and two Patterdale terriers - many of which had telltale injuries consistent with aposaposhunting activities.aposapos Six of the injured hounds were rescued from dirty and squalid kennels at the rear of Grant Sraposs home in Hyde. The seventh was found at Cardingaposs home.  RPSCA prosecutor Hazel Stevens said: “This is a case that is shocking and horrendous and in which children are present. “The fact a two-year-old child was being encouraged to join in can only be described as barbaric. Two mobile phones were seized which revealed a series of video clips showing badger baiting and fox hunting, the prosecutor said. aposaposIn these video clips Grant Jr is pictured showing a child how to hit a live badger over the head with a spade, she continued. Cardingaposs voice is heard and it appears that she is filming and providing commentary. On one video, she was encouraging a child to get a dog to attack a wild animal. aposaposOne video depicts a male digging into a badger sett and then a chamber being revealed with badger material and what appeared to be the head of a badger within. “This is a family affair and as they call it on Facebook, it is a family day out where they went to hunt and kill foxes and badgers. aposaposShe was encouraging a dog to pull a fox to pieces and in another video a two year old child is told to say ‘aposf**k off’, which is amusing to them. She encourages the child to join in and in these videos. “This is an ongoing violent, nasty and vicious treatment of wild animals for their own enjoyment.aposapos An independent vet who attended the scene during the investigation said in his report that the kennels were ‘unhygienic’ and described many of the dogs as having ‘mature scars’. When Leigh Sr was arrested, officers found a kennel block in the back garden containing six dogs - three of which were recognisable from the videos.  The two black Patterdale Terriers had scarring on their faces and one was underweight three bull lurcher types - one called Mission - also had facial injuries and a white and black terrier - called Clover - had fresh wounds and a swollen face and muzzle. RSPCA investigator Kirsty Withnall told the court: “Grant Jr was involved in the buying and selling of dogs but Grant Sr had taken over on behalf of his son. “They had a reasonable turnover of dogs which had been sold and bought. aposaposComments on the Facebook page talked of ‘bangs pigs %’, and ‘lurcher that will do everything and I mean everything.’ There were a lot of links to hunting everything from badgers to deer. aposaposThere are children in the photos and Paris Carding was present during the recordings. She was responsible for taking the footage. There is a Facebook video posted by Grant Senior of a aposfamily day outapos.aposapos Another RSPCA inspector said: aposaposOn the videos Paris says: ‘There it is, it’s a pig isn’t it.’ A pig is a term to mean badger. The terrier will go into the hole and it will locate the badger and pull it out. There are three dogs on that video with the badger. Paris says ‘Good boy, get him out. Look at them fighting’.  The voice was of Paris Carding and there is no potential it could have been of anyone . I knew this from the five second conversation I had with her. I had no idea of her job or what she did.aposapos In a police interview, Carding gave a statement denying it was her in the videos but her voice was recognised by the headmaster at her school. She did not give any evidence in her defence. Grant Sraposs defence lawyer Chris Squibbs said: aposaposHe was previously employed as a huntsman and he maintains his interest in this. “He has been involved in these activities because it was passed down to him by his father and he passed it down to his son.aposapos But District Judge Bernard Begley told Carding: aposaposA lot has been made of the ‘family day out’ and I am satisfied it was you in the clips in question giving active encouragement to those present.

She has now been reunited with her familyDaisy was reunited with her owner Francis Briley by the Animal Warden team Image: Public Protection Partnership   SWNSByTom Campbell:,  Feb |comments A pooch stolen  months ago has been reunited with her family thanks to dogged detective work by the woman who found her  miles from home.Amazed owner Francis Briley, who had given up hope of seeing the English springer spaniel again, said: “We’re all overjoyed.”Daisy the dog was nabbed from her home in the summer of , probably to breed at a puppy farm.She was found abandoned last month by the woman who then took her to a vet. Tracking the dog’s owners was very dficult as her microchip details had not been registered. Daisy spent seven nights in kennels and would have been rehomednot for the woman picking up a scent. She trawled through the Dog Lost website in search of her owners, while the hound was handed over to the Public Protection Partnership animal warden team. Daisy’s fur had been clipped in what was probably an attempt to conceal her identity, making the search more dficult. Fortunately, she had distinctive markings and colouring which matched a post on the Dog Lost site about a spaniel that had been stolen near Ashford, Kent, in .Daisy, who was found in Bracknell, Berks, was reunited with her owner after animal wardens were able to confirm her identity with the help of Kent police.Francis said: “I can’t believe I have her back. I’m so grateful to the lady who found her and to the animal warden team for bringing us back together again.”He added the microchip details were not registered because the paperwork had been lost in a fire when she was a puppy and the issue then went out of his head.Daisy was found in decent health. She had recently had a litter, suggesting she was stolen to breed at a puppy farm. The animal wardens said it is “rare” to locate an ownerthe dog’s microchip has not been registered. They added Daisy was “very close to being rehomed”.

David Nicholls, once head of Glenfer High School in Paisley, Renfrewshire, said he drove to the Premier Inn in Glasgow trying to find Melissa Tweedie - who had allegedly had sex with a former pupil.The head arrived at around .am on June   before he was met by six pupils in the foyer. The students were adamant when they told him that Tweedie, then , was sharing a room with an -year-old boy.After managing to reach the former PE Teacher on the phone- she claimed to be at home, the Daily Record reports.However, the following day Mr Nicholls said the pupil who was in the room admitted that he had slept with Miss Tweedie.Miss Tweedie is alleged to have partied with pupils at their school prom at SWG nightclub in Glasgow before going back with them to a Premier Hotel in June . She faces being struck off the teaching register by the General Teaching Council for Scotland following an investigation into the allegations. Giving evidence to the  today , Mr Nicholls said: On the evening of the leavers dance I became aware that something was wrong. I sawHeather Prentice and Lyndsay Cameron.  They said Miss Tweedie had left with a group of pupils. She seemed absolutely fine and compos mentis . I later found out from senior staff that they thought she was getting over familiar with a certain senior student. Staff members were telling Miss Tweedie that they would get her a lt or a taxi. She refused and said she was getting a lt from her flat mate. He added: At :am, one of the senior boys phoned me. The boy who phoned seemed alarmed and said that Miss Tweedie was in the hotel. He seemed quite anxious. When I got into the foyer I found six pupils, including the Head Boy and Deputy Head Girl, they seemed anxious and said that a member of staff was in the hotel. Hotel staff asked the age of the people involved and when they ascertained that they were of legal age they said it was not their problem. One of the boys was adamant that they saw her in one of the hotel rooms. Referring to the moment he reached Miss Tweedie on the phone, Mr Nicholls said: She did sound a little drowsy. She told me that she had been at the hotel but was now at home. I told her to come and see me in the morning. The students showed me how to take a snapshot of my location on my phone. I sent that to her and asked her to send the same. She did not reply. I eventually got home at am and was back up for work at am. Mr Nicholls arranged a meeting with Pupil A at Glenfer High School the following morning. He said: The pupil came in alone. He said theyaposd been in the room having a drink with other pupils, then they began to leave. I asked him aposdid you have sex with a member of staff apos He said aposyesapos. The following day Mr Nicholls suspended Miss Tweedie while they carried out an investigation. He said: I had a letter on authority to tell her that she had to be suspended. Miss Tweedie was told she was suspended, with no option for conversation. She broke down in tears. She left shortly afterwards. Miss Tweedie, who now lives in Dubai working as a yoga instructor, faces being struck off the register by the General Teaching Council for Scotlandfollowing the allegations. The allegations read: Between  June  and  June , whilst employed by Renfrewshire Council as a PE Teacher at Glenfer High School, at the senior prom and immediately thereafter, you danced inappropriately with pupils during the prom, including making inappropriate physical contact whilst dancing with them at SWG, Glasgow. [You] kissed Pupil A at the hotel in which pupils were staying for the night, the Premier Inn Hotel and engaged in sexual intercourse with Pupil A after the prom, at the Premier Inn. [You drank a shotat the bar of SWG, behaved in an inappropriate manner in a hotel room at the Premier Inn by drinking alcohol in the presence of pupils and stating words to the effect of Can we for a minute act like Iaposm not a teacher to a pupil. Further allegations state the teacher was alone on a bed with Pupil A and, when Pupil E entered the room, stated to Pupil E words to the effect of: Technically I havenapost touched him yet. [You] were under the influence of alcohol to the point of being inebriated in the presence of pupils in the Premier Inn [and] had awareness that an ex pupil was in possession of drugs and did not report this to the appropriate authorities.

A good nightaposs sleep helps cut appetite by up to  calories a day, according to a new study, which argues that more rest could save millions of people in the UK from piling on the pounds. It is estimated that two out of every three men and six out of  women in England are either obese or overweight. Obesity increases a personaposs chances of suffering from mental health problems and has been linked with heart conditions, diabetes and cancer, all leading causes of death. Now scientists at the University of Chicago Medicine have come up with a simple solution which many people are likely to welcome - getting more kip. Author Dr Esra Tasali said: Over the years, we and others have shown that sleep restriction has an effect on appetite regulation that leads to increased food intake, and thus puts you at risk for weight gain over time.  More recently, the question that everyone was asking was, ‘Well,this is what happens with sleep loss, can we extend sleep and reverse some of these adverse outcomes apos” The researchers recruited  young, overweight adults, who would usually only sleep for six and half hours a night. They were asked to wear a sleep monitor and given counselling sessions to bring their shut-eye up to eight and half hours per night. This way, participants were able to continue sleeping in their own beds and did not have to change their diets. Dr Tasali said: “Most other studies on this topic in labs are short-lived, for a couple of days, and food intake is measured by how much participants consume from an offered diet. “In our study, we only manipulated sleep, and had the participants eat whatever they wanted, with no food logging or anything  to track their nutrition by themselves.”Participants increased their average sleep duration by over an hour a night after just one counselling session. To track their calorie intake, the researchers used a special urine test called the doubly labelled water method. It involves giving participants water where the hydrogen and oxygen atoms have been replaced with less common harmless substances. Senior author Professor Dale Schoeller said: This is considered the gold standard for objectively measuring daily energy expenditure in a non-laboratory, real-world setting and it has changed the way human obesity is studied.  People who get more sleep reduce their calorie intake by an average of  kcal per day, with some even cutting out , the researchers found. This translates to roughly kg [lbs] of weight loss over three years, provided the effects were maintained over a long term. Dr Tasali said: “We saw that after just a single sleep counselling session, participants could change their bedtime habits enough to lead to an increase in sleep duration. We simply coached each inidual on good sleep hygiene, and discussed their own personal sleep environments, providing tailored advice on changes they could make to improve their sleep duration. Importantly, to blind participants to sleep intervention, recruitment materials did not mention sleep intervention, allowing us to capture true habitual sleep patterns at baseline.” The study lasted four weeks, with the first two being dedicated to finding out how many hours participants enjoyed. Dr Tasali said: “This was not a weight-loss study. But even within just two weeks, we have quantied evidence showing a decrease in caloric intake and a negative energy balance - caloric intake is less than calories burned. A healthy sleep pattern could therefore be used to combat obesity, which affects around % of the worldaposs population. Dr Tasali said: If healthy sleep habits are maintained over longer duration, this would lead to clinically important weight loss over time. Many people are working hard to find ways to decrease their caloric intake to lose weight -well, just by sleeping more, you may be able to reduce it substantially.” The findings were published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine.

The -year-old noticed the blotch on the right side of her forehead years ago, but thought it was a birthmark so didnapost think much of it. She started noticing the mark because it stayed white while the rest of her face became red while exercising, in training as a -time British skipping champion.It became more prominent during her pregnancy, prompting Rachael to get it checked and discover she had basal cell carcinoma - the most common type of skin cancer.She then faced a terrying nine-month wait until after she had given birth to have surgery - allowing the cancer to spread and meaning a larger area of skin had to be removed.  The fitness business owner has now shared shocking photos of the hole in her forehead and the large scar sheaposs been left with after surgery. Rachael wants to warn people about the risk of skin cancer even for those who arenapost sun-worshippers. The woman from Redditch in Worcestershire said: I first noticed it a few years ago but stupidly I didnapost get it checked out until recently. I thought it was a birthmark to start off with so I didnapost really think anything of it, just because Iaposd had it for so long and it never grew from what I saw anyway. But when I fell pregnant last year I really started really noticing a dference - it started looking more prominent even when I wasnapost exercising and it looked bigger around the edges so it was growing. I had this test where they basically take a section of it out like a hole punch and test it and the results came back that it was low-grade skin cancer.I knew it could just keep spreading and growing and I just wanted to get it out but being pregnant I didnapost want to cause any issues with that. After finding out what it was and having to wait to get it removed it was playing on my mind quite a bit. While I had to wait to have the surgery I was worried about it spreading - Iaposd already had it for a few years and I just kept thinking how much bigger is it going to get in that time. I knew the bigger the area was the bigger the scar would be and it was already quite a big area. If Iaposd left it any longer it could have gone into my eyebrow or hairline which isnapost nice to think.But it was definitely worth it to have my baby here and healthy and both of us are okay now. The mum says she first noticed the mark on her face in  but brushed it off for years until it started to look more prominent during her pregnancy last year. At the beginning of , a suspicious mole on her mumaposs back was diagnosed as low-grade skin cancer, which also encouraged Rachael to get her mark checked out.  After visiting her local GP in February  she was referred to a dermatologist at Kidderminster Hospital in May that year, where a test confirmed she had basal cell carcinoma.With the NHS waiting time for an operation being up to two years, Rachael decided to go private for Mohs surgery - where a specialist cuts away the affected area and further another layer of skin to make sure they get all of the cancerous cells.So just four months after the mum and her husband Adam Rollisson, , welcomed their baby James, she had surgery at Solihull Hospital, on January th. Rachael said: I was fully awake for the surgery and that was the scariest thing. They injected the area with a local anaesthetic so I had quite a few injections in my head to numb it and that was probably the most painful part of it. They cut the skin away and take it away for a few hours to test it and make sure theyaposve got all of it. They got it all in one go the first time so I was quite lucky and then I went back in for an hour and a half to have it sewn back up. That was probably the worst bit because it was a lot of pulling and tugging of the skin, which wasnapost nice at all. The feeling of the skin being pulled over is going to haunt me. They allowed me to take a picture of the hole left by the section they took out before they sewed it back up again so that was quite scary seeing that. I didnapost think it would be that big of a surgery so when I came out of the surgery I was quite upset because the scar was so big but Iaposm just relieved Iaposm in the clear now. The mum says her skin cancer diagnosis came as a shock as she has always been careful with sun cream and doesnapost sit in the rays much. After her scary experience, she warns that aposit can happen to anyoneapos and hopes to encourage people to get their skin checked. Rachael said: Iaposm not really a sun-worshipper but I do tan really easily. I wasnapost in the sun often at all, not enough to expect to have something like this anyway. Itaposs scary because it shows that it really can happen to anyone, evenyouaposre not a sun-worshipper. Iaposve always been quite careful with sun cream but Iaposll definitely be even more careful now, especially with the baby. I would just advise people to get anything dferent on their skin checked out definitely.

Daisy Cranshaw was still processing the heartbreaking news mum-of-three Tina could be dead within a year due to her own tumour when she started suffering excruciating headaches of her own.The -year-old was finally given an emergency MRI when she developed a blind spot in one of her eyes.Months earlier, Tina, , was on a work Zoom call when she started slurring her words and her face drooped, reports StokeonTrentLive. She also complained of being able to smell gas and her shocked colleagues called an ambulance. Doctors originally thought sheaposd suffered a stroke, but tests revealed she had a terminal brain tumour the size of a golf ball and just  months to live.  Daisy said Tina, who works for a charity, was on an online video meeting at home in Doncaster, South Yorks, when colleagues first realised something was wrong. She said: During the meeting, my step mum had the worst headache, and she could smell gas. “She started slurring her words and her face drooped, so her colleagues called an ambulance. Tina, also mum to Theo, nine, Imogen, , and Abbie, , was taken to Doncaster Royal Infirmary . Doctors initially thought she had suffered a stroke, but a CT scan revealed a shadow on her brain. Tina was then sent to Royal Hallamshire Hospital in Sheffield for a further MRI scan, with doctors confirming there that she had a brain tumour.  Daisy said: “It was horrible. I was doing my mock GCSEs, so it was a really stressful time. I was so worried, I kept thinking: ‘This may be the last time I see my step mum’.” On October , , Tina underwent an operation to remove the tumour, which was the size of a golf ball. But she was given the devastating diagnosis that she only had between six and  months to live. Daisy, of Middlesbrough, North Yorks., said her symptoms had started in February of the same year.Her GP put her headaches down to stress and when she went to AE, medics had told her she had a migraine. It was only during a face-to-face appointment with her GP in September  that she told him she had a blind spot on the left side of her eye. On December , she had an emergency MRI scan which revealed a mass on her brain. She was then referred to the Royal Victoria Infirmaryin Newcastle, where her tumour was confirmed. Luckily for Daisy, her tumour is non-le-threatening, but she said the news was still hard to take for the family. She added: “It was the worst thing to hear, especially after seeing what my step-mum has gone through. “Dad is gradually losing his we, and I thought that he could also be losing me. It was horrible. “Fortunately, they found that some of my brain tumour is dead, which is brilliant news. “I need to have scans every three months, but I’ve been told it’s not le-threatening and they don’t need to operate yet.” Daisy is walking , steps every day this month to raise money for Brain Tumour Research. She said: “There is such a lack of research into this devastating disease and more needs to be done. “Not everyone is as fortunate as me to not have to have any treatment immediately like my wonderful step mum. “She’s my inspiration in doing this as she always makes me persevere in everything I do.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON HospitalsTeenagersBrain Tumours\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The building, which dates back to , was used as a home for the orphaned children of sailors but it has been empty for nearly  years, reports Glasgow Live. The old school, commonly known as the Balrossie Orphanage, is about  miles west of Glasgow.It was paid a visit by an urban explorer who captured the crumbling ruins and creepy atmosphere in a series of snaps. Kyle Urbex, the Leeds-based photographer and urban explorer has visited dozens of abandoned sites over the past  months. He said the orphanage had been on his list for quite a while.Kyle said the old orphanage looked like it would soon be gone forever, so he was glad to be able to visit last week, while there was still something left to see. He said: I arrived [at Balrossie] last Saturday and when I first got there I noticed that half of the building had already been demolished. There was a big massive pile of rubble in the middle.I reckon the rest of it will be gone very, very soon. I can imagine itaposll be gone within the next few months, or something like that. Thataposs why I go exploring to capture all these forgotten buildings before theyaposre gone forever. Amidst all the rubble and debris, signs of the old schoolaposs former use were evident, despite it having closed back in . The site has repeatedly been the target for vandals, and, in , the buildingaposs fate was sealed when it was subject to an arson attack. Following the resulting blaze, which was attended to by more than  firefighters, a building inspection was carried out and the Balrossie school was declared unsafe.  Parts of the building have since been demolished, with more of the structure to follow suit. Due to the Balrossieaposs deteriorating condition, Kyle admitted his latest Scottish excursion was particularly dangerous and that he had to make extra sure certain parts were stable before proceeding. It was quite dangerous. Essentially itaposs a construction site. The second building I went in didnapost have an upstairs, as the floor had already caved in. I tried walking up the stairway, but it was literally starting to fall apart. I do take extra precautions. For example,Iaposm upstairs in a building and it feels quite weak then Iaposll always put something thataposs heavier than myself there first just to make sure.Since starting up his risky hobby back in June , Kyle said he has visited  abandoned buildings and regularly posts his photos on Instagram and Facebook.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON EducationSchoolsArsonAbandoned placesGlasgow City\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Humans naturally gravitate towards animals that look like our babies, with round heads, big eyes and flat faces.But our growing desire for dog breeds with these characteristics is causing them immense suffering, with their genetically pre-disposed health issues requiring a letime of expensive and stressful surgeries and medication. Last week, Norway announced the selective breeding of British Bulldogs and Cavalier King Charles Spaniels has been banned in a landmark ruling against the aposcruelapos process.Oslo District Court ruled that reproducing the two breeds breaches the Animal Welfare Act in Norway. The court ruled that the practice leads to man-made health issues for the animals after lawyers argued it was no longer possible to maintain the health of the breeds. Getthe newsyou want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here The new ruling added that breeders who work towards closing the door on the animalsapos health problems can continue, bringing some hope for lovers of the two breeds in Norway. British Bulldogs and aposCavviesapos have a brachycephalic face, meaning their skull is compressed and flat - and so are the structures inside it. This means they not only have a lot of folds around their faces which causes skin issues, but major breathing problems. Flat-faced dogs have rocketed in popularity in recent years with a , per cent increase in ownership in the UK of French Bulldogs alone since , according to figures from Kennel Club. But  per cent of short nosed dog owners could not recognise signs that their pet was having breathing dficulties, according to a study by the Royal Veterinary College in . The health issues are deeply unpleasant for the dog and for the owners, who witness the suffering and must fork out for treatment - and itaposs tough for the vets who operate on the suffering puppies, day in day out.I spoke to Tavishi Pandya, a -year-old vet who graduated in  and works in Waltham Forest. She thinks Norwayaposs ban is a step forward - but warned it could encourage back-door breeders to continue underground, making the situation even worse. The way we have bred these dogs is forcing them to live a le where they are under unnecessary stress, says Tav. On hot days, you use your whole nose to cool the air down, but Bulldogs canapost do that, so they suffer a lot with heatstroke. The dogs end up suffering from BOAS , where their soft palette goes over their upper glottis, and causes the loud snorting breaths we associate with flat-faced dogs. Tav points out that while we might think these noises are adorable and that they indicate the dog is happy, what it really means is they are struggling for breath. Imagineyou had to breathe with a plastic bag over your head all the time, she says.There is always an element of respiratory distress because they have to fight a lot harder to maintain their oxygen levels. Sothey are put under stress, we see a lot of collapses, they canapost run around like normal dogs can and they get out of breath. Tav explains that over time, the snorting sound the pups make begins to affect the structures in their throats and makes them swell up. Iaposve seen many cases where their throats are so swollen the dogs are at risk of collapse and death, she says. All of these things are a completely man-made problem. Meanwhile, Cavalier King Charles Spaniels can also suffer with Brachycephalic airway disease, though not to the same extent.They are more susceptible to heart defects, eye disease, joint problems and chronic headaches or syringomyelia - a neurological condition caused by their brains being too big to fit in their skull.This is painful and distressing for owners, says Tav. Their brains are essentially being squished.  She explained the dogs will often struggle with their balance and with neck pain. aposCavviesapos are also genetically disposed to heart conditions which means they are much more prone to congestive heart failure, something Tav sees every day. Youaposre breeding a dog and you know for a fact thereaposs a high risk that later on in le it will have to be on medication just so it can breathe, and its lespan is much reduced, she says. Itaposs stressful for owners, the dogs, and itaposs expensive to fix. Tav says itaposs heartbreaking to have to put a young dog to sleep because of the issues that come from selective breeding, and to have to tell owners that their new puppy is going to be unwell for most of its le. We are selfish, we are breeding them like this just because we like the way they look, she adds.  British Bulldogs, French Bulldogs and Pugs have similar issues, says Tav. They have major skin issues - they are so uncomfortable. Imagine being itchy your entire le, and getting infections so often you need antibiotics every month or every other month, she says. We donapost want animals on medication all the time, thataposs not our goal. But weaposre fighting with genetics, so itaposs out of our control. Why breed them this way  Tav believes there is a lack of education about the issues that come with certain dog breeds, and owners are often shocked to learn their new addition to the family will need major surgery once itaposs fully grown just so it can breathe slightly better. Iaposve come across many owners who have been hit with these vet bills and health concerns, and they tell me, aposIf I had known this before, I would never have bought the breed,apos she says.  Soyouaposre thinking about getting a puppy - get a healthy breed. We arenapost saying thereaposs a breed with absolutely no health conditions guaranteed, but why pick a breed where the risk factors are so much higher  It makes our job ten times harder, and owners often donapost understand until the situation is very, very bad. Sometimes owners even accuse Tav and her colleagues, who donapost work on commission, of money-grabbing and suggesting unnecessary treatment. That can definitely take a toll on you, having to go over these things with owners who are just ill-informed and unaware, she added. A happy checkup has to be taken to quite a serious place where I have to warn the owner to keep an eye on their dogaposs breathing all the time, anditaposs making noises when itaposs running around having fun, you need to stop the fun - I donapost want to have to advise that. Itaposs upsetting to know what these dogs are going to have to go through in le, they will suffer. Asked whether she thinks the Norway ban should be brought to the UK, Tav warns an absolute ban opens the door to underground breeders selling the dogs, which would make the situation even worse. Instead, she thinks breeders should work to eradicate these common health issues, with certication and a protocol that ensures only healthy dogs are bred from.Tav suggested a breeding license that gives a certicate of health to the Bulldogs and the Cavvies, similar to the recently-passed Lucyaposs Law, which made it illegal for third party dealers, such as pet shops and online traders, to sell puppies.Tav is quick to point out she and her colleagues love the dogs themselves, and she doesnapost believe the breeds should be totally banned - but the health issues must be bred out of them. We arenapost saying get rid of the breed, we are just saying please breed them in a way that they donapost have all these issues - breed them with longer noses, she adds.

The most pleasurable part was getting up the beach before anyone . We saw deer, rabbits and foxes on the beach. The feeling is is a real privilege. It is so special.He also said that seeing porpoises and seals were a common occurrence. We saw the sand dunes develop, he said. We saw a whole ecosystem reclaiming the land from the sea. It is fascinating. It is not like owning anything .It is good for the soul. In order to decide who he will sell to, he needs to know what potential buyers intentions are. I have had serious interest, so I am going to shortlist people who want to own it for the right reasons. I had about  messages and about  serious buyers. I have now got to whittle it down to three people. There is going to be a chance for interested buyers to take a tour of the beach, where they will be told information and can ask questions. It is at pm on Sunday, February  starting at the Bell Inn in Ingoldmells. One person interested in buying has essentially told Simon to name as high of a price as he likes. Simon said: Someone came to me with an open chequebook because they really wanted to buy it - but he added he wonapost sell it for more moneythe person is not buying the beach for the right reasons.

Meghan Markle and Prince Harry welcomed their first-born son Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor on th May .While many royal fans were disappointed that they couldnapost gather outside the hospital to offer the couple their congratulations, they were able to learn more about the birth through his birth certicate. Like all birth certicates, the document is a public record and was released later that month. It details the location and time of his birth as well as some interesting facts about Harry and Meghan, like her official job title. The document lists her role as Princess of the United Kingdom - and many fans were confused as Meghanaposs official title is Duchess.

She is Her Royal Highness Princess Henry of Wales through her husband, Harry. Under the job section part of the form on Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louisaposs birth certicates, she is also listed as a princess.Some fans were also surprised to see her name was listed as Rachel Meghan under the aposmotheraposs nameapos section as many people did not realise this is her real name. Her parents Thomas Markle and Doria Ragland have called her Meghan since birth, and all of her friends use it rather than Rachel. But just a few months later, it emerged that Meghan and Harry had changed the aposmotheraposs nameapos section of the document to say aposDuchess of Sussex.apos A statement released to the media said: The change of name on public documents in  was dictated by The Palace, as confirmed by documents from senior Palace officials. This was not requested by Meghan, The Duchess of Sussex nor by The Duke of Sussex. “To see this UK tabloid and their carnival of so-called ‘experts’ choose to deceptively whip this into a calculated family ‘snub’ and suggest that she would oddly want to be nameless on her child’s birth certicate, or any other legal document would be laughable were it not offensive.

The Joint European Torustokamak - a fusion reactor - produced  megajoules of heat over a five-second period on Wednesday. This is more than double previous records achieved in  at the UK Atomic Energy Authoritysite in Oxford. The breakthrough demonstrates the potential of fusion to deliver a safe and sustainable low-carbon energy, experts say. With no greenhouse gas emissions and abundant fuels, fusion can be a safe and sustainable part of the worldaposs future energy supply, scientists suggest. Fusion energy is based on the same principle by which stars create heat and light.  Atoms are combined rather than split, as in a nuclear reactor, and special forms of hydrogen are used as fuel. But harnessing and reining in the forces involved is a huge challenge, as at the heart of a fusion reactor is a super-hot cloud of electrically charged gas, or plasma, many times hotter than the sunaposs core. However, researchers say it is a power worth striving for, with one expert saying it is a source of energy that helps protect the planet for future generations. During the latest experiment, JET averaged a fusion power of around  megawatts . The previous energy record from a fusion experiment, achieved by JET in , was  megajoules of heat energy. However, the peak power of  megawatts achieved briefly in  has not been achieved in recent experiments as the focus has been on sustained fusion power.  Tony Donne, EUROfusion programme manager, said: If we can maintain fusion for five seconds, we can do it for five minutes and then five hours as we scale up our operations in future machines. This is a big moment for every one of us and the entire fusion community. Ian Chapman, the UKAEAaposs CEO, said the reward comes after more than  years of research and experiments. He added: These landmark results have taken us a huge step closer to conquering one of the biggest scientic and engineering challenges of them all. Itaposs clear we must make signicant changes to address the effects of climate change, and fusion offers so much potential. When light atoms merge to form heavier ones, a large amount of energy is released.  To do this, a few grams of hydrogen fuels are heated to temperatures  times hotter than the centre of the sun, forming a product - called plasma - in which fusion reactions take place. A commercial fusion power station would use the energy produced by fusion reactions to generate electricity. Ian Fells, Emeritus Professor of energy conversion at the University of Newcastle, said: The production of  megajoules of heat energy from fusion over a period of five seconds is a landmark in fusion research. Now it is up to the engineers to translate this into carbon-free electricity and mitigate the problem of climate change. Fusion began with the explosion of the hydrogen bomb in  but it has taken until now to achieve five seconds of fusion, the professor explained. And it could be used to deliver energy in the next ten to  years, the results suggest.  Researchers say the experiments are a major boost for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor , the larger and more advanced version of JET.Iter is a fusion research project supported by seven members - China, the European Union, India, Japan, Korea, Russia and the US-based in the south of France.The researchers say the achievement is a major step forward on fusionaposs road map as a safe, efficient, low carbon means of tackling the global energy crisis. The record was achieved by researchers from the EUROfusion consortium - , experts, students and staff from across Europe, co-funded by the European Commission. Dr Mark Wenman, reader in nuclear materials at Imperial College London, said: For me, this means we can expect big things from Iter and that fusion energy really is no longer just a dream of the far future. The engineering to make it a useful, clean power source is achievable and happening now. Professor Sue Ion, Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering, said the latest results demonstrate how much progress has been made and that it is worth pursuing. She added: Efforts must now concentrate on the very signicant engineering and materials challenges which are still to be overcome before fusion can be considered a realistic and reliable energy source.

Dressed as a shark, he follows her around, before convincing her to join him in a private world where others cannot see or hear them. He creates a portal and the two disappear inside. Another girl, who appears to be a young teen, is standing on the roof of a tall building, looking down. A male user, using a monkey avatar, taunts her from below, shouting: “Jump! jump!”. He later gets other young users together to teach them ‘lessons of le’, and writes the chilling instruction: “Kill yourself”. In another room, a robot avatar with a deep voice is putting his hands on a little fairy, who also has a child’s voice. She tries to move away from them, asking: “Who is this paedophile ” “Me,” the robot replies. “I just want to put you in my pocket and bring you home, little fairy girl. I’d put you in my sink and give you a bubble bath”.  Such alarming online scenes might seem like something you would find in the deepest parts of the dark web. But they are actually from the most popular chatroom app on one of this year’s must-have gaming devices, Oculus.Millions of families now have the VR headsets, now called Meta Quest, while the Oculus app needed to play on them was the most popular on Apple’s App Store over Christmas, with . million downloads worldwide. While most parents might reasonably expect the device – owned by Meta, formerly known as Facebook – is safe for their children to use, the reality is chillingly dferent.Within minutes of entering one of the virtual reality worlds on VRChat, where adults freely mix with young children who are clearly much younger than the Oculus’s age limit of over , we witnessed shocking scenes. They included racist, homophobic and misogynistic language, bullying and threats, as well as explicitly sexual conversation and abusive behaviour, including simulating sex, virtual sexual harassment and masturbation. In almost all the incidents, minors were present. Children were also regularly exposed to graphic sexual content and pornography, including digital avatars showing naked bodies and users drawing explicit images.  The Oculus VR devices are central to Meta’s pursuit of the “metaverse” – an interconnected D world where people interact via digital avatars. Announcing his company’s change of name to reflect their goal in October, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg promised that metaverse products would be designed “for safety and privacy and inclusion”. But that is not what we found in virtual rooms in VRChat, which is listed fourth in the Oculus’s most popular apps. Conversations in the chat rooms are littered with explicit and offensive language. In one room, users – including children – crowded around a SpongeBob SquarePants avatar as he pretended to commit sex acts. Although Meta this week announced it would introduced a mandatory four-foot personal boundary between people’s digital avatars in its own apps, campaigners point out it does not apply to others on their , like VR Chat. While it is dficult to accurately identy those behind the avatars, it is clear that the rooms attract vulnerable teens. One, dressed as a skeleton, told a male monkey avatar that his dad “left me after  years” and that “I haven’t seen my mother in a while”. When the monkey, who had an older voice, wrote ‘kill yourself’ in the air, the skeleton replied, “I have a kne on me right now actually. I have five knives in my room.” Our findings are backed up by user reviews, one said the game is “full of genuinely worrying people talking explicitly and sexually to young kids.” Meta’s VR policies prohibit bullying, abuse and harassment, including “sexualising minors in any way”. But while Oculus has a form where users can report abuse, the Center for Countering Digital Hate claims Meta rarely takes them seriously, reporting  policy violations on Oculus, they did not receive a response. Imran Ahmed, the charity’s chief executive, branded it “a cesspit of hate, pornography and child grooming.” Hannah Ruschen, Child Safety Online Policy Officer at the NSPCC, said: “Immersive environments are the new frontier in the Wild West Web and children are at huge risk of abuse because tech bosses haven’t learnt that putting growth before safety has consequences.” A spokesman for Meta said it provides tools to report and block others, adding: “Quest devices are + and were not designed for younger children. “We encourage parents to monitor use, limit the time using the headset, and ensure they take breaks.”  Gaming risks: what parents need to know Do you really know what your children do when they are playing video games, and the types of gaming that can put them at most risk  Here the NSPCC outline six aspects of gaming that all parents need to be aware of. Power dynamics In many online games some players have more power than others. Those who have gained more achievements are looked up to by those who are newer to the game, and passing on their knowledge to others is often used as currency. Children who want to earn more badges or points, and be looked up to themselves, are often vulnerable to grooming by adults who could help them. Cross- risks You might think your kids are just playing on one gaming device, but often they are using a number of s simultaneously, putting themselves at more risk. A child may be playing a game while also talking to someone in a separate community, or on a chat service such as Discord. It’s also common for gamers to meet a player in a game and then connect with them on one of several social networks. Offenders often use multiple accounts to target a child, knowing there is no system in place for dferent s and social networks to tell each other about suspicious or abusive accounts. Live streaming If your child is a gaming fan they’ll probably watch others live streaming themselves playing and commentating on games. However, while watching livestreams is increasingly popular among kids, the technology that can flag harmful content and behaviour as it happens has not caught up with the pace of this development. It means there is more risk a child can be exposed to material that would be removed on a more traditional . Real time text and voice chat Many games allow players to talk to and text others while playing. Companies find it dficult to keep on top of abusive chat and step in to remove suspicious people. In voice chat, girls are particularly at risk as their voices are easily distinguishable making them vulnerable to misogynist and sexist abuse. So called ‘pile ons’ where people conspire to harass a single user, are common. Immersive gaming and VR In many immersive worlds, where we can embody avatars, interact with others and explore D landscapes, children can mix with adults with little to no moderation. Even on kid-friendly Roblox there have been reports of virtual strip clubs with children seen virtually lap-dancing to earn money to spend in the game. The NSPCC is calling on the Government to toughen up the Online Safety Bill to hold tech firms and bosses to account for failing to protect children in these immersive environments Bullying and harassment Research shows one in six children have experienced bullying or abuse when playing games connected with other users online. % of women have experienced sexist abuse when gaming, while LGBTQ gamers are at particular risk. A type of cyber-attack called doxxing is common – where personally identying information is shared as a way to abuse members of marginalised groups.

Child of Courage Harmonie-Rose Allen, eight, and -year-old Max Woosey who won the Spirit of Adventure Award at the star-studded event, will camp out together along with presenter Carol Vorderman and an army of supporters as Max, aka The Boy In The Tent, hits an incredible two years of sleeping outside.“It’s going to be a real celebration of what Max has achieved,” says the schoolboy’s mum Rachael. “The fact Harmonie-Rose is joining him is amazing. She and Max are very similar in many ways. They’re gutsy and brave and they just don’t believe there’s anything they can’t achieve. They’re an inspiration to be around.”  Max, from Braunton, north Devon, received his award from adventure hero Bear Grylls in October after sleeping outside for more than  nights, raising £, for his local hospice. Neighbour and family friend Rick Abbott had given the youngster a tent when he was terminally ill, and told him to have an adventure. It was after Rick’s death that Max did a sponsored camp out, intially hoping to raise £ for the hospice that had cared for his friend.Harmonie-Rose from Bath raised more than £, for charity after contracting Meningitis at just  months old. Doctors at first told mum Freya Hall and dad Ross Allen she had a % chance of survival. As well as having part of her arms and legs removed after they became infected, the youngster also lost part of her nose.During lockdown she embarked on the . Challenge for charity Meningitis Now completing six tasks her parents once feared she might never do including including drawing, jumping on a trampoline, singing the alphabet and doing cartwheels. The unstoppable pair hatched a plan to camp out together the night they met last year in London at the Daily Mirror Pride of Britain Awards, in partnership with TSB. “Harmonie-Rose was just mesmerised by Max,” says Freya, . “He had so much time to talk to her and we all thought he was so inspiring. We don’t know which of them came up with it first, but the idea of Harmonie going along to camp with Max came up that very first night they met, and when we all got together the next morning it came up again and we knew straight away it was going to happen.”  With both youngsters raising money for their respective charities through Max’s Big Camp Out on March  - Harmonie-Rose for Meningitis Now and Max for North Devon Hospice - they hope they can inspire other children to take control of their own fundraising efforts. “Throughout the whole process, Max has made his own plans on everything he’s done,” says Rachael, , also mum to Isobel, , and Abby, . “He asked to camp out and he chose what he’s fundraised for. On March  we’re going to have our own event in Devon, but we’d love other children to join in wherever they are. “Through Max’s Big Camp Out, we’d love to get kids across the country having a go at raising money for causes close to their hearts, and whether they’re camping in a den in their bedrooms or sleeping in a tent in the garden with their parents, there are lots of ways to do it. “Max has grown so much through all of this. He’s gained confidence and resilience, and of course he’s achieved a huge amount for charity. We couldn’t be prouder of him.”And after a setback with his tent last week - Max’s shelter collapsed in the wind last Friday - he’s already back in business. “Luckily we had a spare tent, so he was able to swap straight over,” says Rachael. “But the messages of support and offers of a new tent have been amazing. We’ve had outdoors companies get in contact, iniduals and small family businesses. Bear Grylls even got in touch on Instagram - it took us a nanosecond to reply.”Along with the youngsters and Pride of Britain host Carol, family members and friends will camp out in Devon to mark Max’s two years under the stars next month. “I’m one of nine, and most of my siblings and their children will be there too,” says Freya, also mum to Luna, who turns four in March. “As well as doing something amazing with Harmonie, and to support her charity we want to celebrate Max’s achievement because what he’s done has been incredible. Two years is a long time to do what he’s done and we’re really proud of him.” Rachael, who along with Max’s sisters and dad Mark will sleep outside next month, adds: “The Pride of Britain was a great way to meet some amazing people. We’re thrilled to have kept in touch with Harmonie-Rose and the family. We met up last weekend to make plans for Max’s Big Camp Out, and had a great time together. She’s a wonderful little girl.

But he now says with the worst of the crisis seemingly over, itaposs likely theyaposll be out and about more in the community, where theyaposve made a number of celebrity friends. He told the Evening Standard : Harry’s been out on his bicycle and walking his adopted Labrador on Miramar Beach and she’s been out shopping in both the upper village and lower village and they seem to be very, very happy as far as I can see.”They’ve made a lot of friends here, particularly Orlando and Katy who live nearby on Park Lane.

There has been speculation Harry and Meghan couldto the UK for the Queenaposs Platinum Jubilee celebrations in June.Since leaving for America, Harry has ed to the UK twice - for Prince Philipaposs funeral and to unveil a statue of his late mother Princess Diana.Meghan has yet towith son Archie, while daughter Lilibet, was born in America and has never been to England. Last month, royal sources revealed Charles has offered an olive branch to Harry by inviting his family to stay with him when they next visit the UK. However, it then emerged that Harry claims he is “unable tohome” after a decision following his exit from the royal family stripped him of his right to personal security provided by the Met Police. Harry, , has since decided to sue the British government by applying for a judicial review against the decision, which could see him face the Home Office at the court.

He has since been fighting to remain on the teaching register, arguing he is still fit to be in the classroom.  Today it was revealed that the mother of the pupil has ridden to his rescue, arguing that he should be able to keep teaching and that he was in a stable relationship with her child. In a testimonial to The General Teaching Council for Scotlandaposs  she wrote: He has shown credibility in his role and professionalism at all times. His encouragement allowed pupils to believe in themselves. She added: She has no concerns about Mr Spittalaposs teacher pupil relationship with Person A and sees them in a stable relationship and has been integrated into their family le. Despite the mumaposs intervention, and following a four day hearing, the teaching regulator decided Spittal will be struck off from the register. Panel chair Alison Reid said: In relation to stage  fitness to teach the aposs findings are that the teacher has fallen signicantly short of the standards that are expected of a registered teacher and is therefore unfit to teach. Section .b of the public services reform order means that the  has to direct that the teacher be removed from the register. The  heard how Spittal first kissed the teen when she stayed behind to help him tidy up iPads in his classroom in April . Emails showed that Spittal sent an email to Pupil A at .pm on an evening in May  askingshe was having chill, fun times. He then asked her to: Talk me through ityou are.  He was outed to the school by his then-girlfriend, Kim Smyth, who found emails, including nude images, between the pair on their shared computer. On Monday, Spittal confirmed he was still in a relationship with the former pupil but admitted that his behaviour back in  was totally inappropriate. He said he was ashamed of his actions but believes he still has a lot to offer to teaching. Spittal, now a delivery courier, said: I think about it everyday while Iaposm sitting in my van about where I could beI hadnapost made stupid mistakes. I made decisions and choices I made in a five to six week period I am ashamed and embarrassed of. I use a traffic light system. Stop, thought and action. I stop and process what is going on around me, I then think and assess my options before proceeding with my choice. My professionalism was called into place, it wonapost happen again, I admit all of the allegations.  Prior to the decision, Presenting Officer Sarah Donnachie argued: Mr Spitall did not act honestly at Inveralmond, he knew what he was doing was wrong and he tried to cover up his actions. Mr Spittal has shown no efficient insight into his actions. He has not fully engaged with his feelings and not been honest with himself in the events that led to the kiss. She continued: Mr. Spittal knew what he was doing was wrong. He only disclosed this to Inveralmond when his ex-partner discovered the relationship. He had been reminded of professional respect on two occasions prior to the kiss. Legal Council for Spitall, Claire Rafferty, said her client had taken steps to ensure this doesnapost happen again. She said: He has been under total remediation for two and half years, showing a passion and commitment to teaching. Iaposm not sure what  a person could do to remediate. I am confident he would make the right decision when faced with dficult circumstances. He has put measures in place to ensuresimilar circumstances would arise he would not repeat his actions. His personality traits make it unlikely there will be a repetition of conduct. Elizabeth Gibb, a chartered occupational psychologist who has been working with Spittal since June , gave evidence in the teacheraposs favour at the hearing. She said: I think he took responsibility for his actions before I met him. He scored lower than most adults on assertiveness. He is fundamentally agreeable and is fundamentally trustworthy and unlikely to use charm. He has now given great consideration to how he acted and he seeked help. He is highly unlikely to bend the rules in the future. Today the  concluded their investigation by issuing Spittal with a removal order.

Mrs Justice Arbuthnot is due to study Williamaposs case at a trial in the Court of Protection, where issues relating to people who lack the mental capacity to make decisions are considered. The trial is scheduled to take place in Liverpool later this month. The judge considered preliminary hearings at an online hearing on Tuesday.  Lawyers told her that bosses at Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, who have responsibilities for Williamaposs care, wanted decisions to be made as to whether he should have a kidney transplant and whether le-extending haemodialysis should be continued. The Judge is also expected to consider whether active treatment should be withdrawn. Justice Arbuthnot heard that the withdrawal of treatment would lead to Williamaposs death. Williamaposs mother does not want treatment to end and claims that he doesnapost either. A barrister representing Ms McLennan, Victoria Butler-Cole QC, told Mrs Justice Arbuthnot the teenager had very bad kidney disease and had few treatment options left.He was in a pretty dire situation, she added. With the legal case ongoing the family is now also appealing for potential le-saving donors to come forward and help William, said a spokesman for law firm Irwin Mitchell, which represents Ms McLennan, on Wednesday. If a living donor can be found, William would have the best chance of a kidney transplant being successful. Ms McLennan said tests had shown that relatives were not suitable donors. If any of us could give William one of our kidneys we wouldnapost hesitate for a second to do so, she said.  Itaposs a race against time but finding someone kind enough to donate a kidney would mean the world to us. We know itaposs an incredibly selfless act for someone to agree to and there would be assessments to ensure suitability. Justice Arbuthnot has ruled that William, who lives in Lancaster, could be named in media reports of the case after being told that his mother, Ami McLennan, wanted to make a public appeal for a kidney donor. Williamaposs mother wanted reporters to be allowed to name him in reports of the litigation - a campaign that was supported by a number of journalists. They said Williamaposs plight had been reported before Court of Protection proceedings began - and argued that it would be dficult to report hearings without creating an information jigsaw which would give away his identity. Judges typically rule that patients at the centre of Court of Protection proceedings should not be named in media reports, in line with their human right to respect for privacy and family le. A spokesperson for Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, which manages the Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital, said: “We recognise that this is a very dficult time for William and his family and we will continue to support them. Our clinicians have worked very hard to enable William’s treatment to take place so far, and he continues to have his haemodialysis, as agreed with his family, subject to any change in his clinical condition. The decision on whether a transplant would be in his best interest is a very complex one, requiring consideration of a range of very dficult issues including signicant risks and the possibility that his transplant would fail, which is why the Court of Protection is being asked to make a decision on the best care for William going forward.”Late last year The Mirror reported on William, an avid golf fan, receiving a lesson from professional golfer Trevor Newsham at Heysham Golf Club in Morecambe.Trevor, , was impressed with his swing saying: “He seemed really bright, taking it on board and hit great shots.

Residents on the road in Telford, Shropshire, want the prince’s name removed from their street signs, as he faces a civil case in the US accused of sexually assaulting Virginia Gufre when she was just .

Flight FR had been meant to take off at .pm local time but the plane was delayed by  minutes after a passenger became disruptive on board.Other passengers on the Ryanair flight said man’s behaviour became “hysterical” after airline crew tried to take away bottles of booze he was clutching.One said that people were “afraid” of the man’s worrying behaviour, including removing his trousers because he said he was too hot. A passenger, whose we was sitting near the man, said she had recounted to him how he took his trousers off shortly after sitting down and proceeded to become more disorderly, the Irish Mirror reports.Nobody noticed anything when he got on, he didnapost seem too bad but when he sat down he got up and took off his trousers, he said.[My we] said that he said to the woman beside him that he gets very hot on the plane, and then she said to me, aposI kind of copped then he was under the weather.He had bottles on his lap, maybe four or five litres of spirits, and the stewardess asked to take them off him because she wanted to stow them up safely. But he wouldnapost let them go, he said they were presents and they werenapost taking them and he got a bit hysterical then. Then they called the other cabin steward and he came down and they were just trying to pacy him and he got a bit abusive then and told them he couldnapost take his stuff and he had rights. The doors to the aircraft had already been closed at this stage, with cross-check completed and the plane ready to pull away from the stand. While the man had put on his trousers again at this point, someone then made the decision to have him removed from the plane as he refused to cooperate with anything, the passenger added. As [my we] was saying from chatting with people afterwards, thank God they got him off becausehe was like that now, what would he have been like in an houraposs time into the flight, he said. [The cabin crew] handled it extremely well, there was no big bust-up, there was no violence. It was three policemen who came on first, then there was another three, so I donapost know whether they thought he was going to get rough or not. As he was being escorted from the plane, the man then made a big deal about a suitcase which led to more delays. However, it emerged that he had not in fact placed any luggage in the hold. While people were mostly peed off by the incident, they were also worried about whether the situation could escalate, he explained. People were afraid, they were more afraid of what could have happenedthe stewardess had not intervened because he was getting lairy, he said. He wasnapost threatening anyone...but you never know,it was an hour into the flight it would have been twice as bad. After the man was removed from the aircraft, the flight departed Alicante and subsequently landed in Dublin Airport at .pm local time, just  minutes later than scheduled.

The Prime Minister said on Tuesday that he wants to drop the legal requirement to isolate by the end of February provided the current encouraging trends in the data continue. Experts have voiced concerns that the removal of the remaining restrictions, which also include the ability for councils to close sites where the virus could be spreading, has caused unease for some of those most at risk.It comes as Mr Johnson continues to fight on despite calls from members of his own party for him to resign over alleged Covid lockdown parties. The Partygate scandal has ripped huge holes in Downing Streetaposs ability to claim it stuck to its own rules during the lockdowns, which saw millions come together to save lives and protect the NHS. Phillip Anderson, head of policy at the MS Society, said ending the restrictions will heap yet more worry and confusion on thousands of immunocompromised people. He added: In the face of callous silence from a government that should be focused on protecting them, they could feel forced to further isolate themselves from others, putting their wider health, wellbeing and livelihoods in danger. James Taylor from disability equality charity Scope, said: Scrapping self-isolation will mean that some disabled people will be feeling very anxious and could potentially be placed in situations that could prove deadly. Nobody should be forced to gamble with their lives, and we need the government to explain to disabled people how theyaposll be safe when this decision is introduced. Virologist Dr Stephen Grfin, of the University of Leeds, said the plan is crazy which goes against all the fundamental principles of public health. He told Sky News: It seems that the government has completely abandoned any concern about people becoming infected. Downing Streetaposs plan is expected to set out further information for vulnerable groups but officials also believe cutting edge treatments will also mitigate some of the risks.  Paul Hunter, professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, said while there were grounds for optimism in the overall data on deaths and hospital admissions, he had concerns about the vulnerable and people who may not have responded as well to the vaccines. There needs to be robust procedures in place to ensure infections in this group are diagnosed early and antivirals are provided within hours of any positive result, he said. Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading said nobody can be certain of the full consequences. If the requirement on infected iniduals to isolate at home is lted as indicated, it will be an experiment which will either be shown to be very brave or very stupid, but nobody knows for sure what the result will be, he said.  Professor Peter Openshaw, who advises the government on Covid through the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group , said he would be very reluctant to suggest this was the end of Covid, adding it was still a very nasty virus.He told BBC Radio aposs The World At One: We donapost know whataposs around the corner, there could be another iant, perhaps based on Delta or something  with higher pathogenicity, which could come back to bite us anytime, and Iaposm pretty sure that next winter weaposre going to see it back.The Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said: We would never recommend anyone goes to work when they have an infectious disease.  Covid infection levels have risen in three of the four UK nations with only Wales showing a fall, according to figures published on Wednesday.Scotland and Northern Ireland both saw an increase last week in the number of people in private households likely to have coronavirus, according to the Office for National Statistics .England also saw a rise, though the trend here is uncertain, the ONS said. The data show there is still a high prevalence of the virus across the country, with infections remaining well above pre-Christmas levels.

Rhys Langford, , had osteosarcoma, a cancer which starts in the bones. Over time, the cancer spread to several other areas of his body. When Rhys read the story of Jacob Jones, a boy from the same town who was fighting a rare cancer called neuroblastoma, he immediately donated £, - his le savings - to the six-year-old and his family. The labourer, who worked for a water supplier, also set up an online crowd funder which has since gone viral and raised more than £, for Jacob and his family. Rhys, whose cancer left him bedridden, passed away this morning. Jacobaposs nan Dawn Jones, , paid tribute, saying the family was “deeply upset”. The love, compassion, strength and courage Rhys showed was unbelievable and he will never be forgotten,” she said.Because of his kindness, Jacob will have a better chance of battling with whatever he is faced with now or in the future. We will never be able to show how much Rhys and his family mean to us. We’re overwhelmed by the fundraising by Rhys and we are heartbroken. Our thoughts are with his family. Rhys was a talented athlete before his illness, and at  had become one of the youngest people in the UK to achieve a black belt in the martial art, Krav Maga, at adult grading. He also scaled Snowdon three times and had dreamed of one day going up Ben Nevis. The first sign of a health problem came when Rhys had a sprint race with friends, lost his balance and fell.  Catherine and his dad Paul Langford, , thought he had a groin strain, but Rhys was still limping eight weeks later. He carried on working but reached a point where he was struggling to get out of the lorry. In October , after ious tests, Rhys was tragically diagnosed with osteosarcoma. Experts at Birminghamaposs Royal Orthopaedic Hospital found an cm tumour in his right hip. Rhys had a series of blood transfusions and went through intensive chemotherapy, quickly dropping from st to st lbs. After the  weeks of chemo Rhys stayed in the Royal Orthopaedic for three weeks for an operation to remove all the bone from his kneecap to his right hip.This would mean Rhys would always need two sticks to walk, but the family hoped it would save his le. Up until August , Rhys then underwent another  weeks of chemo, which they initially thought had cured his cancer and he started to get his le back. But in October, a year after his diagnosis, Rhysapos right leg started to swell, growing three times its normal size.  Rhys spent almost a month in ious hospitals being treated for sepsis in the run-up to Christmas until tragically experts found a cancerous mass in his thigh.Although consultants in Birmingham discussed the possibility of a full amputation of the leg, they told the family on January  that Rhys could not be saved.You can donate to Rhysaposs fundraiser for Jacobaposs by visiting the fundraising page,here .Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON HospitalsCancer\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Instead, the awarding of marks was left down to their teachers. And, surprise surprise, children in fee-paying schools scored highest.Research by The Sunday Times showed % of pupils received A*s in , but this soared to almost % in  when teachers gave the grades. In one school alone, North London Collegiate, which charges over £, a year, .% of pupils were awarded A*s, a staggering increase from just .% in . Of course parents who pay for their children’s education want bang for their buck and boy did they get it.  But it’s not just about questionable grade inflation. When the country went into ­lockdown, forcing schools to close, private school pupils switched ­seamlessly to online classes. Children continued to have access to high-quality education and virtual “face to face” lessons with teachers. It should have been the same for all children, but it wasn’t. For many state school kids there often were no lessons with teachers for months. Lesson plans were put online for pupils to ­effectively teach themselves. While in the private sector kids could log in from any number of devices, other ­children, especially those in more deprived parts of the country, were scrabbling for laptops and tablets, ­struggling with wi issues and parents who didn’t have enough data.My fear is this will exacerbate inequality. Education is meant to be the great leveller, but the playing field has never been so unequal.Students with these mega-high grades will get their pick of universities and jobs. There have already been calls for an inquiry. That’s all well and good but what will it solve  Some people have suggested private schools should lose their tax-free status and that money be given to the state school sector. There has to be a way of ensuring the Covid Class of  isn’t penalised any more. I’d like to see a section added to uni and job applications that reveals the level of support, or lack of it, they had in the pandemic, for more context. Because for pupils in state schools, passing under those circumstances should be applauded – and worth far more. It’s time to stop the gap widening any further.

I will absolutely never eat meat again. Every time Iaposve been in my kitchen since it happened, I gag. Mercedes has issued a formal complaint to Lidl who have contacted the supplier of the chicken and have told her to expect a response in the next  days.

They met last year after he first appeared at her home and are now set to wed, despite their struggles to find a suitable property to marry in. “Edwardo and I are currently arguing over the wedding date,” Brocarde said. “I want a summer wedding but he hates the heat and I’d secretly love to make him melt, but he disappears often enough as it is. “For weeks, we got nowhere with it, so I’m going to design an Oujia board of wedding dates, to see which we are both drawn to. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here “I swear he’s turned into a complete groomzilla and his list of demands grows daily. “Edwardoaposs always had a temperamental nature but the nuptials seem to be bringing out the worst in him. The pair communicate through unique methods, with the ghost sending cryptic messages in the shower. She said: “Edwardo still leaves subliminal messages in the shower and shows his emotions by sending hot and cold sensations through my body. “Whatever it is I need to ask him, he finds a way of communicating back. It doesn’t just lay in the perimeters of what some people class as ‘normal’ – but who wants normal ” But it can be dficult for a human to marry a ghost, with the couple shunned from churches believing their romance is blasphemous. Brocarde said: Finding the venue is proving really tricky. We’ve been kicked out of a few churches and have been threatened with exorcism already, I want a huge white wedding but a lot of people just can’t see the vision. “Edwardo has made a few appearances but there’s an overwhelming sense that he doesn’t feel comfortable in churches, it’s far too risky for him.”  She claims to have had “fascinating” discussions about religion and the paranormal with priests but believes the church can’t publicly endorse such beliefs. She added: “I refuse to consider any of the typical rules and boundaries, as this isn’t a typical romance. “I’ve applied a ‘DIY’ mentality to everything – I’ve even designed my own wedding dress, which pays homage to the Victorian era. “Edwardo has insisted that I make him a Victorian three-piece suit and I’ve played around with a few ideas but ultimately, I just can’t see it. “I’d prefer him to surprise me and pull a mourning suit from his old wardrobe.” The guest list is also dficult to nail down, what with many of Edwardoaposs friends no longer alive and his best man stuck in hell . The couple is also inviting some celebrities including the ghosts of Marilyn Monroe, Elvis and The Bard. She said: “My dream is to have an eclectic combination of souls at the wedding. “I have a blatant disregard to whether they are classied as alive or dead – at this point, it barely seems relevant. “We’re going to invite our favourite historical characters, such as Elvis and Marilyn Monroe. “William Shakespeare would be warmly welcomed, particularlyhe’s reading a sonnet, so long as he doesnapost re-enact Hamlet. On my special day, I donapost have four hours to spare for someone aposs drama. “Edwardo desperately wants one of his fellow soldiers to be his best man, but apparently he went to hell in  for running an opium den. “He hasn’t been reachable since.  “There are so many obstacles to cartwheel over when marrying a dead man.” Brocarde’s A-list guest list also includes King Henry the Eighth and Johnny Cash. Edwardo proposed to the singer in November , when she claims to have found a diamond ring on her pillow after the pair had a fight. She took the mysterious piece of jewellery as a romantic proposal and said aposyesapos to her spirit lover. She said: “One morning I awoke to find a ring on my pillow. It was digging into the side of my cheek – it felt like I’d been stung by a bee or something – but when I touched my face, I felt the stone and ring band. “I thought I was dreaming and I think I fell back asleep. When I awoke, the ring was gone. “I went for a shower and noticed a question mark appear in the steam. I was convinced I was still half-asleep, so grabbed a few espressos and carried on my day. “The next night the same thing happened, but this time I awoke to find the ring still there. Again, question marks appeared in the steam on the shower. “It was then that the penny dropped – Edwardo was proposing.”Despite the ghost being furious with her appearance on ITV ’s This Morning last year, she still wants him to feel like a king on their big day.After penning a love song to her beau on Halloween last year, which won back his affections, she has plans to kick it up a notch for their big day. She said: “I’ve really tried to pull out all the stops and I’ve written him a magical wedding song, which I plan to walk up the aisle to. “It’s always been my dream to write my own wedding anthem and the paranormal, haunting element of Edwardo’s presence has provided me with so much inspiration. “He’s really pushing me to the edge of creativity and challenges me to open my mind to a whole new world. For Valentine’s Day, the pair have some steamy plans ahead but Brocarde admits she will be the one left out of pocket. She added: “The thing that really annoys me, is that I will be left footing the bill but he is a cheap date, as he doesn’t eat or drink in public. “I’ve asked Edwardo to whisk me away for a steamy night of passion but he’s promised he’ll always be by my side wherever I travel. “I want to see what he has in store for me andI can really feel his presence.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Henry the eighthJohn DalliMarilyn MonroeWilliam ShakespeareThis MorningLoveMarriageSoldiersWeddingsWedding dayWedding dressJewellery\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Villages is a sprawling development for over-s in Central Florida, where residents sip cocktails with neighbours, live in homes with manicured lawns and travel to the market square on their golf carts. Happy music can be heard over the loudspeakers to promote positivity and to keep up this energy, ambulances reportedly turn off their sirens and funeral cars are said to be unmarked. It has its own newspaper and radio station, which is run by the communityaposs management, and only covers positive items. The manicured lawns have signs on them to warn residents to keep children and pets away as they are pumped with chemicals - to keep up its pristine appearance.  The Villages boasts  golf courses,  pools and , social clubs. But Americaaposs largest retirement community has caused controversy among residents who live in the same area outside the neighbourhood. It is understood , people - who are known as Villagers - live across the  villages, which is just an hour north of Orlando. The Schwartz family who developed the area are now billionaires.Valerie Blankenbyl, who spent time living in the community while shooting her documentary aposThe Bubbleapos told news.au : The Villages is a place that is so honed towards perfection that it cannot uphold that perfection, it’s just not possible. The Bubble was shown this week at Sydney Antenna film festival as Valerie likened the community to The Truman Show. The Truman Show stars actor Jim Carrey and is about a man who is trapped in a perfect town that turns out to be fake and made up of actors. Valerie also said most villagers will not hear anything negative against their community, which is promoted as an “active retirement community”. Daily programmes are packed with lunchtime karaoke, cardio drumming, belly dancing and cheerleading lessons, even synchronised golf cart displays. Valerie also says their days are filled with lots of day drinking.  In the documentary, one resident says to his we happy whatever day this is as he drinks a cocktail on his veranda. The filmmaker also said the residents she met were friendly. One is quoted in the film as saying: We know we’re in a bubble. But it’s a nice bubble”. However, outside the development, critics say there is something sinister about its idyllic appearance. As soon as you leave the development you can see local opposition, it is hard to escape.  Valerie said: It wasn’t something that you could escape because as soon as you drove outside the gates you see all these signs that say ‘Stop the Villages’. People who live nearby have raised concerns about their reported lack of accountability and apparent encroachment into established communities. Valerie said: You kept hearing inside The Villages that there was nothing before where The Villages now are. “But there wasn’t nothing. There was a community there and it was where people used to gather and now it’s just all gone.”  Campaigners against the community say the Villages use the mass amount of water to keep the grass lawns green and the pools filled, and claim the development has lowered the water table and led to shortages and sinkholes. One of the biggest thorns of all for the outsiders, is how the management company tries to separate it from its neighbours. Owners installed boom gates on roads going into the development, giving it the appearance of being gated. However, it is on public land and locals were fooled for years thinking they were barred from entering. Valerie also said the management tried to make her film crew leave and tried to stop residents from speaking to them. She added that many Villagers didnapost know about the controversy or werenapost bothered about le outside the bubble - and instead they were focusing on staying positive and cheery. Valerie says an academic who studies ageing told her it was one of the most troubling aspects of le in The Villages. She said: She thought The Villages was the most ageist place there is in the world. “Because even in a place that’s full of older people, you aren’t allowed to be old or age. “You still have to be fit and young and beautul and healthy. “And sickness, death and dying is not part of that. “It’s sort of like an extreme form of ageism that has manested in a retirement community.” The management company has been approached for comment.

She had no idea what they were talking about, then soon they were pulling down a lionaposs head, a conger ell, a zebra and other stuffed animals. She had no idea her partner, Kevin, had spent years hoarding dozens of cased animals in their attic, which is now being described as one of the most unusual private collections by auctioneers. What do you think about Kevinaposs incredible collection  Let us know in the comments...Julie, , from Blakedown, near Kidderminster, Worcs., said: I was never allowed into the loft but, after I lost Kevin, I needed some work done in the attic. The workman said to me, aposDid you know there are a lot of boxes up there apos I found  pieces of taxidermy I had no idea about. Iaposm amazed Kevin managed to squirrel them away without me knowing.  Julie has since learned that their son James had helped his dad to move the items into the loft so she wouldnapost find them. She was aware of Kevinaposs interest in taxidermy but had no idea how vast his collection was and went on to find an extra  pieces tucked away in their garage. Julie added: The garage was Kevinaposs domain and I didnapost go in there much.  I knew he had some more taxidermy in there but I never realised the extent of it. They were stacked one behind another on deep shelves. I think he felt a bit guilty about buying so many pieces so he didnapost tell me. The collection included a circa s lionaposs head with real teeth, conger eel, otter, white rabbit, badger, fox, plains zebra and hartebeest, a type of African antelope.Among the peculiar finds was a large glass display case featuring a puppy dog, a pair of red squirrels and a green woodpecker dating back to the s. There was also a multitude of fish and birds including an albino blackbird, moorhens, herons, lapwing, curlew, Long-Eared owls, pike and perch. Julie continued: I know some people think taxidermy is a bit strange but Kevin was fascinated by it.

When our daughter, Esther, was small and had sleepovers, some of her friends were terried when they walked into the hall. Esther did a school project on taxidermy when she was . The teacher must have thought we were a bid odd. I used to feel a little bit embarrassed when people went into the hall but most people were fascinated by the collection, even the medics who came to look after Kevin when he was ill. It makes me smile now to think of Kevin smuggling those pieces into the loft. I found out his son, James, helped him lt them in.  The time feels right to part with them now but I am not letting everything go. The items will by sold by Hansons Auctioneers at Bishton Hall, Staffs., where they are expected to fetch in excess of £, on February . Charles Hanson, owner of Hansons, said: Kevinaposs collection is quite extraordinary with examples dating back to the s. Some people may find it a little bizarre but you have to put taxidermy into its historical context. In Edwardian and Victorian times people had a deep fascination with natural history, just as we do today. Kevin passed away at the age of  in August last year. His le was taken by sarcoma, a type of cancer that starts in tissues like bone or muscle. A donation from the proceeds of the sale of his collection will go to Sarcoma UK.Do you have a story to share  Weaposd love to hear all about it.

and had a good chance to score when Robertson freed John McCallum to play in Andrew Renton.Renton advanced on the left side of the box, but the youngster#s touch when bearing down on goal was just on the heavy side, and allowed the keeper to lunge at his feet and collect the ball at the last moment.Kilsyth made it - with  minutes remaining to end the match as a contest, giving the score line a harsh look from a Pupils# perspective, having competed well with their lofty opponents for an hour of the contest.And while such defeats are always tough for a team#s players and management, they still offer valuable on-field experience for the young Pupils players in the squad, as they adjust to a higher, more physically demanding level of football in the West of Scotland FL.The Pupils have nine fixtures left to play this season – five at home and four away – and are on the road again tomorrowagainst second-placed Finnart FC, at Springburn Park.

It was the Pupils who would concede it.In another move tinged with disappointment # the match referee failing to spot another offside in the build-up # a ball from the right flank was swung in to a player in an offside position, who held the ball up and worked it back to a central area where Finnart’s captain unleashed a strong strike high into the Pupils’ net.And while the Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils continued to work hard to claw their way back into the match they were undone with only a few minutes remaining by a smart counter-attack at the other end, which allowed Finnart’s number  to score from close range with a low, side-footed effort.On reflection, the Pupils were undone by moments of business-like quality – certainly for goals two and four from their hosts # and perhaps their own naivety against a canny and disciplined side who are challenging to win the WoSFL’s Division Four.Nevertheless, the Pupils can reflect on a decent, determined performance for much of this match.

two goals in two games against the Pupils.Then, a header from a swirling cross from Finnart#s left-hand side couldn#t be kept out, despite the efforts of Alasdair Ferguson in goal.The Pupils# Rhys Casci did go close with a one-on-one effort in the first half after being freed by a low pass from midfield, but the Tarbert-based player opted to shoot early and the keeper got his body in front of the effort and gathered at the second attempt.After the interval, the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils hoped to use the westerly tailwind to put pressure on the visitors# goal, but it was a quieter half than the hosts would have liked.Finnart battled to repel the Pupils, limiting them to two dangerous efforts from outside the box, first from Casci who forced a save from the away keeper to tip his low shot round the post for a corner, and then from Scott Souden whose deflected effort forced the keeper into a save.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils made some changes late on with youngster Andrew Renton and right-back Michael McKinlay making afrom injury, but it wasn’t enough to turn the tide of the game and the visitors took all three points, to leave themselves two points behind leaders

will be built west of Law Primary School and will replace the town’s current nursery on Law Road.However, Law Primary School’s parent council has raised concerns about the “lack of thinking around how families will travel to the nursery in a more sustainable and healthy way”.Construction is due to start next month, with the facility due to be completed by next year.The new building will feature a play area and garden to the north of the nursery, prompting criticism by parents of the building’s energy sustainability.Kate Allen, chairperson of Law Primary School Parent Council, said: “Our main frustrations have been the lack of thinking around how families will travel to the nursery in a more sustainable and healthy way, and how the nursery should be built to be as climate friendly as possible.”The parent council originally objected to the plans for the facility in May , citing two key points around creating better paths for travel and a reorientation of the building to utilise more natural light.New plans from East Lothian Councilwere released in December, with parents claiming that “very few changes to the original plans from May” had been made.The site of the new planned new early years centre at Law Primary School, North BerwickKate added: “We wrote to ELC in December asking for them to explain why this was and they never replied.“Then the plans were passed in January  without any further discussions.”Although a travel plan was not submitted in the nursery build’s original application, the council did meet with the parent council in May last year to discuss its concerns, and then submitted a comprehensive travel plan, which included many of the parents’ suggestions for future paths.The council has not, however, responded to parent council questions regarding the reorientation of the building.Kate said: “The latest report is completely unsatisfactory in terms of an explanation.“There may be a good reason but we are yet to hear one.“It was our belief that the buildings department would have to work with East Lothian Council’s Climate Change Strategy to ensure new building work should be as climate friendly as possible.“This is the question we believe needs asking of the council – are they using their Climate Change Strategy when they brief architects  If not, why not ”She added: “The delay to the build is so frustrating for staff and parents and we have only objected because we feel that these issues are so important – we want to get it right for future generations.”An East Lothian Council spokesperson said: “The project team has engaged with and responded comprehensively to the queries raised throughout this project both in discussions with Parent Council and Planning Department. This includes extensive information provided on the building’s energy and sustainability, which led to planning permission being granted.\"We have committed to providing a low carbon and sustainable nursery building in a - learning campus that supports the local community and provides a healthy and resilient natural environment for the future. This is in line with our Climate Change Strategy.“The development will offer learners, staff and the community all the benefits of moving from an older, much less energy-efficient building to a new, more sustainable, high-quality, purpose-built facility with multiple access routes to encourage sustainable travel.“The nursery building’s orientation within that campus of north  south is also very important. The main building access is orientated to the south from Old Haddington Road to allow ease of access for those with additional support needs, as well as addressing the close relationship to the main primary school building, of which the nursery is a part.“Energy efficiency has been considered carefully throughout the building’s design and specication and we aim to combine this with sustainable building practices and reduce emissions where possible throughout the construction.”The new nursery, which will have capacity for  children over two sessions, has an open-plan design, with a mezz- anine area and separate quiet room.The contract value of the nursery is £. million, with a further £, due to be spent on internal fittings.North of the site, a three-classroom extension for secondary-school pupils is being built on the south-west side of North Berwick High School.This £. million project, due to be completed next autumn, will house new home economics, modern languages and social studies classrooms for the high school."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-covid-update-today-time-watch","story":"Final restrictions put in place in response to the Omicron iant sweeping across Scotland have been removed since Monday, January .In last week’s update the First Minister has confirmed that following the cabinets three-week review, the current Covid measures will not change.Changes were however announced for international travel.

Lots of people empty the teapot contents once they are cool onto their houseplants.\"So, which leftover liquids will really make a dference  Here, experts unravel the fact from the fiction...Coffee\"We did some research and found tea and coffee are quite good for plants. They contain a modicum of nitrogen - butyou put milk in your drink it can get a bit smelly and rotten in the soil, although its alright for outside,\" says Barter.If you take sugar in your coffee, that may reduce the beneficial effects to your plants because it can lock up nitrogen, he warns. In that case, add ordinary fertiliserplants go a bit yellow. Try to avoid using coffee which has had milk or cream addedyoure going to deposit your dregs on houseplants.Putting coffee grounds into your compost heap is an organic way to give plants a huge boost, according to experts at WeThrt, who add that coffee grounds can also be used for most houseplants.But they warn against over-feeding plants with coffee, only giving them a boost about once a week. Acid-loving plants such as azaleas, hydrangeas and bromeliads prefer coffee to other plants like roses, which can end up with a burnt stemthey are overfed.Tea\"Tea is slightly acid, althoughyou have really alkaline water, that might reduce the acidity. People have historically used it on their indoor azaleas and gardenias and its thought to be good for houseplants,\" says Barter, although again try to avoid using milky tea.However, a Which  study in  found its unlikely that much of the nitrogen in tea is actually available to plants and that tea also contains aluminium, fluorine and manganese, which are harmless to people but high concentrations in very strong or stewed tea could stunt plant growth. It concluded that tea leaves are best put on the compost heap, rather than around your plants.BeerWhile most people tend to use beer to attract slugs into beer traps in the garden, some have taken to pouring it on their plants. The idea is that the acid in beer will kill pests, and the sugar and yeast will add beneficial soil microbes, assisting growth.However, there doesnt seem to be much substance to claims that it boosts the le of houseplants. \"I dont think it contains much nitrogen or plant food, so I wouldnt have thought its a good substitute for regular houseplant fertiliser,\" says Barter.Carbonated drinksFizzy drinks tend to contain sugar, which prevents plants from absorbing nutrients, so dont go pouring lemonade or cola on your houseplants.\"In the old days when lemonade was very sugary, it was excellent for putting cut flowers in because its acid, which stops the bacteria, and had sugar in it which would feed the stems. Im not sure modern lemonade would do that,\" adds Barter.Research shows that carbonated mineral water may be better, as it commonly contains many of the macronutrients hat are essential for healthy plant growth.According to a  study conducted at Colorado University Boulder, carbonated water makes plants grow faster and makes green plants grow greener.Carbonated water which has gone flat can also be used on houseplants, but make sure you dont pour it on your plants straight from the fridge, as this may send them into shock.Washing up liquid\"Using old washing up water to water your plants outside the back door shouldnt do any harm. There will be a certain amount of phosphorus in it, but it might be too grubby for indoor plants,\" Barter advises.At the end of the day...\"I cant think of anything thats a really good substitute for proper fertiliser,\" says Barter."},{"url":null,"title":"mary-continis-recipe-sauteed-cannellini-beans-winter-greens","story":"sautéed with new season extra virgin olive oil, fat juicy cloves of garlic and plenty of spicy chilli,according to your taste.Piled on some toasted sour dough bread this transports beans on toast to another stratosphere.Ingredients: x g tins cannellini beans or g dried teaspoons bicarbonate of soda garlic cloves fresh bay leaves dried chillies or  thick fleshed fresh chilliesextra virgin olive oil bunches bitter greens, cavolo nero or curly kaleSea saltpepperFlat leaf parsleyMethod:If using dried cannellini beans:Cover beans with cold water and leave overnight.Pre-heat oven Gas Mark    CDrain and rinse beans.Cover with cold water and add the bicarbonate of soda.Boil fiercely for  minutes skimming off all the scum that rises to the top.Rinse in cold water.Return to the pot, cover again with about - cm cold water.Add a crushed clove of garlic, unpeeled,  fresh bay leaves and a splash of extra virgin olive oil.Do not salt the beans at this stage.Bring to the boil, cover with a tight lid, and bake in the oven until cooked making sure they do notdry out.

There is a huge dference between an expat who decides to live abroad and the citizens of a part of the country that decides it wants to leave a union. Pensions are paid to us through the taxes collected from current taxpayers. There is no pot that can be shared between Scotland and rUK. Independence means just that – standing on your own two feet and living within your means. Those who seek independence sound like the flatmate who has moved out as they didn’t like you but still wants to come round to use the washing machine. The concept that another country would be responsible for paying pensions out of its current tax receipts is just farcical.As for goodwill on both sides, I have yet to see the SNP ever extend goodwill to the UK Government. Ian Blackford is testament to that. The ex-flatmate that is all nice when he wants something is going to learn the hard way.The SNP and separatists are yet again trying to get the citizens of Scotland to jump off a clf into the unknown. No thank you, I say.Jane Lax, Aberlour.THE BURDEN OF PROOFTHE joint contribution of The Herald and the Fraser of Allander Institute is to be welcomed in the debate on the future of Scottish pensions Letters, February   . We now have neutral confirmation that the UK state retirement pension scheme is a pay-as-you-go arrangement, with no accumulated personal or national pot and that it is a benefit rather than than an entitlement. In turn, we can now agree how those Scottish pensions will not be paid for .However, there is uncertainty as to how they would be paid for, even at the current rates, let alone the more generous levels promised by the SNP. It is incumbent on nationalists to tell us the who and how of the future funding of Scottish pensions. Hopefully, we will learn more in the much-touted independence prospectus now being prepared at great cost by the policy masterminds of the Scottish Government. Ever the optimist, I look forward to being convinced.Incidentally, the issue of pensions is a perfect example of why the burden of proof should always be with those who advocate change, in this case who support secession from the UK. We can see the current state retirement pension, how it is funded, how sustainable that funding is, what it will buy, what its relationship to private pensions is and so on. In contrast, we have no certainty at all about the arrangements in a putative independent Scotland, just lofty assurances and best-case scenarios, and there will none until we know how they will work in realistic and concrete terms.Peter A Russell, Glasgow.A DEAL WILL BE DONEMARK Smithquite rightly pointed out the irony in Ian Blackford and Nicola Sturgeon possibly \"doing a Boris\" regarding the state pension being paid by the UK Government on gaining independence. But his article seemed to be a personal worry that he may lose out financially given a breakaway. He needs to take on board that a Yes vote is not a vote for Nicola Sturgeon, or even a vote for the SNP, but a choice for self-determination. I believe that a deal will be done to honour the pension.Brian Higgins, Clydebank.* CAN someone please explain why the UK Government would continue to pay Scottish pensions after independence  I accept that the UK pays for expat Brits who live abroad as they are still British, but I cant see whyScotland gets independence why they would pay for the pension of foreign nationals, as every person living in Scotland will become a foreign national on day one of independence.Robert McCaskie, Biggar.GIVE US SOME CLARITYI AGREE with Barbara Jarvis . Last year one of George Galloways Alliance for Unitys policies was for the UK Government to pass a Canada-style Clarity Act to set out the terms of any referendum and subsequent treaty on issues such as national debt, trade, borders, citizenship and options for No-voting regions to remain in the UK.This would be negotiated before a referendum so voters would know what they were voting for.It was studiously ignored by all the mainstream parties. The argument over pensions is surely an example of the need for it,only to put the nationalist pipe dream – and Scotland – out of their misery.Allan Sutherland, Stonehaven.HOME TRUTHS FOR STURGEONKEVIN McKenna’s articlewas pretty funny and despite being tongue in cheek offered some serious points. I fully agree with his suggestion that the FM should visit “one of Glasgow’s less salubrious arrondissements” for a photo shoot. May I suggest she visits Govanhill, possibly one of the least salubrious arrondissements in Western Europe  Oh, it’s in her own constituency, by the way.John Gilligan, Ayr.JOHNSON MUST APOLOGISETHE hounding of Labour’s leader by what can only be described as a baying mob on the streets of London was shameful .Cries about Jimmy Savile and Sir Keir Starmer’s part in the prosecution processcould be heard clearly on news clips. I am afraid Boris Johnson must accept his part in igniting this disgraceful behaviour and unconditionally apologise. When he taunted the Opposition leader in the way he did, it was tantamount to unleashing every crank and zealot in the UK.Does the PM not recall that very recently one of his own MPs was brutally stabbed to death by a zealot  And of course no-one has forgotten the Jo Cox atrocity. When someone in high office uses such language he or she risks giving carte blanche to the unstable and deluded.It is incumbent on all in public office to speak in measured language and remember what can resultthey do not. Mr Johnson may well be singing \"I will survive\" in the shower but it will not be for much longer unless he learns very quickly to hold his tongue.Alexander McKay, Edinburgh.THE CASE FOR A WINDFALL TAXOIL giant BP has reported its highest profit for eight years, amounting to £. billion for , the highest for eight years. This comes days after Shell reported profits of more than £ billion for last year, both companies cashing in on rocketing oil and gas markets.Gas prices have increased five-fold from prior to the pandemic and oil prices have almost doubled as economies open up. This is leading to big increases in gas and electricity bills for households, which will face a record energy bill increase of  per cent from April after the regulator lted the cap on default tarfs to £,. The choice for many, pushed into fuel poverty, will now be between heating and eating.Facing crippling increases in the cost of living, it is interesting to note what other countries are doing to tackle this energy crisis. France, for example, is capping bill increases at four per cent Norway is paying half of its citizen’s energy bills with profits from its lucrative oil fund, and Germany is looking to cap increases at five per cent.The pockets of the oil companies are deep, having profited from higher wholesale prices, and a one-off windfall tax here in the UK on fossil fuel giants helping hard-pressed households cope with record energy bills is urgently required.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.* WILLIE Macleanstates that when it comes to the treatment of North Sea oil, the crucial dference between Norway and Scotland is that the former is independent, whereas Scotland is not, being subject at the time to the UKs efforts to conceal the full potential economic benefits. The implication is, thatwe had been independent, then we could have followed Norways course.Forgive me for not sharing his rosy view, in light of the fact that with the benefit of  years hindsight, the SNP Government felt able to sell off seabed plots for offshore wind projects for what most experts deem to be a pittance.R Murray, Glasgow.Read more: Stop causing needless alarm to the elderly over pensions"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13456167.jpg?type=article-full","title":"first-look-inside-glasgows-burrell-collection-69m-revamp","story":"Along with his we, Constance, Lady Burrell, shipping magnate Sir William Burrell amassed one of the world’s greatest personal art collections.It was renowned for its quality of Chinese art, exquisite stained glass, intricate tapestries as well as its breadth of fine art.Read more: Glasgows Burrell Collection reveals public reopening dateAnd when Sir William decided he would donate his collection, Glasgow fought to give it a home in the city.Now, almost  years after the Burrell Collection opened its doors for the first time in the stunning grounds of Pollok Country Park, it is entering a new chapter in its history.

From the wartime parents who despaired of their s teenagers to Baby Boomers who wonder aloud about the behaviour of Millennials and Gen Z, dfering views and priorities will continue to ide the generations.  However, one thing that people of virtually every age can agree upon is that the direction of climate change is indisputable – andwe don’t accelerate our current attempts to tackle it then the consequences are going to be severe. Understanding the challenges is crucial.Those who will have to live longest with it are primarily Generations X, Y and Z – and their children, in what is now called Generation Alpha. These are people born between  and the mid-s. However, Baby Boomers also have a dog in this fight – for it is their grandchildren and great grandchildren who will live with the consequences of the actions we take in the next few years.And those actions must ramp-up drasticallywe are to have any chance of success. After the despair of the last few years of the pandemic it is now time for a ‘Great Acceleration’ of words and deeds.With that in mind, a number of Scottish organisations have come together to develop the Climate Solutions Acceleratorprogramme. The Royal Scottish Geographical Society, the Universities of Stirling and Edinburgh and online educational Jump Digital have created this new, world-leading project. Describing the thinking behind the concept, Mike Robinson, Chief Executive of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society, said: “The curriculum as currently framed is wholly inadequate in covering the climate crisis, so it is not surprising that we are hearing from students themselves, wanting to learn more about the climate emergency. “Now and in the future, today’s young people will be driving much of the change required, so its vital we give them a solid foundation on which to build, as much in preparation for the world of work as for the protection of our planet.  The more we all understand the solutions, the sooner we can all start ensuring they happen.”The result of this collective endeavour is believed to be a world first a customised award which was created by Jump Digital and jointly badged with SQA who will certy successful candidates.It can be delivered to people of all ages and abilities in both the education and private sector fields.Derek Houston, Regional Manager at the Scottish Qualications Authority: “SQA is delighted to be one of the partners involved in the development of this unit, which will equip candidates with an understanding of the science behind climate change and of solutions that exist to help tackle environmental deterioration.”Jump Digital’s initial Schools Pilot Programme was road-tested by all S and S pupils and  members of staff at Lochside Academy, Aberdeen.  The feedback from Lochside has now been fine-tuned into the schools’ version of the CSA, which gives school pupils the environmental knowledge and skills that can improve their employability in what is, and will likely remain, a challenging jobs market. Neil Hendry, the former Head Teacher at Lochside Academy was enthusiastic about the impact of the course.He said:“Following a two-day induction programme for the key teachers and School Senior Management Team, our senior students completed the course on theirto school. It was very well received by staff and students, and I was subsequently very impressed by the willingness of Jump Digital to listen to – and make good use of – the feedback we provided.”Alongside the development of the core course materials, Jump Digital recognised the importance of ensuring that teachers and career advisers also have the necessary knowledge to guide students through the course and help them understand its value in the job market.Consequently, a Teachers Pack was produced, and ‘Meet the Expert’ webinars developed, where pupils and teachers can ask questions of industry thought-leaders. The next phase will see the Schools CS Accelerator being rolled out to over , pupils in the north-east of Scotlandas part of  Scottish Government’s £.million of funding to the North East Economic Recovery and Skills Fund.  In response to the successful trials and roll-out, Robert Fleeting of Jump Digital said: “Tackling the climate emergency is likely to shape the future careers of so many of our young people, so improving their understanding of the issue at an early stage is essential.”  Allison Carrington, Regional Skills Planning Lead at Skills Development Scotlandfor the north-east and working with partners to deliver the NEERSF, said: “It is satisfying to see so much progress being made with this innovative programme and the upcoming roll-out will now see up to , pupils across the north-east of Scotland benefit from its value and relevance in terms of developing employability skills.“SDS is supporting the ersication of the regional economy and the drive to net zero by delivering activity focusing on supporting a range of learners – including school pupils – to gain digital skills which will help them articulate into further learning or into employment in digital technology.”Newsquest Scotland commercial director David Ward said: “The Herald is proud to be involved with the Climate Solutions Acceleratorprogramme. It is vital that we not only equip Scotlands young people with an academic appreciation of the climate emergency, but also give them a real, practical understanding of the solutions that exist.

Children from P , P  and P  are instead accessing learning from home. Three classes — P, P  and P — and the nursery remain open.On Monday evening, Orkney Islands Council shared hopes to reopen the school fully on Wednesday, with further updates to be confirmed today, Tuesday.Head teacher Islean Gibson has been meeting with representatives from the education service and public health on a daily basis and this will continue as required.She has also been communicating directly with families on the ever-evolving situation and is heartened by the support shown.“We are confident that the home learning on offer to our three classes is working well for families at this time,# Miss Gibson said.#Part of our meeting involved planning for the rest of this week, and I will be writing out to everyone as soon as is possible tomorrow to let parents know what we hope we can provide across the remainder of this week.“It has been an exceptionally tough day for staff and a tricky balance in terms of in class teaching and making sure we have learning going home, so I thank all from the bottom of my heart for the understanding as we all try to get to grips with our new normal for today and tomorrow. To say the team at Dounby have rallied is nowhere near thanks enough.”OIC executive director of education, leisure and housing, James Wylie, added: “The school is experiencing a high number of teaching and support staff absences due to sickness which includes COVID, and this is now coupled with an increasing number of pupils being off across some of the classes too.“Whilst there are  reported COVID-positive LFD and PCR cases within the staff and pupils at the school, it is the combination of all the sickness absences that has led to this decision. We are looking to all measures to try and ensure the school can operate in full from Wednesday, and this will be communicated tomorrow.“Please be assured that we are doing everything we possibly can to get back to normal as soon as possible. I want to also commend the Head Teacher and her team for stepping up in these dficult circumstances.”Despite a relaxation of restrictions nationwide, it remains vital for everyone to continue carrying out lateral flow tests and to report the result, whether positive, negative or void here: https:www.nhsinform.scot # coronavirus-covid-#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Have time to build a squad.“I think the next three years certainly is going to be very dficult to win the Premier League.“They need to give someone that time to build a squad and then really challenge for the big prizes, which a club like Manchester United needs to be doing.” vw,vw,px, px\"Wayne Rooney attended the premiere with his we Colleen Askedhe would like to be the United manager one day, Rooney said: “Of course.

On the pitch which is bad. Off the pitch, good and bad.“I think it gives everyone a real insight into me as a person. Sometimes the struggles you have, whether that’s mentally.

This falls in with ‘Candlemas’ on nd February as a Christian festival and a traditional end of the Christmas season. Candlemas commemorates the presentation of the infant Jesus at the Temple in Jerusalem as described in St Luke’s Gospel and when some denominations bring candles to their church. Candlemas is also one of the so-called ‘Quarter-days’ marking the changing seasons of winter, spring, summer and autumn. It is followed by Whitsun, Lammas Day and Martinmas as the term-days with their administrative and legal implications for the payment of rents and flittings. Saint Bride or Saint Bridget has been one of the most popular of the saints of the celtic church. Of course, there were many ‘Bridgets’, but the one whose festival date is on st February was ‘Bridget of Kildare’ in Leinster whose death was dated to AD . Bridget was one of the patron saints of Ireland and is remembered in the tradition of plaiting rush crosses around st February to set over doors and windows to protect the home from fire and other danger.   or the endearing ‘Bride’s little fosterling’.’ . ‘Bride’s Day, the birthday of spring’. century, traditions of Saint Bride were collected by Alexander Carmichael among his prayers, hymns, blessings and charms from the Hebrides. He suggests that accounts of Saint Bride were not easily recovered and summarised the tradition: ‘The serpent is supposed to emerge from its hollow among the hills on St Bride’s Day, and a propitiatory hymn was sung to it. Only one verse of this hymn has been obtained, apparently the first. It dfers in dferent localities: [Early on Bride’s mornThe serpent shall come from the hole, I shall not molest the serpent, Nor will the serpent molest me.’ The snake is a powerful element in mythology and religion and a creature to be respected as the ‘hymn’ makes clear. Familiar in the snake coiled round the rod, it is a symbol of medicine and healing, and the appearance of the adder or snake on Saint Bride’s Day offers a feeling of hope and transformation, and of turning the corner with the ening of the days. . century. .!... !"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Donnie-Munro-picture-scaled.jpg","title":"special donnie munro concert to bring skye live back with a","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe island#s premier music festival is set toin style on Thursday th May # following a two-year break due to the pandemic # with an opening night extravaganza # ‘Coming Home: An Evening with Donnie Munro and friends’ and featuring special guests in the form of multi-award-winning Gaelic supergroup Mànran.The show will be Donnie’s first in his hometown since  and will see him perform with a full eight-piece band line-up on the spectacular Skye Live Festival site at Am Meall in Portree. The singer said: #This offers me a fantastic opportunity to bring this amazing line-up, featuring some of Scotland’s top musicians together, for an exclusive performance to open this year’s Skye Live Festival.He added: #It has been fantastic to watch the festival grow in strength, year on year, in what must be one of the most special and unique festival locations anywhere in the world, and to see it become internationally recognised as, ‘one of the best boutique festivals in the country’, is just fantastic for the island, and it is such a great honour for me to be invited to be a part of it all and to be bringing the music back home here to where it all began.#Joining Donnie Munro on the night will be Mànran, internationally recognised as one of the most iconic and respected Scottish bands on the road today.

Credit: PAPA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueHealth Minister Robin Swann. Credit: PAFebruary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailAll remaining Covid restrictions in England, including the requirement to self-isolate, could be scrapped this month — and Northern Ireland might not be far behind.It’s not quite cut and dried though, with the political crisis here playing into the equation.Current restrictions in England, which are due to expire on March , mean anyone who tests positive must self-isolate for at least five days. However, the Prime Minister — currently on a charm offensive as part of a mission to restore his reputation — has said he expects the last domestic rules in England could end earlythe data permits. Boris Johnson made the announcement on Wednesday, as Robin Swann was still waiting for an expert assessment on whether he can press ahead with lting restrictions in Northern Ireland.Earlier this week, the Health Minister told a press briefing that he wants to lt most, “ not all” remaining measures. Key to all of this, however, is the legal and public health advice he receives. It is understood that even as late as Wednesday night he hadn’t been given the green light to press ahead with relaxations and it isn’t entirely clear what this will entaillawyers tell him he has the power to act without Executive approval. If this proves to be the case, Mr Swann then has to decide which restrictions he will lt.Among the rules that remain are the controversial Covid certicate scheme for nightclubs, a minimum self-isolation period for people who test positive, a legal requirement to wear face coverings in indoor public spaces, and the regular use of lateral flow tests. Given Mr Johnson’s comments on Wednesday, there was hope that Mr Swann would follow suit, but a spokeswoman from the Department of Health on Wednesday night poured cold water on any such suggestion. “There are no immediate plans for changes to the current arrangements for testing, contact tracing and isolation in Northern Ireland,” she said. “All aspects of test and trace are kept under active review.”However, while this may be Mr Swann’s preferred position, his hands may be forced on the matterMr Johnson scraps lateral flow testsin England. To date, NI’s supply has come from England and it will be dficult for the UUP minister to make a case to the public that they should pay for LFTs as it is unlikely Westminster will pay outthey aren’t in use across the water. The only other alternative would be for Stormont to pick up the cost — and given the current political instability, it’s anyone’s guess whether that would even be possible.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up As it stands, Covid- is still re in Northern Ireland.Given current testing arrangements, the actual number of positive cases is likely to be signicantly higher than those on the Department of Health’s dashboard. Realistically, how many people are actually recording positive LFT results Mercully, Omicron has not turned out to be as dangerous as first feared — at least to most people. But there are still tens of thousands of people here who are clinically extremely vulnerable and for whom the vaccinations may not provide effective protection.Many have had to shield and make extraordinary sacrices to stay safe over the past two years. While the wider population is looking forward to a e to normal, it is these very changes and relaxations that will force the clinically vulnerable to retreat even more from the world.Related topicsDepartment of HealthRobin SwannBoris JohnsonMore On Department of Health PremiumSwann has ‘no plans’ to follow Boris and ditch rules on testingCoronavirus Northern Ireland: What restrictions could be lted tomorrow There’s still a lot of work to be done to deal with mental health issues of young people in NI, says Koulla YiasoumaRobin Swann speaks of own child’s heart condition while declaring organ donation bill ‘Daithi’s Law’ PremiumViewpointOpinionNorthern Ireland’s health at risk after broken vowsMost ReadPolice launch murder investigation after mandies following Lisburn ‘assault’South Belfast restaurant damaged after car driven into front and set alight‘Keep calm and carry on as Northern Ireland Protocol is here to stay’… investment expert says businesses do not agree with DUPReport in no way reflective of what RUC was really like, says former officerLisburn blaze at Ashvale Farm Shop ‘blow to the community’Top VideosPlayVideo: Ciarán Hinds has his name mispronounced during this year#s Oscar nominations\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news eae .ece AUTOCROP wh fbfedcdcbdaa.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news eae .ece AUTOCROP wh fbfedcdcbdaa.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayVideo: Man shot in legs during Newry shootingPlayNorthern Ireland politicians pledge to make country a #daily mile nation#Latest Northern IrelandSwann has ‘no plans’ to follow Boris and ditch rules on testingEugene had time for everyone, says friend of Lisburn murder victimRonan Hale’s best days are still ahead of him and with Larne: Tiernan LynchWomen’s game in Northern Ireland to be offered slice of the stadia funding pieTree to be planted at Stormont to mark Platinum JubileeLatestAngus Robertson describes Brexit as ‘ongoing calamity’ following EU exit reportRelease date for Ewan McGregor’s Obi-Wan Kenobi series confirmedSwann has ‘no plans’ to follow Boris and ditch rules on testingRalph Hasenhuttl ‘will never forget’ Saints’ win over Spurs in his th gameSteven Gerrard tips Jacob Ramsey for England call after brace against Leeds,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

And while this semi-autobiographical film is about the Troubles and the effect it had on the people who lived here, it#s also about how le went on regardless and people tried to make the best of things - going to school, visiting grandparents, worrying about brown envelopes - in one of the most authentic aspects of the film.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up The telling of the story through the eyes of Buddy, an innocent child, adds crucial objectivity and a view of things through the eyes of someone without the cynicism of adults or the need to weigh up the options like his parents.

He is assured: If they can#t understand you, then they#re not listening.It#s a wider point, made to ying degrees throughout the film, about how best to relate to each other and while not the whole picture, plays into the broad brush subjectivity that means Belfast can be enjoyed by all.Read MoreBelfast: Branagh’s ode to city goes up against western hit The Power Of The Dog at the OscarsWill it be seventh heaven for Branagh this time at Oscars Most ReadPolice launch murder investigation after mandies following Lisburn ‘assault’South Belfast restaurant damaged after car driven into front and set alight‘Keep calm and carry on as Northern Ireland Protocol is here to stay’… investment expert says businesses do not agree with DUPReport in no way reflective of what RUC was really like, says former officerLisburn blaze at Ashvale Farm Shop ‘blow to the community’Top VideosPlayVideo: Ciarán Hinds has his name mispronounced during this year#s Oscar nominations\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news eae .ece AUTOCROP wh fbfedcdcbdaa.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news eae .ece AUTOCROP wh fbfedcdcbdaa.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayVideo: Man shot in legs during Newry shootingPlayNorthern Ireland politicians pledge to make country a #daily mile nation#Latest Northern IrelandEugene had time for everyone, says friend of Lisburn murder victimRonan Hale’s best days are still ahead of him and with Larne: Tiernan LynchWomen’s game in Northern Ireland to be offered slice of the stadia funding pieTree to be planted at Stormont to mark Platinum JubileeDavid Healy again comes out fighting to dispel the doubtersLatestRalph Hasenhuttl ‘will never forget’ Saints’ win over Spurs in his th gameSteven Gerrard tips Jacob Ramsey for England call after brace against LeedsEugene had time for everyone, says friend of Lisburn murder victimPep Guardiola not interested in debating whether Man City are world’s best teamPalace boss Patrick Vieira calls on Wilfried Zaha to maintain his standards,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This wasn’t a police investigation,” he said. “But the RUC is not in a position to defend itself. The organisation is tied up, hooded and open to taking battering after battering.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “Negative publicity is what republicans have been superb at, deflecting reality and piece by piece building up the RUC as the ‘bad guys’.“London is not interested, and as there are no prosecutions they are happy to sit back and allow the RUC to be tarnished. Officers are being let down.”A lot of former officers have now given up trying to defend themselves. They are always on the defensive but when the Ombudsman leaps on a bungee cord into the past that does not mean there is any sense of the realities of what the RUC were facing.”DUP South Antrim MLA and Policing Board member Trevor Clarke warned that the record of the entire RUC is at risk of being “unfairly tarnished” by sweeping allegations of collusion.“This is the latest in a growing list of reports by the Ombudsman which alleges collusive behaviour against police officers during the Troubles despite the fact that no such criminal offence actually exists,” he said.“Tellingly the report makes no recommendations in terms of criminal proceedings and accepts that the RUC has no prior knowledge of the attacks.“The courts previously ruled that the Police Ombudsman has no remit to adjudicate on claims of criminality or misconduct. Now it seems PONI has found a loophole by examining allegations of collusion against the description of collusion put forward by families rather than any legal definition.“This trend will frustrate many retired officers. The vast majority served with distinction yet now face the ignominy of having their record unfairly tarnished by what are in the main dubious and unproven claims.” Former Victims’ Commissioner Mike Nesbitt said that “no one is above the law, anybody guilty of wrongdoing should face the criminal justice system”. But the UUP MLA added: “I believe we are in possibly the worst of all possible places – not for the first time the police ombudsman has concluded there were murders that could not have been prevented, could not have been stopped, and yet she points the finger at police officers with the expression collusive behaviour.

Credit: Kelvin Boyes Press Eye FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueHealth Minister Robin Swann. Credit: Kelvin Boyes Press EyeLisa SmythTwitterFebruary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThere are currently \"no plans” to change Covid testing and isolation rules in Northern Ireland, the Department for Health has said.An official laid out Robin Swann’s position last night as the public waits to find out whether he can lt Covid- curbs without Executive approval.Mr Swann had said he hoped to be able to provide further clarity on Thursday. However, it is understood he was still awaiting final legal and public health advice on Wednesday night.A spokeswoman said: “There are no immediate plans for changes to the current arrangements for testing, contact tracing and isolation in Northern Ireland.All aspects of test and trace are kept under active review.”However, the future of the UK’s Covid testing system is hanging in the balance after Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced he hopes to remove all restrictions in England within a matter of weeks.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up The move could see an end to free lateral flow tests and a scaling back of the PCR test system.Mr Johnson said he will present his plan for “living with Covid” when Parliament s from a recess on February , with an aim of lting the requirement to self-isolate within days of that.England’s current self-isolation regulations expire on March , but Mr Johnson told MPs “provided the current encouraging trends in the data continue, it is my expectation that we will be able to end the last domestic restrictions, including the legal requirement to self-isolateyou test positive, a month early”.A public health expert on Wednesday night raised concerns the announcement is politically motivated and warned that Northern Ireland should not follow England’s lead in removing all Covid- safety measures in the coming weeks.Professor Mark Tully of Ulster University said the remaining restrictions should be lted in a gradual way, with a clear exit strategy to suppress any resulting rise in Covid- cases.And he said it is possible the announcement by Mr Johnson on Wednesday that self-isolation will be scrapped in England this month could further damage the public health message.He said: “We really don’t want it to turn into a free-for-all.”It comes as the latest data shows infection levels have risen in many parts of the UK, with only Wales showing a clear week-on-week fall. In England around one in  people in private households is estimated to have had the virus in the week to February  — up from one in  in the week to January .Northern Ireland saw infections continuing to increase week-on-week, from one in  people to one in  — the highest since records began. While in Scotland the estimate is up from one in  to one in .In Wales, around one in  people is estimated to have had Covid last week, down from one in  the previous week.Prof Tully said: “We always knew that we would reach a point where we would need to try and transition out of the pandemic.“Personally, I’m worried because we don’t really seem to have detailed plans about how that’s going to happen, but we know that with an infectious disease, when we stop managing spread we’re bound to get a flare-up againeveryone rushes back to increased social contact.“If everyone s to work without masks, it will be like opening the floodgates.“We always said in Northern Ireland that the restrictions would only remain in place for as long as absolutely necessary.“That’s an important principle, it has been important to have them in place, but it’s also important to lt them when we can.“I think it’s too early to lt all restrictions we should be looking at lting certain behavioural restrictions that were put in place for the Omicron wave.“Then maybe in the following month or two, we could look at removing testing requirements and self-isolation, but I get the sense that restrictions are being lted for political gain.”On Wednesday a further , Covid cases and two deaths were recorded here.

They went through a few phases, allowing their out half to burst through a couple of tackles to score and take a - half time lead.Playing with the conditions in the second half, Ballynahinch started the on the front foot but fell foul of the referee at the breakdown, allowing Lurgan to pin them back in their own .The visiting forwards then went to work, carrying hard and scoring another try.The conversion left the home side  points down, but they hit back almost immediately with some great attacking rugby creating space for Callum McCargo to smash his way over.The game was on the line at this point, but a lack of composure allowed the excellent Lurgan full back to punish weak tackling and score a long range try.Left with a mountain to climb, Ballynahinch once again played some superb rugby with great interplay between centres James Graham and Harvey Campbell creating space for Sam Hamilton to dash for the line.He was stopped short but desperate Lurgan defending saw them receive a yellow card before Matthew McAuley reduced the deficit to five points with a try from a quickly taken penalty.A smash-and-grab victory against  men with only a minute on the clock demanded error-free rugby and after an excellent restart Ballynahinch moved upfield.However a knock-on saw the referee blow his whistle for full time and Lurgan earned a deserved victory.Both sides can be proud and the game was played in a superb spirit with the teams having lunch together in the clubhouse..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2020_Mourne.jpg","title":"Beauty of local landscapes feature in exploration events  ","story":"SEVERAL familiar locations in Downpatrick, Newcastle and Strangford are at the heart of this monthrsquos Northern Ireland Science Festival.There will be a selection of events between February  and  with people across the district encouraged to explore something new as ious venues prepare to play host to a series of stirring events.The so-called STEM celebration mdash which has grown to become the largest of its kind in Ireland mdash boasts more than  events over  days.On February , the St Patrick Centre in Downpatrick is the venue for the Patrick  The Pagan Hills event which provides an opportunity to follow in the footsteps of both the patron saint and pagan in an exploration of the landscape that Patrick himself encountered when he ed to Ireland nearly , years ago.On February  and , the Strangford Activity Centre is hosting a ldquopaddle back in time kayak adventure to Mahee Island following a traditional smuggling route undertaken by Daft Eddie and the Merry Hearts.There will also be an opportunity to discover ruins of the monastic site of Nendrum, le in the monastery in the Middle Ages and the role played by the Vikings in the Strangford Lough area between the th and th centuries.The Strangford Activity Centre is also hosting ldquopaddle with a purpose on February  and  with participants invited to do their bit for the environment by joining a clean-up of Strangford Lough.And ldquoforaging afloat on February  and  at the same venue sees people joining with the Centrersquos Rory Martin and Andrea and Graham Gannon of Peninsula Kelp for a unique guide to the sights and flavour of the area as spring arrives on the lough and with it an array of seasonal wild food.On February , therersquos an opportunity to discover the wonders of the Mournes at a range of festival events.During the Diamond Rock Walking Tour on February , guide Peter Rafferty will explains how to identy erse rock types and how the Mournes were formed, alongside learning about the amazing geology and history of the area at the Geology on the Rocks event on February .The following day, the Men of Mourne ndash Stone  Steel hiking tour takes place with an opportunity to hear stories of hardship and endurance as participants take to rocky mountain tracks.During the Mourne Stone Walling ndash A Granite Kingdom event, therersquos a chance to experience the beauty and hard graft behind the ,-year-old craft of dry-stone wall building. A date for the event has yet to be confirmed.On February  at the Newcastle Community Cinema, Film Hub NI is inviting families to a special screening of lsquoThe Snail and the Whalersquo, a joyous, empowering story about the natural wonders of the world and discovering that no matter how small you are, you can make a dference.And to coincide with this special screening, NI Science Festival has organised an interactive seashore adventure with Beach Schools NI which will take place a short walk from the cinema and is included in the ticket price.Festival director, Chris McCreery, said the event exists to engage audiences, stimulate discussion, and ignite interest in the wonders of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.ldquoWe are confident that this yearrsquos erse programming will expand the horizons of festival goers of all ages and abilities across Northern Ireland, he added.The Science Festival is supported by the Department for the Economy, Belfast City Council, Tourism NI, Derry City and Strabane Council, Queenrsquos University,Ulster University, British Council Northern Ireland, MCS Group, The Open University NI, Innovate UK, Matrix NI, Film Hub NI and Arts and Business NI..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2020_CD.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C  February 5%2C 1992  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK ndash The Downe Hospital has been identied as the possible site of a new police station in Downpatrick.The Police Authority has expressed an interest in the large site in a move which would pave the way for the construction of a new Downe Hospital, utilising Lecale House and the Maternity Hospital as the core buildings on the Ardglass Road.The present Downe Hospital, medical assessment unit and nurses home would then be completely demolished to make way for a new police base.Police Authority officials toured the hospital complex before Christmas and are reported to be impressed with both the size of the site and its central location.The officials have also held informal discussions with representatives of the Eastern Health Board who are also believed to be attracted to the plan.The revenue generated by the sale of the massive complex would go a long way to paying for the construction of a new hospital which politicians have called for on numerous occasions.A spokeswoman for the Police Authority said it is not normal policy to comment on such matters, and she added that there is still a commitment to build a new police base on the Ballydugan Road.Although the Authority has obtained outline planning permission for the Ballydugan Road site, it is believed that the nature of the land and the potential size of the highly fortied station is causing concern.Publicly the Authority is pressing ahead with plans to build there, but behind the scenes it has continued to look at possible sites in ious town locations.The Downe Hospital has now emerged as the surprise front-runner although evensuch an ambitious plan is approved, it will be many years before a police station is operational on the site.ARDGLASS ndash A special sub-committee has been set up by Down District Council to consider the European Communityrsquos review of the common fisheries policy.The committee is to be empowered to provide a response to the document.Ardglass SDLP councillor, Mr Dermot Curran, said some of the systems that were being introduced by the EC are not very helpful to the people employed in the fishing industry. Others were, such as decommissioning, but are not being put into action.ldquoIn all of these schemes there is nothing to protect the people employed in the industry. Government must do something to help the plight of these people, said Mr Curran.He complained that these workers are treated as casual labour with no claim to redundancy or national assistance.ldquoThe fishing industry plays a very important part in the economy of Northern Ireland and we must protect it and the people who work in it. Government should set up systems to ensure that everybody is treated fairly, he said.Ulster Unionist, Mr Gerry Douglas, said something has to be done to assist and to at least ensure that the processing industry is retained in Down District.KILLINCHY ndash The  new jobs announced by the Northern Ireland Spinners group as part of a pound.m investment will have no direct impact on its Killinchy factory.A spokesman for the company explained following Thursdayrsquos official announcement that the expansion of the firmrsquos sister factory in Newtownards will have no adverse impact on the Killinchy operation.ldquoThey are sister factories, both concentrating on very similar yarns, he said.ldquoWe have already completed major expansions at Killinchy, virtually replacing all the machinery we had. Killinchy is a very modern mill, as modern as Newtownards, he added.Mr Ray Dinsdale, chief executive of Richards Plc, the Aberdeen-based parent company of Northern Ireland Spinners, said: ldquoThis investment will strengthen the position of Northern Ireland Spinners as the largest United Kingdom spinner of semi-worsted yarns for carpet manufacturers.ldquoOur strategy is based on the expansion of the business into Europe, and the investment will mean that Northern Ireland Spinners will be of the size required to enable it to offer the economies of scale and cost reductions which are required to win business from major carpet manufacturers in these competitive markets, added Mr Dinsdale.CROSSGAR ndash Crossgarrsquos loss has been Bangorrsquos gain with a -job factory picking up an important quality certication.The firm of Dunn and CompanyLtd. was set up in Crossgar in , and it has now picked up the BS quality certication.After four years of trading, the company relocated from its premises in Crossgar to a factory unit based in Balloo industrial estate, Bangor.It manufacturers special purpose valves and precision components for industrial application with  per cent of it business going to the export market.It currently employs  people and has plans for further expansion, explained Mr Ron Dunn, managing director.When asked why the company left Crossgar, Mr Ron Dunn, managing director said: ldquoThere was not enough room in Crossgar.ldquoWe occupied part of the premises of my brother, Sam, but there was just nothing available in the Crossgar area at that time when we employed three of four people.His brother continues his own successful firm manufacturing machine tools on the Saintfield Road, Crossgar.BISHOPSCOURT ndash Planning Service officials have been urged to attend next monthrsquos first bike race at the former Bishopscourt base ndash before reaching a decision on a planning application for a permanent circuit.The plea has been made this week by local SDLP councillor, Mr John Ritchie.ldquoI would expect they will understand the necessity to attend to make an informed judgement on the matter, explained Mr Ritchie.ldquoAfter that date I would hope a decision would not be long delayed.Mr Ritchie said he had read the petition against the proposed race track and seen the comments of those members of the Ballyhornan Development Association who support the proposal. He had also read the details given by the two developers.ldquoThere are a number of issues involved. I understand that there can be up to  meetings without planning permission per year the equivalent of one a month and two a month in two summer months. I would have thought this wasnrsquot unreasonable.SAINTFIELD ndash The centre of Saintfield was sealed off for three hours on Friday afternoon after the discovery of a suspicious package in a telephone box.The area around Crossgar Road and Toddrsquos Hill was closed as army bomb disposal experts carried out an examination of the device.The device which consisted of cassettes, a battery pack and wires, was described as an elaborate hoax and was taken away for examination.NEWCASTLE ndash Mentally handicapped people from all over Northern Ireland will soon be benefitting from a remarkable transformation at Newcastlersquos Ruby House.For the past year passers-by have seen the conversion of the Bryansford Road complex from a row of not-so-attractive seaside resort houses into aspacious and modern residential home which now offers accommodation for  mentally handicapped adults.This year the holiday home is expected to provide upwards of  holidays for mentally handicapped people from all over the Province.The Ruby House Group now has three centres in Newcastle, including a converted house in Main Street and the purpose-built Mary Murray House in the Lawnfield.STRANGFORD ndash A single Strangford Lough management committee is to be launched in the spring by the Environment Department.It will consist of about  representatives of lough users, the community around the lough and those with specialist knowledge of the area.This weekrsquos announcement reflects some of the views expressed by the Strangford Lough Nature Conservation Association the body which was set up a few years ago in protest against restrictive DoE proposals.The new body will have the development of management proposals for the lough area as its main task. It will be consulted on any designations or proposals by government or local government relating to the area, including the marine nature reserve..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2022_Celtic.jpg","title":"Gibney’s Hoops double  ","story":"IT was a case of what could have been for Killough, as Celtic Bhoys capitalised on opportunities to stay in the race for the title on Saturday.From the refereersquos first whistle it was a heated event at Ballyhornan with both sides looking to grab possession.The advantage of the wind was with Celtic Bhoys in the first half, and it was a minor error by Killough goalkeeper, James Crangle, in the fourth minute that gted Jay Gibney his first goal of the game.Cranglersquos kick out went direct to the striker and Gibney made no mistake with his finish.The Killough players looked more driven by this and showed great character supporting their goalkeeper to get his head back into the game. Connor Kelly had a chance for the visitors, but Celtic Bhoysrsquo goalkeeper, Nathan Curran, was on form and saved.It was a balanced game as both sides had their chances with Killoughrsquos Kevin Groves coming close in the th minute and Celtic Bhoysrsquo Jordan McCoubrey pushing forwarding search of an opportunity in front of the net.Killoughrsquos Gareth George had to be subbed due to an injury on his ankle and Declan Looney came on in the rd minute of the game. Jack McLaughlin had a one on one chance facing Curran, but the ball went straight at the lsquokeeper before it was cleared.The visitors were keeping up the pressure to level the score, with a surging run up the left wing from Looney, who passed across to find Connor Kelly, but again Nathan Curran saved.The second goal of the game came from a similar scenario to the first ndash a lacklustre kick out that found the feet of Jay Gibney again and Celtic Bhoys went two up going into half-time.Two errors by Killoughrsquos goalkeeper saw the hosts leading at half-time and all of the play was going down the right side of the field.Killough signalled their intentions that the game was not over, as Declan Looney looped the ball into the danger zone, and Nathan Curran somehow got his hand to it to push over the bar.Jay Gibney was set for his hat-trick in the th minute when the Killough custodian came out to stop him in his tracks. Gibney managed to manoeuvre round him, but the ball was cleared by Sean Burns. Celtic Bhoys had another chance to go three up, as three of their players from a free-kick stood looking at one another and the chance went a miss.Killoughrsquos Declan Burns played a great ball from the middle of the field to Declan Looney, who found team-mate Daniel Taggart. The striker saw his shot saved, but the rebound fell to Kevin Groves, who finished to bring his side back into the game with  minutes to go.Celtic Bhoys made a couple of substitutes in the next ten minutes, with Sean McMahon going up front and Sean Ferris ping back into midfield.As the clock ticked to the th minute, Killoughrsquos McLaughlin fired in a free-kick to the head of Eamon Gargan.However, man of the match Nathan Curran pushed the ball at full stretch over the bar.In the final five minutes of play it was all attack by Killough. Kevin Groves had a chance which was denied with Declan Looney quickly following up, although there was no way to find the leveller. It was in the last minute that the Killough goalkeeper made a clearance mistake that saw Shaun Megahey score to break Killough hearts.Celtic Bhoys will be very happy with the win, while Killough will count their missed chances. Nathan Curran made the dference in a tight game, and Killoughrsquos young Crangle will have learnt a lot from the contest for the remaining matches of the season.Celtic Bhoys: N Curran, S Megahey, R Quinn, R Fitzpatrick, M Rice, C Doherty, B Tracey, P Casey, J Gibney, J McCoubrey, C Kerr.Subs: E Kelly for P Casey, S McMahon for J McCoubrey, S Ferris for Conaill Kerr.Killough FC: J Crangle, R Burns, E Gargan, C Burns, S Og Burns, D Burns, C Kelly, G George, D Taggart, K Groves, J McLaughlin.Subs: D Looney for G George, K Tierney, C Doyle..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2020_Wave.jpg","title":"It’s like a little  safe haven here%2C somewhere you can come and cry and not get judged  ","story":"TEARS still spring easily to the eyes of Dympna Kerr, the sister of Columba McVeigh, one of the lsquoDisappearedrsquo victims.Once she begins to talk about her  year-old brother, whose body has never been recovered after he was abducted and murdered by the IRA in , after nearly  years of dealing with his loss the pain remains.Last weekend, the Donaghmore woman left her home in St Helenrsquos in Merseyside to travel to a welcoming building in the coastal village of Killough.At the newly named Wave By The Sea centre in Castle Street, Dympna spent precious time speaking with longstanding friends who are also relatives of the Disappeared. The main dference is that they have been fortunate to locate the bodies of their loved one. Several searches have yet toher brotherrsquos remains to the family but they remain hopeful.ldquoItrsquos like a little safe haven here, somewhere you can come and cry and not get judged. The people you are crying to know why you are crying as they understand, explained Dympna about her lasting need to connect with people with shared experience.ldquoGoing to the Wave house in Belfast is like going home. Itrsquos like getting a hug as soon as you go across the door. And itrsquos the same here as Irsquove already been several times.The help and support of the iniduals who make up the Wave Trauma Centre quietly helps thousands of people like Dympna who have been bereaved, injured and or traumatised by the decades of conflict in Northern Ireland.The building has been provided by the local trustees of The Kinder Project, a charitable Dutch organisation that began its association with Northern Ireland in the s for the education and social welfare of disadvantaged children and young adults.The hostel now provides residential breaks for a maximum of  people, providing rooms for families and iniduals, who use the time to break away from their lives still traumatised and dealing with the physical and emotional aftermath.Counselling and complimentary therapy sessions are offered and other courses are provided by Wave to help those who come, many of whom have never sought help before.Itrsquos the sixth centre around the province that Wave has established, along with r satellite projects, with support funding from the Victims and Support Service, NI Executive, Special EU Programmes Body and charitable donations.One of the Troubles survivors who wished the service had been available locally for him and his family is Killough man Peter Heathwood.Peter knows the benefit of support from Wave. In September  he was left paralysed after a Loyalist gun attack in his Belfast home as he played with his youngest daughter in his living room mdash bullets missing the baby by inches.His attack was witnessed by his late we and two eldest children. His father Hubert died from a heart attack at the scene when he saw his apparently dead son.As a member of the Wave Injured Group, he has campaigned for years for a state pension for people left physically or psychologically injured from the conflict.He has yet to receive his pension, even though he applied for it last autumn.ldquoI had to travel to Belfast night and day and only discovered Wave when I went on to the Victimsrsquo Forum years after my shooting, said Peter.ldquoMy we died at  with a diagnosis of PTSD and suffered with flashbacks. If I had found Wave earlier, I reckon it could have saved her as she could have met other women and shared stories and experiences.ldquoWhen I was shot, I passed out but she saw me lying there with blood pumping out of me, children screaming and my father dying. She could never deal with the fact that she opened the door to the gunmen. But I told her thatshe hadnrsquot have shouted a warning to me, I would have been dead as I was able to get up and slam the door.ldquoEven in this village, there are people who moved from Belfast and a lot of them lost relatives in the Troubles, uncles, fathers, grandfathers and many of them never speak about it. I didnrsquot really talk about it to my own children as you didnrsquot want them to be filled with hate.Peter said that even on holiday when people asked what happened to him, he would say he was injured skiing in the French Alps, a more sanitised version of his attack mdash purportedly in mistake for another man mdash as he enjoyed an evening at home with his family.ldquoWave is a fantastic organisation. We are completely cross-community. Everyone has been hurt by all groups and thatrsquos the great strength of it, said Peter.ldquoI would really encourage anyone who has affected by the Troubles and has never sought help to come along to Wave. Itrsquos never too late to talk.Waversquos chief executive officer, Sandra Peake, says that the new centre will help  people in the immediate area and around  from the district, in addition to providing weekend residential breaks from families across Northern Ireland, Britain and the Irish Republic.ldquoThis wouldnrsquot have been possible without the generosity of the Kinder Project, explained Sandra, who said that the building has been fitted out to reflect a more comfortable family style accommodation.ldquoWe had initially done some work in Downpatrick about  years ago to see what we could have provided but have always been keen to provide a local base, which Kinder has now provided to us.ldquoThe welcome from the people and the shopkeepers of Killough has been brilliant. They seem to know why our visitors are staying here and give them a respectful place and go beyond and above to help them.ldquoSome of the families have enjoyed paddle boarding lessons on the water with children experiencing this type of activity for the first time. One grandmother got to sleep in a bed for the first time in years as she normally sleeps on the couch to let her grandchildren have the bed.Wave By The Sea is much more than a weekend or holiday break.ldquoWe aim to provide a holistic service here for people. It will start with an outreach case worker working with you to establish what your needs are and then that moves us into seeing what we can provide, whether its counselling, physiotherapy, group support and so on, Sandra continued.ldquoSeventy per cent of Waversquos work is service provision, the remainder is trauma education. We have a whole range of short trauma courses now and we hope to run courses her.ldquoThey deal with how trauma affects families, recognising the impact of trauma and how to build resilience, the intergenerational impact and issues such as trauma addiction as we would see people with issues. We also provide trauma education for healthcare professionals and student doctors, nurses, and social workers.She predicts an increase of demand for services as new referrals increased last year in part due to interest in the Injured Pension scheme and the proposed Legacy proposals.ldquoThe majority of people coming to us now have never gone anyway for help.

Team-mate Devlin then converted a free to pile on the pressure.Opposing number eights, Dylan Ward and Ian Maguire, were having a notable midfield battle which drew attention fromboth sets of supporters on numerous occasions but often it was the Kilcoo man coming out on top.lsquoKeeper Kane kicked an effort off the ground and over the bar on the rd minute before Eugene Branagan scored a point from play to give The Magpies the lead.As was the theme of the contest, Sherlock knocked over a brace of frees for the Munster champions and the score line swayed once more.Daryl Branagan curled two points from play over the bar before Ryan McEvoy was shown the yellow card for a foul on the opposition. Sherlock duly converted the resulting free and now the game was in its last ten minutes of regulation time.Ward received a yellow card for more off the ball antics with Maguire but Kilcoo kept on scoring through the left boot of Devlin, who split the posts after receiving a neat pass from Daryl Branagan.As the officials indicated four additional minutes, The Magpies held a narrow one point lead with the scores reading - to -.On the rd minute, The Barrrsquos were afforded the chance to draw level from a long ranged free which Sherlock made no mistake in doing.With seemingly one lastthrow of the dice, Kilcoo launched the ball forward to the experienced Devlin, who drew the foul as he attempted to pick up the pass.With what everyone thought was the final kick of the game, Devlin prepared to knock over his free and send his side through to a second successive All-Ireland final.However, there would be one last twist before the whistle.To everyone in attendance and those watching at homersquos disbelief, Kilcoo joint-captain Aidan Branagan, who was only on the pitch for a matter of minutes, needlessly collided with Barrrsquos replacement Adam Lyne off-the-ball.After brief deliberation, referee Cawley gave Branagan his marching orders in the form of a red card and reversed his decision from a free to a throw ball.The full-time whistle sounded seconds later and the game headed to extra-time.Despite the high drama, Kilcoo would not be denied and dominated the following duration of the contest.Custodian Kane was first to kick over, before Anthony Morgan doubled the deficit. Sherlock pulled one back for The Barrrsquos from a free but Micheal Rooney quickly cancelled this out at the other end.Devlin extended the lead to three and yet again Sherlock proved reliable for The Barrrsquos through a converted free.However, Kilcoo clearly had prepared for these extraminutes and scoring opportunities looked to be seldom for their opposition, although Colm Barrett did split the posts after Devlin curled over another point.lsquoKeeper Kane saw his rsquo sail over the bar to restore a two point lead and from here St Finbarrrsquos ran out of gas.Jamie Burns saw red for the Cork side after punching out at Doherty, and Kilcoo were now afforded the extra space to stamp their authority in the closing minutes.Despite Ward picking up a late black card, a brace of Doherty points rounded off the scoring as the match finally reached its climax at - to -.After the contest, Kilcoo lsquokeeper Niall Kane spoke about his sidersquos performance and reaching yet another All-Ireland final.ldquoWe knew it was going to be tough when you get to the last four in Ireland, he said.ldquoYes everybody was saying Kilcoo were going to be red hot favourites, but deep down we knew St Finbarrrsquos are no walkover and they proved that.ldquoItrsquos only a semi-final, therersquos nothing won yet so we are back at it in the morning, get our recovery and training Monday night.St Finbarrrsquos: J Kerins S Ryan, J Burns, C Scully C Lyons, B Hennessy, A OrsquoConnor I Maguire, Eoin Comyms D OrsquoBrien, S Sherlock , B Hayes C Myers-Murray , E McGreevy , C McCrickard.Subs: E Dennehy for C Myers-Murray, C Barrettfor D OrsquoBrien, M Shields for E McGreevy, A Lyne for C McCrickard.Kilcoo: N KaneN Branagan, R McEvoy, Aaron BranaganM Rooney, D Branagan , E BranaganD Ward, Aaron Morgan C Doherty , J Johnston, S JohnstonC Laverty, R Johnston , P Devlin .Subs: Anthony Morganfor Laverty, Aidan Branagan for Aaron Morgan, C Laverty for Aidan Branagan, T Fettes for R Johnston, J Clarke for M Rooney.Referee: Brendan Cawley ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2020_Death.jpg","title":"Marc (18) remembered as ‘an unassuming and polite young man’  ","story":"THE funeral of a teenager who died in a road accident near Castlewellan at the weekend takes place later today.Marc Quinn died after being struck by a car on the Newcastle Road in the early hours of Sunday morning.It is believed that Marc, who celebrated his th birthday last Wednesday, was walking home when the accident occurred shortly before .am.He was treated at the scene before being taken to hospital, but sadly died a short time later.Police are appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident to contact them.The funeral cortege will leave Marcrsquos home in Annsborough today at .pm for Requiem Mass in St Malachyrsquos Church in Castlewellan at pm, to be followed by interment at St Maryrsquos Cemetery, Aughlisnafin.Marc was a talented Gaelic footballer who was a senior player for Aughlisnafin GAC.His mother, Jenny, is the club secretary, and his father, Garry, is a former player.

The tactic looked like paying off, but at the post So Ladylike, with Caoimhe OrsquoBrien in the saddle, got up to provide the rider with her second success, her first coming on this Alana McGuinness-owned runner back in October. Ballinasilla finished a close third.The winner is trained by Ian Donoghue, a brother of top Northern Ireland jockey Keith, who is no longer with Gordon Elliott.Only six of the  entries took part in the Dennison JCB Maiden Race for five year-old geldings, but the race provided spectators with a close finish.The Aaron Sinnott-ridden Song For My Father, owned and trained in Co Cavan by Shane Donohoe, just passed the judge ahead of Time For A Pint, ridden by Tom Hamilton for Co Carlow trainer Shark Hanlon, with Hapy La Vie back in third ahead of Old Style Humor.It was not long before a stewardsrsquo enquiry was called with the result that the winner was disqualied for failing to draw the correct weight. Time For A Pint was placed first ahead of Hapy La Vie and Old Style Humor .Four set out in the Kingsfield Stud five year-old Mares Maiden Race, but only three remained after the fourth fence, after Paddy Cleary lost his irons and was unseated.This left Born Famous to win from Famous Function and local hope Social Distancing. For trainer Claire OrsquoConnell it was a welcome winner. Paul Bannon was the successful rider.The Cosy Roof Open Race saw the grey Creadan Grae make most of the running but in the end had to be content with second to the ex-English trained Brain Power mdash a rare open horse for Warren Ewing, who is best known for producing top four year-olds.The successful rider was Maghera-based Oran McGill who was replacing his injured younger brother Dara. Warren is part of the well known fish merchant family. Third home was Bajan Excell, ridden by Ben OrsquoBrien.The connections of the runner-up in this race, Broughshane owner Philip McBurney, rider Noel McParlan and trainer Gerry Quinn, also based at Broughshane, had better fortune in the Armstrong Auctions  year-old and Upwards Mares Maiden when Tamlaght Eyes, pulled up in her previous three races, proved to be the smooth winner from the Lee Shawagen-ridden Any Time with Castle Arms Casa a very close third.The final race on the card was the G Curran  Co Ltd Maiden Race for  year-old and Upwards Geldings. Ask Charlie was the easy winner from Kilmoganny, ridden by Tiernan Power-Roche, and Robbie Armstrongrsquos ex-English trained Carolersquos Templer, ridden by Deckie Lavery.Good to see the long established Denis Reddan colours in the winning enclosure. Ridden by Ben Harvey, the winner is trained by his father, William.Perhaps the result may have been dferent had Paul Bannon not become unseated at the final fence of his mount Butcher Barry.Best turned out in all races as usual was courtesy of Glencairn Stables.Acting stewards: Rev Colin Hall-Thompson, Max and Margaret Evine and David Aiken.Ballee jockey Toni Quail, out of action with a broken ankle as a result of a schooling accident, was helping with declarations at the meeting.A tribute was paid to the late Maurice King who for many years was a vet at the meeting.The next meeting at Tyrella is on Saturday, March . Prior to that, the North Down meeting at Kirkistown will take place on February . First race is at pm. The same evening the East Down Hunt Ball will take place at Ballydugan Mill.Victor Reid, a long time owner and breeder along with his late we Margaret, sadly passed away suddenly at hospital on Friday. His son, Neville, still has horses in training. The late Drew Reid also from Banbridge, rode many of Victorrsquos horses in point-to-points.A notable absentee at the entrance on Saturday was William McDowell, although he was present.

I strongly recommend that the author of the editorial reads the -page Amnesty report. It was developed through four years of rigorous and extensive research on laws, policies and practices, where we have documented in detail how Israeli authorities treat Palestinians as an inferior racial group and systematically deprive them of their rights.It documents how massive seizures of Palestinian land and property, unlawful killings, the forcible transfer of Palestinian people from their land, drastic restrictions on movement, and the denial of nationality and citizenship to Palestinians are all components of a system amounting to apartheid.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.Apartheid is defined under international law. No two systems of oppression and domination will ever be identical, and the treatment does not need to be identical to that experienced historically in South Africa. Indeed, Amnesty has previously found that the Myanmar government subjects the Rohingya people to a system of apartheid. Apartheid is both an international wrong and a crime against humanity. When a crime against humanity is committed, the international community has an obligation to hold the perpetrators to account.Crucially, Israeli law treats Palestinians as an inferior and separate group defined by their racialised non-Jewish, Arab status.We conclude that this apartheid system is enforced against all Palestinians living under the effective control of Israel – whether in Israel, the Occupied Palestinian Territories, or in other countries as refugees.Amnesty recognises that Jewish people, like Palestinians, claim a right to self-determination and does not challenge Israel’s desire to be a home for Jewish people. However, international law does prohibit Israel from discriminating against Palestinians and others who already live in that country, including with respect to rights concerning family reunication, and against Palestinian refugees who have a right toto the country.Like all countries, Israel has the right - and indeed an obligation under international law - to protect all people under its control. However, security-related policies must still comply with international law, and they must be proportionate to the threat posed. Security can never be a justication or pretext for human rights violations and crimes against humanity. Though not the subject of this report, Amnesty has consistently documented serious violations by the Palestinian authorities in the West Bank and Gaza. We have consistently reported on and condemned unlawful attacks by Palestinian armed groups against Israeli civilians. This includes the firing of indiscriminate rockets from Gaza into Israel, which we have called for the International Criminal Court to investigate as war crimes. The state of Israel has been a member of the United Nations since its establishment in . It is a party to international human rights conventions and other treaties and therefore must respect these obligations, including by upholding the right to equality and non-discrimination, and by ending and remedying violations of international law. This report is a call for the Israeli government to do so and thus end its system of apartheid against Palestinians.Patrick Corrigan, Northern Ireland Programme Director, Amnesty International UKAmnesty International calling Israel an apartheid state is an unjust slur——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

After waiting for three golfers to complete the hole they moved on locating their first stile in woodland which led into fields containing sheep as the sun put in an appearance.A descent led them to the ruined buildings and old stable block at Cefncarnau-fawr along with a mysterious ivy clad ruined building, where they deviated along a narrow muddy track in woodland to enter fields, where boots crunched over frozen uneven mud as they approached a stile leading into Coed-y-wenallt.A wide wet and muddy pathway populated with dog walkers led them to a wooden footbridge and across the fast flowing Nant Cwm Nofydd for the climb up to Rhiwbina Hill and a short road walk before turning into Fforestganol.A steep climb past water gushing down the bare hillside in small waterfalls led them through Heol y Forest and along a rough track carpeted with autumnal leaves with shadows of the surrounding bare trees silhouetted on the ground. Then downhill through part of Fforest-fawr where natural resources like limestone, coal and haematite, an iron rich mineral which were abundant in this area were mined. So many of the hollows and mounds to be found within the woodland are the result of shallow workings and spoil tips, many of which are now hidden beneath vegetation.The path eventually brought them out at the bottom of the main driveway leading uphill to Castell Coch, or the red castle and stopping to utilise fallen tree trunks for seating, they enjoyed morning refreshments whilst gazing at the fairy tale castle. Actually built on the remains of a th century castle this th century Gothic style folly, standing above the steep Taff gorge was built by William Burgess for the rd Marquis of Bute, although sadly Burgess died ten years before the project was complete..removeRefreshed, another climb led them uphill and further into Fforest-fawr where they descended a wide pathway to the valley bottom to join part of the Taff Trail along the flat disused railway line. Then another climb, this time on narrow muddy pathways through bracken to zig zag gradually uphill to the open hillside overlooking Taffs Well and Gwaelod y Garth in the valley below and up through the Taff valley towards Rhydfelin and Pontypridd.The last haul brought them to the summit of Craig yr Allt with its panoramic views including towards its sister hill the Garth and the reward of a sit down for lunch under overcast skies, whilst gazing towards the coast at Penarth Head and out across the misty Bristol Channel. Continuing along the ridge and making their descent to a road, a short journey led them back into fields containing passive horses as they trekked through mud to Waun-waelod.One last climb up through a waterlogged narrow track between bramble bushes led them out onto Caerphilly Common as the sun ed, for the short climb to the trig point at m on Caerphilly Mountain to enjoy the views over Caerphilly in the valley below with its ruined castle clearly visible.All that was left was the short descent passing many other people who were out with dogs and children enjoying the afternoon sunshine and views, to make their way back to their start point after a lovely . mile undulating tramp.You can follow the group’s exploits at www.penarthramblers.wordpress or Facebook. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

The visit was hosted by the Parliament of Ghana, UK High Commission, and other key partners.We were given a warm welcome and held candid discussions on issues including Covid, conflict and climate matters. We met local women traders and the Chamber of Commerce, as well as MPs from countries across Africa and other key figures. There were lots of discussions about how they view the UK and our mutual partnerships going forward, how we tackle global challenges, and how we fight for human rights and gender justice together.After arriving back in the early hours, I was then straight back into Westminster for anFriday sitting in Parliament – a very important one – as I joined other MPs to support my colleague Rosie Cooper MP’s British Sign Language Bill, which aims to make BSL an official language of the UK.I had a chance to thank local BSL interpreters and deaf community activists, saying: “I add my wholehearted support to this Bill. Like many hon. Members, I have campaigners in my own constituency, such as Stuart Parkinson, an activist for the deaf community with Cardf Deaf Centre, but I also pay tribute to the work of the Association of British Sign Language Teachers and Assessors. Interpreters such as Julie Doyle and Tony Evans can be seen on Welsh Government broadcasts, live with the First Minister and Health Minister, interpreting in BSL in real time in the room, and I pay tribute to them for the work they have done for the deaf community and in supporting this Bill.”.removeWhile we are thankfully now back at Level  Covid restrictions in Wales, it’s important we continue to keep up the effort on vaccinations and boosters – soyou haven’t had yours, please arrange to do so as soon as possible. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Currently the Northern Ireland Executive can’t meet following the resignation of First Minister, Paul Givan, last week. The last remaining restrictions were due to be discussed at an Executive meeting on Thursday. However, Mr Swann said he was not prepared to allow a failure of politics to get in the way of lting now unnecessary restrictions. I am now seeking that legal guidance on how I myself can replace the bulk of the remaining restrictions,not all of them, with clear guidance and advice, he said on Monday afternoon. When we had an executive, ministers always said we wouldnt retain restrictions for a day longer than necessary, so that same logic should still apply. While we must move forward carefully, we cant stay locked in emergency restrictions forever. We need to start getting normal back.
