It made you angry and you lost your self control. Do you agree or not?\u0027Depp replied: \u0027There were many instances. There was an episode involving her rendezvous with Mr Barker. There were many instances where jealousy did come from my side. \u0027There were many instances where it was provoked if you will.\u0027In a text sent to Heard after the alleged attack read to the court, he said: \u0027Slim I\u0027m truly sorry I could not be more sorry for upsetting you to the degree I have. \u0027I do of course take your generosity and devotion to heart and I reciprocate. Please know my apology is sincere and solid. I hope your meeting with Clive Barker is excellent. Love you very f**ing much, Steve.\u0027He later wrote: \u0027I always regret it when I jump or when you jump therefore I put in heavy work with shrink. I\u0027m sorry for being less your disappointment in me and my behaviour, I\u0027m a f***ing savage.\u0027Ms Wass noted that Depp used the same language to describe himself in his texts as he had earlier used to refer to iniduals who \u0027kicked\u0027 women.The lawyer asked: \u0027Yesterday I asked you how you would describe a man who kicks his wife in the back and you immediately came up with the word savage. \u0027It\u0027s a word I use,\u0027 came the reply.\u0027And you were describing yourself as savage in that text because you had been violent towards a woman,\u0027 the lawyer said.\u0027No ma\u0027am, I often describe myself in derogatory ways and would be the first to be unkind to myself,\u0027 Depp said.\u0027Not only did I not kick, or punch Ms Heard at any time. Calling myself savage is certainly not to the effect that you suggest. So I disagree with your dissection of this text.\u0027Depp described himself as \u0027sick\u0027 while infamous footage of him presenting an awards ceremony while under the influence of drugs was played to the court.He denied being drunk in the viral clip of him onstage hosting the Hollywood Film Awards in 2014.Asked about his slurred speech and shambolic appearance, Depp said he had been withdrawing from a \u0027very unpleasant medication.\u0027He said: \u0027I was not drinking.\u0027I don\u0027t feel ashamed of that moment because that\u0027s a sickly man, a drug addict who is coming off a very unpleasant medication and I was not prepared to go out and give that awards show however because they had asked me and it was my duty to do so I carried it through. It was a horrific mistake.\u0027I was under the influence of many many medications.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Facebook considering ban political ads days leading U S election","story":"Share this articleBloomberg - Are you a robot?Facebook Fails to Appease Organizers of Ad Boycott - The New York Times"},{"url":null,"title":"Air pollution 30 pre lockdown levels London major UK cities","story":"Share this articleUK air pollution still down despite return to normal traffic – study | Environment | The GuardianAir pollution lower than normal in cities because vehicles are idling less in queues | News | The Times"},{"url":null,"title":"US couple trapped B B 100 days lockdown coming Yorkshire buy flat caps","story":"Share this articleAmerican couple trapped in Skipton bed and breakfast for 100 days during lockdown after coming to Yorkshire to buy flat caps | Yorkshire Post"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/074bf41e4e9ce306f8eabb6fd3cf914db463c49c/0_126_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6cf3472be2aad3b7315fd641eb2e1d59 660w","title":"charlie kaufman making people laugh makes me feel validated as a human","story":"The screenwriter behind Being John Malkovich, Adaptation and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind has written a novel - about a film critic who hates Charlie KaufmanWhen Charlie Kaufman was seven years old, he knew what he wanted to be when he grew up. He knows because he went as far as to write it down. “Actor, doctor or fireman,” he says, and laughs. He ended up being, at least briefly, one of those things – but he’s best known as the screenwriter andor director of some of the trippiest and most metafictional films in recent history: Being John Malkovich, Adaptation, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Synecdoche, New York.Now, with the publication of his first novel, Antkind, he’s also the author of a trippy and metafictional book. This isn’t some sort of Hollywood big-name vanity project of the sort on which Sean Penn lately came unstuck: Kaufman wrote the book, he says, because he couldn’t get work in the movies. “I got the contract to write it in 2012,” he says. “The movie and TV business wasn’t really working out for me at the time.”What? The Bafta and Oscar-winning Charlie Kaufman? The guy whose directorial debut was described by Roger Ebert as the best movie of the decade? The neurotic screenwriter “Charlie Kaufman” as adorably characterised by Charlie Kaufman in Charlie Kaufman films? That Charlie Kaufman?“My films don’t make money,” he says. “In 2008, the first movie that I directed, Synecdoche, New York, came out, and it lost money. And at that time the movie industry, coincidentally, fell apart because of the economic crisis and studios stopped making movies and started making superhero franchise things. The sort of mid-budget movie that I’ve been working on, there was no outlet for it any more. It just didn’t exist.”He’s not the sort of writer who could suck it up and make an Iron Man flick as the cost of making his passion projects possible? “I thought about it,” he admits. “But I’ve never gone past thinking about it. I don’t think I could get that kind of job. No one would hire me for that. And if they did hire me for that, I think probably I would end up giving them something that they didn’t think was usable, because my mind doesn’t work that way.”When we talk, Kaufman is in a fairly Charlie Kaufmanish situation. He’s alone in lockdown on the west side of Manhattan (his wife and child, for reasons he won’t go into, are back on the west coast): “I’m sort of stuck in a sublet apartment in New York. I don’t know where I’m going to end up, but it’s not my place, not my things. Not my books, you know, not my bed. I spend almost all my time in this place because, you know, there’s nowhere to go and I’m very anxious about getting ill.” And he’s writing – what else? – a script about a virus.His novel, too, is an extremely Charlie Kaufmanish proposition. It begins with a description of the discovery of the real-life “St Augustine Monster” – an unidentifiable mass of organic material, or “globster”, washed up on a beach in Florida in 1896. It then takes 700-odd pages to tell the story of B Rosenberger Rosenberg, a bald, lavishly bearded and very thwarted film critic who, relatively early on, encounters an eccentric elderly man called Ingo Cutbirth. Ingo has spent the whole of his long life making a stop-motion puppet movie with a running time of three months. But Ingo abruptly dies of old age, and his masterpiece is destroyed in a fire leaving only one frame – from which B now hopes to reconstruct the film with the aid of a succession of hypnotists.Then it gets properly strange. B is shrinking. He ends up sleeping in his psychiatrist’s sock drawer. He constantly falls into manholes. He has his nose reconstructed against his wishes. He spends a great deal of time in hypnotic or hallucinatory or comatose states, and reconstructs a number of different versions of the movie. He has an unsuccessful career in shoe retail. A meteorologist (or “meaty-horologist”) discovers a means of predicting the future. We spend time with a fictional 1940s comedy duo called Mudd and Molloy, who survive a murder attempt by Abbott and Costello. A war is fought between the Slammy’s burger chain and an army of android versions of President Donald Trunk (sic). The Block Theory of the universe, the Kentucky Meat Shower, time-travelling clones and clown fetishism also feature. And that’s before we get to the hyper-intelligent far-future ant who may or may not have accidentally invented a virus that travels backwards in time.The way Kaufman describes the process, the novel sort of grew and mutated as it went. The germ of it, he says, was that “I wanted to deal with time travel in many different forms – all of them mutually exclusive.” It reads, sometimes but not always in a good way, like the work of someone who has spent an awful lot of time with John Kennedy Toole and Thomas Pynchon (and we’re talking the Pynchon of Against the Day rather than the Pynchon of Inherent Vice) with, in the chimerical-movies department, perhaps a glancing acquaintance with Mark Z Danielewski’s House of Leaves and David Foster Wallace’s Infinite Jest.Did his editor, I ask as tactfully as I can, not say words to the effect of: “What the hell?” Apparently not. “He was open to ... he liked the book.” He told Kaufman that a 900-pager (the manuscript was longer) would be a hard sell, so Kaufman cut it back as far as he could without compromising it – “I think they wanted it to be 500 pages” – and the editor pronounced himself satisfied: “Actually, at that point, having read it again. I think he felt like he understood it better.”The book is stuffed to its mad gunwales with gags and ideas and scattershot erudition, and my strong hunch is that readers will find it ... challenging. But if anything, its comic sensibility is what will pull them through. Kaufman says that looking for the funny has been a constant in his work since he played a rooster in a school play at the age of 10. “I was a very shy kid, but somehow I managed to make my way into this production,” he says, “I played a character who was funny and I got laughs from the audience – and I was just hooked. “Being funny and having people laugh makes me feel validated as a human. And it’s very black and white in my estimation. If you write a scene in a movie and people laugh in the audience, it’s worked.”The book’s intellectual range of reference – from phenomenology to Jungian psychology to quantum physics to Beckett and Pirandello – is dizzying. Kaufman says that he “read a bunch of popular physics books when I was young ... but I was frustrated because I didn’t have the mathematical background to do the actual reading so it was all in translation – but I loved it. I love things that make me think about the universe in a way that is different from my perception of it. It’s very helpful in my work and in my life – it takes me out of myself. It makes my frame of reference larger and more complex than my concerns with my own issues.”That willingness to pull focus makes Kaufman an intellectual pleasure but, it should be said, a slightly frustrating interviewee. He is scrupulously genial and polite, and happy to talk about theories of spacetime, but extremely reluctant to say anything on the record about the book’s more sublunary themes and ideas.For instance, B is a sort of parodic extreme of film-nerdery – forever drawing up top-10 lists consisting of ultra-obscure experimental foreign-language films and inveighing against rival critics. Do critics bug Kaufman? “I’m interested in film criticism, and I’m certainly interested in film critics who have been very hostile to my work,” he says, “And this was an opportunity to do something that I don’t get to do – which is respond. But ... that sort of fell by the wayside. It isn’t what interests me any more about the book … That’s just kind of like a vestige of some sort.”Vestige or not, B really really hates Charlie Kaufman (“Kaufman is a monster, plain and simple ... Kaufman is Godzilla with dentures, Halloween’s Mike Myers with a rubber knife, Pennywise the Clown with contact dermatitis from living in a sewer”) and really loves Judd Apatow – the only mainstream director who ever appears in his lists of great works.This Apatow thing is hard to read. Is he a great friend of Kaufman and B’s enthusiasm for his work an affectionate in-joke? Or is it chosen because Apatow – as seems equally possible – represents everything Kaufman detests about modern cinema? “I’m not in a position to explain B or what he’s thinking,” he says primly. “It is what it is. You can take from it what you want. I’m not gonna comment one way or the other.” All right then: do you like Judd Apatow’s work yourself? “I don’t think that’s relevant,” he says, and then with a gentle note of reproach: “I feel like you’re asking the same question in a different way.” Then there are the cultural politics of the book. B thinks of himself as progressive – a slightly wearisome running gag has him using “thon” as a pronoun – while at the same time being heroically crass (he prides himself on his girlfriend’s African American identity no less than he vaunts himself on having gone to Harvard). The pronouns issue is a particularly hot topic. Was Kaufman worried that it would look as if he was making fun of trans rights? “Oh, yeah. I’m worried about everything. You know, always worried about everything but it is what it is.” Well, OK, does he feel that some people who are punctilious about being politically correct in their language are covering up some rather more unworthy things?“I’ve made a practice throughout my career of not explaining my intent,” he says. “I feel like, I mean, I feel like it’s irrelevant. I’m not writing an essay about race relations or virtue signalling, I’m writing a novel, and I have a character in it, and the character has this personality. And that’s the book.” I venture that this character is kind of unlikeable. Kaufman declines to address the question. “I don’t think in those terms,” he says. “I tend never to care if a character’s likeable. It doesn’t interest me as an idea.”To be fair to Kaufman, the novel’s central preoccupations are a lot more abstract than that line of questioning would suggest in any case. Like his films, it gleefully unravels any sense of a stable reality. “That which the mind creates,” one character in it declares, “is also real.” Perhaps there’s even a timeline in the quantum universe where Charlie Kaufman is a fireman.I mention Michael Pollan’s recent book on psychedelics, and Kaufman expresses interest but says he’s never had much truck with drugs himself: “Mushrooms a couple of times when I was young ... I couldn’t do LSD. It scared me too much.“Part of it for me may just be that I always try to think past the original idea,” he says. “So that if I have, for example, a portal into John Malkovich in a story, then I have to think of all the iterations of that, and I come to: what if John Malkovich goes into his own portal? This thing that people say is my style ... is just the way my brain works. I do have an OCD kind of quality to my thinking.”Does he feel as though reality, then, is a stranger and more fragile thing than most people imagine?“Jesus yes!” he yelps.• Antkind is published by 4th Estate (RRP £18.99).

The I Saw It First business was set up by Jalal Kamani, 60, who jointly founded Boohoo with his brother Mahmud, 55.The public filings raise further questions of Boohoo after a report in the Sunday Times that claimed staff at one of the fashion company’s suppliers were paid less than minimum wage and did not have masks to protect against coronavirus. An undercover reporter working at the Morefray factory was told to expect pay of £3.50 an hour, compared with the national minimum wage of £8.72 for over-25s.Boohoo launched an urgent investigation into its supply chain this week, saying conditions at the Leicester warehouse were “totally unacceptable and fall woefully short of any standards acceptable in any workplace”.The company added that it was trying to identify the company at the centre of the allegations. After being approached by the , Boohoo confirmed that the supplier was Morefray, Filings also show that Irshad became the owner of I5 Holdings on 10 June, when he took control from Zogan Limited, a company that shares three current or former directors with I Saw It First, including Irshad himself. One of Zogan’s directors describes themselves on professional social media network LinkedIn as “head of tax” at Kamani Group. Jalal Kamani is a co-director of several other companies with Irshad and other directors of Zogan.A spokesman for I Saw It First said: “I5 Holdings Limited owns a non-controlling shareholding in Morefray Limited.” The spokesman declined to answer further questions about the company. Someone who answered a telephone number for Morefray declined to comment.A Boohoo spokesman confirmed that Morefray was the Boohoo supplier at the centre of the allegations but said that Mahmud Kamani had no involvement in the business.“Morefray is a recognised supplier to Boohoo and we have never previously been aware of any allegations of paying below the minimum wage until the media report,” said Boohoo. “As a result of that report and subsequent discovery that it was Morefray and not the company in the media report, we are immediately visiting the Morefray site to investigate further.”On Wednesday, Boohoo announced an independent review of its UK supply chain. The review, led by Alison Levitt QC, will be accompanied by a £10m investment in “eradicating malpractice” in its supply chain."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b13ff5ff40d87bbce08f7a52eebf846b6f259227/0_198_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ff1d56bb68e144b9b4713bb597c7803f","title":"pub landlords livid lack of support rishi sunak","story":"Publicans fear for future as chancellor’s proposals offer nothing for traditional localsThe landlady of the Old Millwrights Arms in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, is livid with the chancellor.“If I was Rishi Sunak and I wanted to design something that got rid of community boozers and replaced them with large chains, I would have written that statement,” said Liz Hind, shortly after the chancellor unveiled a multibillion-pound support package for the hospitality industry.The former Labour parliamentary candidate may not be the most surprising critic of a Conservative chancellor but she is far from a lone voice.While the measures offer much-needed financial respite for restaurants and gastropubs, the exclusion of alcohol from either scheme has left many publicans worried.Since pubs reopened in England on 4 July, trade has been dismal in Whitby, a seaside town starved of its usual flow of tourists enjoying the North York Moors, fish and chips or its associations with Bram Stoker’s Dracula. A VAT cut on food is no help at all, the publicans complain.“It’s a slap in the face,” said Richard Nattriss, who runs the Little Angel. “We don’t do food, we’re an award-wining cask ale pub. It just helps all the big chains. The Wetherspoons pubs will be fine because that’s the way the government have arranged it.“It’s the good old community pubs where you go in for a drink and a natter that will suffer.”It’s a view backed by the British Beer \u0026amp Pub Association (BBPA), the Society of Independent Brewers and major chains such as Greene King and Admiral Taverns.At the same time, costs have risen significantly due to the need for enhanced cleaning regimens and extra staff to provide table service and monitor social distancing.“I’ve got less than half the customers but just as much work,” says Hind. She points out that the pubs that stand to gain most from the chancellor’s VAT cut – chain venues with large floorspace and a broad food offering – were already more resilient to industry decline. They are also far better placed to cope with a post-pandemic world, she said.“Traditional pubs, village pubs and those built 100 years ago, they’re designed to have little areas, with your lounge bar and your snug bar,” she said. “So trying to get tables in that are separated with a screen in place, it’s really difficult.”With footfall down and costs up, a VAT cut on alcohol would have gone a long way to easing the burden, as pubs fear not being able to pay rent.Thousands rent their premises from major pub companies (pubcos) under the “beer tie” – an arcane and often controversial arrangement that many publicans complain exploits them, funnelling profit into the pockets of big business.While some pubcos agreed to waive or reduce rents to reflect earnings, many simply deferred the payments. Some are now preparing to restore rent bills to normal levels, even though trade is a fraction of what it once was.The BBPA, whose members include the influential pubcos, said it has asked the chancellor for rent support. But publicans, many already in debt, hold out little hope.“It’s becoming difficult to deny that this government either doesn’t understand the public house situation or just doesn’t like pubs,” said Mountford. “A lot were already failing before this crisis occurred. To ignore them, by not providing any support, then providing support to their competitors, just seems completely and utterly bizarre.”Behind the bar at the Little Angel, Nattriss is concerned about the future of not just his establishment but the entire industry."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4268e54350362ed3d569b02b7e9ad49373da635c/0_482_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=583167278fca58ee98acc42c811ff62f","title":"i was a foreign student kicking them out is shortsighted and cruel","story":"Sending international students home during the pandemic will do lasting harm, not least to America’s reputationI came to the United States as an international student in August 2002, a month short of the first anniversary of 911. I came from and to privilege: I was fully funded and had family in the States. Most importantly, even as the Bush administration tightened scrutiny of international students, I arrived to a welcoming place and people, and have loved being here ever since.Even so, an announcement like the one from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) requiring international students to leave the US if their campuses went fully online would have chilled me to the core. There was no pandemic back then, but my closest family was already in the US, and I had no source of income in my home country. I was lucky with help from my family, I could have covered the costs of travel and broken leases. But at that time before the internet, I would have effectively been cut off from my program of study. Most importantly, I would have missed out on the fundamental experience of being, physically and mentally, in the United States.Both academia and the US are difficult places in which to find a home. Both can be fixed in their ways, hostile and narrow-minded. But being an international student was and remains a way of discovering what is good about America, the land and its people. Many of us come here because American universities remain some of the best ambassadors the US has. Studying in America is something to aspire to and be proud of, and around the world it makes people think kindly of our country: not only the students, but also their families, friends and employers.Some, like me, stay and make this place our home. We do this for many reasons, but whatever motivates us, we repay the years American institutions have invested in us here, rather than our home countries. We pay taxes, raise children and teach future generations of students. We build businesses, and when we become citizens, we vote and do all the things regular Americans do – because that’s what we are. And we continue to think and speak well of this place we made our home, to ourselves and to those we left behind.Education, at all levels, is a space uniquely devoted to kindness. It is rooted in the belief that one can get there from here, that people can learn and grow and thrive, and that all the students in the room are worth investing in. This is why education is so often at the root of the pursuit of happiness, and the American university is part of why people come here to seek it.Sending international students back home during a global pandemic, by contrast, is cruel. It demands that these young people choose between risking their lives or risking their education. And even that is no choice at all. The pandemic has restricted flights, and the US’s hotspot status means that even returning citizens are not always welcome in their home countries. Travel means increased exposure in transit and for those back home.Universities and academics are moving rapidly to challenge the decision, and so should we all. Not just because of the many benefits international students bring, but because sending them away is a betrayal of the contract of education: it declares, loudly and clearly, that some people are not worth investing in. And what does it say about us when we are sending away some of the rest of the world’s best students?American higher education is already in crisis. Tearing away at its international reputation will do lasting harm, not only to American universities, but to America’s reputation in the world, a reputation that is already suffering. I fear that the world will soon decide that we are the ones not worth the investment, and, worse, that they won’t be wrong.There will be a time after Covid-19. When that time comes, I, for one, want my campus to remain the globally vibrant place it was before the pandemic started. Let’s keep our international students where they belong – right here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ef128cd464f6c90bc67eb546110956ee27c0c27/0_0_3789_2274/master/3789.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02a4ef518058e687d5f8de324983cbb1","title":"let a jury decide what content should appear on social media","story":"As we can’t trust the bosses of the digital giants, why not ask ordinary people to evaluate ads? One of the most instructive experiences of my life was serving as a juror in a criminal trial. When the summons to report for jury service arrived, though, I was anything but enthusiastic. I was bringing up two young children on my own at the time and the last thing I needed was to be locked down for an unknown number of days. So I headed into the crown court feeling pretty glum.The trial was a serious one: the charge was of causing grievous bodily harm with intent. It went on for two weeks. A number of witnesses gave evidence, much of which seemed (to me) unconvincing, sometimes contradictory, occasionally horrifying. We learned more about what goes on at night in an economically depressed East Anglian town than is good for anyone. And then, when the lawyers and the judge had summed up, we retired to reach a verdict.What happened next was remarkable. My fellow jurors, chosen – as I was – at random, were all “ordinary” citizens: none of us had any legal training or knowledge. But the process that unfolded in the room was deeply impressive: 12 people, confronted with a morass of contradictory evidence, quietly sorted through it, identified the one witness who seemed to all of us to be the most credible, and unanimously reached a verdict: guilty. Only later did we discover that the defendant had a set of previous convictions for violent assault – knowledge that had properly been withheld from us during the trial.The jury system isn’t perfect no system is. And juries sometimes make mistakes or are misled. But it’s no accident that law-abiding societies have for a long time used juries as a way of deciding whether someone is guilty or innocent. “In the court system,” writes the eminent Harvard legal scholar Prof Jonathan Zittrain, “legislators write laws, and lawyers argue cases, but juries of ordinary people are typically the finders of fact and judges of what counts as ‘reasonable’ behaviour. This is less because a group of people plucked from the phone book is the best way to ascertain truth – after all, we don’t use that kind of group for any other fact-finding. Rather, it’s because, when done honourably, with duties taken seriously, deliberation by juries lends legitimacy and credibility to the machinations of the legal system.”This quote comes from an essay in which Zittrain wrestles with two of the most pressing problems of the digital age: what kinds of content should be allowed (and disallowed) on social media platforms? And who should make those decisions? At the moment, we have no good answers to either question, so decisions are left to the bosses of those platforms via their shifting terms and conditions, their legal obligations in different jurisdictions (eg, Germany, China, Saudi Arabia, India), the incentives to permissiveness implicit in their business models and lust for growth, and their lack of transparency and accountability.The result is a chaotic vacuum at a critical time for democracies grappling with acute polarisation, a looming presidential election and what will be an epic post-pandemic economic depression. Small wonder, then, that legislators in the US and elsewhere are beginning to think about pulling the internet kill-switch buried in Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act – the crucial clause that grants internet companies immunity from liability for the content posted by their users. If that section were repealed – and Joe Biden, for one, has said that he thinks it should be – then the business model of Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and a host of other smaller companies would become toast overnight.But even those of us who abhor these platforms should be careful what we wish for. As Anna Wiener writes, in the New Yorker: “Without Section 230, only platforms with the resources for constant litigation would survive even there, user-generated content would be heavily restricted in service of diminished liability. Social media startups might fade away, along with niche political sites, birding message boards, classifieds, restaurant reviews, support-group forums and comments sections.” What we might wind up with is “a desiccated, sanitised, corporate internet – less like an electronic frontier than a well-patrolled office park”.Original? Definitely. Utopian? Maybe. But then I expect that the idea of asking a dozen average folks to decide guilt or innocence once seemed utopian too.Panic attackThere’s an intriguing academic article, The Sisyphean cycle of technology panics, by Amy Orben in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science.Virtually perfectZoom is great for virtual meetings, but if you want to use it for seminars you really need to know what you’re doing.

Not Charlize Theron, evidently. Playing immortal warrior Andy, leader of a covert band of unkillable mercenaries, Theron spends almost as much time battling many centuries worth of accumulated angst as she does slicing and dicing entire battalions of attackers. Armed with ennui and an ancient axe, Theron brings layers of complexity to a role that is otherwise largely defined through exemplary fight choreography.Gina Prince-Bythewood’s crisp, efficient direction of this adaptation of an action-fantasy comic-book series by Greg Rucka serves the physical element of the performances well. A fight on a rattling cargo plane between Theron and KiKi Layne (playing Nile, a reluctant new recruit to the immortal club) is a blast. Even Andy cracks a smile at one point. “She stabbed me,” Theron’s character later tells her right-hand man, Booker (Matthias Schoenaerts). “I think she has potential.”Where the film is less well supported is in the screenplay, which Rucka himself adapted, and which gets bogged down in some decidedly muddy character motivation at a crucial point. Equally tone deaf is a score that sidesteps the timelessness of the central characters, feeling more disposable than eternal. Still, there’s plenty to enjoy, not least Layne’s terrific turn as the newbie with a fresh take on forever.

They cross so many borders that their food repertoire becomes vast, seasoned with the intonations of many cultures. These dishes are the bonny love-children of those blended borders – African ingredients overlaid with warm Arabic spices and Indian culinary traditions. They pay tribute to migrants who learned to reconcile the old and new with grace, who preserved memories while learning to let go, who carved a place for themselves in their new nations and expressed their contentment with food.This iconic dish is eaten all over Kenya. Its roots are in coastal Mombasa, a port on the Indian Ocean where many immigrants arrived (of which my own grandfather was one in the 1940s). Every family has its own version – the spices can differ and some may not include tomatoes – but they all share coconut milk. In my version, I smoke it at the end to recreate the memory of cooking it over an outdoor stove.1 tbsp ghee1 red onion, peeled and finely chopped1 thumb ginger, peeled and finely grated4 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed2 green chillies, finely chopped1 tsp ground turmeric100g chopped tinned tomatoes6 chicken drumsticks400ml coconut milkJuice of 1 limeSea salt1 piece lump charcoal (optional)2 hard-boiled eggs, peeled and cut in half, to serve1 small handful chopped coriander, to serveFor the masala2 tbsp coriander seeds2 tbsp cumin seeds1 tbsp fennel seeds1 dried red chilli1 tsp green cardamom pods¼ tsp cloves1 star anise1 tsp black peppercorns1 cinnamon stick1 tsp hot paprika1 tsp ground ginger¼ nutmeg, finely gratedBegin by making the masala. Heat a dry frying pan over a medium heat and toast all the whole spices until they are aromatic, stirring frequently and being careful not to scorch them. Pop the spices into a spice grinder and whizz to a fine powder, then stir in the paprika, ground ginger and nutmeg.Put the ghee in a large frying pan over a low heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 20 minutes, or until dark and caramelised, then add the ginger, garlic and chillies and fry until fragrant.Next, add two tablespoons of the masala and the turmeric, and cook for a few minutes, until your kitchen is full of the fragrance of the spices. Now tip in the tomatoes and season with salt.Cook for 10 minutes, then add the chicken and coconut milk. Mix well, then cover and simmer for 25 minutes, or until the chicken is tender and toothsome. Squeeze in the lime juice and season with salt to taste.If you want to smoke the dish, sit the piece of charcoal directly on a gas burner or barbecue, letting it catch light and burn. When it is smouldering and grey, carefully transfer it with tongs to a small, heatproof bowl. Nestle the bowl inside the pan with the chicken and drizzle a little oil over the charcoal – it will start smoking immediately. Cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid and leave to smoke for half an hour.Serve the kuku paka topped with hard-boiled egg halves and scattered with chopped coriander.Thai curries do not have to be searingly hot, such as the mild massaman, traditionally belonging to the Thai Muslim community. It is generally made with beef or lamb, but is equally good with pork, chicken or robust vegetables like pumpkin. This one always tastes even better the next day, so I tend to make it a day in advance.

Pour the oil into the frying pan, add the shallots and garlic and fry until caramelised, then add the shrimp paste and the ground spices and fry, stirring constantly, until fragrant. Tip the contents of the frying pan into a food processor, add the coconut milk, lemongrass and ginger and blend to a smooth paste.In a large frying pan, fry the pork in the coconut oil with the star anise, cardamom pods, curry leaves and cinnamon stick until the meat is lightly sealed. Add the coconut milk, then fill the empty tin with water and add that to the pan as well, along with the curry paste. Bring to a simmer, cover and cook for one and a half hours, or until the pork is butter-soft.Meanwhile, make the relish. Put the pineapple in a bowl. Put the jaggery into a small pan with 100ml water and stir over medium heat until the jaggery dissolves, then bring to the boil and simmer for two minutes, or until syrupy. Remove from the heat and leave to cool completely.If you are using basil seeds, put them into a small bowl and soak in just enough water to cover for 10 minutes – they will puff up. Pour the cooled syrup over the pineapple, then follow with the soaked basil seeds, if using, and the remaining ingredients except the mint and coriander. Refrigerate until needed. Just before serving, toss through the herbs.Add the potatoes, shallots, fish sauce, tamarind concentrate and palm sugar to the curry and simmer, uncovered, for 30 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender, then stir through the peanuts. Garnish with Thai basil leaves and serve with the pineapple relish.In east Africa, this is served both as part of a main meal with rice or chapatis, or on its own as a snack. The original uses crushed peanuts, but I use peanut butter to make a thick, funky, creamy sauce spiced with aromatics such as star anise and curry leaves. Always look out for unsweetened peanut butter.5 corn on the cob, 1 left whole, and the rest cut crossways into 4 chunks2 tbsp rapeseed oil1 tsp brown mustard seedsA pinch of asafoetida20 curry leaves1 cinnamon stick1 star anise1 thumb ginger, peeled and finely grated4 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped1 red chilli, thinly sliced200g tinned tomatoes1 heaped tbsp tomato puree3 tbsp smooth peanut butter2 tbsp tamarind concentrate1 tbsp soft brown sugarSea salt1 handful each toasted desiccated coconut and coriander leaves, to serveHeat a grill to medium and toast the whole corn cob, turning it frequently so it chars all over.

Add the mustard seeds and, when they pop, follow swiftly with the asafoetida, curry leaves, cinnamon and star anise, and fry briefly. Turn the heat down to low, add the ginger, garlic and chilli and cook until fragrant.Stir in the tomatoes, tomato puree, peanut butter, tamarind and sugar, and cook foreight to 10 minutes, stirring every so often, until you have a sauce that’s thick enough to cling to the sweetcorn. Add salt to taste.Throw in the sweetcorn chunks and stir to coat thoroughly. Finish with the coconut, coriander and reserved sweetcorn kernels.Rendang is an aromatic, dry, braised curry from Malaysia. It is normally made with tough cuts of beef that require lengthy cooking, but I like to use duck legs, which also become luscious with a long, slow braise. The duck is first seared to render any excess fat, then simmered for hours in a lip-tingling, chilli-spiced, coconut sauce that turns the meat into a meltingly tender, flavourful sludge. Serve with steamed rice.4 duck legs400ml coconut milk3 tsp palm sugar, or to taste2 tbsp fish sauceJuice of 1 limeFor the curry paste15 dried kashmiri chillies15 dried bird’s eye chillies1 red onion, peeled and roughly chopped50g ginger, peeled and roughly chopped25g galangal, roughly chopped4 fat garlic cloves, peeled and roughly chopped2 stalks lemongrass, roughly chopped8g fresh turmeric, peeled and roughly chopped3 tsp shrimp paste2 tbsp rapeseed oilFirst, make the curry paste.

Process to a coarse paste.Heat a large, deep non-stick frying pan over medium–high heat. Add the duck legs, skin side down, and fry, without turning, until the fat renders and the skin is golden brown – two to four minutes.Set the duck legs aside, reserving a tablespoon of the fat in the pan. Add the curry paste and fry over a medium heat, stirring constantly, until the colour deepens and the onion becomes fragrant – it will take around 10 minutes to cook out the rawness and to tease out all the flavours.Add the coconut milk and 375ml water and bring to a simmer. Add the duck legs, return to a simmer, reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer gently for one and a half hours, stirring occasionally, until the duck is very tender and the sauce is thick and deepened in colour.Finally, add the palm sugar to the sauce, stirring to make sure it all dissolves, then stir in the fish sauce and lime juice.• This is an edited extract from Jikoni, by Ravinder Bhogal, published by Bloomsbury at £26.

It’s not that the chickpea is any better than its classmates, but, assuming the role of teacher’s pet, it is eager enough constantly to want to please. Its enthusiasm means it gets along with any personality – from fierce chilli to the outwardly funky parmesan – moulding itself unto their own qualities. Here, I’ve used the chickpea in its many forms – dried, tinned and floured – to showcase just how adaptable and malleable this magic bean truly is.These have won the hearts of many, and for good reason – cooking them in the oil without added liquid makes them go super-soft, allowing the dish’s pungent flavours to release into the oil. The best part, though, is that you throw everything into a pan and pop it in the oven, leaving it to its own devices. Use a non-dairy yoghurt to make this dish vegan. 2 x 400g tins chickpeas, drained (480g net weight)11 garlic cloves, peeled, 10 left whole and 1 crushed30g piece fresh ginger, peeled and cut into julienne strips300g cherry or datterini tomatoes3 red chillies, mild or spicy, to taste, slit open lengthways1 tbsp tomato paste2 tsp each cumin and coriander seeds, roughly crushed in a mortar½ tsp ground turmeric½ tsp chilli flakes2 tsp red Kashmiri chilli powder, or paprika1 tsp caster sugar200ml olive oilSalt8 tbsp (15g) mint leaves8 tbsp (30g) coriander leaves, roughly chopped180g Greek-style yoghurt2-3 limes – 1 juiced, to get 1 tbsp, the rest cut into wedges, to serve4 pita breads (or other flatbread), to serve (optional)Heat the oven to 170C (150C fan)325Fgas 3. Put the chickpeas, whole garlic cloves, ginger, tomatoes, chillies, tomato paste, spices, sugar, oil and a teaspoon of salt in a large, ovenproof saute pan for which you have a lid, then stir to combine. Cover, put in the oven and cook for 75 minutes, stirring once halfway, until the aromatics have softened and the tomatoes have broken down.Meanwhile, make the yoghurt dressing. Put the mint, coriander, yoghurt, lime juice, crushed garlic and a quarter-teaspoon of salt in the small bowl of a food processor and blitz smooth.Serve the chickpeas directly from the pan (or transfer them to a shallow serving platter), with the yoghurt and lime wedges in two separate bowls alongside, with warm pitta or flatbread, if you wish.I use chickpeas three ways here: cooked chickpeas, chickpea water (aquafaba), and chickpea (gram) flour. Save on time, if you like, by using regular shop-bought mayo or yoghurt, although the chickpea mayo really is very special. If you can’t find chaat masala, which gives these fries a distinctly sour flavour, use garam masala or, indeed, any other spice you have to hand.

Bring to a simmer, then turn the heat to low. Stir the gram flour and polenta in a bowl to combine, then slowly pour into the water, whisking continuously to ensure there are no big lumps (there will still be a few small ones). Cook for four minutes, whisking vigorously, until the mixture thickens and starts to pull away from the sides of the pan, then quickly transfer to the prepared tin and smooth out the top with a spatula. Leave to cool for about 10 minutes, then cover and refrigerate for about 30 minutes, until set completely.Meanwhile, make the mayo. Set a sieve over a bowl and drain the tin of chickpeas. Separately measure out 50g chickpeas (save the rest for another use) and 40g of their water (discard the rest), then put in a food processor with the garlic, mustard, lemon juice and an eighth of a teaspoon of salt, and blitz smooth, scraping the sides every now and then as you go. With the motor running, very slowly drizzle in the sunflower oil, until the mixture comes together into a loose, mayonnaise-like consistency, then transfer to a small bowl (and refrigerate if you’re making this ahead of time).Use the paper lining to lift the chickpea mixture out of its tin and on to a board. Trim the edges slightly, to give you a neat rectangle, then cut lengthways into 12 1.5cm-thick slices. Now cut again widthways in half, to leave you you 24 pieces in total.Heat the sunflower oil in a medium saucepan on a medium-high heat. Once very hot, fry the chickpea pieces in about three batches for about five minutes a batch, until golden and crisp on the outside, using a slotted spoon to move them around a little as they cook. Transfer to a tray lined with absorbent paper while you cook the rest. Once all the pieces are cooked, sprinkle lightly with salt.Stir the coriander and chillies into the pickled onion bowl. To serve, pile the chickpea chips on to a plate and sprinkle all over with the remaining quarter-teaspoon of chaat masala. Spoon the onion mixture to one side, put the mayo bowl on the plate and serve warm.This is inspired by cacio e pepe, the Italian pasta dish coated in lavish amounts of butter, spicy black pepper and cheese. The pickled chillies help offset the super-rich pulses, but if you don’t want the extra heat, serve it with a squeeze of lemon juice instead. Start by soaking the chickpeas the day before.3 tbsp olive oil8 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed1-2 parmesan rinds (60g), plus 80g finely grated parmesan300g dried chickpeas, soaked overnight in plenty of water and 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda¼ tsp bicarbonate of sodaSalt and black pepper2 red chillies, thinly sliced into rounds, seeds and all2 tbsp apple cider vinegar250g baby spinach4 tbsp roughly chopped parsley100g unsalted, fridge-cold butter, cut into 2cm cubesHeat the oven to 180C (160C fan)350Fgas 4.Put two tablespoons of oil in a large, high-sided, ovenproof saute pan for which you have a lid, and place on a medium-high heat. Once hot, add the garlic and cook for about 90 seconds, until it’s fragrant and just starting to colour. Add the parmesan rinds, drained chickpeas, bicarb, 1.2 litres water and a very generous amount of coarsely cracked black pepper (give it about 40 grinds). Bring to a boil, skimming off any scum that rises to the surface as it does so, then cover and transfer to the oven for an hour and 15 minutes. Add three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt, and cook for another 30 minutes, until the chickpeas are very soft and the liquid has reduced by about half.While the chickpeas are baking, mix the chillies, vinegar and a small pinch of salt in a small bowl and set aside to pickle lightly.About 10 minutes before the chickpeas are ready, put the last tablespoon of oil tin a large frying pan on a medium-high heat and, once hot, add the spinach in batches with a quarter-teaspoon of salt and cook for about four minutes, until just wilted, then stir through the parsley.When the chickpeas are done, remove the lid and, while they’re still hot from the oven but not on any heat source, add a quarter of the butter cubes and about 15g grated parmesan, stirring until the butter has melted into the sauce. Repeat, adding a quarter more of the butter and 15g parmesan each time, until you’ve used up all the butter and 60g cheese. Finally, add another very generous grind of coarsely ground black pepper.The sauce will by now have thickened significantly and coated the chickpeas. Top with the spinach mixture, the pickled chillies and their liquid, and a final sprinkling of parmesan, and serve with extra parmesan on the side."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3404e41f55cd30dcff9218368f1d6a869179bc8e/0_59_5211_3127/master/5211.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=395788132910874ea1c497a83bdd5f72","title":"he was larger than life football world pays tribute to jack charlton","story":"Tributes to Jack Charlton have poured in from across the world of football after the World Cup winner and former Republic of Ireland manager died aged 85 on Friday.During his time in charge of Ireland, Charlton led the team to two World Cups and a European Championship, earning him legendary status in the country. The former defender was already a hero in England, having won the 1966 World Cup.The former Liverpool midfielder Ray Houghton, who was handed his Ireland debut in Charlton’s first match in 1986, told TalkSport: “He was a larger than life character. The word legend is used too much in football but not for Jack, for what he’s done domestically with Leeds, winning the World Cup, which he should have been knighted for, and the fact he did so well with Ireland.“He changed everything about Irish football because there was a stage where we hadn’t qualified for tournaments, we had some great players and very good managers but didn’t quite over the line. Jack came in and changed that mentality. His legacy within Ireland is absolutely huge.”Charlton managed Ireland for a decade, earning numerous famous victories. One of the most notable came when Houghton scored the winner against Italy at the 1994 World Cup.The former Ireland captain Paul McGrath, who played throughout Charlton’s tenure, tweeted: “Absolutely gutted. Father figure to me for 10 years, thanks for having faith in me. Sleep well Jack, Love ya. Thinking of Pat, John and Peter at this sad time. #thanksforthememories”The former Ireland striker John Aldridge tweeted: “Absolutely gutted that BIG JACK has passed away! What a football man. Loved and adored, specially in Ireland. The best manager I was lucky to play for. The times we had on and off the pitch was priceless! My thoughts are with Pat and the family! RIP my good friend. Never Forgotten!!”The Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjær, praised Charlton’s enthusiasm. “He was a legend of football, a gent, I watched Norway play Ireland at World Cup 94 but he was always so passionate when he was speaking and sad to hear.”Jason McAteer, who also played under Charlton for Ireland, tweeted: “Can’t speak … heart’s just broke. Love you Jack.”Charlton played every game at the 1966 World Cup, including the 4-2 victory over West Germany in the final. Geoff Hurst, who scored a hat-trick in that match, tweeted: “Another sad day for football. Jack was the type of player and person you need in a team to win a World Cup. He was a great and loveable character and he will be greatly missed. The world of football and the world beyond football has lost one of the greats. RIP old friend.”Boris Johnson also paid tribute. The British prime minister tweeted: “Jack Charlton was a football great whose achievements brought happiness to so many. My sympathies are with his family and friends.”Meanwhile the Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, wrote: “Very sad to hear that World Cup winner Jack Charlton has died. A true one club @LUFC player and a giant of English and Irish football.”Ireland’s Taoiseach, Micheál Martin, said: “So saddened to hear of the passing of Jack Charlton who brought such honesty and joy to the football world. He personified a golden era in Irish football – the Italia 90 campaign being one of pure joy for the nation. He gave us magical memories. Thank you Jack.”The Premier League will hold a minute’s silence before this weekend’s matches and players will wear black armbands as a mark for respect for the former Leeds United defender."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef98c4fac267d80defd75f54f070e1688d9f8cf8/0_50_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e842ec11996f75abfda59fd2ea5772f8","title":"liverpool burnley premier league match report","story":"The results machine, as Jürgen Klopp described Burnley, has churned over Liverpool’s hopes of polishing a pristine Premier League campaign with a flawless Anfield record. Sean Dyche’s team became the first visitors since Leicester in January 2019 to prevent Liverpool winning at home in the league thanks to an immaculate finish from Jay Rodriguez and commanding display from goalkeeper Nick Pope.The contest was fiercely and refreshingly competitive from the start. Liverpool dominated until the first drinks break, switching play superbly and combining sharply in search of a breakthrough. Burnley, their resources stretched to the extent that left-back Erik Pieters was again stationed on the right of midfield, fought tirelessly to resist the pressure with goalkeeper Pope to the fore. Dyche’s two tight banks of four also tested the patience of the champions, who started with two academy products in Neco Williams and Curtis Jones.Klopp cited the need for fresh legs as reason for the youngsters’ inclusion but it was also a smart psychological move by the manager to start Williams in his favoured right-back role. The 19-year-old struggled as a makeshift left-back at Brighton in midweek, when he was withdrawn at half-time, and the recall served as a timely show of faith. Both Williams and Jones repaid their manager’s confidence. The young midfielder’s ability to find space and time his runs into the penalty area were a key feature of Liverpool’s early dominance. But for Pope, Klopp’s side would have established a commanding lead and Mohamed Salah would have reached his latest Liverpool milestone by the interval.The Egypt international requires one more goal to become the first Liverpool player since Roger Hunt in 1965-66 to score 20 league goals in three successive seasons for the club. Hunt’s World Cup winning teammate, the late Jack Charlton, was remembered with a minute’s silence before kick off. Salah almost had it from Liverpool’s first incisive attack. Joe Gomez released Robertson with a glorious cross-field pass and only a perfectly-timed intervention from Kevin Long prevented Liverpool’s leading goalscorer converting at close range. Another Gomez delivery led to Salah’s first shot on target. Long’s headed clearance dropped to Salah, who exchanged passes with Roberto Firmino before volleying towards the top corner from 12 yards. Pope sprung to his left and clawed the ball to safety with an excellent save.Burnley’s keeper started the game leading Alisson 14 to 13 clean sheets in the race for the Golden Gloves award but a 15th always appeared a tall order at Anfield. Pope foiled Jones with a low save after Firmino dummied a Robertson cross. Jones was denied by Phil Bardsley following an outstanding one-touch move around the visitors’ penalty area and Pope thwarted Salah again when Sadio Mané released him through on goal. From Robertson’s resulting corner, however, the resistance was finally broken. Fabinho floated a delightful cross back into the area after Burnley dealt with the initial cross and Robertson, left unattended after his corner duties, ghosted in to send a header arching beyond Pope and inside the far post. It was a finish that any one of Liverpool’s world class forwards would have been proud of.The visitors had started to threaten by that stage, especially from set-pieces, and Rodriguez should have at least tested Alisson when Bardsley’s ball over the top caught the Liverpool defence square. The striker dragged his angled shot well wide, however.Pope produced another superb save on the stroke of half-time to beat away Mane’s powerful drive after the Senegal international had turned Long. Minutes after the restart the Burnley keeper was beaten by Firmino’s low finish but saved by the post. Jones could have put daylight between the teams when sent clear by Salah but blazed a left foot shot wide.It proved a costly miss when Burnley, without warning and while battling to stem the Liverpool tide, equalised with a fine Rodriguez goal. Bardsley sent a free-kick deep into the Liverpool box where James Tarkowski’s towering header fell invitingly for the forward. Rodriguez still had plenty to do with the ball spinning away from goal and Virgil van Dijk closing in, but he swept a clinical finish on the turn inside Alisson’s right-hand post. Klopp had made a double substitution as Liverpool prepared to defend the free-kick but nothing could detract from the quality of Rodriguez’s finish.Burnley substitute Gudmundsson should have ended Liverpool’s proud unbeaten home record with three minutes remaining when Alisson pawed Ashley Westwood’s cross into his path. Gudmundsson, who had escaped a risky challenge on Robertson inside his own area moments earlier, was unmarked on the penalty spot but smacked the crossbar with the Brazilian keeper beaten."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39fdc780757718d1e0170f3218e949765d930ca2/0_74_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=915b38ff1fe9afce4fcf14a49734b686","title":"norwich relegated premier league west ham match report","story":"Would Daniel Farke do it differently if he was allowed another go? Norwich’s manager has stuck to his principles all season, trusting in the players who won promotion last year and insisting on an expansive style, but it is not hard to feel that a touch more pragmatism would not have gone amiss in a scrap for survival.Weaknesses are ruthlessly exposed at this level and Norwich’s inability to cover up their flaws has been their undoing, dragging them back down to the Championship at the first time of asking.The defeat that sealed Norwich’s relegation summed them up. They defended abysmally, conceded soft goals from set-pieces and lacked conviction in the final third. Farke’s lightweight outfit looked broken and beaten throughout and succeeded only in delivering a masterclass in how not to handle Michail Antonio, whose four goals helped West Ham take a big step towards preserving their Premier League status with their first away win in nine matches.“I am sorry we were not able to work another miracle. No one expected us to win the title in the Championship. We were highly motivated to beat the odds. We can only apologise.”Farke spoke about injuries to key iniduals and expressed hope for the future, pointing out that Norwich have talented young players on long-term contracts.He sounded confident about their financial position and ready to fight again next year, saying that he has no desire to leave the club. “I have a long-term contract,” he said.Nonetheless it was striking to hear Farke describe Norwich’s seventh successive defeat as a case of “men against boys”.They were demolished by Antonio, who collected his first professional hat-trick after moving to six goals in his last four games, and West Ham cantered to their second 4-0 win since David Moyes replaced Manuel Pellegrini in December.Moyes was delighted with a first clean sheet in 15 matches after his side rose six points clear of the bottom three with three games left, having played one more than 18th-placed Bournemouth.There was a doomed air about Norwich and a straightforward change from Moyes lifted West Ham after their defeat by Burnley last Wednesday, the omission of Andriy Yarmolenko for Mark Noble giving the side more balance.Noble worked diligently with Declan Rice and Tomas Soucek in midfield, Jarrod Bowen was menacing after returning to the right flank and Norwich creaked at the back, escaping when Soucek clippedshot wide early on.Norwich’s feeble defence could not cope with Antonio. West Ham’s forward rattled his markers, Ben Godfrey and Timm Klose, and he had already forced a save from Tim Krul before giving the visitors the lead, meeting Issa Diop’s flick from Bowen’s corner with an emphatic right-footed volley from close range.Behind after 11 minutes, Norwich could have been forgiven for walking down the tunnel. They are the only team in Europe’s top five leagues not to have claimed a point after conceding first this season and even West Ham, who have dropped 24 points from winning positions this season, could not find a way to blow this lead.Noble, surprisingly playing at the highest point of midfield, was looking like a cockney Kevin De Bruyne. Bowen caused constant problems, arrowing two efforts wide, and West Ham saw another chance go begging when Krul denied Soucek.It was a brilliant save from Krul but the Norwich goalkeeper was powerless to stop West Ham doubling their lead just before half-time. Noble swung in a free-kick and Antonio glanced in an easy header.After 53 minutes Noble made another telling impact, lofting a clever pass through for Antonio. The 30-year-old raced clear and although Krul saved his first effort, he gobbled up the rebound with a looping header.West Ham attacked again and Antonio became the first player to score four goals in one game for West Ham since David Cross in 1981, tapping in a cross from Ryan Fredericks. “He’s been excellent because we’ve been without Seb Haller,” Moyes said. “Not many people score four in a Premier League match.”It was a grim march to the final whistle for Norwich. Farke sounded resigned before this game, admitting that his side were already down. The German just wanted his players to enjoy themselves. The problem, though, is that there is nothing fun about relegation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b280d4d0b99d8fcc07dcceb9ab60d06d43a2f417/0_137_4096_2458/master/4096.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf0d18fbfe1806b360dda067fa022534","title":"jack charlton a life in pictures","story":"World Cup winner Jack Charlton, who forged a successful career in management after hanging up his boots, has died aged 85.

Read on ...“That’s how they scored the goal. What Burnley did really well, they stayed completely in the game. They weren’t bothered about conceding chances minute after minute. They pretty much just did what they wanted to do. All respect for that, but on the other hand it’s frustrating, clearly. We should have scored much earlier.”Sean Dyche speaks: “It’d be pushing it a bit,” he tells BT Sport, when asked if it was game Burnley might have won. “They’ve had chances as they do here. They were terrific, especially in the first half. They stay and they press and they don’t give you a breather. We felt that if we could just stay in it, as we did just about until half-time, we might find moments in the second half. And we did.On Burnley’s improved second half performance: “It was a strange kind of game,” he says. “They had a lot of chances but there was a lot of ‘maybes’. We had that golden chance right at the end and we’ve created some really good chances today against a top side. Forget about the fact there’s nobody in here, this is still a very difficult place to come. On his half-time team talk: “I just reminded of them of the fact, don’t wait for 1-0 down football. A lot of teams relax a bit when they’re 1-0 down. It seems a strange thing to say but they kind of go ‘Let’s see what we can go and do’. So I just reminded them of that. It’s very difficult because we were never going to dominate the ball, but we’ve done well.” Nick Pope speaks: “We pushed on in the second half,” the Burnley goalkeeper tells suave and debonair BT Sport pitch-side reporter Dishy Des Kelly. “Really after they scored I thought we played really well. We created chances of our own and every set piece we looked dangerous, every ball in the box we looked dangerous. Unfortunately, it didn’t quite go in for us at the end. After the goal we started to press a bit higher and make chances. It nearly worked.”On his two outstanding first half saves: “It’s nice to be involved,” he says. “You come to big grounds like this you expect to be busy. Liverpool are Premier League champions for a reason so you’ve got to come here and be ready for action. I was fortunate enough to keep a couple out.”Peep! Peep! Peeeeeeeep! It’s all over at Anfield, where Burnley have got a well deserved point. Andy Robertson gave Liverpool the lead with a wonderful curled header, but several fine saves from Nick Pope kept Burnley in the game before Jay Rodriguez smashed home from the edge of the penalty area to earn his side a share of the spoils.90+2 min: Liverpool go forward, Virgil van Dijk picking out Trent Alexander-Arnold on the right flank with a wonderful pass from deep. He squares the ball for Mo Salah, who shoots straight at Nick Pope. Salah has missed several good chances today, which will be a source of great irritation for him in his quest for the golden boot. Off the top of my head, I think he’s two behind Leicester’s Jamie Vardy. 90 min: We’ll have four minutes of added time but will we get a winner? Burnley are edging it at the moment.89 min: Nick Pope is booked for time-wasting. Stop wasting time, Nick. 88 min: Phil Bardsley is booked after clattering through the back of Mo Salah. 88 min: Joey Gudmundsson smashes a shot off the bar after some pinball in the Liverpool penalty area following a Burnley corner.87 min: Chances at either end as Jay Rodriguez is this close to getting his toe a cross from the right, before Mo Salah shoots straight into Nick Pope’s bread basket. There’s three minutes plus add-ons left, but I reckon we’ll get a winner. 83 min: Another cross into the Burnley penalty area by Trent Alexander-Arnold and there’s a penalty appeal as Gudmundsson brings down Robertson. He got the ball. No spot-kick.82 min: Trent Alexander-Arnold curls a wicked cross into the Burnley penalty area from the right, but Kevin Long clears with a good header.81 min: Liverpool substitution: Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain on for Gini Wijnaldum.80 min: Joe Gomez is booked for a late challenge on Joe Gomez near the halfway line. 77 min: Naby Keita presses forward and tries to pick out Firminho in the Burnley penalty area. His pass is intercepted.75 min: Liverpool go in search of their second, Robertson crossing low and hard from the left. Kevin Long hacks clear. 71 min: The last top flight team to win all their home games in a season were the mighty Sunderland back in 1892. Liverpool are good, but are they that good? Can they hold a candle to Victorian era Sunderland, with their monocles, pipes and top hats and ? We’ll find out in the next 20 minutes.A free-kick from deep, the ball’s knocked down in the Liverpool penalty area and Jay Rodriguez smashes home a low drive from the edge of the box.68 min: Gin and tonics all round as the players of both teams pause for drinks. Liverpool double-substitution ahoy: Neco Williams and Curtis Jones are clapped off by the virtual crowd after good performances, Naby Keita and Trent Double-A on.65 min: Burnley double-substitution: Joey Gudmundsson and Matej Vydra on, Erik Pieters and Chris Wood off. Liverpool win a corner, which Nick Pope claims comfortably.62 min: In the opposition penalty area, Gini Wijnaldum hacks at a ball that drops his way following a Liverpool corner, but his effort is blocked. Burnley are hanging in there doggedly.60 min: A Fabinho shot from just outside the Burnley penalty area takes a wicked deflection off Josh Brownhill. It goes out for a corner, but could have gone anywhere, truth be told. Nick Pope was completely wrong-footed.58 min: Rocking a newly acquired peroxide blond barnet, Divock Origi begins warming up on the touchline. It suits him in a way that Bobby Firmino’s purple rinse really does not do the Brazilian justice. 57 min: Jay Rodriguez, who I remain convinced is still at West Brom, brings a smart save out of Alisson. Offside. 55 min: Neco Williams tries to shimmy and a-shally his way towards the Burnley goal, cutting in from the right. He beats two defenders, but runs into an immovable object in the form of James Tarkowski.55 min: Chris Wood tries his luck from distance but Alisson saves comfortably. 51 min: The man in charge of BT Sport’s crowd noise machine hits the button marked “Kop celebrates a goal”, but he’s a mite premature. From a great position just inside the Burnley penalty area, Curtis Jones fires wide.49 min: Still looking for his first Premier League goal at Anfield this season, Bobby Firminho looks a certainty to score into the empty Kop end until his low diagonal effort raps the foot of the far upright and bounces back into play before being hacked clear. So close! Good play by Mo Salah, who teed up the Brazilian on the left side of the penalty area.47 min: A good ball from deep from Virgil van Dijk looks to be arrowing towards Salah at the far post, but James Tarkowski glances a header out for a corner. The ensuing outswinger sails out of play before curling back into the penalty area. Goal kick. 46 min: Play resumes with no changes in personnel on either side. The champions lead by the only goal of the game but Burnley goalkeeper Nick Pope has kept his side in with a shout with a couple of outstanding saves.Andy Robertson’s excellent header separates the sides as they saunter off for the break at the end of an entertaining first half. Liverpool deserve their lead and could be further ahead but for a couple of outstanding saves by Nick Pope. It’s all to play for in the second half.45+2 min: Another brilliant save from Nick Pope, who must have wrists made of titanium to keep out a Sadio Mane pile-driver that looked destined for the top corner with his right hand. That’s his second world class save of the game. Outstanding. 45+2 min: James Tarkowski heads away as Gini Wijnaldum tries to pick out Mo Salah with a ball over the top. 45 min: Liverpool corner, which Neco Williams takes. Erik Pieters heads clear as Tannoy Man announces there’ll be two minutes of added time.44 min: Andy Robertson is playing a blinder today and drills another low cross into the corridor of uncertainty after leaving Erik Pieters in his dust down the left wing. Mo Salah looks likely to convert at the near post, but doesn’t quite get there in time. A let-off for Burnley.41 min: Where others might capitulate, Burnley have responded well to going behind. They’re enjoying their best spell of the game and go close when Dwight McNeil intercepts a wayward cross-field pass from Robertson. Joe Gomez gets his body in the way and defelcts McNeil’s shot from the edge of the area out for a corner. From that set piece, Burnley win another, with Alisson getting increasingly frustrated with the way he’s been man-marked by two Burnley players on his own goal line at corners. Liverpool clear.40 min: Virgil van Dijk stretches every sinew to intercept a cross looping towards the head of Chris Wood on the edge of the six yard box with his head. 37 min: Back to the goal, from the middle of the pitch, maybe 10 yards outside the Burnley penalty area, Fabinho spotted Robertson making a run up the inside right. He picked him out with a clipped pass and the Scot guided his header across the face of goal, past Pope and inside the far post. That was a brilliant header from a man who has clearly sobered up since his celebrations on the night Liverpool were confirmed champions.35 min: Burnley win a free-kick between the left side of the Liverpool penalty area and the touchline, but Ashley Westwood’s delivery is atrocious. Liverpool clear, the head of Andy Robertson making another decisive intervention.Well colour me red and call me Mystic Meg. Andy Robertson steers a wonderful header past Pope and inside the far post from a difficult angle. 33 min: Burnley give the ball away inside their own penalty area, offering Mo Salah a route to goal. His shot is saved well by Pope.31 min: The deadlock remains unbroken but you can’t help but feel it’s only a matetr of time before Liverpool score and potentially open the floodgates. Burnley are being over-run in midfield, where Josh Brownhill and Ashley Westwood are struggling. Young Curtis Jones has been impressive on the ball, moving it quickly and with no little precision."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99dd8399ba42707b8d975a95bc3c19c04af52a30/0_114_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c996f75fb2027c0baf8985a389c48f79","title":"sheffield united v chelsea premier league live","story":"3 min: It’s a super-early booking for Baldock, who clatters into Pulisic late, and grabs him for good measure.

Sheffield United are in their old red and white stripes, while Chelsea wear next season’s first-choice blue. We’ll be off in a couple of minutes. But first, a moment of silent reflection in honour of Jack Charlton - formerly a player with Leeds and manager of Sheffield Wednesday - who passed away today. RIP Big Man.Frank Lampard - who scored with a strange, swerving, keeper-bamboozling free kick the last time Chelsea played at Bramall Lane, in 2006 - has a word. “Credit to Chris Wilder, they have a real identity. Even if you feel like you know what’s coming, it’s still very difficult to deal with them. They’ve shown that in the Premier League this season. It’s a huge credit to them. You really have to do your homework and look at how they play, because it is pretty unique. We have to be ready to deal with it.”Chris Wilder speaks to Sky Sports. “Performances have been good, and we’ve got to try to find a way again to get past a very good side. We’re not getting ahead of ourselves, we can’t look any further than this afternoon, they’re one of the most free-flowing teams in the ision. It’s a brilliant test for my players, and one we’re really looking forward to.”Sheffield United make one change to the team that beat Wolves midweek. David McGoldrick replaces Billy Sharp up front Sharp drops to the bench.Chelsea make two changes to the side that won at Crystal Palace a few days back. Tammy Abraham and Jorginho replace Olivier Giroud, a sub today, and the injured Billy Gilmour.Chelsea away was Sheffield United’s first statement result this season. Two goals down to Tammy Abraham’s first-half double in late August, Chris WIlder’s newly promoted side rallied in the second half and secured a richly deserved 2-2 draw, Callum Robinson scoring one and teasing a late own goal out of Kurt Zouma. After the game, Chris Wilder made his intentions for the season clear: “Three years ago we were bottom of League One and now we have come away from Chelsea with a result. We are not day trippers getting autographs and collecting shirts.”Nearly a year down the line, poor United still have no autographs or shirts. But they have collected quite a lot of points, and as such remain a good bet for European qualification next season. It’s been the best performance from a newly promoted side since Ipswich Town wheelspun around the country in their tractor back in 2000-01. Since the restart, they’ve been diddled by technology at Aston Villa, and have recovered from back-to-back three-goal setbacks to pick up seven of the last nine points on offer. John Egan’s last-gasp winner against Wolves on Wednesday could be the reinvigorating boost that sends them continent-bound next season.Chelsea have wants and desires of their own, mind. Since the resumption, they’ve moved into third spot, their Champions League chances for next season looking none too shabby right now. But they do have a couple of tricky games to end the season in Liverpool and Wolves, so could be doing with getting the full quota of six points from today’s match and Tuesday’s visit of Norwich. Easier said than done against a side who have lost just one of their last nine at Bramall Lane, and Chelsea don’t boast the most dependable defence in the ision. But they are a lot of fun to watch, so this could be a doozy.

Then a colleague said it might be worth somethingI work for a charity in central London, and in 2012 there was an animal welfare charity shop near my office called Paws. I’d go in there in my lunch break, mostly to chat to Michelle, the friendly lady who ran the shop. There was always loads of stuff in there: I guess to Michelle it was organised chaos. You’d see the same people come and sit in there every day for a bit of company. It was a real community hub.I was there one day when a hippy couple started unloading a camper van of hundreds of books. I noticed a copy of The Hobbit. Weirdly, I’d bought a new copy a few weeks previously because I wanted to read it again before the film came out, but I’d lost it. I thought: oh, that’s lucky, I can carry on reading it now. Underneath it was a slightly racy cartoon magazine from the 70s, which I picked up for an artist friend. Michelle said I could have the two for a pound.It was a nice book. The dust jacket had an illustration of trees and mountains in blue, green and black with Tolkien’s name beneath. I started reading it on the train back and forth to work. I’m not a fast reader so I was still getting through it a month or so later when, as I was leaving work, a woman from our finance team came up to me, having spotted it in my hand. She said it looked old and that I should look into whether it was worth anything.I ended up down an internet hole looking at first editions of The Hobbit. I learned that there were 1,500 copies printed in the first run in 1937. You can check if you have one by looking for the reference to Charles Lutwidge Dodgson – better known by his pen name Lewis Carroll – printed in notes about the novel on the dust jacket. On the first edition, the name was misspelled as “Dodgeson” and had to be hand-corrected by the publishers. I checked the back and found the crossed-out e.I was thinking, “This can’t be.” As luck would have it, my girlfriend Jenna was working as an event coordinator at Christie’s at the time, so she put me in contact with a specialist in the books department. I talked him through the details and I remember him saying, “I think you might have a very valuable book on your hands.”I wrapped it in a pair of pants, put it inside a sandwich bag and took it in to show him. He asked me what I thought it was worth. I’d done my research and said that I was hoping for about £7,000. He agreed that was a good estimate.I had to wait four months for an auction. It ended up happening a few weeks before The Hobbit film came out, so there was a lot of interest. The auction started at 2.30pm in one of the rooms at Christie’s, with about 40 buyers in attendance. Most of the lots before mine were going for about £2,000. I was thinking, even if I make 500 quid, it would still be amazing. I only paid 50p for it.So when it came to my book and the auctioneer said, “We’ll start the bidding at £3,000,” I was already thrilled. The bids started going up in jumps of £500: “£4,000, £4,500, £5,000.” My heart was racing. “£6,000, £6,500, £7,000…”I started to feel a bit nauseous, but was trying to hold it together. The bidding had reached 10 grand before I knew it. It was very quiet in the room. My girlfriend had come to watch with a couple of her colleagues. As it got to £13,000, they were mouthing, “Oh my God!” to me. It finally went for £16,000.I was 28 at the time I didn’t have any serious life pressures, but I’d been in debt in the past. All I knew was that I couldn’t piss it up the wall. I’m not the sort of person who has a rich relative to leave them money to fall back on.My girlfriend persuaded me to put on a photography exhibition – something I’d always wanted to do. Then I spent the rest on a deposit for a flat. I would never have been able to get the money together to buy my own place without it. We’re still living here now.I carried on going back to Paws until it closed a couple of years ago. I made a small anonymous donation, but never told them what had gone on. I know it sounds strange, but I didn’t want to change the relationship. I just popped in the next lunchtime as if nothing had happened.• As told to Clare ConsidineDo you have an experience to share?

She had never heard of Charles or Ray Eames before, but it marked the start of a new obsession, becoming the first piece in her ever-evolving collection of vintage design.That collection – which s the second half of the 20th century – is seen here in Octernaud’s Art Deco apartment in the 7th arrondissement in Paris. She moved into the apartment six years ago with her husband, Stephen, and three children (the couple now have four, aged between five and 13).It was the generous entryway to the apartment, built in the 1920s by the French architect Jean Walter, that first attracted Octernaud. “So many of the 19th-century Hausmannian apartments have one long, dark, scary corridor,” she recalls. “This felt much more inviting.” When they first viewed the apartment, it was home to a single man. “It was decorated in the style of the French interior designer Christian Liaigre,” remembers Octernaud. “Clean, white and minimal, but not very practical for us as a large family”. Octernaud lived with it for two years before enlisting the help of the Parisian interior design studio, Transition ID.Together, they have transformed the apartment into a playful yet hard-working home, introducing a bold profusion of colours and pattern. Black, gold, pink and lush botanical prints provide the backdrop to family life – and to Octernaud’s eclectic collection, which includes pieces by some of Europe’s most celebrated designers: among them Gio Ponti, Patricia Urquiola and Willy Rizzo.When Octernaud had her fourth child, the design studio suggested they create an additional bedroom by moving the kitchen and dining room into the living space and iding the room with oak panels. The panels are based on the curved timber screens created in the 60s by the Czech designer, Jindřich Halabala – a shape echoed in the hallway shelving. “My son is like a monkey,” Octernaud explains. “Rather than have him climb all over original, fragile pieces, we had everything made from hardwood. It’s important my kids don’t feel as if they are growing up in a museum,” she explains. “I don’t want to be constantly shouting: ‘Be careful! It’s a masterpiece! Don’t touch!’ Everything has to be functional, too.”The Mickey Mouse cupboard in her son’s bedroom is a case in point. Designed by Pierre Colleu in the 80s, it is made of laminated wood and plastic and, so far, has survived life in the company of a five-year-old. The seating in the living room – including the Elda leather armchair by Italian designer Joe Colombo, and the fuchsia Culbuto armchair by the French architect Marc Held – have also been chosen for their robustness as much as for their iconic shape and status.Octernaud’s collection is seldom static. She is continually searching online for new pieces, which she will swap out for less loved items. (Three of her favourite Instagram accounts are @galerieglustin, @galeriemuscariadrienterret and @thegoodolddayz, which, she says, “is like a vintage dictionary to me”.) Once a month, the family will scour the flea market at Saint-Ouen. She is careful to respect her husband’s taste in interiors: he will tolerate a pink kitchen, but not so much her passion for 70s tapestries, for example. “When we go to the flea markets together,” she explains, “we each have the right to say no to each other. It works.”Octernaud’s commitment to design has, at times, caused more than a mild marital rift. The solid eucalyptus washstand in the couple’s ensuite bathroom was first glimpsed by Octernaud in a post on Instagram. She pursued the designer until he agreed to part with it. But it was too big to fit through the bespoke doorway –which had to be knocked through and remade. “That is one piece I will be keeping,” says Octernaud. “That and the red chair.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6392e5bfbe167574a5c7a470241ef25c5341feae/238_493_2851_1710/master/2851.jpg?width=1300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96924c6ad0da9cbef938d350037435e2 1300w","title":"electric cars five best buys from new models to used bargains","story":"Most new vehicles can now exceed 200 miles on a single charge. We look at options for every budget If you’d love to replace your ageing car with an electric model but have been put off because you don’t have a drive on which to charge it, it’s time to think again.This week British Gas revealed it had ordered 1,000 all-electric Vivaro vans from Vauxhall for its engineers. If it is preparing to move its entire fleet over to electric, is it time the rest of us considered electric vehicles too?“If you’re looking to buy a new or used car, now is the perfect time to switch to an electric car,” says Ben Lane, co-founder of the Zap-Map app, which guides owners to their nearest public charging point.Lane, who owns a used all-electric BMW i3, says he is not set up to charge the car at his Bristol home and relies on a fast charger near work for a 30-minute, £10 top-up once a week. If he leaves the city, he uses public chargers on the motorway network, or at his destination.“It just takes a little bit of planning, and I schedule in a weekly charge around a lunch break. Drivers who give electric cars a serious try, rarely, if ever, go back,” Lane says.If you have never driven an electric car, what can you expect? The biggest change for most drivers will be that electric cars are universally automatic, meaning no gears or clutch. They accelerate extraordinarily quickly – frighteningly so in some cases. And they are generally quieter than petrol cars. The dashboard shows the remaining range and a host of other information but, apart from that, most drivers will adapt easily enough.Recharging rather than refilling the car takes a bit of getting used to, say users, particularly if you don’t have a driveway and the ability to install a charger at home.While the purchase costs are higher – the better new models start at about £26,000 – the running costs are considerably less. Most buyers will elect to lease or long-term hire their cars with payments starting at approximately £250 a month after a big upfront payment. Good models can be found secondhand, although they will not all offer the range and faster charging options of the latest versions.Instead of paying £50 to fill up at the petrol station, electric cars cost as little as £5 to charge at home on a night-time economy tariff, or £10-£15 at one of the UK’s 18,600 charging points.Electric car buyers pay no vehicle excise duty, saving £140 a year compared with the average car. Annual servicing should also be cheaper – there is no oil to change, no spark plugs to check, no gearbox and fewer moving parts – and no expensive cambelt and exhaust replacements to make as the car gets older.Electric cars typically cost a little more to insure than conventional models, because they are more expensive to repair in the event of a crash. However, LV, which is aiming to be the go-to insurer for electric cars, says the Nissan Leaf costs only £10 a year more on average to insure than a petrol Nissan Micra.One of the biggest problems for potential buyers is the almost bewildering array of models, battery sizes and claimed ranges. Instead of engine sizes, manufacturers quote the size of the battery – in kilowatt hours (kWh) – and the bigger the battery the further the range. The motor’s output is confusingly quoted in kilowatts (kW) – so while the Renault Zoe comes with a 50kWh battery it also offers two motor sizes of 80kW or the faster 100kW, what would have been 1.6-litre or 2.0-litre engines in the old technology.Buyers need to be aware that the outside temperature affects an electric car’s performance, and the range drops dramatically in the winter. On the plus side, the latest models enable motorists to turn on the heating remotely via a mobile app, so you won’t get cold de-icing the car in January.So which should you buy? Fortunately for you, we have read all the car reviews, talked to the people who know and crunched the numbers – so you don’t have to. Below we run through the best buys, and what you will pay to buy a vehicle or for long-term hire, which is the most likely option.Starting at £26,000, the latest Zoe is not the cheapest electric car you can buy, but it should go almost 200 miles on a full charge and you get practical four-door hatchback capable of long journeys. It comes with good standard equipment, a 50kWh battery, and the company will throw in a wall-mounted 7kW home charger too.Go for the more powerful 100kW version if you do more out of town driving, plus the rapid charger option. Ling Cars will hire one to you for three years for £235 a month with a £1,410 payment upfront.After a long-term test and 10,000 miles on the road, Auto Express said the 64kWh five-door Kia e-Niro was “pound for pound” the best electric car on sale, and it remains the top choice for those needing space for pushchairs and similar items.“A great family car that happens to be electric. It’s better to drive than many petrol cars, is way cheaper to run and is a fuss-free joy to live with. I absolutely love it,” was the tester’s final verdict.It typically delivers a real-life range of 250 miles on a full charge, depending on the temperature. When using Kia’s super-fast 100kW chargers, testers said they were able to add about 150 miles of range in 30 minutes of charging. On a more common 50kW rapid charger, expect to wait an hour.This car can be bought for about £33,000, but again most buyers will probably hirelease one. Ling Cars will hire you one for three years for £465 a month, plus an upfront payment of £1,395. For comparison, the cost of the petrol hybrid equivalent is approximately £320 a month.The electric Jaguar I-Pace has won all the big awards around the world, including the UK, European and world car of the year. The sports utility model is packed with the latest technology, has frighteningly quick acceleration, according to owners, and offers “a driving experience that will win over just about everyone who gets behind the wheel”, according to Nextgreencar.It has a claimed range of 292 miles on a full charge, or 250 miles in real life. Owners get a 90kWh battery, which comes with an eight-year100,000-mile warranty. It also features ultra-rapid 100kW charging.On the downside, it’s not huge inside for an executive car, but it’s the price that will halt most buyers in their tracks – a cool £63,925 to £74,425. Expect to pay £750 a month to lease one with an upfront payment of £6,700.Used Nissan Leafs are the bargains of the electric car world. On Auto Trader this week a 2011 model with 36,000 miles on the clock was going for less than £6,000. Older models have a real-life range of 75-85 miles – significantly less than the new cars above, but perfectly good for a 60-mile round-trip commute each day – if you ever have to go back to the office.These cars are well-made, practical and reliable, and have proved durable.  Money is aware of one that has 187,000 miles on the clock and still manages 75 miles on a full charge. If you need a bigger range, £10,000-£14,000 gets you a 30kWh version that will do about 110-120 miles on a full charge. Older Leafs can use many of the the rapid chargers that are available.Given that they cost just pennies to run, these offer super-cheap, clean, very low maintenance motoring that cannot be beaten.No review of electric cars would be complete without a mention of Tesla. Its £42,500-£55,000 Model 3, its “affordable” car, has been an instant hit since launching last year. The standard design will do 254 miles on a single charge, while the long-range model claims 348 miles. These cars are packed with technology and, like the Jaguar, offer impressive performance figures. They will take four passengers, and feature a super-minimal interior that you will either love or hate.“For a few thousand pounds more than a Kia e-Niro you get a product that feels more special,” says Auto Express. However, some reviewers have expressed concerns as to whether the build quality is as high as it should be, given the price. Rapid charging is available from Tesla’s Supercharger network and conventional CCS charge points.IPhone users will want this car. Those who prefer the value they get from a top Android phone may want to opt for the Kia instead. And if you can afford it, buy the Jag.There are more than 11,600 charging sites in the UK, but spend a hour looking at how and where drivers can recharge their cars out on the road, and it’s easy to see why so many use only their home charger. A bewildering range of sockets and a host of companies have popped up at motorway service areas, car dealers, supermarket and local authority car parks and, increasingly, pubs and restaurants.Paid-for charging sites typically cost 30p per kWh, which is about twice as much you would pay if doing it at home, meaning you will pay about £10 for 33kWh of electricity at a rapid charger – in most cases enough to drive 130 miles.In something of a rerun of the BetamaxVHS video battle of the 1980s, there are three types of connector currently being used, meaning most drivers have to carry two leads around with them. The good news is that new cars sold in Europe are moving to one standard, CCS faster charging, which should make life much easier in future.New drivers of electric cars should download the Zap-Map app, which lists the public chargers in any given location or on a planned route as well as the type of charge offered. It also gives service updates as to whether the charger is working, which can be an issue.Drivers connecting to low-power 7kW public chargers use their own cable, while the higher-powered 50kW and 100kW sites have built-in cables, similar to a petrol pump.

He can be spotted playing as part of London Afrobeat band Kokoroko, with whom he wrote their serene 2019 smash Abusey Junction, which has been streamed a triumphant 60m times, or working alongside Shabaka Hutchings, Moses Boyd and Yussef Dayes.The Norwich-born guitarist, who studied at London’s Trinity Laban (the same conservatoire Fela Kuti attended), is also an accomplished solo artist. Last year he supported LA sax prophet Kamasi Washington on the latter’s UK tour. Next month, Jerome will release his debut solo album, Breathe Deep, which inhales a broad range of influences: supple Latin-American-influenced soul, dub pioneer Lee Scratch Perry, US jazz bopper Grant Green – and the pastoral imagery of John Keats. Many familiar faces from bands such as Ezra Collective, Sons of Kemet and Maisha crop up as guests.Jerome’s guitar sounds like sunbeams, and he is a gifted songwriter with a folkie sensibility – soulful but understated, his voice never forced or overblown, and all the richer for it. Current single, the upbeat and acoustic Joy Is You, has a sliver of the Jack Johnson about it Timeless is a gorgeously slinky duet with Lianne La Havas. But Jerome also sings about the climate crisis, homeless refugees and “the haze of city life” with an intimacy that may make you gasp.

Our writers have had their say. Now it’s time to hear from our readersNovak Djokovic was hoping to defend his Wimbledon title this weekend. Instead, he is at home recovering from Covid-19. It may be some time until the world’s best players are reunited at a grand slam. So, for now, we have to content ourselves with reminiscing about their past glories.This week we have been analysing the best male players of the past 50 years. Our writers made the case for Djokovic, Pete Sampras, Rafael Nadal, Bjorn Borg and Roger Federer. Now it’s time for the readers to offer their verdict. More than 1,500 of you have been in touch and you have a clear favourite. Time and time again you wrote to us to extol his virtues, not just his record of 20 grand slam titles but also his elegance on the court and class off it.Federer’s two great contemporaries, Nadal and Djokovic, were also popular with readers, as were some of the greats of yesteryear, with John McEnroe, Rod Laver, Andre Agassi, Boris Becker and Jimmy Connors all having their backers. Thanks to everyone who took part.It isn’t just down to his record number of grand slams titles. There is his domination through the mid-2000s his incredible record of 310 weeks as world No 1 and his success on all surfaces. He adapted his game as well as any of the great players of the 1970s, going from the slow clay of Paris to the lightning fast lawns of SW19.Above all, though, is his longevity. As the big hitters such as Nadal and Juan Martín del Potro came to the fore, Federer knew he would have to concentrate on closing off points at the earliest possible opportunity. When the best returners in the game, Andy Murray and Djokovic, entered the fray, he had to find the impossible angles to ensure they had no reply. Their challenges have only strengthened his game. And he does all this while continuing to have the most stylish groundstrokes the game has ever been. Don’t even get me started on his attire. The man has brought style back to tennis. If he started wearing a top hat, the whole world would follow suit.I remember the first time I saw him play, against Xavier Malisse at Wimbledon in 2001. We stumbled across the match on Court 13 and, as he came through in five sets, I remember my mother and I looking at each other, knowing he could be quite good. Without a doubt my favourite memory of watching him play has to be the Australian Open final against Nadal in 2017.Six months earlier I had been heartbroken as I was sure Federer’s back injury would prevent him from playing competitively again. But after two incredible five-setters against Kei Nishikori and Stan Wawrinka, he produced an incredible finale under the floodlights. Federer gave us the fairytale comeback every tennis fan was surely praying for. And who better to share the stage with but his friend and nemesis Nadal, who has had his own injury woes. I thought that might be the last time we would see these two giants perform at such incredible heights, but they have kept proving me wrong, reaching final after final. Ralph MelhuishThe battle to be the best player of the past 50 years comes down to a battle between three current players: Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. And Djokovic wins it. He has a better head-to-head against the other two he has won four grand slams in a row and he has a 3-0 record against Federer in Wimbledon finals.Federer’s grand slam record is a little bit skewed due to the lack of competition he faced early on in his career he is 16-1 in grand slam finals against players other than Djokovic and Nadal, while going 4-10 against Djokovic and Nadal. He is also five years older than Djokovic, who is catching him on the grand slam front quickly.Nadal is the greatest clay-courter of all time, with 12 of his 19 grand slam titles coming on the surface. But Djokovic is the greatest because he is the most well-rounded of the three. Nadal has still not beaten Djokovic at the Australian Open, yet Djokovic has beaten the Spaniard in all four slams. Djokovic is the only player who can fluster Nadal on clay, one of only two players to have beaten him at Roland Garros. It is only a matter of time before Djokovic wins the most grand slams and spends the most weeks at world No 1. Matt GraverRafael Nadal gets my vote for his heart, intensity, focus, resilience and sportsmanship. Every time he steps on to the court, you know you are about to watch something special. He does not make it look as easy as Federer he does not have the speed of Djokovic and he does have the power of many of the up-and-coming players. He consistently hammers the ball across the net, fights for every single point, makes superhuman shots and conducts himself with class and humility, on and off the court.Nadal’s love of the game is palpable and his record speaks for itself. The joy of watching him play only increases as his career progresses. The 2008 Wimbledon final will go down as one of the greatest tennis matches of all time. Watching Nadal pick up his first Wimbledon title against Federer is one of my best tennis memories. Cindy StevensPete Sampras won so many titles – including 14 grand slams – at a time when there were a lot of top-notch competitors. Look at the list of the players he faced who are considered all-time greats: Boris Becker, Jim Courier, John McEnroe, Andre Agassi. All of them were rivals and yet Sampras had won the most grand slam titles until Roger Federer came along.Federer is a great player but he won many of his grand slam titles when there were fewer top-class level players to beat. Sampras won all of his amid a higher level of competition. Also, he was a gentleman and a credit to the game, with no temper tantrums or poor sportsmanship. Good guys can finish first. Harvey VlahosJohn McEnroe achieved a lot in a short space of time. His biggest achievement in a way was from 1979 to 1981, when he broke into the top three alongside Bjorn Borg and Jimmy Connors before eventually overtaking them to reach the No 1 spot. McEnroe himself states that chasing and then overtaking the previous decade’s big two was the most satisfying time in his career. In a way, running the great Borg out of town created a dilemma for McEnroe. He could never recreate the excitement of playing Borg again.Although he “only” won seven grand slams, that was in the days when amassing majors did not seem such an obsession (he rarely played Australia for example). And to fully appreciate McEnroe, you need to look at his doubles record. Along with Peter Fleming he formed best team in any world sport for years. In all he helped win 10 grand slam doubles titles, one of them the French Open mixed in 1977.But it’s not all about how much you win. It’s also about how you do it. And that is what made McEnroe great. At his best, he was the equal of anyone. Fred Perry said he had the best hands he had ever seen. His footwork was on a par with Federer’s. His aggression and commitment to the fight draws comparisons with Nadal and Djokovic.He lost his edge too early, but between 1979 and 1984 he was the best athlete in the world. His record of 82 wins and only three losses in 1984 is what seals him as my greatest. For that year he was virtually untouchable. His defeat of Connors in the Wimbledon final was a one-sided execution. Connors himself is one of the all-time greats but that day he was swatted aside like a fly. That was McEnroe’s great masterpiece. If only he had beaten Ivan Lendl in the French a few weeks earlier. But that was part of the Mac magic. Occasionally he would implode amid the self-created drama. But while he was up there with Borg and Connors, he was the most compelling sight in all of sport. Donald ButlerRod Laver is the only player to have won two calendar year slams – in 1962 and 1969. Heaven knows how many more he would have won had he not been banned, after he turned professional, for five years. To return after that and win another calendar slam is a remarkable achievement, one that is unlikely to be repeated. He was a proper gentleman who played with finesse and elegance. It is doubtful we would have Federer without Laver. He is revered in the tennis world, especially by Federer, and that’s some compliment. Patrick CallaghanBjorn Borg’s sublime footwork, agility and speed around the court made him stand out. He nearly always found a way to get the ball back, which must have left his opponents wondering just how they were going to win a point. He was a superb athlete, able to finish tough five-set matches as if he was starting them. He had a cool demeanour on court and rarely showed emotion, not giving anything away. Borg, who won 11 grand slams, produced some revolutionary strokes, including a crushing two-handed topspin backhand, a looping topspin forehand and an attacking topspin lob. His serve got the job done, too. And he hit the ball very, very hard.His victory over Jimmy Connors in the Wimbledon semi-finals in 1981 stands out. Connors was on fire, taking the first set 6-0 and the second 6-4. Borg finally started asserting himself in the third, taking it and the remaining sets to win the match and make it to the final for the sixth year in a row. I remember jumping up from a sofa at the end of the game and punching the air. Chris GreenAndre Agassi deserves to be mentioned in this discussion. Despite inconsistencies in his career – which in part made him such an exciting player to watch – he played fine tennis and was an athlete who transcended his sport. As with several others after him, he had to contend with extraordinary fame, money, constant focus and criticism. He was among the most famous men in the world. Even when he was playing the challenger circuit, he remained among the highest-paid athletes around.When judging sportspeople we often look at the trophies they won. For me, sport it is about personality. Perfection can be boring and uninspiring. However great Federer, Nadal and Sampras are, they lack a level of energy – something I never missed with Agassi. Allan FletcherBoris Becker was only 17 when he won his first Wimbledon title in 1985. He was the youngest grand slam winner at the time and he is almost singlehandedly responsible for the the German tennis wave that followed. He was an emotional player, with an excellent and exciting game. You knew you were in for action and drama when he was playing. Also, he’s no boring, clean-cut guy. While he does say the wrong things at times, he wears his heart in his sleeve. Dan ZilicTo be great in any sport, winning is not the only thing. Some brilliant players have been awful ambassadors for tennis, but Arthur Ashe’s life was exemplary. Even after he contracted Aids from an infected blood transfusion, he used his misfortune to do good, starting a foundation in his name aimed at raising awareness of the illness. He died way too early, at the age of 49.I was won over by his composure, his seriousness and his success against overwhelming odds, on and off the court. My favourite memory was the 1975 Wimbledon final. Jimmy Connors was the overwhelming favourite and Ashe had to find a strategy to beat him. Connors fed off power but when given a low, short ball he would often whack it into the net. Ashe worked that out, used it to his advantage and won. I was a boy at the time and remember the sight of Ashe during the changeovers, sitting quietly with his eyes closed, his hands on his knees, apparently meditating, as if he had access to some sort of secret power that could overcome the physical power on the court. John BonnerFor longevity, determination and sheer will to win, I would put Jimmy Connors at the top. Nowadays players go on for ever, but the playing career was much shorter in Connors’ era. He competed and won at the highest level for 10 years, claiming his second Wimbledon title eight years after his first – by which time he had been written off as past it. To top it off, he won all of his grand slam titles – two at Wimbledon, five at the US Open and one at the Australian Open – with the same tiny T2000 racket that might have been revolutionary in 1968, but had long since past its sell-by date.Connors is the bridge between the genteel, upper-middle class snootiness of the amateur tennis club and the modern, ultra-focused, hard-hitting professional game. No one can match his 109 career singles titles. In his best performances Connors was like a windmill in a hurricane, cracking the ball for all he was worth, low over the net and aiming for the lines. He did not have the concentration of Borg, or the variety of shot of McEnroe, but he had more turbo-charged mojo than both of them put together.

But as the government gave the go-ahead only on Thursday evening, it will still be some time before most shows can go on.Curnow has swiftly programmed a new summer season, with theatre productions scheduled from 20 July. Smaller-scale storytelling performances will commence this Monday, 13 July, and from Saturday the Minack is resuming its daytime tours, in which a local actor, Mark Harandon, portrays the gardener who created the theatre with its founder Rowena Cade in the early 1930s. The summer programme will include monologues and a revival of the Minack’s 2019 production of Marie Jones’s two-hander Stones in His Pockets. “It doesn’t need as much rehearsal time because it’s a remount,” said Curnow. The actors will be in a bubble together, flat-sharing.As for social distancing in the audience, Curnow said the Minack was fortunate in that the season is financially viable even with a reduced audience capacity. With its jaw-dropping setting, it is a popular tourist destination even without productions. “We’re always full from July to September,” said Curnow. “We have over 300,000 visitors a year.” The Minack has been inundated with proposals from producers around the country, she said, not least because it was name-checked by the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, in Thursday’s press briefing.Pubs were given 10 days to prepare before they reopened open-air theatres had less than 48 hours’ notice. Curnow said she “couldn’t sign any contracts until after 5pm on Thursday”. Will Mytum, the manager of Brighton Open Air theatre (Boat), said Dowden’s announcement came after “weeks and weeks” of waiting for news, and he would be surprised if any open-air productions could open with such short notice. “But I hope they do. It’s a short season for outdoor performance in Britain and we’ve lost a chunk of it, so the sooner the better.”Boat, which usually runs from May to September, is set to reopen on 25 July. Mytum applauded the government’s rescue package of £1.57bn for the arts and heritage sectors but said the past few weeks had been unsettling. “Open-air theatre has been held back compared with other outdoor activities. It’s been confusing. If you can go to a pub from 4 July you’d think sitting outside watching theatre would be as safe.” He said theatres needed time not only for rehearsals but also for implementing safety measures and running adverts. When Boat opens later this month, it will host performances by companies from around the UK, many of which have already formed a bubble.Adam Nichols, the artistic director of Maltings theatre in St Albans, Hertfordshire, said they had already begun the casting process for their August outdoor Shakespeare festival. A recent petition launched by Nichols, urging the government to allow outdoor performances to return in July, quickly gained more than 7,000 signatures. He argued that reopening would allow open air theatres to generate revenue, be less dependent on government support and bring benefits for the local economy. Outdoor theatres play an important social role because they attract people who are not regular theatre-goers, Nichols said, describing the open-air sector as “more accessible and inclusive”. (Circuses, too, have been allowed to open from 11 July. A spokesperson for the Equity union called circus a British cultural institution and “an affordable art form that brings families and local communities together”.)As well as deep cleaning of venues and e-ticketing, government guidance for reopening stresses a reduction in venue capacity and limited ticket sales to ensure social distancing. Nichols said seating for open-air theatres had a greater degree of flexibility than indoor theatres, which have fixed constraints. His festival productions will run without an interval, to avoid gatherings. Actors will arrive in full costume for each performance, to minimise backstage movement. Nichols said it was challenging to enable social distancing between actors without scenes looking ridiculous for the audience. He has chosen to stage Henry V (“history plays tend to be more formal, there’s less touching”) and The Merry Wives of Windsor (“although it has a lot of slapstick, unlike some of the comedies there is less at close quarters”). They are waiting for guidance on the use of gazebos and marquees to provide cover from rain.Regent’s Park open-air theatre in London is exploring the possibility of opening for a short period later this summer. Sheffield Theatres welcomed the government’s announcement and said it was working closely with the city council on its previously announced plans for a “Shakespeare to Sheffield” outdoor performance programme this year.But there have been concerns, too. Peter Stickney, the artistic director of the Lord Chamberlain’s Men, which stages all-male outdoor Shakespeare productions, said he was “concerned that in the clamour to present live theatre this summer, many actors and creatives, who are likely in pretty desperate financial circumstances, might get exploited”. Stickney fears that safety and quality may be sacrificed by some in the rush to stage outdoor work. He said the government guidelines for reopening “would be incredibly difficult for us to follow rigorously and still deliver a performance that would be in any way recognisable”. The company has rescheduled its production of Macbeth to next year. He said the outdoor theatre industry was “full of creativity, expertise and ideas” and “ready for big and exciting conversations about safe and high-quality ways forwards”.Shakespeare’s Globe, perhaps the world’s best-known open-air theatre, said it was not economically viable for it to open with socially distanced performances. “We’re an independent charity with very limited reserves,” a spokesperson said. “The government understands our situation, and we are incredibly grateful for their promised investment in our sector.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea0484df0689f3d9975d06a31dd9ef411696f98b/0_85_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=f6a9854fefef548842bd5c2b49b485c2","title":"coronavirus los angeles mask making","story":"Outbreaks have hit factories including LA Apparel, ordered to shut down amid 300 cases and four deathsFrancisco Tzul has worked in the Los Angeles garment industry for eight years, sewing clothing on cramped factory floors and struggling to get by on low wages. An undocumented immigrant from Guatemala, Tzul found himself out of work when the pandemic hit in March. So when he heard in May that LA Apparel, a brand run by the former CEO of American Apparel, was hiring workers to make masks, he jumped at the chance.“Here’s an opportunity, a golden opportunity, I told myself,” he told the  in Spanish. “From one day to the next I became an essential worker, with more dignified wages.”But this “golden opportunity” nearly cost him his life. Just two and a half weeks into the job he began experiencing symptoms of Covid-19, which he says he contracted at work. He wound up hospitalized and intubated, unsure if he would survive. Tzul emerged after more than a week in the hospital to find himself homeless, kicked out by his roommates on account of his illness.Tzul is one of the many garment workers across Los Angeles recruited to meet a booming demand for face masks. LA Protects, a scheme implemented by the city to fast-track mask production, has partnered with numerous local companies to produce protective gear for frontline workers.The program, announced on 27 March by the LA mayor, Eric Garcetti, has resulted in more than 7 million non-medical masks for grocery store workers, non-medical hospital staff, and others. Over 400 companies initially signed up for the LA Protects scheme, including LA Apparel, although not all are currently participating.The city program, combined with increasing demand from consumers and businesses, has spurred many LA garment companies to pivot to mask-making, hiring new workers and refocusing existing production facilities. But garment workers and advocates say it has come at the expense of the health of the people who make them.Outbreaks at factories now making masks speak to the scale of the problem. LA Apparel has been forced to close its three factories, where county health officials report at least 300 confirmed cases and four deaths. Keep It Here Apparel Manufacturing, which makes clothing for a number of other companies, has had 19 confirmed cases, according to the department of public health. And at F\u0026ampG Sewing, a manufacturer that works on behalf of companies including Fashion Nova, workers have reported more than a dozen people sickened.Marissa Nuncio, the director of GWC, says the coronavirus pandemic is exacerbating longstanding industry issues such as low pay, poor working conditions and the lack of a safety net. “It was already a very dangerous and unhealthy space for workers,” says Nuncio. “And now it’s just intensified and the stakes are higher.”According to city guidelines, all factories in the LA Protects scheme should provide health screening for staff members who may have been exposed to or are displaying symptoms of the virus. There should be 6ft of distance between workstations and between workers when eating or when entering or exiting the building.Garcetti said in July that operating guidelines for businesses were “not optional, not a menu they are mandatory”. The mayor’s office told the  that city representatives have performed hundreds of site visits to companies participating in LA Protects to ensure compliance.Nuncio’s organization has been reaching out to the county’s public health department to make sure these inspections happen, but the large and often disorganized nature of the industry, which exploits a largely immigrant workforce, makes the problem hard to control.“When you have wall-to-wall violations, both wage and hour, and health and safety, it’s going to be tough to get a handle on that just through enforcement,” she says.Dov Charney, the owner of LA Apparel, is a controversial figure who was fired from American Apparel in 2014 amid sexual harassment allegations. Since then he has turned LA Apparel into a well-known brand that sells basics such as T-shirts, sweatshirts and bodysuits directly to consumers.In mid-March the company began revving up mask production for government agencies as well as regular customers, using Instagram to promote images of models wearing the masks, as well as the workers who make them. The company’s offer of $14.25 an hour, with the possibility of extra pay if workers produced more, made Tzul excited to take the job.Tzul says the company took temperatures and gave out hand sanitizer on the factory floor. Maribel Maldonado, another garment worker who tested positive for Covid-19 while working at an LA Apparel factory, says workers wore masks. But both Maldonado and Tzul say there was no consistent enforcement by management for any of these measures, and that the biggest risk was a lack of social distancing.Maldonado, 50 and originally from Mexico, had been laid off from her job cleaning hotel rooms due to the pandemic when she heard LA Apparel was hiring mask-makers. She began working there in April, trimming the loose threads off cloth masks, and was diagnosed with Covid-19 in May. She says she got the illness at the factory, and that she was healthy until she started working there.Maldonado says work stations were not set up the required 6ft apart, social distancing was impossible, and enforcement was lax. “There were too many people to separate everyone,” she told the  in Spanish. “We didn’t fit.”Maldonado believes there were too many willing to work and that made it easy for managers to ignore concerns, since someone was always ready to take their place. She says street vendors would make their way on to the factory floor to sell snacks Tzul also describes workers crowding around the microwaves during lunch breaks.She began displaying symptoms of Covid-19 on the factory floor, including diarrhea, nausea, cold sweats and chills. She says the managers at LA Apparel did not pay much attention to her symptoms, and it was only with the help of GWC that she was able to get tested and discover she had the virus.In June, county health officials began investigating LA Apparel and found that the company was violating mandatory public health infection control orders, including social distancing requirements. At the time, the company reported 151 confirmed cases of Covid-19.On 27 June, the department of public health (DPH) ordered LA Apparel to shut down its operations until it could implement the proper safety and infection protocols. The order was still in effect when, 10 days later, the company reopened its manufacturing plant. DPH issued another directive ordering LA Apparel to cease operations, and on 10 July DPH confirmed that there are more than 300 cases of Covid among LA Apparel workers, and four have died.“The death of four dedicated garment workers is heartbreaking and tragic,” said Dr Barbara Ferrer, the director of DPH, in a statement. “Business owners and operators have a corporate, moral and social responsibility to their employees and their families to provide a safe work environment that adheres to all of the health officer directives – this responsibility is important, now more than ever, as we continue to fight this deadly virus.”Ferrer said her department would continue to monitor LA Apparel and other manufacturing sites to make sure they were safe working environments for employees.In response to the county’s claims that LA Apparel had flouted health orders, Charney told the  his company has been “totally cooperative” with county health officials, despite receiving conflicting directives. He said that LA Apparel was “doing everything we can to take care of our people. We love our employees, they’re our partners, and we’re working to build an environment of safety and prosperity.”In response to workers’ claims, Charney says the company has taken precautions to keep people safe and insists that social distancing between work stations has been enforced, but he acknowledges that enforcing distancing during breaks is challenging.“We are working very hard. We reorganized our factory many times,” Charney says. He is skeptical that people caught the virus at work and attributes the recent outbreak to a countywide spike in Covid-19 cases, saying workers could have been exposed during lunches or after work hours. “We can’t control social distancing: what people do at home, or when they go out and eat,” Charney says. “To even imply that it’s because we’re not doing our duty is laughable.”He says the company now plans to test all of its workers every week.The pandemic has highlighted the precariousness of Los Angeles’s 45,000 garment workers, most of them women and immigrants from Mexico and Central America. Workers are typically paid per piece, rather than an hourly wage or salary. According to a UCLA Labor CenterGWC study published in 2016, piece rates are so low that workers make an average of $5.15 an hour.Speaking about his time in the garment industry, Tzul says it’s impossible to build up any savings doing such low-paying work. “That means we can’t be prepared for difficult situations like the one we’re living through now.”A worker at F\u0026ampG Sewing, who spoke to the  in Spanish on condition of anonymity, says she is currently making masks, clothing and robes (the kind used by salon workers) for Fashion Nova, a brand that has been accused of wage violations. The US Department of Labor found that Fashion Nova clothing was being manufactured in factories owing millions of dollars in back wages to workers. The company told federal investigators last year that it was addressing this with its contractors. Meanwhile, the worker at F\u0026ampG says she makes five cents per mask and eight cents per robe – if she works hard enough during her 12-hour shift, she can make about $5 an hour.She describes workers toiling in a basement with small windows, no ventilation, no soap in the bathroom, and only one or two feet between workers conditions that she’s used to, but which now come with deadly risks. Until recently, the windows were covered with cardboard and the doors stayed closed.F\u0026ampG Sewing says it signed up for LA Protects but was not getting many orders through the program and was not sure if it was still a participant. Regardless, the company reports having received a visit from a city inspector as recently as last week.The worker estimates she is one of 10 people at the factory who have gotten sick with Covid-19, one of whom has died. In May she became sick with an illness that left her with chest pain and struggling to breathe – both symptoms of coronavirus – but she did not get tested at the time.A representative from F\u0026ampG Sewing says the company is complying with all the necessary regulations and has implemented safety protocols such as providing face masks, distancing workers, and making sure each workstation is used by just one employee. The company says the factory floor is well ventilated and the workforce is content, and that workers have been asked to stay home if they experience symptoms. F\u0026ampG could not confirm whether any of the workers have contracted Covid-19.Keep it Here did not respond to a request for comment.In response to questions about worker safety under the LA Protects program, the mayor’s office said it had announced in June a limited-time deployment of mobile testing units to factories in need. LA Protects has also rolled out additional workplace safety criteria for companies participating in the program.Tzul, meanwhile, is back at work in another garment factory. But Maldonado says she would “never go back” to the factories. “Because that’s where I got sick.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6f995dd9d64ab8c8021e66605a0f10801526a61/0_310_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=0db55668fcfe30efd00b06440324df8c","title":"is too much trade at stake for britain to stand up to beijing","story":"When China’s ambassador to London, Liu Xiaoming, warned this month that there would be “countermeasures” if ministers interfered in Chinese internal affairs over Hong Kong, it sent a shudder through Britain’s battered business community.After four months during which the pandemic has plunged the economy into a recession, this was not a message to fill boardrooms with joy. To the surprise of many in diplomatic circles, Boris Johnson had offered up to 3 million British national (overseas) passport holders in Hong Kong a path to UK citizenship, following the passing of China’s draconian state security laws covering the region.Xiaoming responded by hosting an online conference to press home Beijing’s anger at Britain’s apparently firm stance on Hong Kong.Highlighting the potential ban on the telecoms equipment provider Huawei from the UK’s 5G network, he warned of “consequences” if the UK’s attitude to China became hostile.Rana Mitter, director of the China Centre at the University of Oxford, fears that sanctions could quickly follow.Until now, the UK government has maintained a pragmatic view of claims against Xi Jinping’s administration of excessive authoritarianism. China is the sixth most valuable destination for British exports, making the world’s second-largest economy a crucial destination for the UK’s goods and services.Some of Britain’s largest manufacturers are dependent on maintaining access to Chinese markets, among them the carmaker Jaguar Land Rover.In addition, London is a major trading centre for the Chinese currency, the yuan British pharmaceutical firms have close research links with their Chinese counterparts and Huawei is poised to build a £1bn research centre near Cambridge.Beijing’s status as a major trading partner weighs heavily on ministers as they consider how to respond to a succession of charges against the communist government of abuses of human rights, media bias and business ethics, and not just in Hong Kong. The treatment of the Uighur community in the north-west of the country is an issue of growing concern as reports trickle out of widespread human rights abuses, including the separation and internment of families that refuse to be “re-educated”.Complaints against China’s state television channel over its coverage of protests in Hong Kong were upheld by the UK regulator, Ofcom, which said it was minded to sanction CGTN, the English-language rolling news channel owned by the Chinese government, for a “serious failure of compliance”. These criticisms lie behind the creation of a China research group within the Conservative party, headed by the MP and prominent Beijing critic Tom Tugendhat.Adding to the pressure on ministers, the former MI6 chief Sir John Sawers said last week he had changed his mind about the UK’s ability to use Huawei components without jeopardising national security. Writing in the Financial Times, Sawers argued that a US boycott of the company was a crucial turning point, as it had forced many of Huawei’s suppliers to cut ties with the company. Without these reputable suppliers on board, there was little hope of telling if Huawei was a benign contractor or acting as a spy agency for Beijing, he said.Leslie Vinjamuri, an international relations expert at Chatham House, says the UK is now in a tight spot: “When you see China taking such a tough line, it feels as if something has fundamentally changed.” She sees it as an inevitability that the UK will be drawn into the global power play between the US, China and the EU that could result in pressure on commerce and retaliatory measures.Nigel Driffield, a trade expert at Warwick Business School, says if Beijing is riled, UK-owned factories in China could be brought to a halt by a simple health and safety inspection. In 2012, a dispute with Japan over islands in the South China Sea escalated into the state-sanctioned looting and burning of Japanese factories on the mainland. Ever since then, major Japanese companies have operated a one-plus-one policy of replicating in other countries all their factories in China.Oxford University’s Mitter is optimistic that commercial and trade relations will continue, arguing that the profit motive is important to China, especially when its own economy remains depressed. “The bottom line is still likely to be whether Chinese firms can make a profit or not,” he says.“China is a pragmatic actor when it comes to its own interests. When there have been diplomatic spats in the past, which has happened on several occasions, there is no correlation with UKChina trade, which has continued to increase year on year.”Mitter cites e-commerce firms such as Alibaba, which want to break out of the east Asia market to challenge behemoths eBay and Amazon. They need the support of the UK to break the US stranglehold on e-commerce.A straight fight over Hong Kong is likely to undermine those collaborative efforts. However, it remains to be seen whether Johnson will risk Beijing’s wrath.• In 1999, China was the UK’s 26th largest export market and 15th largest source of imports. By 2018, it had risen to sixth largest and fourth largest respectively.• In 2019, the UK’s single largest import from China was telecoms equipment, valued at £6bn. Professional services accounted for £1bn of UK exports to China.• 833,000 Chinese visitors to the UK in 2019 spent around £2,000 per head to make a total of £1.7bn.• Chinese citizens make up a quarter of international students at UK higher education institutions.

Speaking at a virtual meeting of the general synod, the C of E’s governing body, he said: “The hard thing will be working out what we can and should do with the time and resources at our disposal, and therefore also what we might have to stop doing.”Cottrell told the synod he plans to build a “safe, loving” church. “As we enter some turbulent times and some challenging decisions, we are just going to have to learn how to love one another, love the world, and love God, so that both inidually and collectively we can be the place where God is revealed,” he said.“We’ve not always been very good at this. We have allowed ourselves to become tribal and ided. We have allowed secondary things to obscure our belonging to each other.”Cottrell said he would bring a series of proposals to synod next year after consulting with people from across the church, particularly younger Christians whose voices are not usually heard in a church that is “overly dominated” by those “usually white, usually male, usually with a certain sort of education, usually over 60”.Cottrell – who is white, male and aged 61, although state educated – took over as archbishop of York from John Sentamu, who fled Idi Amin’s regime in Uganda in the 1970s. Following Sentamu’s retirement, there are now no senior BAME bishops in the C of E, although there are five suffragan, or junior bishops.The C of E has set up a commission on racism in the church to implement “significant cultural and structural” change. In answer to a question, Cottrell told the synod that further details of the commission’s composition and work would be announced in September.He said he was “personally extremely committed” to the work. “It’s really important that the leadership of the church reflects the communities we serve.”In his earlier address, he said: “I am very sorry for the mistakes I have made, and for the ones I will almost certainly make in the future. But I will be honest about them. I will seek to learn from them. I will try to build a safe and loving church that is merciful and just.”Ten days before he was confirmed as archbishop, Cottrell admitted he had failed to take proper action relating to allegations of domestic abuse by a priest 10 years ago, saying he was “deeply distressed and extremely sorry”.The C of E leadership faced criticism from members of the synod over guidance during lockdown that churches must close, even to clergy. Sarah Mullally, the bishop of London, told the meeting: “We recognise this caused hurt and anger for some, whereas for others it was reassuring and a relief.”The synod, normally held in York over five days, was reduced to a one-day Zoom session because of the Covid pandemic. As well as two question-and-answer sessions and a discussion about the church’s response to the crisis, it featured barking dogs, slamming doors, off-screen whispers and a number of technical glitches."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6783005927aa639a1c612794d150b1ca7e07c493/804_230_2696_1618/master/2696.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=18f7938ceac805d1f26b8e9931324931","title":"the non running of pamplona bulls in pictures","story":"The coronavirus pandemic has brought Spanish bullfighting, long reviled by animal rights campaigners, to a standstill.

But how well placed are Ministers from the Green Party to secure such hard-won coalition pledges?The island’s choughs have declined to some 10 breeding pairs, part of a substantial drop in the Special Protection Area for birds that covers Dursey and the cliffs of the Beara peninsula.The project ecologist for Cork County Council, Dr Paul Murphy, found the decline still unexplained but agreed that “the potential impact of human disturbance as a result of increased visitor numbers cannot be ruled out”.This now concerns An Bord Pleanála. Last month, as detailed by Friends of the Irish Environment, it wrote to Cork County Council to question if proposed mitigation measures would be enough to cope with “potential likely significant effects” on the choughs and their foraging grounds.The present proposals include peak visitor limits and a 50m “buffer zone” along well-marked paths supplied with “educational” signs. But most island visitors are drawn naturally to Crow Head at the island’s wilder western end.This is the hot spot for the choughs, especially around the end of June. It’s here, too, that visitors spill out across the open land. They risk invading the crucial “flushing distance” of the crows, put at some 31m, at which they lift and fly away.No censusIn the response requested by the end of this month, An Bord Pleanála seeks clearer proposals for managing the numbers and behaviour of visitors. It may then decide to seek further public consultation.The Special Protection Area for the island and mainland cliffs was defined by the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) under EU nature conservation directives. The objecting NGOs criticised the NPWS for failure to carry out a crucial census of the choughs or to prepare a management plan.The latter failure is common to the scores of conservation areas for which the NPWS is responsible. While sharply critical, the NGOs have also pointed to the agency’s lack of adequate funding and resources.Such opinion, pressed by the Greens, resulted in the new Government commitment “to review the remit, status and funding” of the NPWS “to ensure that it is playing an effective role in delivering its overall mandate and enforcement role in the protection of wildlife”.Before the change of government, the NPWS was held in the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, of which Josepha Madigan was minister. Now the portmanteau office has changed to the Department of Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the Gaeltacht, of which Catherine Martin, deputy leader of the Greens, is Minister.Dúchas, with national monuments as well as wildlife in its brief, took its public outreach seriously, introducing a fleet of smart little vans to bear its name. But it upset a lot of people with its assertiveness and planning appeals, and its brave new public identity was snuffed out in reorganisation. An editorial in this newspaper saw this as “a step backwards into an uncaring past”.The new present, when able to take its mind off Covid-19, is certainly less uncaring, and the Government programme has promised to “progress the establishment of a citizen’s assembly on bioersity”. Urgent attention to the NPWS, and an independence like that of the Environment Protection Agency, has been urged by NGO leaders.Like the glossy black choughs of Dursey Island, they need to keep prodding away."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4302485.1594476994!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"cluster of covid 19 infections at kerry house party investigated","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t‘While most of the cases reside elsewhere in the country, a number live in the HSE-South region,’ GPs were told.A cluster of Covid-19 cases among a large group of young people who “partied” in rented accommodation in Killarney last weekend is being investigated by public health officials, GPs have been advised.Over 30 people travelled from “different parts of the country” to Killarney and stayed a number of days together, according to a letter sent to general practitioners throughout the region on Friday.The letter to GPs comes on foot of mounting reports in the area, and on social media, of a group of people from Dublin who arrived on Thursday of last week and of a large party in a house on Saturday night last. There have been claims that a person in the group had tested positive for Covid-19 but this was not revealed to others until Sunday.At least one person who attended the house party in Killarney sought a Covid-19 test on Monday, and at least one person has tested positive, according to reliable information.There were initial reports that some of the group had socialised in pubs in the busy tourist town.However , Consultant in Public Health Dr Margaret B.

However one person used public transport and this was being followed up, Dr O’Sullivan said.“While most of the cases reside elsewhere in the country, a number live in the HSE-South region,” she said.Enhanced vigilance with regard to young people partying and Covid-19 transmission risk was underscored, the GPs were told.A low index of suspicion among young people was urged “especially in this phase of the country’s reopening, based on current national trends and by this cluster in particular,” the consultant advised.Pressed during the week by media, amid persistent reports, and concern, the Department of Public Health on Tuesday said in a statement that persons with Covid-19 in the Kerry Cork region in recent days had been identified and traced.Friday’s letter to the GPs appeared to contradict this earlier stance, confirming the arrival of the large group of young people and the house parties and saying that the persons were still being traced and followed up.The letter states: “Close contacts are being followed up and advised, and are being referred for testing. Several Departments of Public Health in other HSE areas are involved.”"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Aidan CrawleyEPAIt’s been going swimmingly for Fine Gael since the party went into coalition with Fianna Fáil and relinquished the Taoiseach’s office to Micheál Martin.Both parties are equals in Government now, though you wouldn’t have thought it this week, with an excitable and agitated Fianna Fáil tripping over the levers of power after their long layoff and a laid-back Fine Gael watching on in amusement.In the Docklands Dáil on Thursday evening, when TDs trooped across the Liffey to their temporary chamber for the end-of-week block voting session, Clerk of the Dáil Peter Finnegan commenced a roll-call vote on Labour’s Private Members’ motion on rents and mortgages.He went through the Fianna Fáil names first, in alphabetical order, and they voted.“An Taoiseach . . .” began the clerk.“Tá,” replied Leo Varadkar, head buried in his mobile phone.The place erupted with laughter and applause. Micheál wasn’t in the hall. Leo instinctively answered when he heard the call.He admitted afterwards that he hadn’t been fully concentrating during the vote. “In my defence, I was distracted trying to follow the Eurogroup election on Twitter.” Paschal Donohoe was duly elected head of the Eurogroup of ministers, making Phibsboro the financial capital of Europe.The Minister for Finance fought off strong competition for the prestigious role by running a very strong campaign. His team worked the phones day and night across the continent in the run-up to the election.“It was some operation, reminded me of the Eurovision with all the back and forth between Ireland and the rest of the EU countries,” said a delighted Donohoe supporter.On the same day, during the first vote at the Convention Centre, Peter Finnegan commenced another roll-call of members. Early on, he called “Minister Thomas Byrne”. There was silence because the new Minister for Europe wasn’t there.For some reason, his absence was a source of great amusement to giggling Fine Gael TDs and other members of the Dáil. And then, a few seconds later, when the name “Minister Barry Cowen” was called out, they giggled again.“Tá,” shouted Barry, very loudly, which almost finished some of them off entirely.The reason for the joviality was the continuing fallout from the Great Huff of 2020, when a ridiculous number of Fianna Fáil TDs threw a monumental strop because they didn’t get ministerial jobs in Micheál Martin’s new administration.The plot thickened the previous night following a wholly unsubstantiated allegation on a social media platform about who might have leaked details to the media on Barry Cowen’s drink-driving ban four years ago. Minister of State Thomas Byrne was mentioned in dispatches but, again, without foundation.But Leinster House thrives on pernicious rumour and gossip and the tweet, sent by a veteran Fianna Fáil footsoldier, set tongues wagging on Thursday. So much so that the wags were referring to “The Thomas Cowen Affair”.Much more sobering mentions of writs and legal actions were also flying along with the uninformed theories.Micheál Martin could do without the distractions.Who goes forth from the fourth estate?It’s not only TDs who take a keen interest in jobs when a new government is formed. Who might get what from this side of the fence is always a popular subject for discussion when journalists contemplate the post-election landscape.The trade has changed a lot in recent years. There was a time when hanging up the notebook and pen and heading to the Dark Side was a career choice taken by senior journalists and correspondents whose ambulance-chasing days were behind them.Not so anymore. Journalists are heading for government jobs with increasing regularity these days. It’s not usually to do with political allegiance but more to do with decisions about career advancement at a time when the news business is under pressure and permanent, pensionable jobs are a rarity.A number of Ministers, at this late stage, have still to appoint key people while the majority of positions have been filled by existing Government advisers on the Fine Gael side and senior in-house staff on the Fianna Fáil side.The shock move among the ranks of the outside appointees was from Fiach Kelly, until very recently the deputy political editor of this newspaper. He is regarded by his peers as probably the best operator in Leinster House and news of his departure – Fiach was also a very dynamic chairman of the Oireachtas gallery – came as a big surprise.He is leaving to become a special adviser to the new Minister for Justice, Helen McEntee. Dubs supporter Fiach will be missed in this neck of the woods.Also linked with a move to a ministerial department is the Business Post deputy editor, Susan Mitchell, who is earmarked for a senior role in Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly’s team.Susan is another highly-rated specialist, and her departure will be a huge loss to medical journalism.Other recent signings include former RTÉ foreign editor Margaret Ward, who has joined Minister for Climate Action and Green Party leader Eamon Ryan’s team as press adviser, while the Examiner’s award-winning Conall Ó Fátharta, who has written extensively on mother and baby homes, is tipped for a job with Minister for Children Roderic O’Gorman.Up the hill backwards for Roscommon-Galway TDCongratulations to Senator Eugene Murphy. The former Fianna Fáil TD for Roscommon-Galway successfully completed a charity 10km walk over Sliabh Bán mountain last weekend. That’s a big achievement in itself.But Eugene, who like some of us is built for comfort and not for speed, traversed the mountain by going backwards. He told us he had been in training for months ahead of his fundraiser walk in aid of local charities.Members of the public around Roscommon got used to seeing their local politician barrelling backwards around the highways and byways, while there were sightings of the Senator “almost moonwalking like Michael Jackson” around the Leinster House carpark as he prepared for his trek.“It wasn’t an easy feat but I trained very hard to get in shape for this,” a delighted Eugene told us after coming around from the mountain last Saturday. He was so flushed with success he immediately announced he intends to have walked 100km between now and next March.“I’m doing it in 10km stages – back up and down Sliabh Bán a few more times but I’ve also had requests to walk backwards in other parts of the region. My next one is in September.“We’ve all heard of backstabbing in politics, but this is a new one: backstepping.”The former radio producer and presenter with Shannonside and Northern Sound says he got some strange looks from other walkers while he was out training, “but then when I explained what I was doing they were very supportive.”He stressed the walk was conducted in full compliance with social distancing guidelines and he has already raised €5,000 for the Hub Community Cafe in Strokestown and the East Galway \u0026amp Midlands Cancer Support Centre in Ballinasloe. The cafe does terrific work for young people with intellectual disabilities and the cancer support centre is a non-profit organisation providing psychological, emotional and practical support for people diagnosed with disease.Eugene Murphy, the Senator who is forward about going backward, has set up a fundraising platform for people who want to donate a few bob, and the link to it will be in place for the next few months.Senators savour temporary return to old stomping groundYes! They knew it. It was all a dream. It was just a bad dream.Like when Bobby Ewing was famously killed off in the ’80s soap Dallas only to reappear a year later because the previous season’s storyline had been nothing more than a bad dream.That’s what the Senators who used to be TDs must have been thinking when they returned to business in the Dáil chamber on Thursday morning, sinking into those old brown leather seats and scanning the familiar surroundings with relief.February’s bruising general election, the trauma of losing a seat and then the scramble for a sliver of salvation from the Upper House, did that really happen? Ten former deputies who got the boot earlier this year – seven from Fianna Fáil, three from Fine Gael – looked very happy to be back in their rightful place.The new Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, Fianna Fáil’s career Senator Mark Daly, settled into Seán Ó Fearghaíl’s usual pew and informed his colleagues that it was the Seanad’s first sitting in the historic chamber since 1987.The recently demoted TDs didn’t talk about their former political home. The senators were far more relaxed about it.“Did any of us think we would all be here together so soon after the past few months and the general election?” wondered Victor Boyhan (Independent). “It’s always a privilege to be here. It’s a nice little space, and I am sure many of us will be motivated, having spent a few hours in here today, to give it a second look. I would encourage everyone to do that.”NUI Senator Alice Mary Higgins wasn’t getting carried away by her surroundings either. Dáil chamber? Seanad chamber? They are just rooms.“While much recognition has been given to this historic chamber, it is important to remember that the first Dáil did not necessarily sit here and that this chamber and the Seanad chamber are not the Dáil and the Seanad. Those are important historic spaces, but it is the members of the Dáil and Seanad and the work we are charged to do by the Constitution for and on behalf of the people of Ireland that is fundamentally important.”It didn’t stop a few of her colleagues taking selfies of themselves in the Dáil chamber. Once deputies can find a way of abandoning their temporary lodgings in the unloved Dublin Convention Centre for a permanent return to Kildare Street, it’ll probably be another 33 years before senators get another chance to sit there.Meanwhile, speaker Daly, who is a regular visitor to the United States and likes to rub shoulders with Irish-American politicians on Capitol Hill, is settling in nicely to his new role. He tweeted on Thursday: “One final run-through for the Senate’s session in the Chamber of Dáil Éireann (aka the House of Representatives in our Constitution).”No stone-throwing in glasshouses – or the Convention CentreIt was very much a case of people in glasshouses not throwing stones when it came to the appearance of Fianna Fáil’s Billy Kelleher in the Convention Centre on the day the new Taoiseach was elected. He was forced to apologise during the week for disregarding quarantine advice by attending the Dáil session when he had flown in from Brussels.Sinn Féin couldn’t get up on their high horse because they were in trouble over the Bobby Storey funeral in Belfast, which saw such a spontaneous attendance of thousands of mourners that the party was forced to organise two funerals – the first, complete with graveside public address system, in Milltown Cemetery and the second at the crematorium in Roselawn cemetery, where the late IRA enforcer’s final obsequies were actually observed.But Fine Gael MEP Frances Fitzgerald was also at the Convention Centre, although she may have been conducting her European Parliament duties remotely.Also spotted were Green MEPs Grace O’Sullivan and Ciarán Cuffe.Before he issued his apology, Kelleher told us he attended having considered the size of the venue and the very strict social distancing rules in operation.“The European Parliament had been holding remote sittings until June 8th when business started up again in Brussels. Everyone entering and leaving the parliament building has their temperature tested through an infrared system – it could be a few times a day. Once a week I also get a swab test, the one where they stick the swab up your nose and poke it around. It’s only a minor irritation and it’s worth it for peace of mind. So far I have tested clear.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4301745.1594404050!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"paschal donohoe s victory seen as a revolt against eu s big four","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLuxembourg’s finance minister Pierre Gramegna, Spain’s Minister for economic affairs Nadia Calvino and Ireland’s Minister for Finance  Paschal Donohoe. Photograph: Javier Soriano,Emmanuel Dunand, Paul FaithAFP via Getty ImagesPaschal Donohoe’s victory in Thursday’s election for the presidency of the Eurogroup, the influential body of Eurozone finance ministers, was welcomed with polite congratulations and good wishes. Those on the video conference clapped when the result was announced, according to people who observed the call. The EU does nothing quite so well as good manners.Privately, however, the Spanish are said to be seething at the defeat, while elsewhere in the EU it has been interpreted as a revolt of the small countries against the big beasts. Germany, France and Italy all backed the Spanish candidate Nadia Calvino. Normally that would be enough to sway any EU decision. But not this time. In Brussels, Donohoe’s victory was described as a shock defeat by Europe’s small nations of the big four, which together make up a majority of both the EU’s population and its GDP.“There’s a big feeling of surprise among the bigger nations, because nobody’s used to a vote where you have the four big countries representing over 80 percent of GDP, and then losing an election with a simple majority,” said one person who followed the contest.Calvino had been the favourite since she declared, and when she secured the backing of the German finance minister (her fellow social democrat) Olaf Scholz, it copperfastened her status. In the hours before the vote, the French also declared their support for her. Big countries and the Franco-German axis it would be difficult to beat that, one Irish source in Brussels noted pessimistically. The Luxembourger Pierre Gramegna was also in the race, although Calvino was the one to beat.Coalition of supportBut Donohoe and the team of Irish officials who campaigned for him had assembled a coalition of support among smaller northern, central and eastern European countries, which they reckoned could give them a path to victory.“It was clear from early on that we wouldn’t get the big countries. But it was also clear that there was no huge enthusiasm for Calvino,” said one official. “The big countries were publicly supportive but they weren’t beating the ditches for support for her.”The key to any election is in the votes – and the small countries had one vote each, just like the big countries.Donohoe campaigned not just as a representative of a small country, but as a bridge-builder between big and small, north and south, east and west – and between the more frugally-minded member states and those who want to see joint EU debt and funding for states who need it.The Irish embassy network swung into campaign mode in recent weeks, while Taoiseach Micheál Martin and Tánaiste Leo Varadkar also made calls to the members of their European political groupings. Gary Tobin, an assistant secretary in the Department of Finance who acts as “sherpa” for Donohoe on the EU’s Economic and Financial Committee (sherpas are the officials who prepare for the ministerial meetings) was a crucial part of the campaign, insiders say.Jobs for politiciansDonohoe also campaigned “as a politician”, says a person familiar with the events of recent weeks. Calvino is a former European Commission official, seconded to the Spanish government. But most EU finance ministers are elected representatives. Politicians tend to be in favour of jobs for politicians. “I’m an elected politician. I will run it as an elected politician,” Donohoe told them.And Donohoe also campaigned among those who weren’t going to vote for him, paying particular attention to France. He has developed a close personal relationship with Bruno Le Maire, the French finance minister, despite policy differences between France and Ireland, notably on the taxation of tech multinationals. While France didn’t support Donohoe, the Élysée didn’t try to block him, either.The voting took place by secret, electronic ballot, counted by EU officials. After the first vote, they informed the ministers that no candidate had reached the 10 votes needed for outright victory, and the meeting adjourned for a furious round of phone calls.The exact results were not given out but Irish officials reckoned they had eight votes, Calvino had eight and Gramegna had three – Luxembourg, Belgium and the Netherlands. They now became decisive for the final round, and they moved as one to the Irishman.But the result was a surprise – and for the Spanish a bitter one. Calvino said she had 10 votes promised, and one minister did not keep his word.“We had 10 votes secured. Someone didn’t do what he said he was going to do,” she told a Spanish radio station. Irish sources dispute it, but also say: it doesn’t matter now. Though maybe it does to Spain."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4302488.1594479809!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"varadkar says he doesn t fully trust banks amid profiteering claims","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment Leo Varadkar TD during a Government Cabinet meeting at Dublin Castle, Dublin. Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollins.The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Leo Varadkar, has said his assumption when dealing with the banks is that he “doesn’t fully trust what they say until it has been demonstrated otherwise.”Mr Varadkar, who is to meet the chief executives of the banks next week, along with the Minister for Finance, Paschal Donohoe, said that when you meet the banks “they talk you down with regulatory gobbledygook”.Asked if he believed the banks would not seek to make additional profits from interest breaks granted to customers because of the coronavirus lockdown, Mr Varadkar said the banks “have form, that’s the truth of this. We’ve seen the tracker mortgage scandal”.Banks have have been accused of profiteering from the Covid-19 crisis by charging mortgage interest on customers who avail of a Government-backed moratorium on mortgage payments during the crisis. The Republic’s five retail banks confirmed last week they would continue to apply interest to such loans, claiming they were relying on advice from the European Banking Authority.However, the European regulators have since confirmed that borrowers would not be pushed into default regardless of whether interest did or did not accrue on loans subject to the relief.Sinn Féin TD Pearse Doherty accused banks of “wilfully misleading” Ministers after it emerged bankers told the then taoiseach Mr Varadkar and Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe on May 11th that if interest did not continue to accrue, loans would be considered to be in default.Mr Varadkar also said he believed it was essential that the Government’s guarantee scheme for loans to business involved some risk on the part of the banks. If loans were entirely guaranteed by the State, then there would be a danger that the banks would lend recklessly. Businesses and business people would be among those who would have to pay more tax if there was defaulting on guaranteed loans.A stimulus package of up to €3 billion to be announced over the coming weeks is just one of a number of packages aimed at dealing with the crisis caused by the pandemic, he said. It is just “one of our bullets”.‘Lost decade’He said it had been a real privilege to be Taoiseach over the past three years, and his mission now was to lead the economic recovery and “ensure that we bounce back and not have another lost decade like we experienced in the past.”The state was expected to borrow up to €30 billion this year. It was important that Ireland, which already has a significant debt, avoids also having a significant deficit.“We are not seeking to be the best fiscal boys in the class, not at all,” he said. Ireland should keep its deficit so that it is in the middle of the eurozone range in terms of its deficit.He said that when compared with Northern Ireland and Britain, Ireland had done well in terms of welfare support for people who lost their incomes, but that “where we have probably fallen down is on grants” to business.An enhanced grant scheme for business is one of the elements that will be contained in the stimulus package, as will be an extension of the wage subsidy scheme.He said that overall, the supports that are being sought by different sectors of the economy comes to approximately €40 billion, and that is on top of additional costs in health and education arising from the pandemic.Being in government meant being subjected to different standards and a higher level of scrutiny. It could also be seen in relation to the level of abuse people were subjected to on Twitter.A former minister had told him a few days ago that the moment he stopped being minister “the abuse just ceased like that.”“You now see people who would be lauded when they were in opposition by the keyboard warriors, now being subject to pretty toxic abuse.”"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Thousands displaced after heavy rains trigger flash floodingMove after Japan\u0026rsquos capital records highest daily cases \u0026ndash 224 \u0026ndash since pandemic beganInfluential sister of Kim Jong-un says meeting makes no sense without reward for PyongyangMayor was reportedly subject of criminal investigation into sexual assault allegationsBilateral military deal driven by Tehran fury at bombs and arson blamed on US and IsraelBeijing calls on Australia to stop interfering following response to China imposing new security law in territoryGlory to Hong Kong, deemed to contain \u0026lsquostrong political messages\u0026rsquo, can no longer be sung or playedMost deaths have come from hardest-hit Kunamoto prefecturePM\u0026rsquos image undamaged as Bharatiya Janata party proves adept at deflecting blameFor three decades the armies of the two most populous countries have been patrolling a disputed border in the HimalayasDozen people missing on southwestern island of Kyushu as government pledges to boost rescue effortsArmy deployed to patrol the NSW and Victoria borders, closed for first time in 100 yearsFlooding and mudslides on Kyushu force hundreds of thousands to evacuate homesGlobal wrap: Subcontinent overtakes Russia, as border between Australian states to closeNew law leaves pro-democracy protesters unsure of where Beijing has redrawn the lineFourteen presumed dead while dozens remain missing in southern part of countryMore than 75,000 evacuated in southern region after landslides and torrential rainZheng Yanxiong will work with police to stamp out pro-democracy demonstrationsNorth Korea claims to have no cases of Covid-19 despite links with ChinaBeijing enraged at plan to help up to 3m residents in fallout over national security lawStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4302495.1594473938!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"bosnia marks 25 years since the srebrenica massacre","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA Bosnian Muslim woman offers prayers during a funeral ceremony for nine newly-identified Bosnian Muslim victims, at the Potocari Memorial Center and Cemetery, in Srebrenica, Bosnia and Herzegovina, on July 11th. Photograph: Fehim Demir EPA.Bosnia is marking the 25th anniversary of the Srebrenica massacre, the only crime in Europe since the Second World War that has been declared a genocide.Only a small number of survivors were allowed to take part in commemoration events due to the coronavirus pandemic.The brutal execution in July 1995 of more than 8,000 Bosniak Muslim men and boys is being commemorated in a series of events including the reburial of recently identified remains of nine victims in a memorial cemetery just outside the town in eastern Bosnia.The Srebrenica massacre is the only episode of Bosnia’s 1992-95 war to be defined as genocide, including by two UN courts.After murdering thousands of Srebrenica’s Muslims, in an attempt to hide the crime, Serbs dumped their bodies in numerous mass graves scattered throughout eastern Bosnia.Body parts are still being found in mass graves and are being identified through DNA analysis. Close to 7,000 of those killed have already been found and identified.Newly identified victims are buried each year on July 11th — the anniversary of the day the killing began in 1995 — in the memorial cemetery outside of Srebrenica.Typically, thousands of visitors from various countries attend the commemoration service and funeral, but this year only a relatively small number of survivors were allowed at the cemetery due to the coronavirus pandemic.Dozens of world leaders, including Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau and Spain’s Pedro Sanchez, US secretary of state Mike Pompeo and the Prince of Wales, have sent video messages to be played at the ceremony.Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said the genocide was “one of the worst atrocities to take place on European soil” and the “psychological wounds remain, particularly for the families and communities directly affected”.He said that although Covid-19 prevented a physical commemoration in Ireland, “it is important that we remember this event for what it was: an appalling act of genocide”.“I want to commend the work of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Association of Ireland who have worked tirelessly, along with other members of the Bosnian community in Ireland, to ensure that the events in Srebrenica have been remembered and marked in Ireland over the years.“Ireland has respect for human rights at the heart of our foreign policy, and we know from our own history the importance of reconciliation and lasting peace. We will therefore continue to support the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina on their own journey towards reconciliation.“We will also continue to support their path towards the European Union, a community which is founded on the values of equality and respect for human rights,” Mr Coveney said.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Health officials say country in \u0026lsquodangerous place\u0026rsquo after early success in curbing epidemicSpeculation grows that \u0026lsquofire\u0026rsquo may have been deliberate attack on facilityIsrael\u0026rsquos move on West Bank and Trump peace plan blocked by Palestinian rivals\u0026lsquoDefender of Israel\u0026rsquo Boris Johnson says move would be \u0026lsquoviolation of international law\u0026rsquoPlan to annex parts of West Bank condemned by UN commissioner as \u0026lsquodisastrous\u0026rsquoSome 9.3m Syrians are now food insecure, an increase of 1.4m in past six monthsSeparatist insurgents from Balochistan province claim responsibility for attackNo group claimed responsibility for the attack and Taliban has denied involvementThousands of children could die from preventable diseases because of dire state of healthcare, UN warnsArab world unites in opposition and warns of dire consequences if annexation proceedsOnly under-65s can take part and pilgrims will be quarantined before and after pilgrimageWorld community urged to reject move to intensify \u0026lsquoprofound human rights violations\u0026rsquoAmple evidence uncovered of movement\u0026rsquos widespread persecution of Yazidi minority and other ethnic minoritiesSarah Hegazi\u0026rsquos simple gesture at a concert led to outrage, persecution and heartbreakDemonstrations against prices and wages erupt in Sweida and spread to DeraaAnnexation would be incompatible with international law, Maas warnsTerror group ramps up attacks as crises including coronavirus provide opportunityGovernment pressed to speed up talks with IMF and donors to secure funds and halt slideBritish-Iranian woman seeking release after first furlough from jail in Iran since 2016Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus. A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role.

He has said his focus after Brexit will be the establishment of a British version of the US’s Advanced Projects Research Agency (Arpa).He recently instructed government advisers to read a book on Superforecasting by Philip Tetlock, as well as High Output Management by Andrew Grove.While the salary for the new role is advertised as up to £135,000, outstanding candidates could get more.The advert says the “newly created role will be responsible for establishing No10\u0027s quantitative ability” as well as advising the Prime Minister. It says the job presents an opportunity to work at the heart\u0027 of government. Applications close on July 27.Earlier this year Mr Cummings placed an advert for “data scientists, project managers, policy experts and assorted weirdos” to apply for Downing Street jobs.Mr Cummings used his personal blog to invite applications from “true wild cards, artists, people who never went to university and fought their way out of an appalling hell hole”. In a much-publicised post, he said: “If you want to figure out what characters around Putin might do, or how international criminal gangs might exploit holes in our border security, you don’t want more Oxbridge English graduates who chat about Lacan at dinner parties with TV producers and spread fake news about fake news.”Shortly after the blog advert was posted, a new Downing Street adviser Andrew Sabisky quit following reports of his controversial comments on pregnancies, eugenics and race.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"ilya khrzhanovsky apology","story":"On 23 April 2020 we published an article headed “Ukrainian prosecutors investigate Dau film project over alleged torture of children”.

Most cases are in the capital Zagreb and in east of the country, Reuters reports.The national civil protection directorate said that from Monday face masks will be obligatory for both employees and clients in shops, and also for employees in bars, restaurants and other places where there is close contact with customers.During the spring months Croatia successfully limited the spread of the disease, and by early June the number of new cases had fallen to just a few daily and sometimes none. However, the number of new cases has soared in recent weeks, with many blaming the spread on gatherings such as weddings.Croatia has so far registered 3,672 cases of the virus and 118 deaths. It’s a well known maxim that “nothing made by man is granted such immortality as a ship”.

The anomalous figures from South America may be due to the pandemic\u0027s effect on already volatile economies, according to Invezz’s David Merry.“The impact that Covid-19 has had on the industry is huge, the numbers speak for themselves,” he said.Many countries such as Russia and China are down as much as half when compared to last year.

However, they alleged that her team demanded a $10m (£7.9m) payment in return for their use of the name.According to papers filed in Tennessee, the country band are not demanding money from White and insist she will be able to continue performing under the name.Royal College of Art drops white male ersity chief amid race rowLady A, formerly Lady Antebellum, sue blues singer of the same nameThe purpose of the case is mainly to assert their rights to the Lady A trademark, which they say they have held since 2011.White told Variety that she expected the band to take legal action because they seemed “unwilling to compromise” from the beginning. She said she had planned to donate half of the $10m to charities of her choice.“I think they always knew what they were gonna do,” she said. “I was quiet for two weeks because I was trying to believe that it was going to be OK and that they would realise that it would be easier to just change their name, or pay me for my name.“Five million dollars is nothing, and I\u0027m actually worth more than that, regardless of what they think.

They disputed the science. ‘It makes it harder to escape from your car if there’s an accident!’ All that stuff.”He added: “These people will always be around.

And so many lives have been taken by this virus because we aren’t doing enough. ⠀She continued: “I really do believe in the basic goodness of people so I know we can all do this BUT still, there are many people in our country refusing to take the necessary steps to flatten the curve, and keep each other safe. People seem worried about their ‘rights being taken away’ by being asked to wear a mask. This simple and effective recommendation is being politicised at the expense of peoples’ lives.

According to TMZ, law enforcement arrived after dogs that were already on site appeared to signal they had found parts of a body in an alligator pit. It was then found that the remains were apparently those of a small animal – possibly an alligator – and officials declared the matter closed. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe dogs were reportedly brought in as part of an episode of Zak Bagans’s Ghost Adventures.

Exotic had originally left the zoo to his former business partner, Jeff Lowe, and his mother. However, the judge ruled that his transfer of the zoo land to them a few years ago was fraudulent.Lowe was given 120 days to vacate the premises and remove all of his exotic animals from the property.In a Twitter post, Exotic’s management said Baskin’s takeover of the GW Exotic Animal Memorial Park ‘was “a dark day in history”.“Carole Baskin has stolen the zoo while Joe is helpless behind bars and the world is trying to fix the brokenness in our police departments,” the tweet said.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Several areas in England are experiencing a surge in new coronavirus cases, with places in the North West appearing most at risk to a second wave of infections similar to the one seen in Leicester.The latest figures from Public Health England reveal Bradford and neighbouring Kirklees in West Yorkshire have seen high numbers of daily confirmed cases in recent days.Higher infection rates in Leicester prompted the government to introduce a local lockdown just weeks after nationwide containment measures first began to ease.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFollowing Leicester’s lockdown last week, epidemiologist Professor Neil Ferguson warned that more localised lockdowns in the UK are “inevitable”.The former government adviser said that an estimated 8 per cent of the UK population has so far been infected, and that the pandemic is still in its “early stages”.Leicester remains the worst affected area in England in terms of cumulative case rate, with more than 1,000 people per 100,000 residents having been infected by Covid-19.Other areas to have experienced similarly high case rates include Ashford in Kent and Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria, however both places have seen new cases fall substantially since May.The rate of new coronavirus infections in Ashford began to flatten off in early June, according to data collected by PHE. By contrast, daily cases in Leicester appeared to accelerate at around the same time.A similar surge occurred in Kirklees, despite the curve initially appearing to flatten one month ago. The number of new daily cases consistently fell below 20 in the first week of June, before spiking to more than 40 on 11 June.In Bradford, the number of new cases fell significantly in late May, before rising again throughout June.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.A teenager has donated more than 3,000 face coverings to The Independent’s Help The Hungry campaign to protect volunteers delivering food to the most vulnerable people.Business student James Eid, 19, has given thousands of protective coverings to our appeal partner The Felix Project, which is delivering up to 30 tonnes of food every day to those hit hardest by the pandemic.Mr Eid, who lives in Radlett, was inspired to make face coverings because his grandmother, Anna Ross, 68, has Behcet’s disease.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe condition, which causes blood vessel inflammation and has various side effects, also lowers the immune system meaning she is more vulnerable to Covid-19.Mr Eid struggled to obtain low-cost face coverings to protect his grandmother and so, spotting a gap in the market, decided to import specialist production machines and make them himself.How to support our campaignFamilies face ‘summer of hardship’, food charities warnWhat it’s like to volunteer on the frontline during a pandemicUsing money donated by his father, who is joint CEO of food company Signature Flatbreads, the Lancaster University student imported a production line of four machines, naming his new company Signature Masks.The entrepreneur has since opened a factory in Dunstable, Bedfordshire, with production beginning in earnest at the end of the month. To start with, he will make 36,000 face coverings a week, but the size and scope of the factory means he will be able to scale up production and make up to 500 million coverings annually.The coverings are disposable and made up of three-ply non-woven plastic material – meaning they are water resistant and can be worn for up to 24 hours. He will sell the coverings from his website – they will cost £3.79 for 10, or £2.99 if consumers subscribe for weekly deliveries.On donating thousands to The Felix Project, the teenager said: “I want to support those who are helping others in this crisis.” Mark Curtin, of The Felix Project, said: “These Signature Masks will help protect volunteers and staff in our food redistribution warehouses.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Viruferrin has been scientifically proven to block 98 per cent of similar viruses to Covid-19, including influenza and Sars.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe snood-like coverings can be worn for up to 50 hours before they need washing, and their effectiveness only drops to 96 per cent after over 200 hours of wear.The face coverings are cut and sewn together by Cookson \u0026amp Clegg in Blackburn, which is run by Patrick Grant, star of the Great British Sewing Bee. He is also behind a campaign to get Britons making their own coverings, The Great Community Sew.How to support our campaignThe coverings, which retail at £20, are different to medical grade PPE used by NHS workers. However, due to the protein coverings they are more effective than standard face masks at protecting wearers from viruses.There was a buzz at the Royal Park Felix Project depot when boxes of Virustatic Shield coverings arrived.David Clark, who has been volunteering for three years, said: “I think it is important to wear these face coverings when you’re delivering to members of the public who potentially come into contact with vulnerable people.”Mr Clark dropped off some coverings to Ian Breen, centre manager at Acton Homeless Concern, which serves hot meals five days a week to those in temporary accommodation or on the streets. Mr Breen said: “It is fantastic to have a delivery of some masks for free. It is important to protect those working here and the people who use our centre.”Gretchen Fisher, from Ealing, who has been volunteering for four years, added: “I wear them whenever I go out as you have to protect others.” Mantas Keblis, the depot manager, said that having “extra precautions” would help food reach more people in London. “Everyone really likes them.

And today, because of the enormous generosity of Virustatic Shield, whose innovative anti-viral snoods we’ve also been producing, 10,000 of London’s most vulnerable people will receive a vital face covering, delivered to them via The Independent’s fantastic campaign.Which star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day It is now mandatory to wear face coverings on public transport, but these coverings are in short supply.That’s why we started The Big Community Sew to encourage people to make face coverings for their friends and neighbours, and by doing so preserve vital supplies of PPE for NHS workers and care home staff who are fighting this virus on the frontline.The science behind face coverings is simple: they help prevent the wearer from unwittingly spreading the disease.

Each section features a famous face, including Morgan Freeman, Whoopi Goldberg and Sir Paul McCartney, and is signed by Sir Peter, 87.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesProceeds will go to two beneficiaries, including The Independent\u0027s Help The Hungry Now appeal partner The Felix Project.Today, Ms Lumley said it was an “honour” to be part of the fundraising effort. She said: “Double honour — to be a face in Peter Blake’s awesome collage for the Mandarin and to be a tiny part of helping Help the Hungry. It is a fabulous way of making life worth living.”Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mDame Judi said: “How wonderful that Peter Blake’s amazing artwork will have a new lease of life for such good causes. I’m very glad that maybe my left eyebrow has gone to good use.”Italian actress Caterina Murino, who also stars in the work, said: “The world is upside down. We fight for our life, we fight for the life of our brothers, and this is the feeling I have when I contemplate Sir Peter Blake’s masterpiece! A hundred stars that reflect the ersity of our world fighting to help Help the Hungry.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Our Help The Hungry appeal today passed the £7m mark, enabling our appeal partner, The Felix Project, to deliver the equivalent of 4.3 million meals to hungry schoolchildren and vulnerable Londoners in the 12 weeks since lockdown began.The milestone was reached thanks to more significant corporate donations, including an additional £100,000 from online grocer Ocado, taking its total donation to £390,000, and a further £90,000 from banking group Citi boosting their aggregate give to £250,000.It comes as the charity Feeding Britain warns that 3 million children face the prospect of hunger during the upcoming school holidays. Of these, it cautions, only 1 million are eligible for the government’s free school meal summer holiday voucher of £15 a week, with the remaining 2 million living with parents who narrowly do not qualify but cannot always afford food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHelen Barnard, of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, confirmed that the summer voucher scheme – agreed by the prime minister after being forced into a U-turn by footballer Marcus Rashford – only covers a minority of children in poverty. She said: “Soaring numbers of families are being pulled under and having to rely on food banks to get through the current crisis, even with the voucher scheme in place.”The harsh reality is that an astounding 66 per cent of food-insecure families – amounting to almost 200,000 children in London – cannot access government help and are forced to rely on food parcels from charities such as The Felix Project.Food and 10,000 face coverings donated to charities and vulnerableWhich star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day At the start of lockdown, The Felix Project faced an existential crisis with a total collapse of its fundraising. Thanks to The Independent’s campaign, it has not only been able to survive but has operated at twice its normal capacity, delivering up to 40 tons of nutritious produce a day and supplying 86 schools and 400 charities and community hubs across the capital over the course of a week.The Independent shareholder Evgeny Lebedev said: “These generous new donations take us 70 per cent of the way towards our goal to secure £10m to combat food poverty in London over the next three years. Our pledge is given added urgency by the release of worrying economic data, including that the number of people out of work and claiming benefits jumped 23 per cent to 2.8 million last month.”Jo West, of Ocado Retail, said most of its donation had been raised from Ocado and their customers via their “you give, we give” scheme. She added: “We’re extremely grateful to our customers for their generosity which enables groups like The Felix Project to bring food to people in desperate need.” James Murray, chair of the Bridgepoint Charitable Trust, which donated £50,000, said: “We are delighted to contribute to the work of The Felix Project in feeding vulnerable communities.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I would not be here if it wasn’t for this project,’ one helper saysWhat has it been like to volunteer during the pandemic? Social enterprise Bread n Butter – one of the charities supplied by our Help The Hungry appeal partner, The Felix Project – closed its doors at the end of March.However, its founders saw a growing need among the city’s most vulnerable for regular home-cooked, nutritious meals, so they joined with community centres Stonegrove Community Trust and the Hive Trust.Since then, Bread n Butter’s team, aided by volunteers, have been cooking and delivering more than 1,000 meals a day to Londoners in need in Barnet, Enfield and Brent. Here, we speak to four people who keep this project going.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRichard Simon, a furloughed IT worker, joined the Stonegrove Community Trust’s OneStonegrove project in Edgware at his wife’s suggestion. The 52-year-old said: “Working in the kitchens was like being on Ready Steady Cook. You don’t know what ingredients you’re going to be working with, so you have to think on your feet.” The father of two, who dedicates 20 hours a week, added that the biggest thing he had learnt was the power of “working together”.“For a group of people who don’t know each other, we just get on with it, working flat out. No one is being paid, we’re just working for a great cause. It has been extraordinary.”How to support our campaignBid on Sir Peter Blake’s artwork in Help the Hungry auction, say stars4.3 million meals to be delivered as Help The Hungry appeal passes £7mJoanne Karbritz, 47, works up to five hours a day, four days a week at OneStonegrove community centre. The former Oxfam shop worker, who has high-functioning autism, said that because of her condition, having a “structured day” is incredibly important. “Without routine, I can’t cope,” she said. “I would not be here if it wasn’t for this project.”Ms Karbritz, who is also anorexic, said working with food had been transformative. “Working to create healthy, nutritious food everyday has changed my relationship with it. I have also learned how to cook, whereas before I lived out of tins.”Mariana Bassi Da Silva, a software developer, wanted to volunteer as she was not working due to the pandemic. A keen cook, the 34-year-old volunteered for OneStonegrove and said the project had helped develop her love of cooking. The Brazilian-Italian, who moved to London seven years ago, said the greatest impact the project has had on her was the sense of “belonging”.“It is hard to settle in when you move,” she said. “Here, I have a community.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Mumtaz Khan’s journey to Britain began in 2009 when he fled Afghanistan, leaving his wife and two young children, in the hope that he would one day see them again. From there it took him seven years to reach the UK, most of which was spent in the Calais Jungle, where he once said the “terrible” conditions caused his mental health to deteriorate. He finally made it to the UK in 2016, only to spend four years fighting against being sent back to his home country, where he feared he would be killed by the Taliban.On 23 June this year, Mumtaz, 38, told his solicitor that the stress over his asylum refusal meant he had lost his appetite. His head was spinning. Khalid Kashy, of Hoole and Co Solicitors in Bristol, reassured Mumtaz, his new client, advising him to eat something and contact his doctor. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFour days later, Mumtaz’s body was found by members of the public outside the flat of a friend he had been staying with. Avon and Somerset Police were called to the scene just before 10pm his death is not being treated as suspicious. An inquest into the death is due to begin next week.Khalid, who had started gathering medical records and witness statements for his new client’s asylum case, says he was “devastated” by the news of Mumtaz\u0027s death. “He knew that he faced removal to Afghanistan, and he was worried the Home Office was going to evict him from his accommodation. It’s a very sad story.“Mumtaz had been living in asylum accommodation in Sunderland, but travelled to Bristol to meet with Khalid in a bid to launch another appeal against another negative decision on his asylum case. While there, he stayed with a friend, who is said to have left the house on the night of 27 June to get Mumtaz some food after realising he hadn’t eaten anything all day. He returned to find his friend’s body.The Afghan national, who was an English teacher in his home country, lost his long-fought battle in the asylum tribunals in February. He had received the first refusal in September 2018 – nearly two years after submitting his initial claim, despite the government’s target time of six months – and went on to unsuccessfully appeal the decision twice, in a desperate bid to convince the Home Office that he would be in danger if he were to return home. At one point, in May 2019, he represented himself in court because he could not get a solicitor, and successfully convinced the judge that he should be allowed to appeal because there had been an error of law in the previous court decision. Ultimately, though, the final decision was made to refuse him asylum.On 15 May 2020, Katherine Lowe, session coorindator at the Comfrey Project, a charity in Tyneside that helps refugees and asylum seekers take part in gardening, dropped off some items for Mumtaz at his address. She says he had been “visibly distressed” after receiving another rejection letter from the Home Office.“When I asked him if he was okay, he broke down in tears outside his house door,” Katherine recalls. “He said, ‘I got a letter from Home Office. They tell me no again. I don\u0027t know what to do. What can I do? I can\u0027t go back to Afghanistan.’ He was clearly very afraid of going back. The impact of this news regarding his Home Office appeal was devastating and the change in comparison to how positive he had been when things were more hopeful was blatantly clear. It was sad to see the change in his emotional state.”Mumtaz, who as an asylum seeker was not allowed to work, had spent a lot of time volunteering with the charity on their allotment sites, where he became a keen gardener, using this activity as a means of helping to manage his severe depression. Eleni Venaki, director of the Comfrey Project, says he would attend the sites several times a week and “dig all day”.“For Mumtaz, gardening was like a therapy,” says Eleni. “He was very hardworking and he liked to be useful. He didn’t like to sit down. If he said he would help with something, you could rely on him. He’d welcome people at the events we held for the community and take groups around the garden. He had a golden heart. He hated the fact that he couldn’t work. He was feeling useless and that was really bothering him.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Sometimes he was quite tearful,” she remembers. “He wanted to see his kids. He’d say he was really missing them, and that he felt guilty because he wasn’t able to send them money.”Throughout his time in the UK, those who knew Mumtaz say his mental health problems were clear. In June 2017, eight months after submitting his asylum claim, his consultant psychiatrist requested that the Home Office fast-track his application, on the grounds that he was suffering from major depression, and that his condition could be improved were he able to work. “His poor attention remains, along with difficulty with sleep due to persistent agitation. He remains relatively hopeless, and feels a burden on all our services, the letter read. Despite this, he waited another 15 months for his asylum decision.The Home Office and the courts acknowledged that Mumtaz was mentally unwell, but it was repeatedly argued that although he was ill, his condition could be controlled with medication, and there was nothing to show that medication would not be available in Afghanistan.Khalid disputes this conclusion: “What they didn’t consider was whether, while the medication could be effective in the safety of the UK with all the support around him and all the charities helping him, if you send him to a dangerous place like Afghanistan, would he be safe and would the medication be effective?”A Home Office spokesperson said it would be inappropriate to comment further before all of the facts of Mumtaz’s death have been established at inquest, but added: “Our thoughts are with this inidual’s family and friends.Syrian asylum seeker dies in hotel assigned by Home Office“The Home Office continues to work closely with its service providers to ensure our asylum system is providing the necessary support to those seeking protection. Their health and wellbeing has and always will be the priority, and we will continue to provide support to those that need it.“Sandra Watt, project development worker at Friends of the Drop In, a small charity supporting asylum seekers and refugees in Sunderland, who had known Mumtaz for more than three years, says it was evident “right from the beginning” that he had mental health problems, and that “every time he got another refusal from the Home Office, it made his condition slightly worse”.Despite the suffering he endured with his mental health, she says, Mumtaz was a generous and giving person. As a multi-linguist, he was always on hand to assist with translating for people who could not communicate in English. Months before his death, he agreed to take in a newly arrived young Afghan man after the charity’s drop-in closed, to help him settle into life in Britain.“He looked after him the whole time during lockdown,” says Sandra. “He took part in community projects, he helped with interpreting, all sorts of things, even though he was unwell himself. He was compassionate. That’s the irony. He was able to extend compassion to others, and yet he didn’t receive it here from the authorities.”His friends echo the sentiment that, despite suffering with mental health problems himself, he was generous and compassionate towards others. Bahar Gul, a friend living in a different city, says he would sending Mumtaz official Home Office letters that he would translate for him over the phone, and describes him as “bright, honest and great company to be with”.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.People gather for the funeral of Dame Vera Lynn in Ditchling, England.

She says he didn’t appear to be in crisis at that point, and that in recent months he had seemed more stable than before.“What a waste of a life. I feel really frustrated about not being able to do anything. I feel quite powerless.“No matter how much you do to try help, however much assistance or talking therapy they get, if you can’t change any of the external circumstances that are contributing to the deterioration of a person’s mental health, it’s very difficult to assist that person in getting better,” she says. “Even if the solicitor was telling him he had a good case for a fresh claim, you can see why people are pushed to the edge. And that’s what happened to Mumtaz.”If you are experiencing feelings of distress and isolation, or are struggling to cope, The Samaritans offers support you can speak to someone for free over the phone, in confidence, on 116 123 (UK and ROI), email jo@samaritans.org, or visit the Samaritans website to find details of your nearest branch.For services local to you, the national mental health database- Hub of Hope – allows you to enter your postcode to search for organisations and charities who offer mental health advice and support in your area.Asylum and Immigration\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Despite the vast differences between the two situations, Fawcett’s extensive military experiences and qualifications have helped him and his team develop a robust response to the Covid-19 crisis.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“I was the only doctor there for about 300 people, which was quite an eye-opening experience,” says Fawcett of his first stint in Afghanistan in 2007 as part of the Army Reserves. Working at the Role 2E Field Hospital in Camp Bastion and at the Forward Operating Base, Fawcett provided key treatment on the Afghanistan frontline.On his second stint in 2007, he spent three months in Camp Bastion as a Trauma Team Leader, and on his third tour in 2011, he was the clinical lead for the Medical Emergency Response Team, a four-person medical team operating from a Chinook flying over Afghanistan, picking up wounded soldiers on the battlefield.What’s more, Fawcett – who also counts a role with the Midlands Air Ambulance Charity as a helicopter doctor amongst his impressive repertoire – has completed an MSc in Disaster Healthcare. Playing an instrumental part of Stoke hospital’s response to the Coronavirus pandemic is just one more string to his bow.“I was able to take a lot of stuff I learnt and apply it from the very start,” Fawcett says of putting his Masters in Disaster Healthcare into practise. “Before the patients even get to the emergency department, we make sure there’s clear boundaries, and patients are directed to the right areas to avoid any cross-contamination.”His army tours also contributed: “Looking at the designs of how they set up field hospitals and stuff helps,” he adds. “And working with international colleagues – it’s good to get a non-UK perspective on how other countries deal with certain circumstances.”This involved an overhaul of the whole emergency area and its processes. “We now run two emergency medicine departments out of one department,” he explains. “We’ve had to basically split the whole department in half.”Now, Stoke hospital features red zones and green zones: the former is for those displaying potential Covid symptoms and the latter is for those who aren’t. As such, the pathways and patient-flow of the hospital have had to be changed to avoid any instances of contact between these areas.“We have separate ambulance entrances for red and green patients. We have two resuscitation departments, two areas for major patients, two areas for walk-in patients, two minor injuries areas, two paediatrics departments, as well as designing alternative pathways to try and stream those patients that don’t have to come through the emergency department to other places.” he explains, noting how such isions have had to be executed throughout the whole hospital to prevent crowding and maintain social distancing.How schools in England are helping pupils return to the classroomThe task may have been monumental, but Fawcett takes pride in the hospital’s response: “This is what we’ve always trained for and it’s been good to see how us as an emergency department have responded to it. We’ve ensured patient safety and staff safety has always been at the forefront.”Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

As well as two Michelin-starred pubs – The Hand \u0026amp Flowers and The Coach – he also opened a traditional butcher and founded Pub in the Park, the biggest food and music festival tour in the UK.During lockdown, staff from Kerridge’s businesses were volunteering to help a new charity called Meals from Marlow which delivers free food to NHS staff, key workers and people in need. This started small in early April and with support from over 1,000 donors, it recently ended up serving its 75,000th meal.From 4 July, both The Hand \u0026amp Flowers and The Coach have reopened fully in Marlow to welcome back hungry diners.The team have prepared a comprehensive Covid-19 policy document with a number of measures to protect the health and safety of guests and staff. Measures include daily staff temperature checks, hands-free antibacterial gel dispensers, one-way systems, private sole-use of bathrooms, cleaning touchpoints and toilets every 20 minutes, and even sanitising deliveries.Kerridge is also working with a company that provides protection against a wide range of pathogens, including Covid-19, using a sanitising treatment applied through fogging machines to provide an even coat on all surfaces, followed by manual application to hot spots, such as door handles.Form a bubble with a one-adult householdVisit your local salon, restaurant or bar, following UK Government guidelinesMeet in private gardens with up to six peopleTravel on public transport without a face covering or maskShare a car with people outside of your householdFor more information, visit gov.ukcoronavirus“Welcoming, safeguarding and taking care of others is at the very heart of what we do, says Kerridge. The last few months have been such a challenging time and we have been eagerly waiting to establish a little normality back into everyone’s lives, and get back to what we do best – providing great hospitality and food.”Kerridge\u0027s pubs have also been altered to make sure that spacing is as per UK Government guidelines. Partitions have been placed to ensure people have privacy and are able to enjoy their experience in the same way as before.Following the success of Meals from Marlow, it has now become a permanent charity and is set to provide 30,000+ meals a year to local people. “I know the people of Marlow are a very generous group but I’m astonished by the speed and the level of kindness, says Kerridge. Thank you, Marlow, I’m proud of you.”Colin Steele and Jade Windsor, pub landlords of the Falcon InnColin Steele and Jade Windsor, pictured below, took over the Falcon Inn five months before lockdown, restoring the pub as a community hub at the heart of the village of Fawley, Hampshire. After coronavirus threw a ner in the works, they were eager to reopen last weekend. “We have social distancing, hand sanitisers and a booking system, so our locals get a guaranteed spot,” says Windsor.The couple made the most of the lockdown by revamping the pub, painting the interiors and outside fencing, and putting up a pergola in the garden for some weather protection. “Because of lockdown we had the time to give the garden the love and attention it really needed,” says Steele. “Painting the fence outside has meant that we\u0027ve been able to interact with the village as they walk past. We\u0027ve been trying to bring that community spirit back.” To keep business going, they opened their car park for plant sales and teamed up with local company HMS Spirits to serve takeaway cocktails on Friday nights, which they will continue on weekends throughout the summer. “It kept us doing what we love, says Windsor, and keeping in contact with our customers.” They also recruited a chef with the goal of making back some of the lost income from closure and the now-reduced capacity that allows for distancing. Where they once accommodated 150 inside, now they can host 40. The team have ramped up hygiene measures: doors are wiped every half hour screens at the bar and face shields protect staff. Additional outdoor seating means that everyone is seated, and a new app will enable customers to order food from their tables. “We\u0027re a family-run business and everyone just wants us to succeed,” says Steele.Windsor adds: “I\u0027m sure we will come across a few issues, it’s something that no one\u0027s ever had to deal with before. I want my pub back the way it was more than anyone, but we\u0027ve all got to deal with it together.”Sarah Bentley, owner of The Cutting Room unisex salon As a small village salon that’s been open for 16 years, it’s little wonder that The Cutting Room’s loyal clientele had been keenly anticipating its reopening after temporarily closing back in March.A tight-knit team with great customer relationships, Bentley and her employees were excited to get back to a sense of normality. After a meeting last week, they felt reassured about the safety precautions put in place for their return. “It was a bit of relief coming back from staff training and just seeing everybody’s face light up and looking forward to being back,” she says. “We’ve had Zoom meetings discussing all the guidelines.”The salon may have been closed, but plenty was going on in the background to ensure that the premises and the team were as prepared as possible for a safe reopening.For example, they worked hard to keep customers informed about changes to their haircutting experience: as well as the salon now being appointment-only, clients have been informed that they are not able to enter the premises before their appointment, as well being asked to wear a face covering.“Because we are such a small salon, we have screens up between all our sections,” Bentley explains, adding that their booking and payment system has been made completely contactless.Though refreshments or magazines can no longer be provided, The Cutting Room has set up its outdoor space for clients to sit in a socially-distanced manner.The Cutting Room\u0027s kit used has also changed: “We’ve got disposable gowns, towels – everybody’s got all their completely own equipment it’s all labelled in their name – their own trollies, Bentley adds.Ultimately, safety is The Cutting Room’s number-one priority. “It’s there to keep us and the clients and my staff safe – and if I felt that they weren’t safe, I would shut the salon tomorrow,” Bentley says. “Everybody’s health comes first.Keeping you safe: a selection of guidelines for UK businesses All businesses are required to be Covid-19-secure in order to help protect their staff and customers. Here are some of the guidelines that salons, pubs and restaurants have been provided with:All businesses will have conducted a risk assessmentThorough and enhanced cleaning facilities will be available for staff and customersBookings will be limited to ensure social distancing and risk mitigationCustomers will be provided with guidance prior to their visitWorkers in continuous close contact to clients, such as hairdressers, will wear visors to promote safetyStaff will be split into teams or shift groups where possible to limit contactIndoor and outdoor seating will be reconfigured to maintain social distancing guidelinesStaggering entry times and introducing one-way systems throughout venuesContact between kitchen staff and front of house staff will be minimisedTo find out more about business guidelines, visit gov.ukguidanceworking-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

But when coronavirus hit in March, Ireland’s biggest sportswear brand had to break the habit of a lifetime and sack its entire 750-strong workforce at its Strabane factory due to the lockdown.With sports events cancelled or postponed, orders from teams and retailers vanished.However, the company was thrown a surprise lifeline when, a day after announcing the layoffs, the Western Health and Social Care Trust approached O’Neills on a Friday about fulfilling a shortage of scrubs to safeguard frontline NHS workers.Factory staff spent that weekend making sample scrubs. By the Monday, O’Neills had secured an order for 10,000 sets of maroon tops and trousers for GPs at a coronavirus testing centre at Altnagelvin Area Hospital, Londonderry.As a result, the company rehired 150 workers immediately. It has since brought back more than 400 staff overall as orders from other health trusts across Northern Ireland grew, with the remaining 350 employees being furloughed.The company now produces some 10,000 sets of scrubs a week. Managing director Kieran Kennedy, a veteran of 41 years at the business, says employees have been supportive of the switch from making sporting goods.“We are a close-knit community in Strabane. Many employees know people who work in the NHS and they want to give back,” he explains. “We could either feel sorry for ourselves or be productive and take a bite at the cherry. Without the NHS orders, we would have had no sales and no cash flow. The scrubs kept the show on the road.”Kennedy says the move outside the company’s traditional business area has been relatively easy. For instance, O’Neills had stockpiled a six-month supply of yarn – the raw material for the scrubs and other clothing – from China to hedge against Brexit uncertainty. The company knits the scrubs at its Strabane factory, then dyes and coats them with anti-viral substances at its production plant in Dublin.Workers on the factory floors are social distancing, as well as wearing face masks, sanitising their hands and having their temperature checked.Kennedy is upbeat on the company’s future prospects, noting that big sporting fixtures are returning, which should boost sales and enable him to rehire more workers. But for the foreseeable future, Kennedy plans to continue producing protective gear – an unexpected new revenue stream.   The gift shop owner donating Happy Bags to localsWhen Sarah Lloyd Williams, pictured above, had to temporarily close her quirky little gift shop in Frome on 22 March, she had no idea what she was going to do with the time ahead.At first, Lloyd Williams relished the opportunity to spend every day with her dog, Chester, taking him with other dogs out for walks. However, by nature, she is a hands-on person and soon realised she needed to find something to fill her time other than dog walking and cleaning.She had found out that someone local to her had been having a hard time. “I knew this lady slightly and wondered if there was anything I could do to help, Lloyd Williams explains. I didn’t feel that I knew her enough to contact her offering assistance, so instead I decided to leave a little gift on her doorstep.” She called it a Happy Bag, containing a copy of The Happy Newspaper (a quarterly newspaper by Emily Coxhead containing nothing but good news), a chocolate bar, bath bomb and a little note.This good deed went down very well: the recipient messaged Lloyd Williams to ask if she could buy a Happy Bag for her friend. “I didn’t want any money, Lloyd Williams explains. This was something small that I could do with items that I already sell in Figgins, so I delivered a Happy Bag to her friend and it went from there.”She ended up delivering a number of bags in the local area and it led to doing a few other little things for people, such as picking up medicines, shopping and more dog walking.For Lloyd Williams, this became a lovely way to connect with people that she barely knew, or had never met before, and it made lockdown much easier to navigate: “Giving away some Happy Bags certainly made me feel much happier. It’s a tiny thing, but sometimes that’s all it takes to make someone’s day,” she says.Figgins has now reopened, with Lloyd Williams taking steps to make sure her shop is safer with a screen, hand sanitising stations, floor stickers and limiting the number of people in the shop at any one time. Lloyd Williams is also donating a Happy Bag every week to someone in the local community.At the start of lockdown, Andy Hibbert, above, transformed his car-sharing business.Launched in 2017, Car \u0026amp Away had enabled holidaymakers to rent out their cars from Gatwick and Bristol Airports while they were away, but when the coronavirus forced airports to close, business plummeted.The CEO from south west London quickly decided to use the business\u0027 existing assets to help key workers and launched a new service: Karshare.“We had this burgeoning desire for people to rent their car from home because it was sat there doing nothing,” Hibbert explains. “But then Covid came along. As a business we were stranded. We thought: this is ridiculous. We have all the systems in place to enable us to share cars. Why don\u0027t we launch the car-sharing concept where owners donate their cars to critical-care workers and people who are supporting the most vulnerable in our community?”At the peak of the pandemic, travelling by car minimised viral spread on public transport and limited key workers’ exposure, while making their journeys easier at a stressful time. Karshare encouraged members of the public in Bristol, Brighton, London, Manchester and Leeds to donate their cars for a week to NHS staff and volunteer organisations. The cars were then deep cleaned and matched to local key workers in need of transport.Insurance and road coverage were provided for free, and the owner received a full tank of petrol as a thank you.Impressively, 700 cars have since been donated – including to 31 London NHS trusts – with a total 19,000 days of use. Leasing company ALD donated 30 new cars in Bristol. “We were overwhelmed initially about the donations,” says Hibbert.One key worker who benefited was Michaela Morris, deputy chief operating officer at the NHS Nightingale Hospital London in Docklands. “She was put into a hotel and told she needs to be on call 247, so we quickly found her a car,” says Hibbert. “It’s remarkable that she has been able to continue that work because of the generosity of the public.”Karshare also helped a care worker who had only been able to reach a couple of vulnerable patients a day on his bicycle. When he was loaned a car he could reach up to 11 – and save more lives.While Karshare is now focusing efforts on making the business profitable again, it is also inviting donations to critical workers and will ask for contributions to cover the insurance. Karshare is also being extended to the wider community, allowing people to rent their cars from home.“There are financial pressures for people,” adds Hibbert, “yet they\u0027ve got an asset on their driveway that could really help.”The distillery that swapped gin for hand sanitiserIn the midst of a global pandemic, constrained by lockdown, a fledging gin brand was surrounded by alcohol with no bars open to supply. But reports of hand sanitiser shortages hit the headlines and gave the team an idea.Sean Roche launched Aintree Gin in December 2019. An organic, craft spirit, it takes its name from its home in Merseyside – a village renowned for its famous racecourse which hosts the historic Grand National.By spring, Roche and the team had introduced the gin to over 30 establishments around Liverpool. They were gearing up for the steeplechase, but lockdown put paid to their plans. “As soon as everything started to shut … all of our income went down to zero,” Roche says.Realising online sales would be key, the team started building a website – then they had a brainwave. “News reports started to regularly mention how shortages of… alcohol-based sanitiser were putting NHS and care workers at risk,” says Roche. “We knew that because we were already using pure alcohol to make our gin, we could change our production line to make sanitiser.”Their first batch was ready within weeks. Word got out and, soon after, they were inundated with requests from care homes, hospitals and more, Roche recalls.Volunteers were recruited and more than 600 litres were donated in six weeks. But as supplies ran low, and with no money coming in, the enterprise became financially unviable. “We had two choices,” says Roche. “Stop – or start selling something.”Opting for the latter, new containers were ordered and labels designed so the sanitiser could be sold online. They started offering a range of PPE products too, from face shields to masks. “This created a revenue stream that allowed us to continue,” adds Roche.A PPE pop-up and free hand sanitiser stations at an Asda store followed. “We donated more than we made in profit over the period,” Roche admits.Today, sales are going strong.

The provincial agricultural department said in a statement that the dog meat trade had descended into “anarchy” in recent years, causing rabies and other diseases to spread from region to region.The department said in a statement that the “catching, buying, selling and slaughtering of dogs” would be punished “severely”, with maximum penalties including five years in prison and fines of up to 50 million riel (approximately £9,700).Dr Katherine Polak, head of Four Paws, said: “The historic decision by the Siem Reap government to ban the stealing, trading and killing of dogs is a huge milestone for animal welfare in Cambodia and is reflective of current sentiment among Khmer people.UN warns of ‘steady stream’ of infectious zoonotic diseases‘If we don’t buy, they don’t die’: Tackling the wildlife trade demandCan social media be weaponised against the illegal wildlife trade?Prince William backs report to ‘end the illegal wildlife trade’Yulin Dog Meat Festival: How did it start and will it get banned?“We hope that Siem Reap will serve as a model for the rest of the country to follow suit to protect the lives of millions of dogs.”The dog meat industry in Cambodia sees an estimated three million dogs slaughtered for consumption annually. Thousands of animals are transported from Siem Reap to different parts of the country each month, including to the capital, Phnom Penh.Tea Kimsoth, director of the provincial agriculture, forestry and fisheries department, told Reuters that demand for the meat was driven by foreigners, especially South Korean visitors to the country.“They like it, that’s why it led to restaurants serving it, so now we ban it,” he said, adding that the trade was “alarming”.The Cambodian province’s decision follows China recent ban on the sale of dog and cat meat. The animals were kept in poor conditions, making them vulnerable to disease that could be transmitted to humans, said activists.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The National Audit Office said the wait time can exacerbate claimants debt and financial dficulties and hit those households already struggling to make ends meet.According to the report  per cent of low-income households have deductions from their benefits of up to  per cent when their first payment does come because of taking out debts to cover the wait time. This is compared to  per cent of all households. The Sun launched the Make Universal Credit Work campaign to slash wait times for first payments so people arent forced to sell their belongings or take out loans to survive - and to make it easier for people to get back to work.According to research by the Department for Work and Pensions rent arrears increase more rapidly after a claim for the benefit - sending households further into debt. Think-tank Resolution Foundation found many people struggling to get by during lockdown did not take advance payments while waiting for the first Universal Credit cheque over fears of being saddled with more debt.The wait time for the first payment often stretched far beyond the estimated five-week-wait time - at least six per cent of households in  - or , new claims - were forced to wait  weeks or more the full payment. Experts have warned the wait time can push people into severe hardship and even cause them to feel suicidal. But the NAO did find the DWP had signicantly improved the proportion of claims paid on time, from  per cent in January  to  per cent in February .One million people are already receiving it and by the time the system is fully rolled out in , nearly million will be on it.But there are big problems with the flagship new system - it takes five weeks to get the first payment and it could leave some families worse off by thousands of pounds a year.And while working families can claim back up to  per cent of their childcare costs, they must find the money to pay for childcare upfront - we’ve heard of families waiting up to  months for the money.Working parents across the country told us they’ve been unable to take on more hours - or have even turned down better paid jobs or more hours because of the amount they get their benefits cut.It’s time to Make Universal Credit work.

Now they say I should be working more than  hours, but how can I when I’m looking after my nephew as well Iain Porter of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation said the five-week wait should have been ditched long before the coronavirus pandemic.

Nobody has to wait five weeks for payment.“As the report shows, signicant improvement has been made in the proportion of Universal Credit claimants receiving their first payment on time and in full, currently around  per cent.“We’ve also increased the standard allowance by up to £, a year, as part of a package of welfare measures worth over £. billion to support the most vulnerable.”  To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This is a change that is never going to go away.Mr Hancock also called for a study to be done into the efficacy of remote working, though he said the broader benefits of the practice - particularly for women - made it worth sustaining in the long-term.Theres a debate as to whether people work better when theyre working from home and its really dficult to know whether productivity goes up or down, but weve just had a massive experiment in that and we need to understand the answer to that, he said.Theres a big argument that productivity has gone up during this when people are working from home, certainly in terms of well-being.The main beneficiaries of home working were women as they tend to have more childcare responsibilities, he said, adding: Evidence showson average benefits women more than men.At the moment employers have to consider flexible working requests, such as job-sharing, working from home or ying hours.But theres no legal obligation for them to say yes.Officials at the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy department have now suggested making the right to work from home into law, Thereported last month.One Government minister told the publication: It makes complete sense.British businesses look set to be more flexible about working from home in the future – with nearly half of bosses believing it will save them money.Seven in  are now considering changing previous rules and regulations, after being so impressed with how staff have reacted.Three out of five people surveyed by Halax said they did not expect things to ever go back to normal.Many saw working from home as a way to be kinder to the environment, too.Many big employers have told their employees to work from home for the meantimethey can - some have been informed the changes will become semi-permanent for the next few months.Other offices are operating a hybrid system where some workers come in a couple of days a week, and work from home the rest of the time.Strict new rules are operating in workplaces, where there is a maximum capacity that can be in at any one time.Screens are put in place in some workplaces, and markers on the floor telling people to stay apart.The Government has said people who have to work in person at a site should do so.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And I still get a thrill when I find that the plane waiting at the airport gate has that distinctive roof bubble. It’s not my absolute favourite machine in the world but it’s certainly up there. Which is why I was sad to hear this week that, thanks to the ’s thirst for fuel, Boeing has pulled the plug.Back in the Sixties, everyone assumed the future of air travel would be glamorous and sexy and supersonic. That’s why Britain and France teamed up to make Concorde — which IS my absolute favourite machine in the world.But giant American airline Pan Am thought dferently. They wanted a plane which would carry lots of people cheaply, which meant it had to be big. So they went to Boeing and, in just  months — a staggering achievement — the  was born. It was not an easy birth. Pilots found in test flights that the wings would flutter.So, to solve the problem, engineers fitted ballast made from depleted uranium.There was also a problem with engines stalling for no obvious reason and an even bigger problem with the regulations, which said all passengers should be able to evacuate the cabin in less than  seconds.That’s just about possible when there are only  people on board but notthere are . Especially when  of them are up on the top deck.Still, they solved the issues at breakneck speed — by throwing people out and breaking their legs — and even though one of the first planes crashed into a post while landing and ripped off its undercarriage, the  went into production. And straight into another problem.A massive recession meant no airline was going to be daft enough to spend millions on one of the new behemoths, so in an -month period only two were sold. Both to Aer Lingus.Eventually, though, the  caught on and, soon, it became the only realistic way of giving yourself epic jet-lag.It was fast, too. Not as fast as Concorde, obviously. But when there’s a tail wind, pilots often have to ease back on the throttle of a  to stop it going through the sound barrier.And then there’s the safety record. Over the years a few have crashed but subsequent investigations have almost always found the plane wasn’t to blame. It was shot down, the pilot had been impatient or there had been a mistake with the servicing.Usually, though, the plane would survive. On flight UAL  from Los Angeles to Sydney in , the cargo door blew off, taking several square feet of fuselage with it.Nine passengers were sucked out and at least one went through the number three engine, which immediately broke.Shortly afterwards, flames began to appear from engine number four so the pilots, suffering from giddiness as the oxygen system had been knocked out by the explosive decompression, had to shut that down too. But despite all this, the plane landed safely and no further lives were lost.Over the years, the  has been militarised and turned into an airborne command-and-control centre for the US President. It’s been used as a fire engine, carrying , gallons of water to douse forest blazes. And it’s carried space shuttles on its back.But it’ll be remembered most of all for the joy it brought to the world, taking people to places they could never have visited before it came along. There’s no other plane like it. It even had a face like Thomas The Tank Engine. I shall miss it.GINA Prince-Blythewood, the female director of new action movie The Old Guard, says that “being able to throw a punch . . . is the biggest giveaway in an action film with women”.That’s presumably why she cast Charlize Theron in the lead role.Having seen Mad Max: Fury Road and, better still, Atomic Blonde, you get the sense thatyou bumped into the South African actress in a pub, you’d be very careful not to spill her pint.THERE have been queues round the block in London for a pair of limited-edition Air Jordan  OG Dior training shoes which cost, wait for it, £,.They are not made from gold or the foreskin of a rare whale. The laces are not studded with rubies and there is no platinum in the soles.They are just shoes.But somehow, it has been decided they should cost more than the very tidy  Mini Cooper I saw on Auto Trader this week.I NEEDED this week to set up an online presence for my new farm shop and, like every other old person, I called my daughter who popped round to help.In a blizzard of activity, she went online, bought something called a domain name, started a new email address, linked it to my phone, and then, by pressing and holding ious buttons, created an Instagram account. Throughout the whole process, she gave a running commentary, explaining what she was doing and why, and it was incredible.Because although I could tell she was speaking in English, I literally didn’t understand a single word she said.WHENEVER countries are asked to check their beaches for cleanliness, Britain always sends an army of boffins to the coast with test tubes and pipettes and some litmus paper.And having analysed the reports, we always say our beaches are filthy.Every other country, meanwhile, does no checking at all and says their beaches are fine.And I’m beginning to wonderthe same sort of thing is going on with the coronavirus figures. According to the latest numbers, there have been  Covid deaths in India for every one million people in the population. The number for Pakistan is , Turkey is , Egypt is  and Russia is . Whereas in Britain, it’s a whopping .This is seen as proof that we are the dirty man of the world, that we don’t wash our hands, that we cough all over one another and that our useless Government has done a terrible job.Or is it actually proof that we are the only country that’s counting properly TWO out of three people in Britain aged  to  think the Battle of Britain might be something to do with the English Civil War.So there’s a message for the BBC. If it’s serious about wooing younger audiences with something inspirational and educational, that shows -year-olds doing something truly heroic, how about clearing the schedules this weekend and showing the Battle Of Britain movie. I SEE it’s now possible to suffer from something called “unconscious racism”. This means you are being racist when you don’t think you’re being racist.So let’s just get this straight. I’m currently thinking about making a sandwich.

It totally devalues the honours arrangements. “The honours committee should find some way of stopping this practice.”A Cabinet Office spokesman dismissed Mr Blanchards claims he would receive feedback from “people who matter” before an application was submitted.“This claim is nonsense – honours are earned, not bought and the process cannot be influenced,” they said.“Attempting to sell honours is illegal. Anyone who suspects wrongdoing should contact the police.The spokesman added: “We do not endorse the use of fee-charging services when submitting nominations.”Mr Blanchard said he was proud of the “entirely legal and above board” service he provided.He added: “The awards process really is wholly independent – no one can ever guarantee a result.”Awards Intelligence claims to have a  per cent success rate in gaining Queen’s Honours for their clients. The Mayfair-based company has a number of packages which include the “Windsor” package that costs , plus VAT, the “Balmoral” deal at £,, up to the £, Sandringham service, which includes  “professionally drafted letters of support” and an ,-word ghost-written nomination.For a whopping £, and £, Awards Intelligence will provide the “Ultimate package” which includes the direct involvement of its chief executive, Mark Llewellyn-Slade.An employee working at the firm told an undercover reporter that it has worked with  clients in total with up  people signing up every year.Another company, Bayleaf Honours, charges slightly less than Awards Intelligence for their services. The firm says its clients include “A-list showbiz and sports stars” as well as charity workers and business leaders.Despite not being able to nominate yourself, Bayleaf Honour’s boss Mike McKie told a Mail undercover reporter that seven in ten of his clients were “self-nominating”. In these cases, the client appoints a trusted colleague or friend who agrees to be their official nominator.Bayleaf Honours then does “all the work in the form” but makes sure it is submitted from the email of the official nominator because “we keep ourselves out of it”, Mr McKie said.“We operate in a way to make sure their name is never associated with working with a company like us.“So when we reach out to get letters of support, obviously we would never say this person is nominating themselves. “We would say, we are working on behalf of an anonymous client who wishes to nominate X for an honour. So discretion is built into what we do.”Mr McKie said: It’s not cash for honours, we don’t have secret access to people, we don’t do secret lobbying.“We know how the process works and we just take all of the facts in the nominees’ case and work with the supporters and just make sure a great case gets presented that is compelling and clear and meets all of the criteria. We don’t promise success.”A spokesman for Bayleaf Honours said: “We always make it clear to prospective clients – as we did to your undercover reporter – that there is a free option directly on the Government website, and that we promise no access or influence directly on the honours process.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Since the coronavirus outbreak first came to global attention earlier this year, the Chinese government has faced accusations that it sought to silence anyone who had earlier tried to raise the alarm. Doctors have reported being detained after speaking out on social media about what they were witnessing, while journalists have recounted being harassed and having their equipment confiscated after trying to report on the issue. Speaking to Fox News, Dr Li who travelled to the US in late April, said she was one of the first people to begin researching the new virus, but that her efforts were stled.The reason I came to the U.S. is because I deliver the message of the truth of COVID, she said. If I tell it in Hong Kong, the moment I start to tell it I will be disappeared and killed.The claims come days after a new security law was passed in Hong Kong that critics say will allow Beijing to target its political opponents within the territory. Dr Li said she her supervisor first asked her to conduct a secret investigation into a new SARS-like virus in Wuhan on December  of last year. The China government refused to get overseas experts, even including ones in Hong Kong, to do research in China, she said.So I turned to my friends to get more information.She said she then spoke to a number of contacts, including one who worked at Chinas Center for Disease Control and Prevention.She said the friend told her of an unknown virus that had emerged in Wuhan and that family cluster cases, an indicator of human-to-human transmission, had been observed. She was also told that the number of cases was thought to be rising exponentially. She claims that, when she took her findings to her superior, she was told to keep silent and be careful. He warned me..., Dont touch the red line, Dr Li said, referring to the unspoken limits placed by Beijing on such investigations.We will get in trouble and well be disappeared. The last week has seen Beijing impose draconian new laws in Hong Kong, previously guaranteed autonomy under an arrangement known as one country, two systems.The law is vaguely worded, but targets offences such as secession, subversion, terrorism, and collusion with foreign forces.Critics say the law will erode the freedom of the press, the independence of the judiciary, and the right to peaceful protest within the territory.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Louis Chauvin, , who runs the Jaguar Shoes bar in Hoxton, told The Times: “It’s quite hard to communicate to customers, especially after two or three drinks, that they need to behave. They can’t just get up and go to the bar and get a drink or go to another table and chat to someone random they don’t know. Mostly the issue we have is there’s a table of pretty ladies and a table of pretty boys and they just go over, like, ‘All right do you want a drink ’ — you can’t do that.”In Leeds, party goers piled into kebab shops and cuddled up with friends on the street.Revellers hugged each other tightly, held hands and enjoyed one anothers company after months of minimal contact.

He said: “The older crowd don’t seem to be coming in as much, it’s all lager that we’re selling at the moment — so you can tell it’s a younger age group.”It comes after pubs and bars reopened on Super Saturday last week for the first time in three month.Pictures from last weekend showed Soho’s streets packed with many throwing social distancing out the window.Some million pints were drunk over the course of Super Saturday and John Apter, the chairman of the Police Federation, said it was crystal clear that people cannot follow social distancing measures when theyve been drinking.Mr Apter, who was on sht in Southampton where he dealt with naked men, happy drunks, angry drunks, fights and more angry drunks, said: What was crystal clear is that drunk people cant wont socially distance.It was a busy night but the sht managed to cope.

This is a change that is never going to go away.”Mr Hancock also called for a study to be done into the “efficacy” of remote working.“Theres a big argument that productivity has gone up during this when people are working from home, certainly in terms of wellbeing,” he said.Most UK office workers do not want toto normal workplaces and hours, according to a poll by Theta Financial Reporting.And nearly two thirds of employees agreed with the statement: “I do not feel comfortable commuting to work via public transport anymore, and think it will be one of the most stressful parts of my day.”Some firms have said they see their staff working from home beyond the pandemic. A building society said it would be a “long time” until its Cardf headquarters was full again and has encouraged its  staff to work from home until September - and possibly beyond.Julie-Ann Haines, chief executive of Principality Building Society, said the company has seen the benefits of home-working.She said: “We have proven that people can be just as effective,not more so, working from home.“The benefits including trading daily commute time for increased time at home, for exercise or for personal development, are helping colleagues to feel more satisfied, engaged and more productive.“Increased remote working will also have a positive impact on ensuring there is less traffic on the roads, supporting the improvements the globe is seeing in reduced carbon usage.”International law firm Dentons is permanently shutting its offices in Aberdeen and Watford to allow its staff to work from home full-time.Lisa Sewell, managing director for the UK, Ireland and Middle East said: “The success of remote working during lockdown has made us really stop and think about how we can learn from this new way of working to accelerate the physical and behavioural changes that form part of our strategy to build the law firm of the future.”Twitter has told its staff they can work from home “forever”they wish.And Facebook and Google have said they will allow employees continue working from home for at least the rest of the year.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But when it came to saying sorry for his own actions, like taking us into an illegal war in Iraq which killed  British service people and hundreds of thousands of locals, he couldn’t do it. The best the trained lawyer could come up with was to express “sorrow” and “regret” for any mistakes he had made. Boris Johnson is similar to Blair in many ways. He lacks any defined ­political ideology and is a ham actor who believes charm is man’s most powerful character trait. And he too has said sorry when there was little political capital to lose.Chasing the BAME vote at the last ­election, he apologised for the “hurt and offence” caused by Islamophobia in the Tory Party. And after approving an article in the Spectator magazine he was editing in , which claimed drunken ­Liverpool fans caused the  deaths at ­Hillsborough, he was forced up to the city by his party leader to apologise. But, like the man himself, it was insipid, insincere, and accepted by no one. Only in , when the Hillsborough Report demolished the article’s unfounded claims, did he offer an unreserved apology. And only after David Cameron, whose job the then London mayor coveted, had grovelled to the Hillsborough families from the Commons floor. An apology issued by Cameron because the blame game was up. More than  years after the Establishment, led by Margaret Thatcher, had accused fans of killing their own to sht guilt from itself, the truth had been established. And they had no option but to abide by it. Watching Labour leader Keir Starmer fail to elicit an apology from Johnson for blaming care workers for the appalling Covid death toll in their residential homes, I was hit with a nauseous sense of deja vu. Once again the blame game was kicking in. Johnson’s accusation that “too many care homes didn’t really follow procedures” was so deliberate and specic it had to have been crafted by Downing Street lawyers. They know an independent inquiry into Britain’s appalling Covid- death toll will conclude that confused government guidance, lack of testing and PPE, plus sending untested hospital patients back into care homes, were the main reasons , residents, % of all Covid deaths, perished between March and early June.

Lidos, water parks, outdoor theatres and grassroots sport are allowed to resume from today, just a week after pubs, hotels, hairdressers and restaurants reopened on aposSuper Saturdayapos. Further changes are coming on Monday, when beauty salons can reopen, and on July  when indoor pools and gyms should get the green light. But social distancing rules - stay two metres apart, or one metre with mitigations like a mask - still apply and the pandemic is not over. As the aposRapos number creeps close to  in England, the WHO has warned coronavirus is still accelerating across the world. So despite that, what is changing from today  Hereaposs what you need to know. The governmentaposs blanket -day quarantine order on arrivals to the UK was lted yesterday. But onlyyou arrive in England , and only for arrivals from specic countries. The full list of countries you can travel to quarantine-free is here. Go to a lido or a water park  Outdoor swimming pools and water parks are allowed to re-open from today in England. So can outdoor hot tubs, hydrotherapy pools, whirlpools and jacuzzis. Timed bookings will reduce the number of people using a pool at one time - and people will be encouraged to shower and change at home. Operators will be told to ensure an appropriate number of people are in a swimming pool at any one time - to allow three square metres per bather. Watch a game of grassroots football... once the sport is approved by government  The government has given the green light for grassroots sport to- starting with cricket from July . But it must be organised team sport, and each inidual sport must submit an action plan and related guidance to the government before it can restart. These include collecting information on participants at both training and matches to support Test and Trace. All players, officials, volunteers and spectators must undergo a self-assessment for any Covid- symptoms. Clubs should strictly limit the time spent congregating at a venue before a match begins. Players should arrive changed and ready to warm up, limiting time spent waiting around or in changing rooms. And basketballs, cricket balls and footballs may need to be cleaned regularly, such as every time they go out of play.  Theatres, operas and dance troupes in England can restart outdoor shows from this Saturday. It will allow the Glyndebourne opera festival to go ahead this year - along with the Minack Theatre in Cornwall. But disaster looms for Londonaposs West End after the government failed to give a date for when indoor shows can resume. Instead the industry will pilot a number of small indoor performances with a social distanced audience to help devise a reopening plan. Theatre venues will be forced to operate at a reduced capacity with only limited tickets - all of which must be bought online. Venues should have social distancing marking, deep cleaning of auditoriums, and long enough gaps between shows to deep clean. Only professionals may sing or play brass or wind instruments in front of an audience. What you canapost do yet Gather in big groups or hug people outside your household There are still limits on seeing family and friends in England. Outdoors, gatherings should consist of no more than either six people or two households, with proper social distancing. Indoors, gatherings should consist of no more than two households - again, with proper social distancing. The exception isyouaposre part of two households joined together in an exclusive support bubble. If so, you can hug and kiss and are essentially one household. This applies in pubs as well as private homes but it is guidance, not the law. The law only prohibits gatherings of more than  people.

By June , four food factories had reported more than  workers between them testing positive with the virus. But unions fear the full total across England and Wales could be far higher.In a meeting between unions and Labour, attended by the Mirror, reps said some low-wage food workers cannot afford to isolate on £.-a-week Statutory Sick Pay. Unite regional officer Brian Troake said “people simply cannot afford to have the time off”. He claimed some workers do not want to be tested “because when they’re tested, they can’t earn any money.” He added: “We’ve got thermal CCTV cameras now on the entrance to the sites. “And even when the alarms are going off, you’ve got a manager stood there saying ‘don’t worry about that, keep on going.’ They need you in the factory. Because they need to make the numbers.” Askedhe had heard of similar cases, Eamon OaposHearn, National Officer at GMB, said a survey of the union’s food and drink members found % could not afford to stay away from work.He added the “response rate fell through the floor” when the same people were then askedthey’d keep going to work, eventhey had symptoms. The British Meat Processors Association has disputed Unite’s claims that workers are exploited or on precarious contracts. The industry body insisted its members pay a “fair wage” and branded Unite’s claims ” and misleading”, adding there have been  outbreaks in food plants so far.  It comes after the governmentaposs own scientic advisors called for extra financial support for people forced to go into  daysapos coronavirus isolation. People who develop symptoms, or have contact with a confirmed case, are told to isolate for  days. They can receive Statutory Sick Pay - but any further payments are up to their employer. Chief Scientic Advisor Patrick Vallance has highlighted the cold, noisy environment factories as a risk for food factory workers. Environment Secretary George Eustice suggested canteens or car-sharing could be to blame. But Unite accused ministers of ignoring the financial element. The union said they were alerted to one possible factory outbreak by bus drivers, who rang the union worried about the state of people they were taking to factory gates.

What you eat – and when–has a massive impact on your state of mind. These simple tips from ­nutritionist Jane Clarke can help you feel happier during these challenging times. . Start with breakfast Jane says: “Eating soon after we wake can help to balance our blood sugar and ­hormone levels to give us vitality and mental focus for the day. “I recommend ­protein – poached eggs, full-fat Greek yogurt with fruit, or a bowl of porridge with nuts and seeds.There’s also a psychological effect of having a good breakfast.Knowing you have eaten well helps you to feel in control, so you are more inclined to keep up the good work ­throughout the day.” . Eat the right carbs “Complex carbohydrates, such as sweet potatoes, porridge oats and wholegrains, are processed by the body more slowly than their refined counterparts, such as white bread and pasta. “Eating these means you won’t get a classic high followed by a crash that makes you feel sluggish and irritable.  “Carbohydrates also trigger a response in the body that leads to the ­production of the ­feel-good chemical serotonin in the brain.This soothing effect can be felt around  minutes after ­eating a carb-rich meal.” . Feel-good foods “If low mood or anxiety is a problem, you may find some relief by increasing the amount of tryptophan-rich foods in your diet. “Tryptophan is used by the brain to produce the happy hormone serotonin. It is chicken, turkey, eggs, ­salmon, tuna, beans, lentils, dark green leafy vegetables, nuts and seeds. “Oh, and chocolate. Chocolate also contains ­theobromine, which is ­proven to boost mood and relaxes muscles, creating a calming effect.” . Cut back on caffeine “I never miss my morning coffee but drinking caffeine after lunch can make me feel twitchy and anxious and it does not help me to sleep later on. “If you’re sensitive to ­caffeine, switch to a fruit or herbal infusion after pm to keep on an even keel.“Calming teas include chamomile, bergamot and lemon balm. “Before bed, switch to sedative brews, such as blue vervain, ­valerian and hops. “And a glass of fresh milk can remind us of a childhood ­wind-down routine.” .

Despite spending £.m of taxpayers on Frogmore Cottage, where the couple live, the Duchess of Sussex reportedly always wanted to leave Britain.The cash was spent renovating the Grade II-listed building after the couple married in . Frogmore Cottage was given to the royal pair by the Queen when they got married.But, according to royal photographer Arthur Edwards, Meghanaposs plan was always to leave the UK with Harry as soon as possible, The Sun reports.He told TalkRadio: All that house refurbishment at Frogmore and the money that they spent on that, she had no intention of staying here. He added: Unfortunately for the last couple of years, [Harry] has gone completely sour. He didnapost talk to me for a year, Iaposve been photographing him since he was born, and it was down to her. Meghan was understood to have chosen eco-friendly, toxin-free, vegan paint for the walls of the property. Five apartments were knocked together to re-form the cottage, while beams, floors and the water and gas systems were replaced. When they quit being full-time royals earlier this year, Harry vowed to repay the cash. Now it is believed the couple have agreed a “rental-plus” deal, above market rate, to keep Frogmore as their official UK base. The Queen made it clear they can use it indefinitely. The couple initially moved to Canada, but now live in Los Angeles, along with baby Archie. They are said to be living in a £ million mansion owned by actor and director Tyler Perry. The actor and director is reported to have given the royal couple the run of the expansive Tuscan-style villa. It boasts eight-bedrooms and  bathrooms, and was custom-built by Perry after he bought the -acre site back in . They are staying there with their son Archie and have already beefed up security there by erecting ft high screens around the back of the property. The couple have shared a few glimpses inside their new home on video calls as theyaposve done virtual engagements with charities and organisations during the pandemic.

Emma Forrester, from Stafford, was shocked into losing the pounds after seeing photos of herself at her sonaposs christening. The -year-old had gone from a size  to a size  during her surprise pregnancy when she was . NHS worker Emma, who gave birth to baby Finn in September , had only been with her now fiance, Dominic Garner, , for three months when she fell pregnant. Whilst Emma was pregnant, she would snack and binge on food during the day and managed to put on seven stone - which she struggled to sht for a year after Finn was born. But when Emma was too ashamed to share photos of Finnaposs christening with her family because of the way she looked, she was spurred into action. Emma, who weighed  stone  at her heaviest, now weighs nine stone and is hoping to train to become a PT to help other mums who want to lose weight. She said: I used being pregnant as an excuse to eat and I constantly felt hungry - I would snack so much.  With having a newborn, I was stuck in a rut and found myself sitting on the sofa all day snacking and bingeing on food. When I saw the pictures of myself at my sonaposs christening, I couldnapost look at the photos or share them because I hated the way I looked and since then, I told myself that I wouldnapost get back to that weight. I plucked up the courage to join a gym and when I first went, it was extremely daunting - I felt like people were looking at me so I would wear big hoodies to cover myself up.  I didnapost feel that big at the time but now I look back and think, woah Iaposve come a long way. My mental health has improved so much and I feel so much healthier but I do have anxiety about being pregnant again in the future - I donapost want to put it all back on. Emma, who had been working as a community house support worker, gave birth to her surprise baby Finn in September  and had to completely change her lestyle. Being a first-time mum, I was only  and my whole lestyle changed.  I was at home more - I used to be out all the time with my friends and going places. It did have a bad effect on me, I went through a bad stage with my mental health because I was doing the same thing every day and just waiting for my partner to come home. It was Finnaposs christening that was the final straw for her to begin her weight loss journey.  I started doing couch to K which really helped because I hadnapost exercised for such a long time and it really eased me in. I havenapost done any crash diets, I eat what I want but I just make sure Iaposm in a calories deficit which I track by using apps and fitness bands. My fiance really pushed me and encouraged us to start doing family exercises such as going for a bike ride or going for a long walk. Now, Emma is a healthy size eight and much happier with the way she looks.  Speaking directly to other new mums looking to lose weight, she said: Donapost be hard on yourself, it takes time. I have so many people ask how I did it but itaposs taken me time. You have to be patient a lot of people expect to lose so much weight so quickly.

Last night pubs in England were open for their first Friday night since lockdown. In Leeds, people were seen huddled close together in kebab shops after partying into the early hours. Under the government regulations, people from separate households should keep at least one-metre apart - but flirty Brits are making it dficult for bar staff to enforce. Louis Chauvin, , who runs the Jaguar Shoes bar in Hoxton, told The Times : “It’s quite hard to communicate to customers, especially after two or three drinks, that they need to behave. They can’t just get up and go to the bar and get a drink or go to another table and chat to someone random they don’t know. Mostly the issue we have is there’s a table of pretty ladies and a table of pretty boys and they just go over, like, ‘All right do you want a drink ’ — you can’t do that.” Revellers hugged each other tightly, held hands and enjoyed one anotheraposs company after months of minimal contact. Brits have been urged to aposbe sensibleapos with the restrictions.  Roy O’Keefe, owner of The Tib Street Tavern in the Northern Quarter, Manchester, said it was the younger customers who were mostly embracing the new freedoms. He said: “The older crowd don’t seem to be coming in as much, it’s all lager that we’re selling at the moment — so you can tell it’s a younger age group.” Pictures from Super Saturday last weekend showed the streets of Soho packed and little sign of social distancing or mask-wearing.  There has been no suggestion yet that pubs reopening in England has caused an increase in the number of infections but there is normally a two-week delay between someone being infected and a positive test. Some million pints were drunk over the course of Super Saturday and John Apter, the chairman of the Police Federation, said it was crystal clear that people cannot follow social distancing measures when theyaposve been drinking. Mr Apter, who was on sht in Southampton where he dealt with naked men, happy drunks, angry drunks, fights and more angry drunks, said: What was crystal clear is that drunk people canapost wonapost socially distance.

Reporting on the  wedding I wrote that, as her long lace veil swept the ancient floor of St George’s Chapel “it felt asshe was brushing away the cobwebs from the dusty old House of Windsor.” Princess Diana broke the mould in  but, I predicted “the new Duchess of Sussex looks set to smash it – and help rebuild the monarchy for our modern, multi-racial times.” Well, I got the first bit right. And I still think it’s a crying shame that Meghan and Harry didn’t have the gumption or guts to work towards that vision within The Firm. It all looked so ­promising. Harry was the Queen’s Commonwealth Youth Ambassador and Meghan showed her commitment to the “family of nations” by having the flowers of all  countries sewn into that veil. The pair were then made President and Vice-President of the Queen’s Commonwealth Trust, and retained their posts even when they quit royal duties in January. Because the Queen believed her cherished Commonwealth had two passionate new champions to “promote prosperity, democracy and peace and amply the voice of small states.” Sadly for Her Majesty, it’s clear from a bizarre video call this week the only voices Meghan and Harry want to amply are their own.  The hollow, hypocritical voices ­spouting woke psychobabble which lecture others about equality and privilege from a £million ­borrowed mansion in Hollywood. The rehearsed words of a man who appears subsumed by his we’s belief system but is still having dficulty getting his head round it. They dropped in on a virtual meeting of young leaders discussing the Black Lives Matters movement. But Harry said the Commonwealth needed to atone for its past – seemingly confusing it with, erm, the British Empire. Then Meg weighed in saying: “We all have to be a little uncomfortable now” to “reach the place where a high tide raises all ships”.

The bright schoolboy’s stabbing last March shocked the country. And as she saw the emotional toll of her brother’s death – and of the fight for justice after his killer was freed – on her shattered mum, Jade worried she might not make it through her self-isolation.Her fears tragically came true last month when Debbie Makki, , suddenly became ill and died, with suspected sepsis from an infection.Jade is convinced her mother would still be alive were it not for the weight of the grief and injustice, and believes she is the second victim of the violent act that claimed her younger brother. Jade says: “I did finally get to give her those hugs, on the hospital bed where she had died. “She was tested for corona and it came back negative, so they let us touch her. “I gave her a proper hug, the one I’d been wanting to give her for so long. “We were all still in shock, I couldn’t believe I’d lost her as well. “I think thatwe’d been able to give her those hugs while she was still alive, she’d still be with us today. “It was us, her children and grandchildren, who really kept her going through all this, just as she kept us going. “We couldn’t be there to comfort and reassure her during the stress and suffering she was going through.” When Debbie was laid to rest, even though Covid- rules meant only  people were able to attend her funeral, hundreds of neighbours lined the streets near her home in south Manchester, clapping as the hearse passed. Dozens of well-wishers stood at a safe distance outside the chapel at Southern Cemetery as Debbie was carried in, to the sound of Angel by Sarah McLachlan. Jade, , a former primary school teacher, says: “My mum had lived there for  years and the whole community really loved her. The support we’ve had since then has been amazing, with more people speaking out for Yousef.” Brilliantly clever Yousef, , had made his family proud by winning a bursary to attend prestigious £,-a-year Manchester Grammar School. But after leaving his home on a normal night out on March  last year, he was kned in the heart by his friend, former public schoolboy Joshua Molnar, .  The fatal fight was in upmarket Hale Barns, Gtr Manchester, home to Premier League footballers and TV stars. Molnar, , was cleared of murder and manslaughter, but jailed for  months for possessing a kne and perverting the course of justice after a trial in which he lied that someone  had stabbed Yousef, then claimed he acted in self-defence after he pulled a kne on him. Another boy, Adam Chowdhary, , one of Yousef’s closest pals, was sentenced to four months in a youth detention centre after admitting possession of the flick kne that killed Yousef. Jade says: “A piece of Mum died with Yousef that day. She was a strong person who made a tough stand for justice, but she never got over the emptiness of losing my brother.” Mum Debbie vowed to fight for a full inquest into Yousef’s death and pursue a civil case against Molnar, while launching a national campaign against kne crime that had her organising silent protests and in endless meetings with police, council officials and the CPS. In October she spoke at an anti-kne-crime summit in Manchester. But she was dealt another blow in February when Molnar was released early from prison, six days before the anniversary of Yousef’s death. Just weeks later, the country went into coronavirus lockdown and Debbie, who suffered from underlying health conditions, had to cut herself off from her family, except her son Mazen, , who lived with her.Jade, who is married to another Mazen, saw her mum only twice during ­lockdown, when she took her kids on their birthdays – on April  when Daniel turned two and May  when Zack was three. Jade says: “Before lockdown, we would see each other every day. “And we’d shower her with hugs and kisses, that was what kept her going despite all the sadness and stress that she’d had to deal with over the past year.“She suffered from inflammatory rheumatoid arthritis and had received a letter from the NHS telling her to stay at home.“She also had a weak heart which couldn’t take too much stress. When we did see her, we’d drive to her house and sit in the car while she got a chair and stayed in the garden, with the garden fence separating us. “We would chat but we couldn’t hug her, and that was really hard for her. “My kids found it dficult too, they used to call her Mum, not Nana, because she was like a second mum to them.

Nadya Suleman rose to fame back in January  when she had eight babies at the same time and became known around the world as aposOctomomapos. She already had six children - four sons and two daughters - through IVF before she was thrown into the spotlight. The mum, who turns  today, had avoided the media while her children were young, but has recently begun sharing some of their lives. Back in January Nadya, originally from Calornia, shared a post about her aposmiracleapos octupletsapos th birthdays. She shared the rare snap of her six boys and two girls as they enjoyed a sit down birthday dinner, complete with celebratory hats. Happy birthday to my beautul angels she began the y dedication. You are some of the kindest, most compassionate, caring human beings I’ve ever known. Words cannot express how grateful I am to be your mother.She added: You are my miracles, my angels, and I will love you with all my heart, forever. Happy th birthday Noah, Maliyah, Nariyah, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Jonah, Josiah, and Makai. But one of her followers was quick to ask why she needed to have so many children. She snapped back that she didnapost need to have them. Nadya said: No one ‘needs’ any children.“I never planned on having octuplets , though I wanted a big family… hopefully, one day you will watch read my true story.”In a  interview with  The New York Times, the proud mother explained that she has sometimes had to resort to desperate measures in order to pay her bills.She revealed that it costs , per monthto run her household even though she only receives ,worth of food stamps from the government.

Marta Casimiro says she noticed the baskets were very dirty when she entered the store and began filming to the show the manager they were not being cleaned properly - but ended up catching an unacceptable act on film instead. In the video, captured at FreshCo in Toronto last weekend, Marta says she was filming an employee wiping down the baskets with a small towel before watching him spitting on the towel he was using to clean. The customer says she later saw the man using the same towel to clean shopping trolleys.  I couldnapost believe that, she told CityNews. I was in shock. I feel sick.Marta was unable to speak to a manager on the day and phoned back the following morning, but said the member of staff she spoke to didnapost want to see the video and treated us very badly. She then escalated the complaint and a few days later her husband received a call to say the cleaner had been suspended.But the shopper says her concerns were not taken seriously enough considering the dangers it could pose during the coronavirus pandemic. We cannot allow such things to be overlooked, she said. I’m furious and very disappointed. We are living in a pandemic, how do you think we feel  Sobeys, the parent company of FreshCo, responded to the CityNews video to say the cleaner was not an employee of FreshCo but worked for a third-party service provider and now no longer works at the store. Jacquelin Weatherbee, vice president of communications and corporate affairs, labelled the behaviour absolutely reprehensible. In a statement she said: [It is] completely against the standards we work so hard to achieve in our stores each day.

It would have been displayed as a sickening reminder and celebration of the unnecessary loss of le. However it was finally handed back over to police in Zimbabwe after the killing caused outcry and disgust in a bid to defuse international anger. American dentist Walter Palmer was the man who shot the final shot, after luring the huge creature with the body of a elephant - which was also hunted. After the death, the remains had been kept by the professional hunter who was in charge as Dr Palmer subjected Cecil to an agonising death, wounding him with an arrow before finally killing him with a bullet.  The head and skin of the hunted beast had been kept at the home of Theo Bronkhorst, to be left to mature and then cured before being shipped to Dr Palmer in Minnesota, US. Normally the skin is salted and stuffed by a taxidermist and the head mounted as a trophy. But Bronkhorst’s lawyer, Givemore Mvhiringi, said at the time: “I advised my client to hand the head and skin to police as soon as he got back to Bulawayo.” Dr Palmer, who paid £, to kill Cecil, was widely criticised for his actions, despite saying they were completely legal. His home and dental surgery were surrounded by protesters and he was forced to flee with his family. Protester Lisa Shelling said at the time: “He’s disgusting. Who can do that to an animal  “He should have his head chopped off and put on a mantelpiece. The police should arrest him.” A chilling note left at the surgery, scrawled in red ink, read: “Rot, burn, die”.  Dr Palmer, , lived at his £, mansion in Eden Prairie with his we and two children. In the letter to his patients he wrote: “As you may have heard, I have been in the news for reasons that have nothing to do with my profession or the care I provide for you. “I don’t often talk about hunting with my patients because it can be a isive and emotionally charged topic. I understand and respect that not everyone shares the same views on hunting.”  Palmer insisted he hired local professional guides and acquired all necessary permits for a legal big-game hunting trip. Police in his home town were bombarded with calls.

Meekings, the former Caley Thistle defender, was no dferent.“I just decided my family should come first. I’d been away from my family for a long time and being so far away from our families – one at the one of the country and one is at the other. My reasonings were family-based.“I understand what the club is having to do because of the pandemic and financially they’re having to make cuts. It’s not nice but I’ve said it before, there’s a lot worse going on right now.“The decisions are never easy but I’ll always put my family first, as I believe anyone would in any line of work.”He has a great deal of gratitude for the work physio Gerry Docherty undertook with him to get him fit again, particularly after hip and knee problems, and also to manager James McPake for not rushing him back.There has been some criticism online from supporters regarding his injury record and it is something that once used to bother him.But, as he stresses, no footballer wants to be injured. He is satisfied that as club captain, he gave his all to the Dark Blues’ cause.“It doesn’t bother me anymore. It used to. I’ve come through it now as I’ve had to deal with it for a little while. I’ve had my fair share and I understand that.“Some things you just can’t play through and the majority of time I’ve been out, it’s been something serious. Mentally, you don’t want to read those comments. You do feel like you’re letting people down but there’s nothing you can do about it, in the grand scheme of things.“Serious things like my knee and my hip – you have to listen to your body. Of course I would like to have played more but I’m  and I hope there’s still plenty more football to play in my career.“If I know I have given everything and I always will, then I can hold my head up high.”He stresses that he has enjoyed his time at Dundee and cites getting relegated and not getting promoted this season as two things he would change. The captaincy is an honour he has appreciated during his time at Dens Park.At  he ought to be coming into his prime as a player. He has a signicant amount of football behind him, particularly at a young age with Caley Thistle, but also so much more to give.The example of Greg Tansey does resonate somewhat though, given he was one of the fittest players in that Inverness team but one problematic injury curtailed his entire career.“It can happen to anybody,” adds Meekings. “I’m well aware of that. But while I’m fit and healthy I want to make the most of that.“I’ve had hit-and-miss seasons with my injuries it’s been dficult for me physically and mentally. But I felt before the lockdown I was in a better place and as a team, we were starting to do better.“I feel fit, as fit as I’ve ever been. I’m raring to go again and I just want an opportunity, one that is right for my family. Then it’s up to me. You’re always in control of your own situation and you need to be ready for it.”Inevitably, Caley supporters will ask about him making ato the Highland capital, where he admits he had the best spell of his career.Weekly chats with his agent keep him updated but any big decision will again have to be made with family concerns at the forefront.“I’m not writing anything off it all but the only decision that comes into my mind at the minute is that my family will come first. That’s all I can say on any situation.“I’ve got a young family – my daughter is two at the end of the month – and I’ve lived away from my family for a lot of years. Grace needs to think about her family too. It needs to be a joint decision.“It’s always nice reading comments from the Inverness fans. I had a fantastic time there. But any decision I make will be based on what’s best for my family. I can’t stress that enough.”#I know there is a lot of exciting talent there# Stevie Campbell hopes Dundee youth cuts don#t stall Dark Blues kids# development\" title\"##I know there is a lot of exciting talent there# Stevie Campbell hopes Dundee youth cuts don#t stall Dark Blues kids# development# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-fc-stevie-campbell-youth-cuts embed # secretEkTMUKPqt\" data-secret\"EkTMUKPqt\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

My Uncle Dickie Boag was in that team, and I’m guessing that photo was taken in -.“Sadly, he passed away from cancer in .”Rob also sent in a photo, and continued: “Dickie is also in the attached Scottish Junior team who played England on April , , at Windmill Ground, Leamington.“Dickie’s in the second row up, third in from the right, and another Dundonian, Jimmy Briggs, is in the same row, second in from the left.“The score was - for Scotland, with Dundee lads Boag and Briggs the goalscorers.”The Scotland team was – GourleyMcDonald , McLureCorrance , Lyon , McDonaldNaughton , Briggs , McKillop , Duffy , Boag .Football players, managers and staff are always sought for quotes by the media.I’m continuing to share some of them with you, which are associated with the Scotland international team.On the night before Scotland visited England in , Scots captain Jimmy McMullen addressed his squad with the words: “Go to your beds and pray for rain!”The weather duly obliged and, on a slick surface suited to skilled ball-players, the ‘Wembley Wizards’ won -!BLETHER: Dundee Solicitors v Dundee CID, Doug Sanders and a trophy-laden St Columba BC image\" title\"#BLETHER: Dundee Solicitors v Dundee CID, Doug Sanders and a trophy-laden St Columba BC image# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp blether-with-brown-dundee-solicitors-doug-sanders-st-columba embed # secretCXiBziL\" data-secret\"CXiBziL\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"midweek joy for golfer david","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsDavid Ronald took the honours in the first midweek stableford at Tarbert Golf Club, with a fantastic score of  points.He was on target to break  for the first time but finished with a double bogey for a , still a great score.

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby.

However, this turned out to be much trickier than I had expected.He claimed: ldquoThe face masks available at that time seemed to be distributed by untrustworthy-looking websites, looked to be of poor quality, took weeks ndashnot months ndash to arrive and were extortionately priced.ldquoI realised that I couldnrsquot be the only person facing this problem, so I decided to stop moaning and take action ndash and #sasMASK was born.He explained that the #sasMASK is manufactured in Europe and complies with the latest material and layering guidelines for non-medical-grade face coverings.It has not only been designed to be washable, comfortable and affordable, but also comes in more than  designs, with this range due to double in size in the coming weeks, he added.With the wearing of face masks now compulsory on public transport in Scotland, Screen  Shield is expecting orders to continue to surge as Hass, now back at his home in Musselburgh, fulfils hundreds of orders there until he can open a warehouse.He said: ldquoA fundamental aim of the #sasMASK brand was to create a business model that also benefited charities that support frontline workers and community groups.ldquoIt seemed to me that ndash in a health crisis ndash anyone who was selling masks should be giving back to the community, and especially to those hardest hit.ldquoI set up Screen  Shield so that  per cent of all online sales go to NHS-related charities.

Irsquove looked out my monthly cinema pass in anticipation of re-opening around July .I appreciate not everyone feels this way, but Irsquom ready to start living again. Irsquom also ready to accept some fundamental political realities.Letrsquos face it, wersquore all just guinea pigs now, part of a radical public health experiment the likes of which has never been attempted before. This experiment is reaching its most dficult phase yet, the bit where the Government has to somehow let people start doing normal things ndash like going back to work and spending money to keep the economy going ndash while simultaneously reminding us that we wersquore not out of the woods yet. They have to encourage people to go out, while keeping them scared.Many ndash including me ndash have criticised politicians for their missteps and mixed messages over the last few months. But I also recognise a number of basic truths that itrsquos better to get onersquos head around sooner rather than later, regardless of party politics.The first is that until coronavirus has been completely eradicated around the world, risk is going to play a part in our lives for the foreseeable future. The second is closely related: the state cannot tell us exactly how to manage this risk in every single circumstance. We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next. And there may be some truth to this. But come on, letrsquos get real.Accusations of ldquomaking it up as they go along are thrown around asthis was an insult rather than simply a fact describing the predicament governments everywhere find themselves in. How could it be otherwise given the extraordinary events of the last six months  And whatrsquos the alternative to us being public health guinea pigs  Staying at home forever Community levels of the virus in Scotland are now low and falling. Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections. Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown. And lting restrictions means the vast majority of folkmust decide for themselves what level of risk they are comfortable contending with, taking into consideration how it might affect their family and community as well as their own personal circumstances.We can help ourselves along the way. Firstly by staying up to date ndash through trusted, legitimate scientic and public information sources ndash about how the virus is transmitted and the best ways to stay safe.We can also resist the temptation to judge others for their decisions. Frankly, Irsquom sick of the army of armchair virologists spouting their culture war vitriol on social media. On one side you have those who seem to relish the lockdown, the class swots who shout too loudly about how they follow every part of the guidanceand seem to revel in the idea of a second wave. On the other side, you have the virus deniers. Both groups peddle fear and misinformation, whether that is their intention or not.At the end of the day none of us, not even the scientists, know whether and when there will be another wave of the virus.

Consumption of chicken, usually of the factory farmed sort that has never seen a blade of grass in its le, has soared accordingly.Independent thought survives though. Many donrsquot believe that Mother Nature is a psychopath. Why would she create a food that shortens the le expectancy of the population and the planet  This sentiment runs deep in our national psyche, and it expressed itself quite dramatically during lockdown. Meat sales soared UK-wide. Overall they climbed . percent on  a particularly spectacular % rise in high street butcher shops.Now a new book from the US, Sacred Cow, provides us with the evidence wersquove needed to show us that in a country like Scotland, eating red meat regularly is a perfectly reasonable, ethical, and natural thing to do. This book is the brainchild of Diana Rodgers, a nutritionist on a Massachusetts farm, who became so frustrated defending pasture-reared beef against reductive anti-meat propagandists, she had to state the case for how well-raised meat is good for both people and the planet. With Robb Wolf, a former research biochemist, she has given us much needed chapter and verse on why beef in particular, and red meat in general, have been vilied in a crude, generic way that fails to distinguish radically dferent farming systems.Rodgers and Wolf pick apart the weak epidemiological science propping up the notion, amplied by Hollywood stars, tech moguls like Bill Gates, ideological groups, and opportunist food companies, that meat eating causes chronic disease. They argue persuasively that humans evolved to eat meat. Our ancestors were ldquonutrivores: they understood that meat was one of the most satiating, and easily digestible foods they could lay their hands on. Meat provides us with micronutrients ndash vitamin B, key amino acids ndash that canrsquot be found in plants, and protein that we can absorb more easily than from plants. Perhaps the lockdown upswing in meat sales is an expression of our latent ldquonutrivore-ism The grotesque ecological and animal welfare excesses of the USrsquos industrial cattle ldquofeedlot system should not be used to characterise Scotland, where beef production is grass-based, and where cattle are typically finished on feedstuff that are inedible for us humans. Happily, our farmers are using, or at least quite close to using traditional ldquoregenerative farming methods, which look like being one of our best tools for mitigating climate change. Many beef farmers in Scotland already manage their cattle grazing in a way that improves the local ecosystem, by stimulating microbial ersity in the soil, increasing rainfall absorption, encouraging wildle habitat, and locking carbon in our soil.Perhaps yoursquod still rather eat the ldquoplant-based products marketed as a panacea for our environmental problems  If so, compare prices. Weight for weight, an ultra-processed plant burger, using all the dark arts of the manufacturer to fake a meat-like effect, and failing miserably, often costs more than grass-fed meat. Excuse the pun, but plant-based meat surrogates are seen by big food as a lucrative gravy train. And theyrsquore mainly made from protein extracted from soy and peas, both crops grown in chemical fertiliser and pesticide-dependent monocultures that create many environmental harms, such as water run-off from compacted soil, and depleted wildle.Simplistic memes and soundbites have got in the way of the complex, nuanced discussion we need to have about meat, but the authors of Sacred Cow move us forward. ldquoWe donrsquot need people to quit eating meat. We need them to start asking questions about how their food was grown no matter what they may be eating. Amen to that!Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

It may be that the Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has also become a devotee of this theory, which says governments can spend public money without having to worry about debt.He is in the hole for pound billion because of Covid and has seen the UK debt pile rise to nearly pound trillion. He borrowed a record poundbn in April alone. But he doesnrsquot sound all that worried and will be adding to it today in his summer statement.Modern monetarists believe that the traditional view of government finance ndash that it has to raise tax revenue to pay for services like the NHS ndash is wrong. Governments can spend on anything they want by printing money or borrowing. Just think of a number, print it and yoursquore off to the races. Rodger Malcolm Mitchellrsquos MMT book Free Money sums it up.So whatBritainrsquos debt has rocketed to more than  per cent of GDP  Doesnrsquot matter. Japan has public debt of % of GDP and seems to be surviving. An independent Scotland shouldnrsquot bother about debt either, so long as it has control of its currency, because it can just print Scottish pounds to pay for it.It sounds crazy, like Zimbabwean economics. And ultimately Modern Monetary Theory is a reductio ad absurdam. Fiat money has no intrinsic value soyou just increase the volume of it, without generating equivalent wealth, then its value will tend to reduce to nothing ndash as in Weimar Germany where people needed wheelbarr,ows to collect wages.However, there is method to MMT madness. It contains an important kernel of truth: that government spending, given low inflation, does not need to be financed by tax revenue.The traditional Thatcherite view, that you can only spend what you can afford, is back to front. If the state spends to get the economy moving in a recession the debt effectively finances itself by generating future taxation from the people newly employed.This was what John Maynard Keynes ndash really the grandfather of MMT ndash argued during the Great Depression. If governments spend money on, say, arms production the people employed in these factories go on to pay for goods and services from where in the private sector ndash food, clothing, housing and so on. This creates more private sector jobs through the so-called ldquomultiplier effect.Thus, a pound spent by the government generates more pounds in future by stimulating economic activity. So long as there is less than full employment governments should spend whatever it takes to get the economy running at full capacity. They could even pay people to dig holes and fill them in again.Yes, itrsquos a kind of free lunch argument and has been much criticised by conventional economists ndash including the European Central Bank - who believe excessive government spending debases the currency, distorts the market and leads to financial collapse, Greek style. Environmentalists donrsquot like the emphasis on growth.What has made Keynsianism, or MMT, so plausible recently is that many central banks have been printing money like therersquos no tomorrow since  and so far prices have remained stable and the roof has not fallen in. In the UK, the Bank of England has created an astonishing poundbn through Quantitative Easing ndash buying government debt.Conservatives like Boris Johnson, hardly radical leftists, are increasingly seeing debt as a good thing ndash or at any rate nothing to worry about. In order to keep his ldquored wall gains intact, Mr Johnson has promised to ldquobuild, build, build.Right now, interest rates are near zero, so there seems little reason to forgo spending. And thatrsquos precisely what Mr Sunak has been doing. In sheer volume terms he has spent more rapidly than any government in British history, mostly paying for furloughed employees.Paying private sector wages goes beyond what Modern Monetary Theorists advocate. It is more in the style of old-fashioned Marxists who wanted the state to take over the economy entirely. MMTers donrsquot want to nationalise the means of production.Of course, common sense says public spending canrsquot increase indefinitely. What about the interest on government debt  Surely that has to be paid. The UK currently spends poundbn a year on debt interest ndash more than on defence.Modern monetarists like Richard Murphy say the government should simply print more money to pay this, which it can do up to a point. However most government debt is owned by private pension funds and institutional investors or by foreign banks and financiers. In the long term,the government paid its debts in worthless printed pounds, theyrsquod soon stop lending.ldquoBut in the long run, said Keynes, ldquowersquore all dead. The Bank of England has printed hundreds of billions in QE since  and financiers are still falling over themselves to lend. Indeed, theyrsquore effectively lending at zero interest and getting nothing for their money.Mr Sunak will promise that Britainrsquos debts will be paid ndash he has to say that because free money sounds irresponsible. But he is likely to keep borrowing and spending because it is politically the sensible thing to do avert a Covid depression.People on the left are puzzled by this. Why is a Tory politician adopting the economics of Bernie Sanders  Well, it might be worth mentioning that one of the main founders of MMT was a hedge fund manager and tax exile, Warren Mosler, in the s. MMT is not a particularly left wing idea, nor is public debt.The former Republican Vice President, Dick Cheney, said in  that ldquodeficits donrsquot matter. Republican Presidents like Ronald Reagan and George Bush massively increased US public debt. It has been Democrats like Barak Obama and Bill Clinton who have sweated to reduce deficits.Donald Trump has ramped up more debt than any US government in history,  trillion, and is about to borrow trillion more.

The problem is this: I ordered the three-roast times two for nine bangers a pop and then when I was charged pound for that, I wondered out loud why. It seems that the nine bangers a pop three-roast comes with rice ndash and therersquos not going to be any of that ready for at least  minutes ndash so instead of that I was being given the three-roast without rice. Times two. Which costs pound more. Work that out.And somehow, somewhere in this stilted conversation, the man behind the counter thinks I am actually refusing this. No, no, no, I definitely want it, I say. But the more I explain the more the money is pushed back towards me until in desperation I turn to the audience behind to seeanyone speaks English.Of course they do. The guy behind me smiling and nodding and saying in minted Glaswegian something along the lines of: ldquoWhatrsquos the problem, big man.And the next moment there is no problem. Why the three-roast without rice costs more than the three-roast with rice  We all agree: nobody knows.I suspect itrsquos because itrsquos a much larger portion. I should have said that during all this I have had, dangling from a pink-tied ribbon in my right hand, a white box containing three fragrant custard tarts from the Chinese Bakery next door.I could smell the aroma of just-baked shortcrust pastry and wafts of vanilla throughout. No pressure.Fast forward  minutes, say, and the kettlersquos on at home, the gooey, crispy, super-fresh tarts are still warm. Being quartered and eaten while Irsquom unpacking the three-roast, times two, to put in the fridge for later tonight.But the pork belly  It disappears like this. I lean over and pop a square of it in my mouth. Crisper than expected, crunchier than anticipated, then sweet and salty, then waves of juicy, savoury pleasure.Try that, I say to Luca, as I venture another. He does. Ah, thatrsquos good, we agree. And we both immediately have another. Then his mum walks in and is prompted by us both to try a square. Hmm, she says as she tastes it, I donrsquot like to see that pork belly fatty bit in the middle. Ugh. And then at that very same moment she leans over and helps herself to another one. And so do we.To cut a long slow lunch short the pork belly will not make it to the dinner table tonight. Not a morsel. But the duck will and the char-sui too, served with rice and spinach. Both succulent, especially that duck golden-skinned ndash hacked into hunks, tender and superbly moist and full of flavour.

Which is not something listeners to The Archers are saying. Like BBC television executives, those in charge of the everyday story of country folk turned to monologues to fill the gap when normal radio business was suspended.Alas, The Archers experiment, unlike the remakes of Bennettrsquos originals, has not ended happily, with fans complaining they cannot take any more droning on. One complained to the Radio Times this week that she found the ldquoendless monologues ldquonot just tedious but oddly unpleasant.Not an easy business, monologues. That Talking Heads made them appear so is down to Bennettrsquos peerless brilliance in the form.Added to this were some of the best actors of today giving their all, each one knowing that previous greats had sat where they were perched, rolling perfectly turned lines around their mouths like so many quarters of mint imperials. Gone were Patricia Routledge, Julie Walters and Bennett himself, but in their places came Martin Freeman, Jodie Comer and Imelda Staunton, to name but a few.Monica Dolan, star of The Shrine, the th and final episode, is perhaps not as well kent a name as Sarah Lancashire, who helmed the seriesrsquo only other new work, An Ordinary Woman, but you will have known the face.

Where this road would lead no-one, least of all Lorna, could be sure.Dolan was perfect in the part, her character alternately felled and infuriated by grief. ldquoI loved you Clford, so why donrsquot I feel anything, she said. The line was not delivered with a question mark, asan answer was the last thing she wanted. Wonderful.Not, perhaps, the best of the dozen,only because it gave more away than the others.

The singers and actors were merely the apex of a large and intricate machine with many moving parts. These were operated by an itinerant and skilled army of designers, craftsmen, artists and mechanics. When people question funding for the performing arts they often fail to see the -hour working hive underneath the stage that keeps the lights on. Itrsquos a vibrant community operating a vast industry.Rishi Sunakrsquos pound.bn package of support to this sector which has suffered grievously from the predations of coronavirus is about a lot more than keeping Dame Judi Dench and Sir Kenneth Branagh in Bollinger for another year.It was instructive to note just how quickly Mr Sunakrsquos largesse could be accessed, though. The chancellor and the UK Culture Secretary, Oliver Dowden CBE, spoke of ldquothe crown jewels of this sector. Thus, the language of the elite was stealthily introduced and a class pecking-order was quickly established.I love the theatre but I view attending the odd play as a treat rather than an essential strand of my cultural DNA. While some of us responded to the work of the great playwrights in school many more chose not to for a wide iety of reasons. While Shakespeare observed the tragedies and triumphs of the human condition many people were often too busy meeting these challenges in their real lives to watch John Gielgud and Sybil Thorndike make costume dramas out of them.In the little time they had to themselves each week they chose to follow a local football team, for this was where working people looked to for drama and escape. These clubs have carried their hopes and made generations walk a little taller when social inequality menaced them the other six days of the week. Now, many of them face extinction before the end of next season. In Scotland, they are much more reliant on regular paying customers owing to the limited values of television deals in a small country whose football is less photogenic than Europersquos gilded leagues.Irsquom not suggesting that Albion Rovers and Queen of the South are more important than the Citizens Theatre but they are more vital to the overall health of their devotees. In Scotland, more people per head of population attend football matches than any other European country.:Scottish Premiership season given green light for August restart behind closed doorsTwo thirds of Scotlandrsquos senior clubs now operate a Community Trust to foster closer ties to their communities. They are integral to the social fabric of their neighbourhoods in normal times and have grown to become social champions during lockdown. Often, they have been the main source of help to their communitiesrsquo most vulnerable people by delivering food parcels and providing succour for those isolated and alone. Art and culture are vital to the health of these places too but local football clubs touch lives more profoundly.These trusts have established Football Memories Groups for those whose light is beginning to fade. There is football for the disabled inter-generational history projects and drop-in clubs for those living in supported housing. They provide volunteer opportunities for people seeking to make a contribution beyond football. They are active in schools and channel childrenrsquos fascination for football as a means of engaging them in the wider educational process. They are much, much more than just football clubs. If they are allowed to die it will destroy the heart of the communities they serve to a much greater extent than the closure of a theatre or the cancellation of Othello.Yet, the Scottish football authorities and the Scottish Government stand accused of doing little to support these vital community hubs through the effects of coronavirus. Following a conference call meeting between football chiefs and the Scottish Government in May Joe Fitzpatrick, the Minister for Sport, socially distanced himself from any prospect of financial support. But he did locate the entire lexicon of Government euphemisms and take it out for a walk. Thus we had ldquoimportance of sport to many and the ldquosharing of best practice and his confidence in ldquofurther-partnership-working.As Mr Fitzpatrick was seeking grass long enough to lose any commitment to actually funding small football clubs the Scottish Government was preparing to establish a poundm theatre venues fund on top of the poundm already pledged to the arts. Scottish football meanwhile had to rely on the kindness of the mortgage fund specialist James Anderson who made a personal donation of pound.m to support clubs through the health crisis. The SFA immediately set up a new department on the th floor of its sprawling Hampden Park headquarters . Then they gave all football clubs, including the richest and best-resourced, poundk while leaving the  community trusts the chance to apply for poundk each.The money cannot be spent on the basics small clubs require to stay alive such as paying wages and bills meeting SFA licensing requirements and testing players before games.

Itrsquos a lsquomulti-idendrsquo policy.ldquoThe coronavirus pandemic has highlighted the inadequacies of our labour market and has hit those on low incomes in stressful, key worker jobs hardest.ldquoA fairer, post-COVID economy that benefits workers is the right thing to do and shorter working hours with no reduction in pay should be part of that.Labour MP John McDonnell and Caroline Lucas are amongst those who have written to the hancellor calling for a four-day working week in the coming months.They argue that reducing hours could provide greater opportunities amid growing levels of unemployment.In the letter sent to the Treasury, they say \"shorter working time has been used throughout history as a way of responding to economic crises\".They believe that a four-day working week could overhaul the economy, and provide opportunities amid the growing unemployment crisis.\"A four-day week would give many more opportunities to the growing list of unemployed people which already stands at . million people,\" the letter explains.\"Shorter working time has been used throughout history as a way of responding to economic crises.\"They were used as a way of reducing unemployment during the Great Depression of the s, which led to the normalisation of the eight-hour day and the -hour week.\"A four-day week would bring multiple benefits to society, the environment, our democracy, and our economy .\"Jacinda Ardern, New Zealandrsquos prime minister, suggested employers could consider a four-day working week in response to the Covid- crisis, which she said would ldquocertainly boost the tourism industry.The four-day working concept first picked up momentum during the  December election, as Labour floated a policy of a -hour working week with no loss of pay within ten years.But campaigners now believe with the country facing an economic crisis in the wake of the pandemic ldquoshorter working time presents itself as one of the best options for fundamentally restructuring the economy so that work is shared more equally.Joe Ryle, a campaigner with the  Day Week Campaign, said: ldquoThe four-day week is an idea that is gaining momentum across the world right now because people are reimagining a better future for themselves post COVID-.ldquoA four-day working week is a no-brainer. Why wouldnrsquot we want to be happier, healthier and at the same time ndash more productive at work Andrew Bartlett, chief executive of Advice Direct Scotland, said: ldquoWe are a people-first organisation, and wersquore always exploring ways to improve the work-le balance.ldquoIn  we became one of the first major organisations in Scotland to introduce a four-day working week, recognising the positive dference this would make.ldquoThis has undoubtedly led to greater productivity and positivity among employees, and we particularly encourage staff to share stories about the activities they enjoyed on their extra day off.ldquoIt has been an incredibly busy period for us providing free advice at such a dficult time for so many Scots, but we ensured the four-day working week remained in place during lockdown and all staff worked from home.ldquoAs businesses consider how they will operate in the future, we would encourage them to consider adopting a four-day working week."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-parliamentarians-let-us-imposition-face-coverings","story":"This is despite the majority of the population choosing not to wear them before, including shopkeepers and the elderly. This is despite the fact that the number of people infected with Covid is at its lowest for months. However, almost regardless of whether one supports this move or not, the population must be aware that this move was brought in by subordinate legislation. There was no parliamentary scrutiny. No questions were asked in parliament. No evidence provided. No timeline set. No criteria for lting the move discussed.In order for the Scottish Government to enact subordinate legislation without laying a resolution before parliament, the Government must satisfy that the move is proportionate in response to a health emergency or urgent. This move, taking effect more than a week after first being announced and months after the infection peak is neither.Its a sorry day for this country when the opposition in parliament fails so abysmally in its duty. EvenJackson Carlaw, Richard Leonard or Willie Rennie truly believed this measure was \"proportionate\" or \"urgent\", they have a duty to scrutinise such a draconian, universal move that impinges on our civil liberties and sets a dangerous precedent. They failed.We have entered a new era of the pointlessness and ineffectiveness of this Scottish Parliament ndash when measures affecting every single inidual and forcing them to wear clothing against their will go entirely unchallenged, the population should worry about what  a power-hungry government has planned for us in the name of the Covid crisis.Jamie Black, Largs.AFTER travelling to Glasgow for the first time in four months, Id advise readers to put their le savings on a second Covid- sweep within the next two months. The sheer pedigree moronity of the general public makes it a literal dead cert.The train there and back were full of people of ious ages only bothering to put on masks when leaving the train only half wore masks in the city centre ndash which in the case of Argyle Street was chock-a-blockand the wearing of them in shops never applied to grunting, tattooed neanderthals under the impression that a threatening attitude to staff gave better Covid- protection than the idle handwash dispensers.All this before the shopping centres and pubs even reopen. I hope the Four Riders of the Bampocalyse havent booked their socially distanced summer holidays yet, because theyve some overtime coming.Mark Boyle, Johnstone.I AGREE with John Couttswhen he says: \"It was good that churches may now open for private prayer but any ongoing ban on collective worship clearly constitutes state interference in matters spiritual.\" He is also right in saying that the Government has a right to maintain public health by social distancing, but it has no further right to prohibit collective prayer and praise, provided social distancing is observed. I think that fear of the coronavirus has caused the Government to exercise control by the state over areas of inidual freedom of which the right to worship freely is one.Christians in Scotland paid a heavy price for freedom of worship. In covenanting times in the th century, men and women gave their lives in  years of persecution when James VI wished to impose on the Church of Scotland terms to which the church could not subscribe without forfeiting its spiritual independence.The Covenanters would not comply and worshipped in the hills and moors of the south and west of Scotland under the penalty of death.The Government has the power to demand political obedience but not spiritual obedience, and to deny inidual freedom in matters spiritual incurs the danger of totalitarianism where the state dictates what people can of cannot do as, for example, in North Korea and China. To prohibit singing in worship services is like Premier League football clubs playing with no fans, and with social distancing should be as safe as in any other property.Norman A Ogston, Johnstone.NICOLA Sturgeon is to allow churches to reopen with \"restrictions on singing\" despite Munichs famous Institute of Fluid Mechanics and Aerodynamics having found that droplets dont travel more than .m from singing test subjects.The fact is singing doesnt expel a large volume of air in jerks like coughing or sneezing. Perhaps Ms Sturgeon still believes the Kirks nonagenarian choristers eject droplets over vast distances and endanger low-flying aircraft.Once again she ignores real science and relies on policy wonks. French churches hauled Emmanuel Macron to the Supreme Court which told him to back off because interfering with religious services is illegal. We should have done the same.Rev Dr John Crawford, St Andrews.I APPRECIATE the sentiment of the SNP pleading for personal responsibility. However, the irony is that no government has done more to erode it than it has.Indeed,such an ethos of personal responsibility had worked we wouldnt have needed a ban on smoking in public places or the sugar tax, which I can almost guarantee will not be the end of the SNPrsquos erosion of personal liberty.In Scotland, you no longer even have the responsibility to prepare for the birth of your own baby any more. You canrsquot be trusted to eat correctly. You canrsquot be trusted to enjoy a can of fizzy juice. You canrsquot be trusted on the internet. Expensive Scottish Government propaganda informs us that \"We are Scotland\" or \"In Town, Slow Down\" or most insultingly, to \"play, talk, read\" to our own children.It would appear that the SNP trusts us to do absolutely nothing without being hectored, cajoled and controlled first.David Bone, Girvan.Read more: Letters: Chancellorrsquos latest intervention is akin to using a pea shooter against an elephant"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-face-masks-everything-need-know-face-coverings-scotland","story":"Heres everything you need to know:Why should you wear a face mask, and do they stop the spread of coronavirus Face coverings could reduce the spread of Covid-, according to a new study by the University of Edinburgh.

currently only the children of key workers are being cared for - but with adaptations made to protect against the spread of Covid-.These changes will place an additional financial burden on nurseries with extra staff needed, additional cleaning measures necessary and appropriate PPE required.However, there is no specic financial package in place to support private nurseries to reopen.Katie Robertson, co-owner of The Nurture Nursery, has launched a petition to have the Scottish Government take the financial concerns of private settings seriously.She says the Bathgate business, which closed in March this year at the beginning of the Covid- crisis in line with government guidance, will, like many others, struggle to survive the financial impact.The Nurture Nursery attempted to remain open for key worker families but the financial strain of this made the situation unviable.The warning comes after the private sector also raised concerns about a \"postcode lottery\" of provision in the lead up to a government pledge to provide families with  hours of fully funded childcare for children aged three to five, and some two-year-olds.The  hours was due for roll out from next month but is now paused due to the crisis -

Allowing pubs, restaurants and hairdressers to open will be another step in our plan to kickstart our economic recovery in a safe manner.”The guidance that is set out provides clear, practical steps businesses can take to open in a way that is as safe as possible for workers and customers.Separate guidance has been published for hairdressers, which states that a clear visor should be worn by the person providing the service, covering the face and providing a barrier between the wearer and the customer from respiratory droplets caused by sneezing, coughing or speaking.The government is also consulting with industry on how businesses should record customer information to help keep customers and employees safe and support the new test and trace system.Edinburgh Hair and beauty salon That Rosie Glow is preparing to open for business on July  after almost four months of closure due to the coronavirus lockdown. A number of safety measures will be in place to help prevent the spread of Covid- when the business opens. The salon has already installed clear screens between each treatment station, and at the reception desk.Customers and staff will be asked to wear face coverings, and customers will be requested to visit the salon alone where possible, and arrive on time rather than early to reduce time spent in the waiting area. They will have to keep their coats and belongings with them instead of them being hung up by staff, and there will be no magazines or refreshments available.Each station and any equipment used will be thoroughly cleaned between customers, and clean towels or gowns will be used with each one.Salon owner Rosie Fraser said: “We closed on March , but we have kept our social media active and positive, and kept in touch with clients.” Ms Fraser said she has tried to make the new measures as comfortable as possible, including the screens bearing the salon’s name. vw, px\"  She said: “I wanted to make sure the clients and also the staff felt safe coming back, and we also wanted people to feel like it’s a nice experience and not too clinical.“In this new normal we will be coming into we wanted to have safety but with style so that women still feel like they are having an enjoyable experience. Our whole ethos is to make women feel empowered, beautul, confident and glowing not only on the outside but on the inside too. With new measures making our usual level of service and attention to detail looking likely to change we did not want to have cheap looking, temporary fixtures.“We have had bespoke screens made with our logo engraved onto them and frames custom made and sprayed to be on brand.”When lockdown was announced, luxury knitwear company Corgi knew they had the experience to get through the Covid- crisis. The Welsh firm – which has a Royal Warrant from the Prince of Wales – has ridden many an economic downturn in its illustrious -year-old history. Co-owner Chris Jones, who is great-great grandson of the company’s founder, said: “We take a view that you can get through anything. I think it makes it easier because we’ve been through crises before.”It helped that the Ammanford-based firm had been through five fantastic years before coronavirus struck. In March they furloughed  of their  staff but now many are ing as orders begin to pick up.Corgi makes hand-finished wool, cotton and cashmere socks and other knitwear and Chris said: “Normally we run two shts on the sock machine, so we kept going with one. Next week going back to one and a half shts – we’re going to have the other knitters coming in some of the time.”With shops reopening, old customers are beginning to ask for new sales catalogues and Chris expects business to pick up properly in around a month.What has helped the business survive more than anything though was the package of financial help the Government made available. Chris said: “The furlough scheme has practically saved us.ithout it, we’d have been in a lot of trouble or we’d have managed but we’d have had to let a lot of people go.”But Claire, her staff and her customers are delighted that the Lisburn business is reopening after putting safety measures in place.Claire first opened the Barber’s Den four years ago and such was its popularity she also decided to expand to include The Hairdresser’s Den for all the ladies of Lisburn.When they had to put the business on hold due to the Covid- pandemic, it was an understandably worrying time for Claire and her staff.She said: “I am heavily pregnant. I’m  weeks now. When I found out the salon had to close the first thought was stress, panic, and what is going to happen to my clients. We closed early. We have about  to  clients a day so that is a lot of footfall and I had a real concern about safety.”Claire and her team have been busy getting the salon ready to welcome back her valued customers.With the rearrangement of the salon to allow social distancing, the introduction of PPE, risk assessment and team training, Claire is ready for the influx of people who are desperate for a haircut after the long months of lockdown.Claire said: “The guidelines are good. We have posters up with the guidelines on them and I have held a team meeting to carry out a risk assessment and explain to the staff what is expected of them.“Hand sanitisers have been installed and everywhere has been thoroughly cleaned.”The UK Government has published guidance to support businesses to reopen and keep workers and customers safe so they feel confident to .at gov.uk coronavirus-business-reopening.If you run a business and would like to know which of the coronavirus support schemes you are eligible for, you can use the business support finder tool.

After monitoring for some time to assess the condition of the animal, and to ascertain whether it was entangled or not, medics were happy that the animal was free-swimming and not caught on anything, however it is in poor condition, for which the prognosis is not good. Unfortunately, as the tide as dropped the animal stranded in shallow water. Medics say that they have remained on scene throughout the day, to monitor its breathing rate from the safety of the shore, and to ensure it is not disturbed “whilst nature takes its course.”They added that unfortunately, with a whale of this size, humane euthanasia to prevent further suffering is not an option, and with it being in very poor health and malnourished it would be highly unlikely to survive at sea. Whilst this whale is not fully grown, it is likely to weigh in excess of  tonnes, which means whilst it is stranded out of the water it is crushing itself under its own bodyweight which will cause internal damage too. Unfortunately refloating a whale of this size once it has stranded is also impossible due to its size and weight. Adult fin whales can reach in excess of  metres inand weigh up to  tonnes.The medics added: “Whilst medics are on the scene monitoring the whale, the landowner has requested that no one  attends and we would ask that everyone please respects his wishes. The local Coastguard team have also been in attendance too.”An update will follow.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Tha i doirbh, oir gu ìre mhòr tha leasachadh na Gàidhlig a’ crochadh air airgead poblach. Tha agus rathaidean, ach tha sinn fhathast an dùil gun cùm airgead poblach iad ann an deagh rian. ’ b’e an Riaghaltas agus a’ Chomhairle a bu chòir a bhith air sin a thogail.

An dèan Riaghaltas na h-Alba strì an aghaidh seo, is iad cho dèidheil air cumhachd a thàladh a-steach dhan mheadhan co-dhiù, mar a tha gach poileasaidh aca thairis na  bliadhna mu dheireadha’ dearbhadh Tha ceistean nas fharsainge ann cuideachd: ceistean a tha mi air togail gach dàrnacha seachdain anns a’ cholbh seo. Tha iad sin ceangailte ri fallaineachd eaconomaigeach nan sgìrean. Mura bheil obraichean ann an Uibhist no anns na Hearadh no ann an Leòdhas no eile, ciamar idir a tha thu dol a chumail òigridh  Agus ma tha obraichean annciamar a nì sinn cinnteach gur e Gàidheila gheibh na h-obraichean sin Oir tha gu leòr de dh’obraichean air a bhith air an cruthachadh as ùr ann an iomadh sgìre thairis na fichead bliadhna chaidh seachad, agus gu tric is e an rud a thachras gun tig Gall air choireigin a-steach a dheànamh na h-obrach sin .Chan eil lagh, moralta no eile, an aghaidh a leithid: cha bhuin an saoghal do dhuine againn. Chan eil e furasta, gun ghuth a ràdh air ceist thaigheadas, far nach fhaigh Gàidheil òga fearann no taigh anns am fuirich iad, eadar prìsean àrd agus margaid mhòr Airbnb.Is dòcha gu bheil cothrom aig A’ Ghàidhealtachd agus aig Na h-Eileanan air toiseach‑tòisichidh ùr a dheanamh a thaobh nan gnothaichean sin ri linn a’ Choròna‑Bhìorais. Nuair a dh’fhalbhas etha fhios nach till sinn gu mar a bha sinn – Gàidhealtachd a’ crochadh air aona-ghnìomhachas – turasachd.  chalpachais o aon cheann den chruinne-cè chun cheann eile.Tha fhios gu bheil cothrom an seo cur romhainn dè da-rìreabh a bhios riatanach dhan Ghàidhealtachd. Cosnaidhean uaine maireannach seasmhach. Ath-sgaoileadh dhen fhearann. Agus cho riatanach agus a tha e ar cànan a chur aig teas-mheadhan gach gnothach sin.

Oir chan urrainn dhuinn cor na Gàidhlig gu lèir fhàgail aig lagh no aig Achd no aig bòrd no aig buidheann no aig aithisg no aig rannsachadh eile. Tha am Bòrd air a ràdh gu bheil an siostam a th’ ann ag obrachadh. Bu chòir dhuinn a bhith draghail gu bheil iad air sin a ràdh gu poblach.

We must work to ensure that the SNP Comhairle Group becomes the majority and that the uncaring, out-of-touch councillors become the minority.On Friday, th June more than  pipers across the world played the haunting march The Heroes of St Valéry from doorsteps, gardens and streets.This recognised the service of the Second World War “Forgotten” st Highland Division which remained on the continent to fight the Nazis after the evacuations from Dunkirk. Despite their incredible bravery, around , men were finally encircled and captured at the Normandy fishing port of St Valéry-en-Caux on th June .The aim of our th commemoration was to ensure these men were remembered. St Valéry impacted on every town, village and hamlet across the Highlands and beyond. Eighty years on, those same communities were joined by pipers from across the globe as they paid their respects.As well as becoming the largest piping ensemble in history, a day-long programme of virtual events, learning resources fo young people and social media tribute messages achieved a reach of  million people.The event was supported three Armed Forces community charities: Poppyscotland, Legion Scotland and RCET: Scotland’s Armed Forces Children’s Charity. Each do vital work today.To each and every piper, we say: “Thank you!” And to those that support the work of those charities: “Many, many thanks!” Most of all, to the men of the st, our thanks, gratitude and respect.Once again this blustering PM talks in sound bites, as in #work work work, jobs jobs jobs and build build build#, all devoid of details.And from Get Brexit done to get Covid done, this is definitely the hand of Dominic Cummings.Boris Johnson#s ludicrous statement that there was #no such thing as a border between England and Scotland# and that all #regions# of the UK are moving forward together, only proves that in his desire to sound Churchillian he actually sounds more Trumpian!Again the factual, historic and dferent legal jurisdictions within the political framework of the Union are completely lost on Boris and London.

The Eco-Schools Programme is the world’s largest Environmental Education programme and aims to make environmental awareness and action an intrinsic part of the le and ethos of a school. Its participatory approach and combination of learning and action makes it an ideal way for schools to begin improving the environments of schools and their local communities. Eco-Schools work through a simple seven-step process resulting in the programme becoming central to the schools ethos. Schools can choose from ten eco-topics ranging from litter and waste to energy, bioersity and transport to name a few. Eco-Schools work towards achieving awards - bronze, silver and the prestigious Green Flag.The internationally recognised Green Flag is this highest award given to Eco-Schools and symbolises excellence in the field of environmental activity. Over the past two years, pupils of Buick Memorial have been working hard on many initiatives in order to address their chosen topics of Waste, Litter and Bioersity. Together with Eco Coordinators Mrs Carleton and Miss Stirling, they have produced policies on printing, recycling and litter for staff and pupils within the school to follow. Their continued commitment to regular Cash for Clobber collections enabled the school to purchase a number of new bins for the playground. Thanks to Catherine Hunter, Mid and East Antrim Education Officer, the children were able to give each class a bin for food waste, allowing the Eco Club to produce compost for their many planting activities. A highlight of the Eco-School endeavours is the annual litter-pick with Cullybackey Community Partnership and thanks must be given in particular to Margaret Murphy who is always keen to help the children in any way she can. The school is extremely grateful to Cranswick Country Foods for providing a superb wooden structure for the ‘plastic bottle greenhouse’ project and to Barry Tapster, Mid and East Antrim Recycling Officer, for his guidance. This year has been exceptionally busy, with the introduction of a termly ‘Walking Week’ which the pupils and parents have strongly supported. The Eco Club have spent a lot of time tending to the school pond area building mini-beast and frog hotels, making bird feeders and planting flowers for pollinators amongst many other tasks. None of these opportunities would have run as smoothly were it not for the unwavering input from Mr Fleckand the dedication of Ms Harkin . The positive attitude and increased awareness of environmental issues is evident within the school from Nursery through to P and this Green Flag is a welcome acknowledgement of the children’s efforts.The International Eco-Schools Programme is operated in Northern Ireland by Keep Northern Ireland Beautul and is a free to enter programme.

The PSNI has indicated that it will rely on other bodies to help enforce the rules.However, Translink said: Our staff have been helping passengers understand the new guidance and we are pleased to see there has already been a high number of customers using face coverings on our services and at our stations today.At Great Victoria Street station yesterday, commuters were still ided over their use and effectiveness in helping stop the spread of Covid-Inside the Europa Bus Centre, Translink officials were on hand issuing people with face masks as they entered the station and reminding them about the rules.Overall staff said they were happy to see that the vast majority of people were complying. Andrew Cooperfrom Comber had just arrived off the bus from Dublin Airport where he had flown in from Holland. The main problem I find is that my glasses keep steaming up when wearing a mask, he said.Everybody on the bus had one on so people seem to be complying. I flew in from Amsterdam and everyone in the airport had one on as it#s regulatory there also, Andrew added. Possibly it#s a little bit safer when you#re in areas where there are lots of people but who knows.It#s just matter of fact now andyou have to do it then you have to do it, at least until we get a little jag or a tablet. Rafael Henriqesand three friends had travelled up from Dungannon for a day in the city.Having worn face masks already for the past few weeks, Rafael was glad to see it was now the rule for everyone. Everybody had a mask on on the bus and I felt a lot safer. For me there was no dference as I#ve been wearing them for a while so I hope everyone  will do the same, he said. Ursula Grayfrom Pomeroy and her sister Dympna McCluskeyfrom Donaghmore said they were respectful of the need to wear masks. I feel much more comfortable on public transport wearing one, for more my own protection and everyone #s, so I endorse it. We saw one man being handed a mask by a Translink official who chose not to wear it which was a bit disappointing but hopefully people will get the message, Ursula said. Dympna added: This was my first experience of wearing a face mask on the bus.

Some hastily arranged Zoom meetings for the Parades Commission to look at the routes. Not-the-Twelfth could be even bigger than a republican funeral.There have been numerous restraining voices from Grand Lodge and unionist politicians, urging respect for social distancing, sensible spacing and online activities. Most will surely adhere. Here they stand apart for they can do no other  But some folk might get carried away. And, to the chagrin of some brethren, the extended bank holiday might involve more songs and Stella than Scripture.But for the tens of thousands who love the Twelfth, the unusual nature of this year#s event could still be joyous. Rather than followers having to travel to appointed demonstration venues, parading will be highly localised. And supporters might cheer on those local bands from their doorstep, enjoying the annual celebration of their history, religion and culture.Given the global pandemic, it is not just in Northern Ireland that the Boyne celebration is in abeyance this year. Parades have been cancelled in several locations: Toronto, Glasgow, Liverpool and Southport march, among others.There has been a notable recent reduction in parading controversies in Northern Ireland, eventhe issues were not truly resolved. Successive surveysshowed nationalists did not want Orange demonstrations skirting their areas, whereas the most common unionist response was support for unfettered parading rights. Proximity to parades was important in shaping attitudes. Surprisingly, though, this year#s University of Liverpool survey found nationalists less happy with the Parades Commission than unionists. One-third of DUP voters felt the Parades Commission was doing either a #very good# or #good job, not many less than the % who thought the commission was performing a #very bad# or #bad# job - and a further % were neutral, stating that the regulatory body was doing #neither a good nor bad# job. However, approval for the Parades Commission falls to one-fth among members of the Orange Order.UUP voters were slightly more critical of the commission than DUP backers. But both sets of unionists showed more support for the commission than Sinn Fein#s voters, only % of whom said it was doing a #very good# or #good# job, with % saying #neither good nor bad# and % declaring it was doing a #bad# or #very bad# job. One-in-six Sinn Fein voters said they did not know.Since the banning of theArdoyne parade on the Twelfth, marching issues have faded in salience. Riots in north Belfast seemed almost an annual feature. But Ross Kemp#s Extreme World series would no longer give the place star billing.This will be an unusual Twelfth, a holiday weekend which, despite all restrictions, will be a celebration for followers of the Orange tradition. Adherents will be desperate for theof full Orangefest next year. But this year#s muted event might yet be traditional in one respect. The forecast says it will end with rain.Jon Tonge is Professor of Politics at the University of Liverpool and co-author of Loyal To The Core  Orangeism And Britishness In Northern Ireland  Belfast   Most ReadDeath threat against Belfast City Council official Nigel Grimshaw amid Bobby Storey funeral controversyBobby Storey funeral: Sinn Fein hit out at #witch-hunt# after council official receives death threatAs Arlene Foster approaches th birthday, she has some unexpected political reasons to celebrateNI roads claim the lives of two men in three days Profiled: Workaholic Wylie and #old copper# Grimshaw in eye of storm over Storey funeral are highly capable,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Molly Elliott died on June . Molly, who lived in the Top of the Hill area of the city, was -years-old. Her sudden death has left her family and many friends heartbroken. Mollys family say they do not want her death to have been in vain, and have urged her friends and other young people to speak to others about problems they are experiencing. Addressing the congregation at Mollys funeral last week, her aunt, Lynn, asked for prayers for all those without hope. googletag.cmd.push “Help all the young people here today, help them Father to talk, to listen, to hear and to seek the help they need. “This is not the answer,you could all just look to your left, to your right, front and back, you will see mums and dads praying this is not coming to their door. “Please, please let our beautul Molly be the last,” she said. Also speaking at Mollys funeral service, Father Michael Canny said she was a person who had time for others and would chat with themthey were feeling down. “Of course, immediate and extended family were important to her,” said Father Canny. googletag.cmd.push “She also was a volunteer at Hillcrest House and involved down through the years in their summer schemes and other things. “The days ahead will be challenging, most of us will go from here but the immediate family will be left on their own to try to pick up the pieces of le again. “It won’t be easy, le will go on, le goes on, but for you le will be much, much dferent. “But at the same time I think you will be able to reflect on Molly and on the dferent rays of sunshine she brought into your lives.” Mollys uncle, Denny Elliott, said she loved giving and receiving hugs. “She was bursting with affection and would give you hugs that you felt the love flowing from her into you. They’ll now stay with us forever,” he said. “She never shut up - ‘wait til you hear’ she’d say and then you’d just listen and not get a word in edgeways. “Those one way conversations will now stay with us forever.” Mr Elliott said his niece was someone who was there for everybody. “Only last week, Mollys best friend felt a wee bit down and did the right thing, reaching out to his best friend Molly, not knowing for the last time. “Come down for a wee chat and a hug, she said. That chat will stay with him forever.” Mr Elliott said Molly loved her family deeply but they were struggling to come to terms with her sudden death. In a direct message to Mollys friends and other young people, he quoted renowned poet Walt Whitman who wrote ‘the powerful play goes on and you may contribute a verse. “What will your verse be ” Mr Elliott asked of young people. “Let Mollys verse be this: No other young person who knew her or reads about her will ever feel the need to end their le but instead reach out all around them and share their fears, doubts and insecurities to their mothers, fathers, siblings, carers and friends and relations.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Despite the wishes of staff and patients that we go back to normal services which includes letting people book their own appointments, it just isn’t possible. googletag.cmd.push We have a duty to all patients as well as our staff. Before any attendance at the practice you will be contacted to make sure you do not have COVID- symptoms. This will be similar for any appointments. We must also remind people not to attend any public placeyou are ill as you should be isolating and getting tested. All services like immunisations, and advice regarding any condition can still be accessed. Practices have become very efficient and even our practice staff are triaging calls to help the smooth and speedy delivery of services. We also have new team members, like physios, social workers, pharmacists and mental health workers. It is vital that you are connected to the correct team member to sort out your problem. googletag.cmd.push The reception staff may ask details regarding the problem to help this process. Practices are still asking people to attend the surgery for tests or examination and to avoid unnecessary trips or exposure we are also using things like video consults. Despite the talk about the ending of lockdown, COVID- is not ending. It is still there and will spread unless we continue to take precautions. This means we cannot have waiting rooms full of patients and allow someone to land in with symptoms and possibly infect a whole waiting room. If you attend the surgery you will be asked to wear a mask. It remains good practice to wash your hands regularly and wear a maskout. Despite the end of lock down, high risk patients remain high risk, and while the government restrictions do not apply, personallyI had been shielding I would continue to limit my contact with crowds during to the risk of infection. We do not have a vaccine yet, and according to figures we are nowhere near herd immunity levels, so any thoughts that COVID- is over are premature. This explains why GPs cannot go back to how things were pre-COVID and may not be able to for some time.We thank the public for their support in this.“ Dr Paul Molloy Western LMC Secretary.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

We have been working with all parties in Londonderry to move this issue forward and make it a reality.

Ulster University previously told the Derry News that when fully operational with  students per year the medical school will cost approximately poundm per year.

The issue of redeveloping the derelict Meenan Square site has dragged on for a number of years. Controversial bonfires have been built at the site in the past and over recent weeks materials have been gathered and burned on a regular basis. In February, The Executive Officethrough its Urban Villages Initiative said it was working with Apex Housing Association and other statutory agencies to take forward plans to ‘transform’ the site. googletag.cmd.push This would incorporate youth and community facilities, social housing and small commercial units. At that time locals, including workers at Denis’s Wee Shop and councillors for the Moor area confirmed to the Derry News that people had been asked to vacate premises to allow for demolition of the buildings. The Bogside Inn was supposed to be part of the second phase of redevelopment – possibly years down the line. Demolition work has not yet taken place and TEO was asked why there are further delays. A spokesperson for TEO said: “The Meenan Square site is privately owned and the Department understands the owner did ask businesses to vacate the site in recent months. googletag.cmd.push “Work is continuing by the Department’s Urban Villages team and other stakeholders to allow for development of the site, however plans will be subject to business case and other statutory approvals and community consultation before any construction work can commence.” HEALTH HAZARD Sinn Feacutein Foyle MLA Karen Mullan has said there are several long- and short-term issues that need resolved to deal with the re-development of the Meenan Square site in the Bogside which has become a source of anti-social activity. Karen Mullan MLA said “It’s very apparent that there are short and long-term issues that need to be resolved at this scar site at Meenan Square. “I and Councillor Patricia Logue are dealing with problems around this site on an ongoing basis. “It is a health hazard and an eyesore for the residents of the area who have to look at it daily and deal with the anti-community activity that takes place there. “There must be a collective effort over the summer period to deal with the recurring problems at this site which includes the illegal dumping of materials, the subsequent burning of those materials, the impact it is having in the area and the serious health hazards this throws up.” She added: “There are also child protection issues with some very young children and teenagers being in around a very dangerous site hrs a day. “In relation to any future plans for this site I fully understand the processes involved and that they take time and like everything they have been impacted by the onset of the Coronavirus Crisis and the change of ownership. But all bodies have a responsibility to prioritise this development. “Over the past number of years myself and Cllr Patricia have worked intensely with the owners, the local community, Iona Enterprises, Dove House Community Trust, The Executive Office , Urban Villages and Council to progress the site to development and had hoped that demolition would have taken place before now. “The residents in the immediate area have suffered for too long as this site has been allowed to fall into neglect and dereliction. “I am confident that everyone involved is committed to delivering the proposed regeneration project that we all desire. “I would urge all the stakeholders to redouble their efforts and commitments to ensure that this community gets the facilities and services that the redeveloped Meenan Park will deliver.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It was scary, even for an introvert like me who didn’t mind staying at home – the notion that there would be no end in sight struck at our collective sense of normality – what was safe, what was normal  Most of the towns bars and clubs took the selfless decision to close from th March and whilst the guidance from governments was just gearing up, Derry slowly went into hibernation. About two weeks in, I thought to myself ‘this must be nearing an end’ but I was wrong, in fact it was getting worse and we all watched with, in my case, genuine fear as the numbers of those infected and those who had sadly lost their lives mounted each night for days and weeks. googletag.cmd.push I should say that my lockdown has been at the lower end of the stress scale. I don’t have children to feed or home school and I can work from home. Whilst having that level of free time, however, I exhausted my in-house options fairly quickly. I painted the house, reconfigured rooms and did someDIY. After about the fth week indoors though, I had a lot more time to sit and observe the lives of others, whether through social media or the news, and I would love to be able to just pause at that point and look at how we all coped. googletag.cmd.push I watched as people drted away from the scornful, reality-tv fuelled selfishness that had increasingly eaten away at that old spirit of community Derry was once famous for. My facebook was overloaded with scenes of kindness and understanding. Neighbours looking out for one another, umpteen tonnes of banana bread being offered as gts and when all the distraction of shopping, going for pints and buying the latest gear was removed, we all reverted to our default settings. Nature was once again our playground, family was again the lynchpin that held it all together and our st century blinkers came off, maybe for the first time in some of our lives. It was the best of us. I say that in no way to gloss over the loss of members of our families and our communities. There will always be a void left by those who we couldn’t mourn properly and lay to rest in our traditional ways. I think we owe it to their memories to try and capture the things that changed us over the last few months and apply it to how we will come out of this.

It was scary, even for an introvert like me who didn’t mind staying at home – the notion that there would be no end in sight struck at our collective sense of normality – what was safe, what was normal  Most of the towns bars and clubs took the selfless decision to close from th March and whilst the guidance from governments was just gearing up, Derry slowly went into hibernation. About two weeks in, I thought to myself ‘this must be nearing an end’ but I was wrong, in fact it was getting worse and we all watched with, in my case, genuine fear as the numbers of those infected and those who had sadly lost their lives mounted each night for days and weeks. googletag.cmd.push I should say that my lockdown has been at the lower end of the stress scale. I don’t have children to feed or home school and I can work from home. Whilst having that level of free time, however, I exhausted my in-house options fairly quickly. I painted the house, reconfigured rooms and did someDIY. After about the fth week indoors though, I had a lot more time to sit and observe the lives of others, whether through social media or the news, and I would love to be able to just pause at that point and look at how we all coped. googletag.cmd.push I watched as people drted away from the scornful, reality-tv fuelled selfishness that had increasingly eaten away at that old spirit of community Derry was once famous for. My facebook was overloaded with scenes of kindness and understanding. Neighbours looking out for one another, umpteen tonnes of banana bread being offered as gts and when all the distraction of shopping, going for pints and buying the latest gear was removed, we all reverted to our default settings. Nature was once again our playground, family was again the lynchpin that held it all together and our st century blinkers came off, maybe for the first time in some of our lives. It was the best of us. I say that in no way to gloss over the loss of members of our families and our communities. There will always be a void left by those who we couldn’t mourn properly and lay to rest in our traditional ways. I think we owe it to their memories to try and capture the things that changed us over the last few months and apply it to how we will come out of this. Remember that it was during this time that nurses and doctors, not reality tv wannabes that put their shoulder to the wheel. Remember the gratitude we all shared every day and the fervour we showed in demanding that they be paid better  We shouldn’t forget that just because our amazon deliveries are back to normal, or because Primark has again opened.

Shortly after the announcement, the Derry News asked the General Medical Councilto confirm whether that now means the Medical School will open in September of next year. A GMC spokesperson said: “There are stages that must be completed, required for all new medical school applications, and funding is just one part of the decision process. We will decide on the readiness of the University of Ulster to accept students in September  later this summer, following completion of all these stages.” googletag.cmd.push The GMC carried out a stage  visit to the Magee Campus last July, and so, the next step is to make the stage  decision. That involves a decision to commit resources to rolling quality assurance and to allow the school to recruit students. From that point on it would be a case of monitoring the schools progress before a decision is made which will allow the school toaward its own primary medical qualications. Foyle DUP MLA Gary Middleton has welcomed the funding assurances for a graduate medical school in Derry. Mr Middleton said: “It is welcome news that the Department for the Economy has been allocated funding from the Executive for the graduate medical school. poundmillion of capital expenditure and poundmillion revenue costs per annum will be ring-fenced. We have been working with all parties in Londonderry to move this issue forward and make it a reality. googletag.cmd.push This is a further step forward to ensuring that in  we will be able to see the first students enrolled. It will be good for the North West but also for the Health Service.” Since the announcement by Deputy First Minister Michelle ONeill that a medical school had been approved, key players in delivering the project including the Economy Minister Dianne Dodds and Arlene Foster have spoken of ‘signicant work’ and risk assessments that must be carried out before they can commit themselves to a  opening date. Ulster University previously told the Derry News that when fully operational with  students per year the medical school will cost approximately poundm per year. Sinn Feacutein MLA Karen Mullan has also welcomed confirmation from the Executive that funding for the Magee Medical School is ring-fenced allowing the project to move to the next stage. The Foyle MLA said: “Confirmation from the Executive that funding for the medical school at Magee University is ring-fenced is great news for the city. “This will allow the University to press ahead and recruit staff and students for the proposed opening date of September . “It will also enable Ulster University to move to the next stage of the General Medical Council process, with their visit to the Magee campus later this month. “The delivery of the graduate entry medical school will not only enable us to produce doctors to serve our local communities, it will be an important economic driver for the whole North West Region.” LARGER EXPANSION Meanwhile, SDLP Leader Colum Eastwood MP has said that the allocation of funding to the Graduate Entry Medical School in Derry must now see a confirmation that the school will open for an intake in September . The Foyle MP said that the SDLP efforts to secure resource for the Medical School must be the first step in a larger expansion of university provision in the North West. Colum Eastwood MP said: “I’m pleased that funding secured by the SDLP in the New Decade, New Approach negotiations will now be provided to deliver on the promise of a graduate entry medical school in Derry. The people of this city have been denied better university provision for far too long. This was a priority for us when we decided to go back into the Executive and I’m delighted we’ve been able to see progress. “This is good news and we’ll work with all parties in the Executive to meet the target for a September  intake. We need to come together and send a message to our young people that we’re doing everything we can to provide them with the opportunity to live, work and study at home. Our young people are our greatest strength, they shouldn’t be our largest export. “This must represent a first step in a larger expansion of university provision in the North West. We need to be ambitious for Derry and the wider region, investing in skills is critical to transforming our economy. That’s why as MP, I’m committed to working with the Executive and the new Irish Government to deliver new opportunities and enhance higher learning institutions on a cross border basis to meet the needs of people here.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The new centre, which opened at the start of the month, is an important part of the wider Test, Trace, Protect programme managed by the Public Health Agency. Speaking during the visit the Health Minister said:“Test, Trace and Protect has a vital role to play in helping us move forward into recovery. This, along with other key public health measures, such as social distancing and ensuring good hand and respiratory hygiene, will help us to reduce community transmission of Covid-. googletag.cmd.push “For Test, Trace and Protect to work, everyone in Northern Ireland must prepare for the possibility of having to self-isolate and be tested to help protect ourselves, our families and our communities.” The Minister added:“This is likely to become part of everyday le for the foreseeable future until an effective vaccine for Covid- is developed and a vaccination programme delivered.” Olive MacLeod, Interim Chief Executive of the Public Health Agency, said: “The initial pilot phase of Covid- contact tracing began in Northern Ireland on  April and as of  May we have been tracing all positive cases. Northern Ireland was the first part of the UK to have this service established and operational. googletag.cmd.push “Our contact tracing team is made up of trained staff who contact the person who has tested positive identy those people with whom they have had close contact and could be at risk of developing Covid- and in turn contact them to advise them on the appropriate next steps.” Mrs MacLeod concluded: “By this stage most people will be aware of Covid- symptoms which are a high temperature a new, continuous cough or a new loss of or change in sense of smell or taste. But people should also be aware thatthey develop any of these symptoms they should get tested for Covid-. More information on testing is available on the PHA website.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

This week I want to highlight the plight of many small businesses across the city and tell you what you can do to help them survive. For the past  weeks many businesses have shut their doors and either furloughed staff or made them redundant. Now, however, is the time to get the economy on this Island back up and running. We cant as a society afford to stay shut any longer. There isnt the option to stay closed and until a vaccine is found. googletag.cmd.push This is just fancul thinking and would bankrupt any economy that attempted this strategy. We must learn to live with the virus within our society and shield the most vulnerable from it. The rest of us must take responsibility for our own protection and follow the guidelines set out by government. Both the British and Irish governments in fairness have risen to the challenge and supported businesses and workers for the last four months. The continuation of this support indefinitely isnt economically sustainable. The cost of the support to date has been largely borrowed by governments and will need to be repaid at some stage by raising taxes. googletag.cmd.push There is no such thing as free money from any government in the world. If you get something from government, it will most certainly will be got back by a tax.  So, lets all accept that we have suppressed the virus and now is the time to re-open our economy and get back to work as best we can in the circumstances. Now let us not forget that many of our local businesses watched in dismay as their income streams totally dried up in March. Over the last three months many have had virtually no income, but bills have still mounted up. Some got reduced rates and rents, however bills unpaid since March are waiting for them now as they open. Landlords will be looking rent again and creditors will be looking paid. The Inland Revenue who has been quiet for a while will be back looking for taxes due for last year and on account for . As these small firms re-open their doors and staff come off government furlough schemes the next few months will either make or break them. They really need our support folks so please support themyou can. Very few businesses havent been affected by this crisis and as the economy begins, the bills may come at them quicker than their customers. There could be a bloodbath in terms of bankruptciesphysical re-opening is ahead of consumer confidence. Many local businesses are opening tentatively not knowingcustomers willin the pre-Covid numbers. For some businesses consumer confidence is their biggest issue. Many customers might shun these businesses for fear of catching the virus. The fear factor is still pretty high amongst some consumer groups, but I hope this is confined just to people that fall into the highest risk of infection . For other businesses like restaurants hairdressers etc. the problem will be the new guidelines and how they effect the delivery of the service and capacity of the business. A good example of this can be seen in the recent price hikes announced by hairdressers in Dublin before they re-opened. With capacity reduced signicantly due to social distancing and the additional costs linked to cleaning hygiene etc. many had to increase prices by as much as %. I dont expect increases of this scale in Derry but I have a lot of sympathy for a business that is forced to increase their prices due to reduced capacity. Its not price gauging and has more to do with the current restrictions and capacity reduction. People shouldnt jump to social media with tales of being robbed or fleeced. Its really a case of pricing to survive for many businesses. These next few weeks will be make or break for many companies re-opening after the lockdown so I believe its our civic duty to do as much as we can to support them. What can we do  The simplest answer is get out there and spendyou can afford it. Put the keyboard down and stop buying online unless you really have to. Book a meal and get out there and enjoy a might out. By doing this you are not only supporting your local restaurant but you’re also helping to preserve jobs. Get up the town and spend a few pound, would be my advice. What we all do over the next few months can make a huge dference and could help save hundreds of jobs in the city. If we dont engage with our local businesses, they will be forced to lay people off. Go out and buy a bed for the spare room. Get that much needed haircut. Take the boyfriend out for that steak dinner. We really have to support local shops, service providers and manufacturers now more than ever. And remember, we can do all of this and stay safewe follow the rules, wear a mask and keep the proper distance. Taking holidays in Ireland or a Staycation will also help. And folks this is not me crying wolf. Huge jobs losses are already occurring across these Islands as we come out of this crisis. Intu Properties, which owns or part-owns  huge shopping centres across the UK and Spain, including the Trafford centre in Manchester, has filed for bankruptcy already last week. It will not the last business casualty of the Covid- crisis. So do your bit folks. Get back out there and spend what you can afford locally, and help keeps jobs in Derry.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Now, at the age of , the well-known Derry man has finally done it. Over the last couple of years, Paddy has been writing his memoirs and, from next week, the Derry News will be publishing extracts of his ,-word story. It is a fascinating story which takes in many aspects of his le, from growing up during World War  to running a business in Derrys city centre throughout the Troubles for  years. However, his working le is only part of Paddys story. After retiring, he embraced a love of learning and graduated with a degree in Irish History and Politics from the University of Ulster at the age of . googletag.cmd.push He admits that he was like a grandfather figure to his young fellow students. He continues to enjoy reading and learning about a host of subjects, particularly history. He is a man who likes to keep busy. “I did not want to retire and spend all day sitting in a chair zapping at the TV,” he said. As a result, the last couple of years have been spent working on his memoirs. Paddy was born in  at  Lone Moor Road, the fourth of eight children born to James and Mary McCaul. Paddy admitted that it had been emotional in writing about his parents. googletag.cmd.push “It was only when I was older that I appreciated how good and hardworking people they were,” he said. “My father would have worked all he could to provide for his family and my mother did everything to make sure that her children were fed and looked after. “I have such admiration for my parents but they were people of their time and thats how things were then.” After leaving school, Paddy worked as a clerk in the Great Northern Railway and the City Surveyors Department in Derry. He started employement as a salesman with electrical appliance company Electrolux in . Through relationships built up in this job, he opened his own shop, McCaul Appliances at John Street in . Within a few years, John Street and the rest of the city centre was targeted regularly as part of the IRA bombing campaign. Paddys shop did not escape. In his memoirs, he recalls on one occasion being held at gunpoint as a bomb was planted in the store. He recalls: “My main focus was not on what was obviously some sort of device but on the shaking hand which held the rather ancient-looking hand gun.” McCauls Appliances relocated for a time to the Waterside, before finding a new base at Quayside Shopping Centre where the store remained until Paddy retired in . However, as already stated, Paddy was not keen on taking things easy during retirement. “I always like to keep active and did not want to end up doing nothing when I retired,” he said. He signed up for a Diploma in Foundation Studies for mature students at the University of Ulsters Magee campus in . He is in no doubt about the impact this had. “That course changed my le,” said Paddy. “I had always been interested in reading since I was a young boy and had enjoyed my time at school. “However, coming from a working class family, the focus was always on getting out of school and finding work so you could start contributing to the family. “So it was great to get the chance to indulge my interest in learning at that later stage of my le.” Paddy said he gained a new lease of le mixing with his young student colleagues and is a big advocate of the importance of education. Despite being in his th year, the Derry man keeps himself active with daily walks along the citys quayside. In his long and eventful le, he has seen many changes, some good, some not so good, in his home town. It is a place he is very proud of and very proud to come from. Whilst acknowledging that he would have been well known in Derry, especially through his involvement in business for many years, Paddy describes himself as just an ordinary Derry man. He says he hopes people enjoy reading the story of his le. He insists it is just the story of an ordinary man. Often, those are the best type of stories.

Earlier that day Bernie was out handing out candles of Sister Clareand I said a wee prayer to Sr Clare before I picked the winner that I would pick the person that deserved it. She works in mysterious ways. The Lamborghini was part of a three part prize draw that also included a Rolex watch which was won by Niall McDaid from Bishops Street from a pound ticket and a lawn mower which went to Patrick McDaid from Rosemount who purchased a ticket for pound. Blaine Tierney of Vogue Competitions and Vogue Car sales in Springtown has given away a large number of cars in competitions since lockdown began in March. The Lamborghini is our biggest giveaway yet, its an amazing car and it would cost pound, new, he said. Its brilliant to be able to give people le changing prizes and the majority of the prize winners have been from Derry.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

There will be no official Orange Order parades after the organisation announced their cancellation earlier this year. Grand Secretary of the Orange Order, Mervyn Gibson, urged people to stay at home, while the Order have launched a ‘Twelfth at Home’ campaign to urge people to celebrate safely. “This year the Twelfth is about everyone’s health. You have to understand why we cancelled the parades. Parades attract large crowds,” he said. “Bandsmen will simply be going into a village or an estate or a street and playing some music. googletag.cmd.push “We would be saying to everyone to stay at your door, stay in your garden, listen to them and enjoy, butyou see a band, please don’t follow them.” The Parades Commission list for July  includes parades in Maghera, Moneymore, Limavady, Garvagh, Articlave, Tobermore and Magherafelt. Two separate bands will parade in Coleraine, Castledawson and Macosquin, but none will take place simultaneously. Numbers of participants have been capped at , with ten of the thirteen bands applying for the maximum amount, while all but one list the number of planned supporters as . The exception is in Magherafelt, where the Ballymoughan Purple Guards Flute Band have specied an ‘unknown’ number of supporters will be attending the parade. googletag.cmd.push Maghera Sons of William Flute Band said no members of their local Orange Lodge would be parading with the band. “No members of MSOW LOL will be on parade with the band,” they said in a post on their Facebook page. “Social distancing protocol will be followed, and we ask members of the public not to gather around the area of the Orange Hall. “The route is the longest we can do, taking in the majority of the town. We encourage you to stay in your gardens and enjoy the time with your family as the band passes by.” The Ulster Bands Forum, an online  for marching bands, have issued a plea for supporters to protect themselves and the bands. “Bands are going to a lot of effort for you, please afford them the same respect and support,” they said. “Dont follow the band, they will make every effort to come to you. Do not travel outside your local area to see bands. “If you need to use a car to see your local band, stay inside and park safely. Observe social distancing measures at all times. Dont invite all and sundry to your garden. “Lets hold our heads high after this and be able to say we respected and observed our culture whilst staying within the law,” the statement concluded. Mid Ulster District Councillor Paul McLean said the bands have made it clear that everyone should obey safety guidelines. The DUP group on Mid Ulster Council believe bands that have organised such events are clear that they wish everyone to abide by the social distancing regulations and guidelines, he said. They will bring the Twelfth to the community who they ask remain in their homes and gardens and not to participate in the parade.I welcome the bands’ commitment to celebrate proudly and safely and I would ask everyone to do as they have asked. Abiding by the regulations and guidelines ensures our friends, our familIes and our neighbours are protected and demonstrates the ongoing commitment to our NHS.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The kits include a slow cooker, cookbook and recipe ingredients for two meals and it is hoped they will provide a more sustainable option for shielding households to make healthy meals. Mayor of Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council, Alderman Mark Fielding, said the kits would offer ‘practical support’. “It’s vital that we support the health and wellbeing of those who are shielding and this is a great example of how working with other agencies can enhance the lives of our residents,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “Practical support like this is very important during these unprecedented times, and these kits will make a real dference to vulnerable people across the area.” Michelle Donnelly from Henderson Retail said the initiative was a ‘fantastic idea’. “Since the beginning of lockdown our store teams have been doing all they can for their local communities, from providing home deliveries to the isolated and vulnerable, to helping foodbanks, charities and community groups,” she said. “Providing these ingredients means those who are still shielding can still enjoy a fresh, hot meal without any hassle. The slow cooker initiative is a fantastic idea and we’re very proud to be part of it.” googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Franciscan Friars first came to Derry in  at the invitation of Bishop Seamus Hegarty. They lived on Abercorn Road for five years before relocating to the Parochial House at St Josephs parochial house in Galliagh, which is now St Columbas Friary.

Its our first place in the city to do that work that God is calling us to do. The St Pio Centre will have a coffee bar. It will have beautul furniture, and be really well lit with music playing and it will be a place for the Friars to connect with their neighbours, said Fr Isaac. It is our desire that our neighbours in Galliagh will come, but it is open to anyone. Fr Issac says the work of the new Apolistic Centre will be guided by the needs of the local community. We are really excited, said Fr Isaac. In the  years that we have been here we have able to plug into the already existing groups and we have been so blessed to be a part of them.

It is our desire that our neighbours in Galliagh will come, but it is open to anyone. Fr Issac says the work of the new Apolistic Centre will be guided by the needs of the local community. We are really excited, said Fr Isaac. In the  years that we have been here we have able to plug into the already existing groups and we have been so blessed to be a part of them. People have asked what sort of services will be available but we will see what needs present themselves,” said Fr Isaac. And we will continue to work with the organisations that we are already closely working with.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

There are also crew quarters for up to ten staff.The dining table can accommodate up to  guests and there is a separate bar and lounge areas.It even has its own inflatable flying boat and other toys include sailing dinghies, speedboats, ing gear and fishing gear, and lots more tucked away in its cavernous lockers.Athos spent several days at anchor in Strangford Lough last week and her presence certainly generated plenty of local interest,not from offers to purchase.She is on a long term charter and is currently cruising up the west coast of Scotland.Among the crew members is  year-old Melissa Ramm, from Donaghadee, who works as a deck hand.Her mum, Margaret, was lucky enough to get on board when Athos pulled into Antigua in the WestIndies back in March just before the Covid lockdown.ldquoItrsquos a stunningly elegant yacht, said Margaret. ldquoI would certainly have no problem living on it..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Book deals usually don’t happen to people like me  ","story":"NOTED for her flair for writing fantasy novels, a Ballynahinch woman is now turning her hand to crime stories after signing a rolling contract with a leading UK publisher recently.Kerry Buchanan, whose award-winning short stories and science fiction books have also been well received by the industries critics, is still in disbelief that her writing career is going so well.Kerry, who lives with her husband, Fraser, and their three grown-up children, Katrina , Lauraand Patrick , is also a full time carer to her  year-old father, Harold Matthews.Kerry, who only began writing shortly before she turned , says their family farm provides a lot of inspiration much welcomed escapism writing.Her crime novels - the Harvey and Birch series ndash will be coming to Amazon in the next few months.Since signing the initial three-book deal with Joffe Books, Kerry says that she feels blessed.ldquoWhen I wake up every morning, I go through the usual check list mdash arms check, legs check, book deal. Book deals usually donrsquot happen to people like me, she jokes.ldquoJoffe were the only publisher I sent my manus to. I was a fan of several of their authors already and I like the way they work with their writers to help them produce their best work.Kerry, who is originally from Yorkshire, settled very easily amid some of Co Downrsquos finest vistas when she married almost three decades ago. She describes how her writing career came about.ldquoI was always a bit of a daddyrsquos girl, so when my father was diagnosed with Alzheimers in , I felt I needed to find an outlet to escape to for some consolation between visits back home. That acted as the trigger.ldquoWhen my mother died a few years later, I brought my father over to live with us and he has since settled in well.ldquoWe are surrounded by horses, hens, dogs, cats, lizards and a few snakes. Maybe not you average farm animals, but we do have stunning views of rolling drumlins, forests and two beautul lakes.ldquoI feel there is an inspirational current with the weather in this part of Co Down. I love it here.

I felt I was just limbering up to a career in writing, cutting my teeth and learning with each page.ldquoWith the books that followed, I grew in confidence and delivery until I felt I could begin to publish them.Kerryrsquos first stories were historical fantasy which she enjoyed working on tremendously, so much so that as more fiction followed, so did the acclaim.She said: ldquoIrsquove been lucky enough to win an ACNI SIAP award in  and then a second ACNI award earlier this year. A short story I wrote called The Armada Tree,won Kraxon Magazinersquos Story of the Year Award.ldquoI am lucky enough to belong to some brilliant writing groups, not least the Hexmen, the Yellow Door Group, and the Belfast Writers Group.

They are great people and include some successful writers who have freely shared their knowledge and experience.Kerry has packed a lot of living and experience into her le mdash shersquos worked as a veterinary surgeon, scienticresearcher, computer studies teacher and stable hand.ldquoIrsquove had plenty of le experience to draw upon and inspire me, she said. ldquoSometimes I give talks for NI Libraries to groups of budding writers eager to learn the basics and I often read my work at these events too. I love being able to do this.

which inform drivers about their speed are to be erected in Downpatrick, Newcastle, Killyleagh and Castlewellan by the districtrsquos Policing and Community Safety Partnership.The signs are to be erected at the Strangford Road in Downpatrick, Newcastlersquos South Promenade, Castlewellanrsquos Dublin Road and the Shrigley Road in Killyleagh.A total of seven signs will be erected shortly across the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area as part of the major clampdown on speeders.The move has been welcomed by a number of local councillors including Dermot Curran, Willie Clarke, Billy Walker, Gareth Sharvin and John Trainor who say that the new signs have the potential to save lives by encouraging drivers to slow down in what are heavily populated areas.Cllr Curran said that drivers regularly ignored the mph zone along a large stretch of the Strangford Road.ldquoThis area is densely populated and there are always people walking at this part of the town. A number of accidents at this location have been blamed on speeding, with residents highlighting their concerns about the issue for some considerable time, he continued.ldquoThere is a clear and obvious need for the authorities to get to grips with the speeding problem and the PCSP deserves praise for this initiative. Unfortunately, many drivers think a large part of the Strangford Road is governed by a mph limit which is not case. Residents I have spoken to about the problem say the speed of some vehicles is frightening to say the least.Cllr Curran said that were many housing developments accessed via the Strangford Road which carries a high volume of pedestrian traffic.He added: ldquoWhile welcoming the speed indicator sign, I believe there is a need to move the mph limit back beyond the former Down Council headquarters. Speeders need to slow down before someone is killed.Cllr Sharvin believes one of the real benefits of the announcement is that it has ldquokick-started and energised a conversation among the public about other hot spots for speeding.He added: ldquoI recognise that these signs are an expensive investment but, ultimately, the success of them will be measured in how the public respond to them. If we can begin to see speeds lowered across the district and lives potentially saved, the scheme will have been a success.Cllr Trainor said he hopes the new signs will raise further awareness in driversrsquo minds on the need to reduce their speed along these stretches of road.He added: ldquoWe know that the Strangford Road is a hotspot for speeding traffic and the dangers associated with this. If the new signs reduce speed and help save lives they will be worthwhile, but but road safety is everyonersquos concern.Cllr Clarke said he is ldquodelighted that one of the new signs will be placed at Newcastlersquos South Promenade which carries a huge volume of traffic.He said news of the speed indicator sign will be welcomed be residents who live at this part of the resort and the many pedestrians who walk in the area will be encouraged by the initiative.ldquoI hope that the sign will go some way towards tackling the issue of speeding at this busy part of Newcastle, he said.ldquoThis is a welcome move and something that Sinn Feacutein has been lobbying for over many years to protect residents who live at this part of the resort. The speed sign will also hopefully make South Promenade safer for pedestrians.Cllr Clarke said the PCSP is committed to improving road safety across the district and will continue to work with local communities and local police to make this happen.The Mournes councillor also welcomed the provision of a speed sign at the Dublin Road in Castlewellan which is a main link to a number of towns and villages and carries a high volume of traffic.Welcoming the presence of a new speed sign at the Shrigley Road in Killyleagh, Cllr Walker said that he hopes drivers get the message and slow down.ldquoMany people walk along this particular road and it is vital that everything is done to keep them safe. I hope that thew new sign will act as a deterrent and drivers will ease off the accelerator, he continued.He added: ldquoThe PCSP deserves credit for listening to the concerns of elected representatives and the wider public on the speeding issue. The message must go out that speeders are placing their lives and those of other road users in danger. My appeal to all drivers is to obey the restrictions in place and drive below the permitted level in built-up areas..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Customers and owners delighted pubs re open  ","story":"PUBLICANS across the district have reported a positiveto opening their doors for the first time since the Covid- lockdown.Bars and restaurants were permitted to open for business last Friday by the Stormont Executive under strict conditions.Customers were only allowed indoors provided they were dining and and non-diners who permitted to drink outside, both socially distanced to m between people.After nearly four months of closure, the reopening was welcomed by publicans and customers alike.Despite being hampered by heavy rain throughout the weekend, publicans reported a generally positive reception by customers experiencing the lsquonew normalrsquo way of socialising.However, several publicans claimed that full compliance to all the drinking regulations was patchy in some towns throughout the district.Stephen Magorrian, owner of Denvirrsquos Coaching Inn in Downpatrick, said while numbers of drinkers and diners were less than normal over the weekend, his customers appreciated the social distancing precautions and measures his team had put in place.ldquoWhile it was probably quieter than I would have liked inside for dining, it was very well received by all our customers who were appreciative of how we had trained our staff and the measures we had in place, said Mr Magorrian.ldquoWe had a lot of very positive comments from customers as they left which we are taking as a good sign.ldquoLast weekend was really about making people feel safe in the hope that they will feel safe for customers and staff and be happy toand word will spread that we are taking their safety seriously.He added that while his team had planned how to cope with larger than expected turnout of customers by hiring a door supervisor, ldquosome other bars really went for it, like it was St Patrickrsquos Day.ldquoWe had no issues with any of our customers who were drinking outside and we were happy to welcome them back.Jack OrsquoHare, owner of OrsquoHarersquos in Newcastle, said he had enjoyed a ldquobusy weekend.ldquoCustomers were delighted to be back and so were our staff.

He said coronavirus restrictions have had a ldquodevastating impact on the railwayrsquos operations and its restoration work and needs financial help.Mr Gardiner also said the railway is likely to remain closed for the remainder of the year due to the restrictions around Covid- and the specic challenges the organisation faces with its trains, infrastructure and operations.ldquoWith no income for the rest of the year, we will face major challenges keeping the railway maintained and ensuring our vital work on our carriages, locomotives, track and stations can continue, he explained.ldquoOur final attempts at securing Covid- support funding from Stormont have failed, so now we reluctantly must turn to our members and supporters to ask for help. We need to raise at least pound, this year just to keep the railway in a good condition and make some progress with essential projects.Mr Gardiner said he could not see now to resume train operations this year in a way that will be safe and, at the same time, not compound the organisationrsquos financial situation by operating trains at a loss.Mr Gardiner said the railway supported the governmentrsquos call for a total lockdown of activities in the fight against Covid-.Even so, he said the lockdown had a ldquomassive hit hit on the railwayrsquos finances, leaving it struggling to keep ready to reopen when it is safe to do so.ldquoWe have just under pound, of bills to pay this year in essential, unavoidable costs alone, to keep the business in mothballs, Mr Gardiner revealed.ldquoWe have been paying these through our savings which were built up over the past few years but were meant for long-awaited essential maintenance, critical repair and restoration work to safeguard the railwayrsquos long term future.ldquoWe have watched as heritage railways across the UK and Ireland launched fundraising campaigns but, at a time when people were worried about basics such as paying their bills, buying groceries and had worries about their jobs and the health of their families, we felt that it just wasnrsquot right to ask for money for a steam railway, so we tried many other avenues of funding.ldquoOur final hope for funding from Stormont was an application for pound, to the Covid- Charities Fund to cover the day-to-day essential costs we have already accrued to date, but we learnt within days of the application being made that it had been rejected.ldquoThis was our last chance with the government schemes as we did not qualy for funding under either the pound, or pound, business support schemes, designed specically for the tourism and hospitality industry as our rateable value was pound, over the pound, threshold. We were also not eligible for the Micro Business Hardship Fund, the Sports and Clubs or voluntary and community sector hardship funds.The chairman continued: ldquoIn short, we have been rejected for support every time because we were too small, too large, or missing a financial threshold by only a few pounds.ldquoSometimes we miss out because we have a small cash reserve for those vital projects, a reserve which is also made up of legacy donations from benefactors who have passed away and wished their donations to go to landmark projects rather than pay day-to-day bills.Mr Gardiner said the heritage railwayrsquos only public funding was what he described as a ldquomodest grant from Newry, Mourne and Down Council and that a question mark hung over this yearrsquos funding.He added: ldquoWe must thank those MLAs, councillors and public representatives who have lobbied and argued our case, even mentioning us in correspondence with NI Executive ministers as an example of an organisation that appears to have fallen through the cracks.ldquoMany of us within the Downpatrick and Co Down Railway feel deep disappointment and frustration, as it feels like every door we try to open is either locked or closed on us. It also feels like, as a business, we are being penalised for good financial governance.Anyone interested in making a financial donation is asked to visit the heritage railwayrsquos website..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Hopes for restoration of Shrigley clock for its 150th anniversary  ","story":"DETAILS of fresh efforts to restore a historic clock which was once the centrepiece of village le in Shrigley have been unveiled.The iconic Martin Memorial clock, which had its bell and interior mechanism removed over three decades ago and placed in storage, celebrates its th anniversary next year.To mark the occasion, Rowallane councillor Terry Andrews is hoping that Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Housing Executive will join forces to help put the tick back in the famous clock.He says it is sad to see the historic landmark falling into disrepair and hopes efforts to restore it will be successful to preserve it for generations to come.Designed in  by Timothy Hevey, the clock is constructed of brown stone in three layers, with the base surrounded by iron railings. Originally, there was an elaborate lamp at each corner and also a drinking fountain.While there have been ious meetings over many years to discuss the restoration of the clock, nothing ever happened, something Cllr Andrews hopes that he can help put right.He says while money is tight for many organisations which had to deal with the coronavirus pandemic, he hopes the local council and housing officials will commit to helping restore the famous clock to provide a reminder to current generations of Shrigleyrsquos industrial past.The village was founded by the Martin family, who came from Pott Shrigley in Cheshire in  and who owned the spinning factory in the village.It was powered by water from the nearby Clea Lough and while the mill has long gone mdash it is reported to have employed  people at one time mdash the clock tower erected by the people of Shrigley in  in honour of the Martin family remains.Cllr Andrews believes that residents in Shrigley, Killyleagh and further afield would like to see the clock restored to its former glory and hopes he can secure agreement in principle for this to happen.ldquoWe canrsquot allow the clock to deteriorate further, he declared. ldquoIt is an integral part of Shrigleyrsquos history and it must be preserved.ldquoIn the past it was suggested that a community garden could be developed alongside the clock and perhaps that is something worth pursuing.ldquoI think it is incumbent upon those who can help restore the clock to step forward and perhaps the restoration project is something that the Department for Communities could also lend its support to, given the clockrsquos historic link with the former mill located nearby.Cllr Andrews said that identying funds to finance any restoration work was vital in moving forward, also highlighting the need for an agreed plan to maintain the clock.ldquoThe Martin Memorial clock is at the heart of Shrigleyrsquos history and culture and it must not be lost. It must be preserved and those who can help achieve this must come forward, he continued.ldquoGiven its history, a restored clock could become an attraction for visitors and people researching the arearsquos past.ldquoI hope that I can help harness interest and willingness in number of agencies to weigh in behind a successful regeneration project in the heart of Shrigley.

It turned out it was a good deion!Our motto for the walk, lsquoBe Amazed!rsquo, was inspired by Patrickrsquos Confession in which he recounts his journey to Ireland as a fth century slave before being freed spiritually and physically by God. To be honest I was amazed all seven wanted to do the whole Downpatrick Camino in one day as, for many people, I would recommend two half days. It is not for the faint-hearted!Welcoming everyone, I pointed out the finish time was between pm and pm and the Dean of Down, the Very Rev Henry Hull, kindly turned up to bless us on our way, leading us in the pilgrim prayer, which is found in the new pilgrim passport.ldquoI arise today through Godrsquos strength to pilot me, Godrsquos might to uphold mehellipThe newly produced Pilgrim Passport was to stamped at each point along the way: Saint Patrick Centre, Inch Abbey, Saul Church, Slieve Patrick, Struell Wells, St Patrickrsquos Memorial Church, Downpatrick and St Patrickrsquos Grave.ldquoA wing and a prayer, was how one pilgrim put it.Our journey would usually begin at the Saint Patrick Centrersquos IMAX film which explores the story of Patrick but due to lockdown restrictions we skipped this part and, instead, there was a quick photo-call with the new high viz jackets, sponsored by Phoenix Gas.It was an eclectic group: the aptly-named Hillary who had climbed Tanzaniarsquos Kilimanjaro and another, a journalist, who planned to write about the Way a mother and son with strong links to Downpatrick a married couple, Jim and Marion, from Belfast, who were around retirement age and had walked the Camino de Santiago in Spain and finally their friend, Colette, a casual walker blessed with great faith, a sharp wit and, I recall, a fancy gadget that calculated distance.We set out, climbing St Patrickrsquos Staircase and were headed towards Down Museum when a pilgrim asked me about the building behind us.That panicky feeling from school days when my teacher asked an unexpected question began to rise. My credibility as a guide was at stake. Thankfully I had looked up the school out of curiosity the night before. ldquoOh yes, that school was built about  years ago by the Southwell familyhellipIt seemed to get easier after that as we walked towards the Mound of Down to hear about John de Courcy before marching through the fields towards Inch. We would have to take the Belfast Road, as my dream of having a bridge, or a boat, to cross the Quoile was still a dream.At least the grass was freshly cut and the weather was dry. The Lord was good to us.During the tour at Inch Abbey we met a local man, Roger, who kindly pointed out some little known facts and features including the early ldquospa hot-tub where the monkrsquos infirmary had once stood on the banks of the Quoile.After a break, we set off for the banks of the Quoile River and Saul Hill, the group happily chatting to one another after a lockdown of three and a half months. The Quoile is a gentle part of the walk and as the river flowed, ducklings were paddling behind their mother, like pilgrims on the Way.The Mearne Road was a bit more challenging as the way got steeper but we knew Patrick himself had made this climb on his route to founding the first church on the island. Before long we could see the round tower and had made it in good time, around :pm. A trinity was there to greet us mdash the Centre Director Dr Tim Campbell, pilgrim guide Elaine Kelly and the Dean of Down, who recounted the history of Saul Church.When we arrived at The Barn at Saul, just yards away, we were all ready for the pilgrim welcome, the pilgrim washroom and the pilgrim lunch mdash soup and sandwiches, tea and coffee with carefully observed social distancing.They were a happy bunch as I bade them farewell and offered a lt back to anyone who wanted it. But all agreed they wanted to continue with Elaine to Slieve Patrick and then on to Struell Wells via the Lecale path, what I had dubbed the Way of Tranquility until I fell flat on my face in the mud, going over a stile the week before.Hours later, back at the centre, we waited for the pilgrims to . Around pm a message came through that the mother and son had to leave for an appointment and one of the walkers had hit her wall just before the ancient ones at Struell Wells. I put the kettle on and was relieved to see Colette, the walker from Ballymurphy, coming towards the centre, half an hour later.She was exhausted but in good humour as she regaled us with her observations, including the need for a toilet at Struell Wells. ldquoPilgrimrsquos Pain, she declared, and jokedthat she had less suffering during the Troubles in Ballymurphy.Slumped in her chair with her tea at the St Patrickrsquos Centre, having completed % of the walk, she insisted that the Way was way more than  miles . She referred to a fancy gadget ndash which actually turned out to be accurate. Our five-mile estimate for the morning was closer to six miles and the afternoon closer to ten. So a sweet  miles altogether. What would the other pilgrims say when they got back Like an expectant mother and father, Dr Tim Campbell and I waited. I was looking at my watch and nervously flicking at the kettle switch until we caught the reflection of the high-vis jackets in one of the shop windows.

It often rained, of course, butyou could hear lambeg drummers in the distance putting in a bit of last minute practice then you knew all was okay.As I got older I was more interested in going to a party somewhere, nothing elaborate as nobody had money for big parties then, butyou could afford a Babycham you were rich and you made it do the whole night.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...If your ear tuned into those lambeg drums somewhere in the distance you walked towards the sound, despite that teenage idea that somehow you needed to move on from tradition and think new things. A few would have gravitated to a local pub, but even that seemed a bit outdated. It was summer after all, parties were better outdoors.It was the late s early s and celebrations were usually innocent affairs. Did we ever stop to think of what the Twelfth celebration might be like half a century later  I don’t think I ever gave it much thought, but had I done so I doubtI’d have imagined bonfires like towering infernos, open air drink parties with many of the participants waving not just a little Babycham but an entire bottle of the real stuff. Proper Orangemen they were not, but we knew that. The men who were to march the next day were at home with their families, brushing down their bowler hats, polishing the shoes and making sure their sashes were free of tea stains from the previous year.I carried some of the traditions with me when I became a mother with children who were anxious to know on the Eleventh Night what the funny noise they heard in the distancewas, and why were we having a small bonfire on a summer night when it wasn’t Halloween  Their father had no connection with the Orange Order, nor his father before him – he was Cornish – so it was left to me to teach my children about this historic celebration, peculiar to Ulster. When it was the turn of our local town to host the big event for the area, I took my two boys along, one in a buggy, to see the bands parading through the town.The younger one was alarmed by the sound of the drums and let out a yell. He wanted home, out of all the noise. The older one didn’t seem to mind the noise but hadn’t a clue what it was all about. I mean, how do you teach your little ones about the Twelfth, and what to expect at a parade  I gave up that day and we ed home much to their relief. Every Eleventh Night after that I made a point of having a small bonfire in the garden. We could always hear drums in the distance and one year, when they were older, I took them to see the local men practising on their lambegs in the village a mile away. They showed little interest and subsequently spent their summer holidays in Strangford’s Seaboard Sailing School.Now grown men and competent sailors, I doubteither of them could tell me what the Twelfth is about. My grandchildren live abroad so they won’t have a clue either though I never give up hope of one year being able to take them to see a Twelfth celebration which attracts visitors from all over the world.So, tonight I will be at home with my memories and my sense of failure at realising that this is one tradition this family will not be able to carry on. Yet, each year the Twelfth celebration becomes bigger and young people involved in the tradition will be out there tonight celebrating – I hope sensibly – to ensure that it’s something in our DNA that is worth holding on to.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gxMtzJ sc-dfVpRl dLpuYr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

In fact decisive leadership was shown months ago when the traditional Twelfth was called off.The temptation to breach the health guidance will be great.

Please try again later.Submitting...The young couple who describe themselves as ‘‘active travellers’’ normally visit Europe four or five times a year, but this summer have decided to stay closer to home. ‘‘Coronavirus has firmly put us in our place and we have decided to stay at home this year and plan for future travels,’’ said Sarah from Tobermore, Co Londonderry. ‘‘Our main reason for not travelling to Europe this year is fear of a second wave coming and getting caught up in the middle of it the travel situation in England is still dferent to here so the unknown of whether we would have to isolate once ing home is off-putting also in terms of work and money. ‘‘The irregularity of flights is also a downfall with travel at the minute and would prove a hassle to arrange good flight times and therefore we have decided to wait until next year where flights will be more flexible.’’The pair plan on staying in Enniskillen to visit the Marble Arch caves and Cuilcagh Mountain. ‘‘We would also like to spend a weekend in Newcastle whenthe good weather comes. We understand how hard this time must be for holidaymakers so instead of taking day trips to dferent areas of Northern Ireland, we aim to spend at least one night in each location.’’However, as Sarah has found, many places are booking up quickly.‘‘Even in the republic we have found it hard to find availability in the near future. As frustrating this may be for us, it’s definitely a positive to see people willing to help holidaymakers on the island.’’But Sarah and Mathew haven’t given up all hopes of a foreign trip this year. ‘‘In terms of travelling once this has passed, we hope to visit both Prague and France and hopefully squeeze in some Christmas markets before the end of the year.’’ Ciaran O’Neill, managing director of the award-winning Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Londonderry, believes  will be the year that hotels in Northern Ireland sht from “trying to attract overseas visitors to looking closer to home for their business”.‘‘Last year, we invested time looking at domestic tourism and how we could sustain and grow that market. This presented a real insight into what local visitors want from a short break, and I’m confident that Bishop’s Gate Hotel can offer people exactly that,’’ said Mr O’Neill.‘‘We have traditionally performed well in the domestic market, consistently attracting couples who have been interested in getting a short break away and enjoying a good ‘foodie’ experience. Equally our offering appeals to those who are keen to do some shopping and take in a concert at the Millennium Forum.“Being in the heart of the city means we are ideally located for guests to experience ‘Legenderry’.“Our July bookings show that there is a strong demand from consumers who are keen to book a break away after numerous weeks of lockdown. We’ve also received enquiries from families who are having to change their holiday plans for the summer, and who are trying to determine what availability exists, and what amenities they may be able to access in the local vicinity.‘‘To tap into this market segment we have tailored our offers and we are currently looking at partnerships with other tourism providers, creating activity packages that encourage families to stay for longer and sample ious entertainment options around the city.’’Tourism NI is urging people to get behind and be part of a campaign aimed at enjoying a short break at home across the summer and into the autumn.The campaign reminds people that you can have epic fun without the epic trek with so much to discover afresh locally. From the vibrant city buzz of Belfast and Londonderry to the stunning beauty of the Glens of Antrim and the North Coast to the Orchards of Armagh, the Lakes of Fermanagh and the rugged scenery of Tyrone, local ‘visitors’ are invited to embrace Northern Ireland’s giant spirit.Tourism NI chief executive John McGrillen said: “We are encouraging local people to see Northern Ireland through the eyes of the millions of tourists who come here for the warmth of the welcome, world class food and drink, the beauty of the landscapes and the immersive experiences on offer.“The tourism industry has suffered greatly from the effects of the lockdown and as we move into a period of recovery we are sending a very clear message that your favourite places, as well as those yet to be discovered, will benefit greatly from your support.”Norman McBride, general manager, Ballygally Castle, Co Antrim, said: “For us, August is looking like it is going to be a lot busier.“I think people wait for the first couple of weeks just to tread carefully and see how it goes. They’ll see how things go, they’ll seethere’s no spike , and then people might venture a bit more.’’Mr McBride said most booking enquiries are from the domestic market, but there have been some from mainland UK. ‘‘We have lots of regulars who come from Manchester and they are texting me every week asking when can they come. People are keen to travel, but it just depends on flying and the boats.’’If travellers do decide to book in what can they expect  “We have your sanitised keys ready for you. We are doing complimentary room service breakfast, so there’s no walking around a buffet breakfast. This has worked well so far, because the most we’ve had is  rooms. Going forward that may change a bit. People like the thought of getting a lovely served breakfast to their room while they sit there staring out over the ocean.‘‘And Mr McBride said as well as the hotel staff enjoying theof guests, Ballygally’s famous friendly ghost, Lady Isabella, is also happy the doors have re-opened. “She’s missed the company,” he laughed.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gxMtzJ sc-dfVpRl dLpuYr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

has spoken of the plight of rural communities during lockdown in Uganda.Three months ago, Jenipher Wetaka Sambazi, a Fairtrade coffee farmer from the Mt Elgon region in Uganda, was sharing her experiences of the benefit of Fairtrade in Penarthrsquos Tabernacle Baptist Church.More NewsVictory in campaign to save Dinas Powys ancient woodland as dam plan is abandonedVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownNow she and her family, like communities around the world, are under lockdown.In March, campaigners, businesses, supporters, and students from around Wales heard Jenipherrsquos story, face to face.Now she is unable to travel or even meet with her neighbours.This means the coffee picked at the end of the last harvest remains on the mountain and Jenipher and her fellow farmers are prohibited from travelling to gather it for processing under the current lockdown rules.There are currently several hundred known cases of covid- in Uganda, but none in the Mount Elgon region and no fatalities in Uganda as yet.Farmers want to keep it this way, but lockdown is causing other concerns such as limiting access to food and healthcare.This is the time of year when there is the least amount of food available, and the closing of markets and freedom to travel for farmers to source food and water means that times are exceptionally hard.Jenipher as vice-chairwoman of a Fairtrade coffee cooperative, is responsible for many who rely on the cooperative for work.The expert hand-sorters who are seasonal workers and rely on this part of the coffee chain to feed their family at this time, have no coffee to sort.While they may have some spare eggs, vegetables or matoke to trade, the threat of soldiers prohibiting them from doing so is too much for them.Farmer co-operatives, an essential element of Fairtrade, enable and encourage communities to work together.Fairtrade also requires an extra amount of money, the Fairtrade premium, to be paid to producers.Fairtrade farmers like Jenipher are struggling, but they have the benefits of a strong local community as well as the backup of the Fairtrade premium.Fairtrade International have announced a .m euro Fairtrade Producer Relief fund targeting the immediate needs and Resilience Fund to help producers rebuild their businesses after Covid-.Jenipher Wettaka Sambazi said: ldquoLe is hard.ldquoThe markets are shut so there is nowhere to sell or earn money, or to buy food and basic essentials.ldquoLocal health centres have been shut to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, but since all transport is banned, those who need operations, treatment or antenatal care need to walk  km to the nearest hospital.ldquoTwo women and their unborn babies have died on the way.\"Roger Casey, who attends Tabernacle Baptist Church said: ldquoIt was wonderful to meet Jenipher and hear her story.ldquoWe get through a lot of coffee in our office and meeting a real coffee farmer from Uganda makes you think about the real people and real lives behind that Fairtrade logo.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquoMeeting Jenipher during her visit to Wales earlier this year was inspiring.ldquoThe increasing dficulties facing rural farming communities because of the pandemic has shown how important Fairtrade cooperatives continue to be and I am glad that leaders like Jenipher continue to promote the benefits of Fairtrade and to support communities.National co-ordinator of Fair Trade Wales, Aileen Burmeister added: ldquoFair Trade producers are being impacted by covid- restrictions.ldquoGlobal stock markets are falling, meaning that farmers and workers are receiving far less for their produce.\"It is in these times that we can really see how important the Fairtrade minimum price is. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

These include:Communication of health information, and how effective it isCultural issues relating to the suitability of health and social services for BAME communitiesIncome and employment insecurity, which is experienced disproportionately by BAME communitiesPoor quality of ethnicity data, which is preventing accurate analysisHousing overcrowding and environmentThe financial burden created by migration statusThe role of structural and systemic racism and disadvantage.The report is by the BAME Covid- expert advisory group, set up by First Minister Mark Drakeford to look at the reasons why people from BAME communities were more likely to be adversely affected by coronavirus.:One of its two sub-groups was tasked with examining the socio-economic factors, chaired by Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna, professor of management and organization at Cardf Business School, Cardf University.\"Therersquos an overall theme running through our research for this report. It centres on long-standing racism and disadvantage, and the lack of BAME representation within decision-making processes,\" said Professor Ogbonna, who is also a trustee and vice-chair of Race Council Wales.ldquoThe coronavirus pandemic is, in some respects, revealing the consequences of a lack of action on race equality.ldquoMany of the issues wersquove highlighted have been identied and discussed previously, but they havenrsquot been addressed in any systematic and sustained way.Analysis of Covid- related deaths across England and Wales by ethnicity showed that people from a black ethnic background are at a greater risk of death involving COVID- than all other ethnic groups.The Office for National Statistics study showe that the risk for black males has been more than three times higher than white males, and nearly two-and-a-half times higher for black females than white.Adjusting for socio-economic factors and geographical location partly explains the increased risk, but there remains twice the risk for black males and around one-and-a-half times for black females. Signicant dferences also remain for Bangladeshi, Pakistani and Indian men. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

have seen a massive increase in areas such as recycling and waste.The other area of increased spending is in social services, which normally spends around  per cent of our budget.\"That is going to go up dramatically because people are getting frailer and succumbing to covid- and we are also supporting people in care homes and providing PPE for our staff and the care homes.Overall the virus is

while the council takes steps to mitigate further issues.A meeting with residents and the local community council was held on Tuesday, June  to explain the steps the council would be taking, in the

The co-consecrators along with myself will be the Bishop of Meath and Kildare and the Bishop of Derry and Raphoe. The preacher will be the Rt Revd Kenneth Clarke, formerly Bishop of Kilmore, Elphin and Ardagh.“Because it is likely that churches will still be operating under strict rules of social distancing in September, attendance will be limited to the family, close friends and colleagues of the bishop-elect, with an opportunity for a more expansive liturgical event at a future date in Belfast Cathedral. However, the service in Armagh will be streamed and recorded.“I would ask you to keep the bishop-elect and his family in your prayers as he prepares for his episcopal ordination.”Speaking in February, Mr Davison said: “The members of the Electoral College for the Diocese of Connor have done me a great honour in electing me to serve as the next bishop of the diocese. \u2028I am very conscious of the great responsibility that is being entrusted to me.”The bishop-elect succeeds the Rt Revd Alan Abernethy who retired at the end of December. Mr Davison was ordained in  and began his ministry in the Diocese of Armagh as Curate of St Mark’s, Portadown . He has served as Rector of Carrickfergus since  and Archdeacon of Belfast since .Meanwhile, the Archbishop of Armagh also announced the Episcopal Electoral College for the Diocese of Clogher will have its first meeting on Wednesday, September , in St Macartin’s Cathedral, Enniskillen, commencing with a service of Holy Communion at .am.--A message from the EditorThank you for reading this story on our website.

From this date, passengers travelling on most bus, train and ferry services in Northern Ireland will be required to wear a face covering. Face coverings will also be required in public transport stations. There will be exemptions for those who are not able to wear a face covering for health and medical reasons, and for children under the age of . Outdoor areas of a ferry where social distancing can be maintained will be exempt from the requirements, along with school transport.  The Executive has agreed that the cross-departmental group that has been established to consider face coverings will engage with the tour coach and taxi industry to explore extending the requirement to these transport modes. Making the announcement, Minister Nichola Mallon said: “As we move through the Executive’s recovery plan, more and more of the economy and society is opening up. Wemust remember however that Covid- is still with us. We need to remain vigilant and continue to play our part in controlling the virus to protect ourselves and others. “As restrictions on our movement are eased, the safety of passengers and staff remains my priority.The evidence suggests that you can reduce the risk of spreading the virus by wearing a face covering. That is why, with the support of my Executive colleagues and the unions, I am announcing that face coverings will be mandatory on public transport, from Friday July th. “The requirement will apply to passengers and also staff in public areas who are not protected by a screen. However, there will be exemptions for those who are not able to wear a face covering for specic health and medical reasons.” A face covering is a covering of any type which covers a person’s nose and mouth it does not have to be a surgical face mask. While face coverings can offer protection to others, they are not a substitute for other protective measures and it is important that people continue to follow social distancing and wash or sanitise hands regularly. Minister Mallon continued: “We are asking you to take personal responsibility and do the right thing to protect the health and well-being of others. The fact of the matter is you can spread the virus to other more vulnerable people without even knowing you have it. By wearing a face covering you are showing your support and consideration for other passengers and staff. “It is important to be aware that wearing face coverings will not be suitable for all members of the public and we need to be sensitive to this and know that reasons for not wearing a face covering may not always be visible. “Advice will be available on nidirect and social media channels. Translink staffwill begin preparing commuters for the requirement to wear face coverings. “It is also important that you do not get a  sense of security about the level of protection a face covering offers. They are not a substitute for social distancing or good hand hygiene. While I know many will find it challenging in the coming days and weeks to keep up compliance with the rules, I want to applaud the public for their leadership. The public have done the heavy lting and kept us all safe. You have been the leaders in Northern Ireland fighting Covid- and I am asking you to keep it up and we will beat this together. “By acting together and thinking of each other we can reduce the risk of transmission.”  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ddaaeffbaebd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_caadffbcc   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/258/172/true/GN4_DAT_3132859.jpg--.jpg?1589969356000\\","title":"castlederg security alert ends ","story":"A security alert at Millbrook Gardens in Castlederg has ended, and a suspicious object which was examined at the scene, declared a hoax.
