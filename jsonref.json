The gong is among Bafta\u0027s highest prizes and is presented annually in honour of Michael Balcon, the British film producer known for his work with Ealing Studios.Previous recipients include Andy Serkis and Ridley and Tony Scott. Bafta has said it \u0027did not know about any allegations relating to Noel Clarke prior to the announcement of the OBCC award on 29 March\u0027.The organisation was responding to an article in Thursday\u0027s Guardian in which claims were levelled against Clarke.Following the claims, which Clarke said he \u0027vehemently denies\u0027, Bafta announced it was suspending his membership and his outstanding British contribution to cinema award until further notice.Updating its members on Friday, the organisation said in a letter: \u0027We wanted to inform you of the background to this situation to give you the full picture.\u0027To be very clear, we did not know about any allegations relating to Noel Clarke prior to the announcement of the OBCC award on 29 March.\u0027We want to reassure you that we have treated this matter with the utmost seriousness, care and proper process at every stage.

I didn’t think about the terroir of grape-growing, the nose of whisky or what wine to pair with raw tilapia. On sunny days, I just thought about the most enjoyable way to quench my thirst. Now, the clank of a metal bottle opener and the hiss of a cold Thatchers Cider opening is enough to bring me back to the Meadows in Edinburgh, for a post-lecture picnic with friends. Stretched out on the grass as the rays warm my skin, the air is filled with the smoky smell of barbecue. Summer walks have been made all the sweeter with a sip of cider at the end. Arriving at a sweep of beach, blanket at the ready, or settling at the end of a pier as the sun sets. The cool fizz of cider tickling down my throat while the sky streaks violet and hazy pink is an unbeatable feeling. On an emotional level, clinking bottles with a friend at the end of the day is the perfect reward. On a practical level, a couple of bottles of ice-cold Thatchers in your rucksack on the way to the sea cools your back – ideal. Cider is the taste of a barbecue with my family – the only way we were allowed to see each other in summer 2020. My dad cooked venison burgers for the first time, an attempt to impress me, the “food and drink writer”, making jokes about not wanting a bad review. Despite the burger buns being a bit frozen in the middle, I gave it 1010. The sun was shining, family was gathered, the cider was flowing and for a brief second it felt like normality again. The epitome of the “better times” we’re all looking forward to. I can’t always suppress the drinks writer in me and did have to note that the iron-y tang of venison burgers goes particularly well with the light sweetness of Thatchers Katy. On the slopes of the Mendip Hills, Thatchers grows 458 different varieties of apple in perfect conditions – more than 25 varieties of them are used for ciders. The autumnal rain, summer sun and lack of winter frost combine to create juicy, flavour-filled apples. They have a cider for every taste bud: sharp and cloudy, sweet and pink. As a drinks writer, I’ve sampled more ciders than I care to remember. Thatchers Katy is the choice for sunny days and balmy nights. While Thatchers’ other ciders are made from a combination of different types of apple, Thatchers Katy is made from just one type. Red as a fairytale apple and sweet as strawberries, Katy apples are the pride of the crop and first to be run through the mill. It’s what you want to be drinking to get that real thirst-quenching moment, with only a hint of sweetness that doesn’t overpower. It sits between sweet and dry, with a crisp finish, so it’s incredibly drinkable. Being an apple-based drink, it goes best with anything pork. But its lightness also carries well with salads and summer food. Think charcuterie boards laden with spicy salami, salty prosciutto, and garlicky mortadella. The slight sweetness to Thatchers Katy cuts through the saltiness of prosciutto beautifully. Hand-held picnic food – scotch eggs, sausage rolls, and pork pies – tends to be savoury-heavy, so goes down a treat with a sweet cider, paired best with a sunset view, of course. But it also mixes well with fruity dishes – a salad sprinkled with glistening pomegranate seeds and topped with ripe avocado. The delicate fizz works particularly well with the creamy squish of avocado. Meat and salad, barbecues and picnic food it’s as though Thatchers Katy was designed for summer. So, it’s no wonder cider is the British summer drink of choice it pairs naturally with grilled meat and fruity salads, it’s easy to drink, and that hit of sweet apple sings of good times. For me, cider evokes memories of barbecues with friends and family, sunsets over the sea and picnics in the park, and Thatchers Katy is my cider of choice this summer, for its strawberry sweetness and crisp finish. If you need me, I’ll be sipping a cold cider in the park, or on my way to the shore, two bottles clinking away and cooling my back. To better times.

For a bite-size section, head to pretty Perros-Guirec, two hours’ drive from Saint-Malo, being sure to try traditional galettes at Crêperie du Ranolien, before hiking the Pink Granite coast, with its rosy boulders reminiscent of Seychelles. Alternatively head for the Crozon peninsula, a three-hour drive cross-country from the port, for lovely swimming creeks and imposing headlands jutting into water the colour of mouthwash. The island loop one: Belle-Île-en-Mer, BrittanyWho knew there was a tiny island paradise so close to home, where white sands meet turquoise waves, lighthouses decorate promontories and sweet seaside cottages are painted candy colours. A little like a French take on the Isles of Scilly, Belle-Île-en-Mer has long attracted creatives such as Claude Monet, who painted its imposing Port Coton needles, and one of the early stars of the screen, the bohemian actress Sarah Bernhardt, who moved into the military fort here in 1894, hosting glamorous parties, with Edward VII among her guests. The fort is now a little museum, in a beautiful spot on the Pointe des Poulains, one of the highlights of the 51-mile coastal path that circles Brittany’s largest island. The path threads together the sheltered coves of the east, steep cliffs in the south, dunes for children to tumble down, and Le Palais harbour. Le Palais, the island’s main town, is where you’ll arrive if you take the hour-long ferry ride from Quiberon on the mainland. Ride the bus to different sections of the path and be sure to have an evening cocktail at Le Grand Large hotel, overlooking the sea. The magical forest one: Brittany’s mythical forestHolidays to Brittany are very often all about the sea, but there are magical walking routes too in the interior’s marshes, forests and hills. Brittany’s once-vast forest of Paimpont, west of Rennes, is thought to be the one referred to in medieval folklore and myths as Brocéliande, an enchanted, fairy-filled forest associated with Arthurian legends. Today, themed trails and a museum at the Château de Comper bring the stories to life, adding an ethereal slant to family walks on the forest’s network of fern-lined trails. Your closest base could be Brittany’s vibrant capital, Rennes, an hour’s drive south from the ferry port at St Malo. The dramatic one: Normandy’s Alabaster coast on the GR21For anyone yearning to tackle one of Europe’s mammoth GR hiking trails there couldn’t be a handier starting point than that of Normandy’s iconic GR21, which begins in the city of Le Havre, arrival port for the Brittany Ferries crossing from Portsmouth. Whether you ditch your car immediately and strike out to walk the full 115-mile route north to the fishing village of Le Tréport, which usually takes seven to 10 days, or drive to stroll shorter sections, is a matter for you and your thigh muscles to decide. The geology of this stretch echoes that on the other side of the Channel, with dramatic high white chalk cliffs earning it the moniker the Alabaster coast. While the beaches of Normandy might still be associated with the noisy barrages of D-day, now only the wind tussling the leaves and the odd gull call will prick your ears, leaving mental space for contemplation on a peaceful route voted best hiking trail in France in 2019’s annual French Hiking Federation survey. The path doesn’t always follow the coast due to the fragility of the cliffs, but descends often to beaches and villages tucked into ravines where rivers meet the sea, such as Fécamp, with an abbey, and Dieppe, with wonderful seafood restaurants. Look out too for second world war sites and Delacroix’s painting subject, St Pierre-en-Port. Just a little past Le Tréport, the lovely belle epoque seaside resort of Mers-les-Bains, with quaint bathing huts on a lively seafront, is a fabulous place to finish up. The boozy one: Normandy’s cider routeWhether you stagger it, swagger it or dart along like a teetotal hare, the 25-mile cider route is a beauty, connecting more than 20 cider farms in the lovely Pays d’Auge region of lower Normandy. Densely wooded hills, villages of colourful timber-framed houses, chateaux and farmland comprise a gorgeous backdrop for immersion in the appley booze-making expertise of the area. You’ll learn to appreciate the slightly bitter flavour of local ciders – neither sandpaper dry or juicy-sweet – perfect for quenching the thirst of parched hikers. Calvados (apple brandy), sometimes mixed with apple juice to make pommeau, has to be tasted along with perries and cheeses. Where should you base yourself? Try any of the characterful hotels in ancient towns such as Cambremer. The cultural one: the Loire estuary The Loire river may be most famous for the beautiful chateaux that decorate its banks, but many other interesting features lend it character as it wends its way west to the Atlantic. At its finale, a wide estuary forms a fascinating natural and semi-industrial environment that’s fun to explore on foot. A 37-mile trail through the estuary from Nantes to the ocean, takes in fishing villages, nature reserves and a fantastic art trail, the Estuaire Nantes\u0026lt\u0026gtSaint-Nazaire, featuring 33 mind-bending sculptures, dotted along the water’s edge. Picking out one section for a day’s walk, you might opt for the lively 11-mile stretch from Paimbœuf, a village of brightly coloured houses, to the seaside resort of Saint-Brevin-les-Pins, on the southern side opposite Saint-Nazaire. It offers sandy beaches, fishing huts on stilts and the art trail’s “Serpent d’Ocean” by Huang Yong Ping, a huge skeleton of a sea serpent submerged in the breakers that’s thrilling for children. Alternatively there are dozens of other shorter walking trails of a few miles throughout the southern estuary area, which are easily doable for little legs. The hilly one: the Alpes MancellesFor not-too-tough hiking challenges in a mountainous region that resembles a mini version of the Alps, head to the pretty Alpes Mancelles in the Atlantic Loire. The mountains here top out at only 200-400m, bless them, so are relatively easy to conquer, but will still earn you the kudos of having summited some of the highest peaks in western France. Le Mont des Avaloirs, at 416m, is the big boy of the region, providing wonderful views of the Sarthe river from a Brutalist-style concrete lookout point at the top.

Last month it was reported that the pandemic had reached Everest base camp and though officials later denied it, climbers have reported a wave of infections that were being covered up. Now it has emerged that 19 people, both foreign climbers and sherpas, at the base camp of Dhaulagiri, the world’s seventh highest mountain and part of the same range as Everest, have tested positive.

He told BBC Radio 4’s World at One programme:  Visitors who have had an EU-approved Covid-19 vaccine, recovered from the disease, or tested negative 48 hours prior to travelling will be allowed entry without restrictions, a tourism ministry source said. The new rules will apply to all countries apart from those on Italy’s travel restrictions blacklist, including Brazil and India. Italy’s government is racing to save its summer tourism season in the hope of salvaging an industry badly damaged by the coronavirus pandemic. Angela Giuffrida, the ’s Rome correspondent, has the full story here: Speaking at a virtual news conference attended also by chancellor Angela Merkel and the head of the WHO, Spahn said the world was still insufficiently prepared for pandemics. The new hub in Berlin, bringing together governmental, academic and private sector institutions, aims to harness global data to predict, prevent and respond to pandemic and epidemic risks worldwide, Reuters reports. “There will be more viruses that will emerge with the potential of sparking pandemics,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told the news conference. The health ministry last week said Kenya was suspending flights to and from India, Reuters reports.The country of 10m registered 60 new deaths, taking the total to 14,151, as Reuters reports.On Tuesday, India passed a grim milestone of 20m Covid-19 cases amid growing calls for the country to go into a national lockdown. Many health experts believe India’s true death toll to be five to 10 times higher than official data.  The earliest of these will be a shipment of 1.7m doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine which is due to arrive next week as part of the global Covax agreement, the Egyptian cabinet said in a statement. Egypt will also receive 1m doses of the Chinese Sinopharm vaccine to arrive in two shipments, and 500,000 doses of the Chinese Sinovac vaccine, the cabinet added.

Since then, over 250,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,900 people have died.Globally, over 150 million people have been diagnosed and over 3\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspis also in talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th.\u0026nbspHow many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?The HSE is currently vaccinating people in the top five cohorts:\u0026nbsppeople aged 65\u0026nbspand older who live in long-term care facilities (cohort 1), frontline healthcare workers (cohort 2), people aged 70 and older (cohort 3), people aged 16 to 69 who are at very high risk (cohort 4) and those aged 60 to 69 (cohort 5).\u0026nbspThe next groups to be offered a vaccine after this will be\u0026nbsppeople\u0026nbspaged 16 to 64 who are at high risk (cohort 7).

In an appearance at an Oireachtas committee today, Robert Watt repeatedly criticised the RTÉ programme and claimed the broadcaster did not offer the department a chance to appear on the programme to respond to allegations. Mr Watt said the practices alleged would not have been ethical but that “they didn’t take place”. He said the department had “comprehensively addressed” the allegations made as “not true”. Mr Watt said although the department did not claim it had never made mistakes, there was “no basis” for the substantive allegations made in the RTÉ programme. He said he regrets the department was not “more forceful” in its engagement with RTÉ before the broadcast. “We should have been more forceful with them, because I really don’t believe that the programme could stand up.”Asked about a phone call he made to RTÉ’s director general, Dee Forbes, before the programme aired, Mr Watt said he wanted to ensure Ms Forbes “understood the gravity of the allegations” and to make clear the department “didn’t believe the allegations were correct”. He said the department was reflecting on what it would do now, and had not waived any of its rights.In a statement posted on Twitter, RTÉ head of news Jon Williams said the station “stands by its journalism”.“It’s untrue to suggest that the Department of Health was not invited to participate by RTÉ investigates,” he wrote, outlining that the team wrote the the department two weeks ahead of the broadcast to put the allegations to them.“It’s also untrue to say there is no basis for what RTÉ Investigates reported. The truth matters. The point remains that the Department held sensitive information on vulnerable iniduals that can only have originated in confidential consultations those iniduals and their families had with medical professionals”He said the Department of Health confirmed it did hold such information during today’s session. Mr Watt defended the practice of sharing information between departments who are jointly named as defendants in legal cases – one of the practices highlighted by the programme. He said there are ways for “various information to be collated and shared” and defended it as a “longstanding practice” which makes “administrative sense” and is lawful. “It’s the only practical way in which I can see us managing these cases effectively.” Both Mr Watt and other senior officials repeatedly stated that information kept on file that might be seen as sensitive was largely provided by plaintiffs themselves during the course of litigation. However, it was acknowledged that in at least one instance, some information was provided by a HSE clinician to supply information that the department said it had not sought.The secretary general defended the gathering of information using “service updates” – reports provided to the department by the HSE on engagement with and use of health services by iniduals involved in litigation. He said they were part of a process “to bring to finality cases that had not been closed and were dormant”. He conceded that “there is information that could be deemed sensitive”on the files, but said: “There’s a suggestion here there’s something untoward, or inappropriate, or underhand going on here.. There’s not”. The service reports were also featured during the RTÉ programme. Mr Watt told Sinn Féin health spokesman David Cullinane: “If your characterisation of what was happening here was correct, it would trouble us. Of course it would, but it’s not”. Mr Watt said it would be true to say the department did not seek information from clinicians or schools directly or indirectly but instead sought updates from HSE managers. Asked by Mr Lahart if there was any evidence that the State through any of its agencies - rather than just the Department - gathered information that would be beyond the normal practice in the defence of a litigation case, Mr Watt said “no”. Similarly, asked if there was evidence the State had sought updates from schools or the Department of Education, Dr McLellan said the Department of Health and HSE had not, but that they could not speak for other departments. Finally, asked if the State or its agencies, rather than the Department, had sought clinical updates on litigants, Mr Watt again said there was not.Asked by Social Democrats co-leader Roisin Shortall about a template letter that went along with such requests, which explicitly stated families or solicitors should not be contacted about the request, he said “that probably should have been worded better than it is,” saying it is “not an attempt to seek information without the consent of parents”.Mr Watt said there is no basis for an independent inquiry into how the Department of Health handled legal cases involving children with special needs.He said he didn’t believe there was any “prima facie basis for an independent inquiry”, and he said there was “nothing untoward” in how the department had behaved.“If Dáil committees want to investigate, that’s their business,” he said but added there was no grounds he could see for an inquiry “based on evidence that we have. If others have other evidence they want to bring to bear, that might change it”.He said his view was there was no “basis for it under the various statutes that are there”. Mr Watt acknowledged “there are issues around data protection which the various papers identify, and we welcome the inquiry by the data protection commissioner, which is currently investigating data collection practices in this area.” He said the department would co-operate with the investigation and its outcomes.It is understood that the committee will meet in private next Tuesday to consider the next steps in its examination of the matter. The Oireachtas committee last week heard evidence in private from whistleblower Shane Corr, a department official whose protected disclosure informed the programme broadcast in March. Several times, Mr Watt said he could not address specific allegations made during that private session. “If you wanted us to be party to the discussion you had with the whistleblower last week, you should have invited us,” he said. Senator Martin Conway asked whether there was a unit in the department “storing and preparing information for potential legal challenges”, while Gino Kenny TD asked if representations made by Ministers and TDs were kept in a database and “searched across Government departments”.

Photograph: MaxwellsRecoupable deposits of 20 cent on cans and bottles are set to return as part of a wider Government initiative to reduce the incidence of litter in Ireland. Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications Eamon Ryan announced a total of over €8 million funding for litter prevention and anti-dumping in preparation for a summer in which most social activities will happen outdoors. The latest results from national litter pollution monitoring show cigarette butts, packaging litter, food litter and sweets-related litter to be the main sources of litter in Irish communities. One initiative which will be introduced at a later stage is a deposit return scheme for plastic bottles and cans, which forms a core part of the Government’s Waste Action Plan which has 200 actions. “Anyone involved in community litter clean-ups will realise that cans and bottles are a huge part of the litter, especially in the past year when people are out socialising, leaving a can or bottle behind. “There is a huge push on the producers of packaging, business community, making sure they play their part, ensuring consumers do not have as much packaging,” said Mr Ryan. Asked how much the deposit would be for a return, he said the exact figure had not been agreed as yet but he said it could be around 20 cent. He said aluminium cans had intrinsic value and they could be recycled without smelting. Deposit return schemes were in existence in Ireland (mainly for glass bottles and cans) for many years but were discontinued in the 1990s. Extra binsMr Ryan said €5 million of the funding would be used to provide additional bins including smart solar-compacting bins. A future €3 million will be provided to local authorities in support of anti-dumping initiatives. Since 2017, over 300 local projects have removed 10,000 tonnes of illegally dumped waste from the landscape. “The key message to communities is to leave no trace behind. It is the summer to be out and have a good time, the likes of along our canal, along our rivers and along our coast but to leave no trace behind, to pick up the litter and to help the Councils work too,” said Mr Ryan. He said the 5 kilometre restrictions had changed people’s mindsets on their local areas with many people getting angry at excessive litter being dumped. Asked was the proposal to allow 3,000 spaces for outdoor dining in Temple Bar excessive, he said outdoors had worked and there had been good examples in places like Cork where 18 streets were converted for outdoor use. He said Temple Bar was an extensive area.“We also need a place where people can meet where they can have a social life. Doing it outdoors is much safer and a much better way of doing it,” he said. He also said that in the vast majority of cases people had been well behaved when outdoors, even when consuming alcohol. “We have seen people operating within social distance and with care. The gardaí have policed it reasonably well. They have moved people on. It is not over policed. Where people are not thrashing an area or annoying local residents, what has been going on has worked well. “We are not going to stop people spending the summer outdoors. We want to encourage it.”"},{"url":null,"title":"life should be relatively normal again by august varadkar says with most covid restrictions gone","story":"A mural of Freddie Mercury by Emmalene Blake, in Kingswood, Dublin, as Tanaiste Leo Varadkar has said he is hoping for a return to normality by late summer. Photograph: Brian LawlessPA WireTánaiste Leo Varadkar has said he’s hoping August will be the month when life is “relatively normal” again. While he said promises couldn’t be made due to uncertainty about the virus, he suggested there will be a “pretty normal” Christmas.Mr Varadkar said he hopes to see customers allowed indoors in pubs and restaurants in July but a decision can’t be made on that until the end of June. He said: “Cases are stable, hospitalisations, ICU are falling and every day, tens of thousands more people are vaccinated so you know if I was in hospitality business I’d be planning for outdoors in June and indoors in July subject to all the usual caveats.”Speaking at a press conference Mr Varadkar was asked when he expects Ireland to be back to relative normality. He said he’s looking at countries with more progressed vaccination programmes like the UK and Israel. “I think Israel is pretty much back to normal. They’re welcoming tourists again, they’re having not very large gatherings but they are having mass gatherings. They have got to that point where we would expect to be by August.”He added: “So I’m hopeful that’s the month when things are relatively normal again. “That doesn’t mean that everything will be the same. “But the vast majority of restrictions you would hope to see gone.”WinterHe said children will be returning to school as normal that month and he expects students back on college campuses in September “and then a pretty normal Christmas in terms of seeing our friends and our relations.”However, he added that nobody could promise these things.He said it’s a new virus and vaccines haven’t even been around for a year - their efficacy could wear off or variants may be resistant. “We don’t know what will happen when winter comes so I think we have to get through another winter to be sure but I do think life will be pretty much normal in August and September but not exactly normal. “I think there will still be restrictions around international travel and mass gatherings particularly.”Mr Varadkar, the Minister for Enterprise, was asked about proposals from the Temple Bar Company that would see almost 3,000 customers outside premises when restrictions on outdoor hospitality are eased next month.He said he encourages city and county councils around the country to allow businesses to make use of outdoor spaces.He said the guidelines for outdoor dining and drinking have not yet been finalised but this will be done “well before the 7th of June” when it’s expected to be permitted. He said it will involved recording the names of customers for contact tracing and not limiting numbers to 15 but recognising that the space available can be big or small.

Trade is inherently competitive, with the gain of one party often equating to a loss by the other. The EU has a mercantilist approach to trade. Its aim is to accumulate wealth even if at the material detriment of its counterparties and the environment. It uses the language of partnership and care but its actions belie this narrative. Nothing else explains its hostile approach to the UK throughout the Brexit negotiations. Nothing else explains the way it goes about hoovering up miles and miles of the sea (not just ours), spitting out, dead, what it does not want or is not allowed to keep. The truth of the matter is, with these two wretched agreements, the EU will be at liberty legally to go on being hostile.  There is already a growing mountain of evidence for this. The most obvious is the treatment meted out to Northern Ireland. No sensible person would have signed the UK into the Northern Ireland Protocol but, that aside, the EU has enforced it to the hilt, caring not one jot for its people. It even invoked Article 16 of that Protocol, albeit briefly, in an attempt to prevent lifesaving vaccines from reaching the UK. To add insult to injury it is taking the UK to court over our unilaterally extending grace periods to allow goods from Great Britain to cross the Irish Sea. Yes, the UK is being sued by a foreign power simply because it wishes to access another part of its own country. On the eve of the European Parliament approving the Trade \u0026amp Cooperation agreement, Ursula von der Leyen, the President of the European Commission, proudly told MEPs that the new agreement had real teeth and the EU would not hesitate to take action if Boris Johnson breached its terms. In that one statement she informed those too lazy to read the agreement that it empowers the EU to the UK’s detriment. I have read it she is right. Virtually the entire agreement is bad but perhaps the worst aspect of it is our being locked into in a level playing field on state aid, competition, environment and employment law. Breaking the stranglehold of EU regulations on our economy is therefore practically impossible. And if we seek to do so, guess what, the EU has the ability to impose sanctions ahead of any dispute resolution mechanism taking its course.Which neatly brings me back to fishing. The Trade \u0026amp Cooperation agreement guarantees EU boats rights to fish our waters, all the way down to the six-mile limit, for as long as the trade deal remains in place. It is a fallacy that there is a transition period ending in 2025, after which full control comes back to the UK. The only way to regain control of our waters is if we are prepared, again, to suffer sanctions or terminate the trade deal itself.No one should be surprised that France is prepared to switch off the lights in Jersey to get our fish. The Withdrawal and Trade \u0026amp Cooperation agreements do not herald the beginning of a harmonious future trading relationship. They are the instruments by which the EU will keep us at its heel and roundly punish us should we try to slip the leash.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"tudor navy far diverse previously thought","story":"Britain\u0027s naval history has come in for a battering recently amid accusations that imperialism and white supremacy discredit Britannia\u0027s ruling of the waves.Yet a new study suggests that, in Tudor times at least, the British navy was far more erse than previously thought.Researchers at the University of Cardiff  analysed the teeth and skulls of eight sailors who died when Henry VIII\u0027s flagship, the Mary Rose, sank in the Solent in 1545.They found that three out of eight of the crew were not born in Britain, with two of Mediterranean origin and one a black African. The remaining five appear to be from the west of Britain, perhaps from Devon, Cornwall or Wales. In a paper published in the Royal Society Open Science, the authors conclude: Our findings point to the important contributions that iniduals of erse backgrounds and origins made to the English navy.In the time of Henry VIII, the Royal Navy employed more than 8,000 mariners, soldiers, gunners, doctors, and chefs. But apart from some foreign artefacts found with the Mary Rose bodies, there has so far been little evidence of where they were born.To find out, the researchers used isotope analysis. Isotopes are atoms of an element that have slightly different weights based on the number of neutrons. Their weight changes based on the environment – for example, coastal or inland – or climate. Each geographical area has its own unique isotopic fingerprint which is imprinted in the bones as people eat food and drink from a particular location, meaning that studying the isotopes in teeth or skeletons can show where a person grew up.Historical documents have shown that more than 3,000 immigrants settled in Britain between 1500 and 1540, mainly from France, the Netherlands, Germany, Scotland, Belgium, Italy, Spain, the Channel Islands and Portugal.Studies have also found that the number of iniduals of African ancestry in Tudor England was greater than previously assumed, with the names of over 360 iniduals having been identified between 1500 and 1640. There is also evidence of contact with African countries, such as Morocco, as early as the late 15th century.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"how vote local elections 2021","story":"NewsHow to vote in the local elections : All the races and ballot papers explainedBrits are about to plunge into a baffling array of dferent  local elections - and the sheer iety makes any kind of tactical voting guide pretty much impossible.

The ‘Super Thursday’ elections are far bigger than normal - because they include thousands of contests which were postponed from May  due to Covid.The bumper results will be the first ballot box test of Boris Johnson and Keir Starmer since the pandemic - and both leaders have been out heavily on the trail, especially in Hartlepool. The results are set to take up to four days to all be declared.The sheer complexity of this yearaposs elections means dreaming any kind of tactical voting guide is almost impossible. Not only are some people filling in several ballot papers at once, the votes for each one get counted under dferent systems. While ultimately youaposll decide who to vote for, your decision could be swayed by knowing how that vote is tallied up. So to make things easier for you this Thursday, hereaposs a guide to what those ballot papers mean, where they will end up - and what battles lie ahead for the Tories and Labour.  English councils More than , seats are up for grabs on  county,  unitary,  metropolitan and  district councils in England. Some are electing the whole council, some half their councillors and some only a third.At first glance Tories and Labour have similar amounts at stake - Conservatives are defending slightly more seats while Labour are defending slightly more councils in control.But the Tories made big gains in , the last time many of these same seats were up for grabs - so Labour should be regaining ground this time.  Key battles will be over the  councils in “no overall control” as the main parties try to seize a majority. More than half the seats up for grabswere meant to be elected in  but delayed due to Covid. Likewise, seats in play include  council by-elections that were delayed by the pandemic. WHERE  Almost everywhere in England.HOW TO VOTE  Councillors are elected for each “ward” using first-past-the-post. Mark one or more Xsnext to the people you want to win in your ward. Usually the big parties put up as many candidates in each ward as there are seats. But some might fall short this year due to Covid.Scottish Parliament All  seats in the Scottish Parliament are up for grabs and Nicola Sturgeon will be hoping to win an overall majority - which she’s just short of now.Polls leave little doubt the SNP will be the largest party. Butthe nationalists up their seat tally from  to , they will have the authority to push for a new independence referendum - seven years after last losing their fight to break away from the UK.However, they’re also facing a fight with Alex Salmond who wants his new Alba party to win seats for a “super-majority” for independence. Labour, with new leaders Keir Starmer and Anas Sarwar, must improve its current third-place standingbehind the Tories it has any hope of a revival in Scotland.  WHERE  Everywhere in Scotland.HOW TO VOTE  Voters get two ballot papers. The purple ballot paper is for your constituency - mark an X for your favoured candidate.  MSPs are elected in this way under winner-takes-all, first-past-the-post. The orange ballot paper is for your region - mark an X for your favoured party. The other  MSPs are elected in this way under a proportional formula. Parties decide who gets to take their regional seats.Welsh Parliament All  seats are up for grabs and polls suggest Labour - while the biggest party - has an uphill struggle to win an overall majority. First Minister Mark Drakeford has ruled out an independence referendum as the price of any pact, but could need a deal with Plaid Cymru or the Lib Demshe’s to form a minority government. This is one of UKIP’s last outposts, where ex-Tory Neil Hamilton clings on for Nigel Farage’s old party even after he abandoned it.  WHERE  Everywhere in Wales.HOW TO VOTE  The system is roughly the same as for the Scottish Parliament - every voter gets two votes, one for a candidate in their constituency and another for the party in their region. Voters first choose their constituency memberthen the party they want on a regional list .London Assembly All  seats are up for election and Labour will be straining for an overall majority - the party’s currently one seat short on . Polling has suggested Labour is at least  points ahead of the Tories which should lead to a comfortable victory. But the ‘list’ system introduces unknowns and allows voters to give a leg up to smaller parties.The Greens and ‘ Brexit Alliance’ each have two seats on the Assembly. WHERE  Everywhere in Greater London.HOW TO VOTE  The system is similar to the Scottish and Welsh Parliaments. Voters get two ballot papers - yellow for a named candidate in their constituencyand orange for a party on the London-wide list . Mark one X on each ballot paper. Again, constituency candidates are chosen by first-past-the-post and the parties choose their “list” members. Seats on the list are dished out using a complex algorithm called the ‘Modied d’Hondt Formula’. mayors in EnglandLondonaposs mayoral election leads the field, where Labour’s Sadiq Khan is on course for the biggest personal mandate of any UK politician.Voters are also electing four metro mayors in Labour-held Greater Manchester and Liverpool City Region, and Tory-held Tees Valley and West Midlands. Labour hopes for a Red Wall upset to seize West Midlands. There are three combined authority mayoral elections - Tory-held West of England and Cambridgeshire  Peterborough, along with new mayoralty West Yorkshire.  And finally five single-authority mayors - all currently held by Labour - are up for election in Bristol, Liverpool, Salford, Doncaster and North Tyneside. This means some people, like in Liverpool and Salford, will be asked to vote for two mayors at the same time. WHERE  Everywhere in the huge regions of Greater London, Greater Manchester, West Midlands Combined Authority, Tees Valley Combined Authority, Liverpool City Region, West Yorkshire, and Cambridgeshire  Peterborough. Plus Bristol, North Tyneside and Doncaster.HOW TO VOTE  For each mayor, voters get one ballot paper with two columns under the supplementary voting system. Mark an X in the first column for your first-choice candidate and -you want to - an X in the second column for your second preference. If no candidate gets % of votes straight away, all candidates except the top two will be eliminated. If your first preference has been knocked out, but your second preference is still in the top two, then your vote will be “moved” to your backup choice. Whoever has the most votes after this wins the mayoralty. police commissioners Everywhere in England and Wales votes for one - except London where the mayor is also the Commissioner. The oft-forgotten jobs are up for election for the third time since they were created in . When they first emerged  were Independents but that shrank to just three in . Labour won  of the posts last time while the Tories won . But given their role as one single person overseeing police, these jobs will end up as a sideshow to the main political news of election night. WHERE  Everywhere in England and Wales except London.HOW TO VOTE  The same way as for the  mayors. Voters get one ballot paper with two columns under the supplementary voting system. Mark an X in the first column for your first-choice candidate and -you want to - an X in the second column for your second preference. If no candidate gets % of votes straight away, all candidates except the top two will be eliminated. If your first preference has been knocked out, but your second preference is still in the top two, then your vote will be “moved” to your backup choice.

ENGLISH MAYORS: Londonaposs mayoral election is the biggest but Labour’s Sadiq Khan is on course for an easy victory. The biggest battles are over Tory-held Tees Valley and West Midlands. Labour wants a Red Wall upset to seize West Midlands but hopes appear slim in Tees Valley. Voters are also electing two other metro mayors in Labour-held Greater Manchester and Liverpool City Region. There are three combined authority mayoral elections - Tory-held West of England and Cambridgeshire  Peterborough, along with new mayoralty West Yorkshire., where Labour MP an ex-soap star Tracy Brabin wants a win. And finally five single-authority mayors - all currently held by Labour - are up for election in Bristol, Liverpool, Salford, Doncaster and North Tyneside. WHERE  Everywhere in the regions of Greater London, Greater Manchester, West Midlands, Tees Valley, Liverpool City Region, West Yorkshire, and Cambridgeshire  Peterborough. Plus Bristol, North Tyneside and Doncaster.HARTLEPOOL BY-ELECTION: The blockbuster Westminster ballot. Eyebrow-raising polls are tipping the Tories want to wipe out Labour’s , majority in the Brexit-backing northern seat - which has been red since its creation in  - with as much as a -point lead. If Labour candidate, the former MP Dr Paul Williams, fails Boris Johnson will hail it as a coup. Pollsters though point out the vote was split by the Brexit Party in , so the seat might otherwise have fallen to the Tories back then. WHERE  Only the Hartlepool Westminster constituency.LONDON ASSEMBLY: All  seats are up for election and Labour will be straining for an overall majority - the party’s currently one seat short on . Polling has suggested Labour is at least  points ahead of the Tories but the ‘list’ system introduces unknowns and allows voters to give a leg up to smaller parties. The Greens and ‘ Brexit Alliance’ each have two seats on the Assembly. WHERE  Everywhere in Greater London. POLICE COMMISSIONERS: The oft-forgotten jobs are up for election for the third time since they were created in . When they first emerged  were Independents but that shrank to just three in . Labour won  of the posts last time while the Tories won . But given their role as one single person overseeing police - and the fact many are being declared last - these jobs will end up as a sideshow to the main political news of election weekend. WHERE  Everywhere in England and Wales except Greater London, where the mayor is also the commissioner. Thursday  May: pm Put the kettle on and keep it near for  hours. Polls close across Great Britain and counting starts for the Hartlepool by-election, Doncaster mayor and  of  English councils. Unlike in normal years, most results will only start being counted on Friday morning - and in some cases much later. This is because there are more elections than usualand counting is much slower .Friday  May: amResults start trickling in from the  overnight councils in England.They include Derby which has swung from Labour to Tory-run no overall controlin recent years. And Southend has been run by a Labour, Lib Dem and Green ‘rainbow coalition’ since the Tory leader was voted out in . Likewise the Tories only need a few gains to take back Colchester from a Labour-Lib Dem coalition.Harlow is solidly Labour-controlled but has backed Conservatives in the past - could it slip into NOC on a good night for Tories  Labour meanwhile will be eyeing Thurrock , run by Tories but which has swung back and forth into NOC over the years. And the Tories seized Redditch from Labour in , so on a good night Keir Starmer’s party would want to make in-roads there. Labour strongholds Stevenage , Gateshead , Newcastle, Knowsley, Sunderland, Oldham, South Tyneside and Rochdale all declare early. Friday  May: am The Hartlepool by-election result is due around am. If the Tories overturn Labour’s , majority and claim the Westminster seat for the first time in its history, it will likely lead the day’s news and be a big political headache for Keir Starmer. We should get our first mayor result in the Doncaster mayoral election, currently held by Labour. And we could get some of the most interesting of the overnight council results, including Dudley where Labour and the Tories are almost neck-and-neck. Also declaring at sunrise are Stockport , a Labour-Lib Dem split in NOC, and Nuneaton  Bedworth which could go red, blue or NOC. On a good night the Tories will want to seize control of Northumberland where they rule in a minority. Friday  May: amIf you’ve stayed up overnight, go to bed. No more results are likely during the morning. But from am, counting begins for an avalanche of races - all  seats for the Welsh Parliament, half the London Assembly,  of the  constituencies for the Scottish Parliament, and  councils in England. Counting also starts for three of the  elections for police and crime commissioners, and the Liverpool mayor. Friday  May: Noon Lunchtime council results start rolling in, including Burnley where Labour only needs one more seat to take control. Tories only need small gains to take control of Bolton but it won’t be an easy fight. Red fortress Manchester declares in the early afternoon as do less strongly Labour-held Rossendale and Tory Devon .Castle Point is a straight fight between Tories and the powerful Canvey Island independents who want their own council. Meanwhile we’ll get the mayor of Liverpool, a Labour stronghold but home to a furious row over the party’s selection of their candidate.Many of the most important Scottish Parliament results will roll in at some point on Friday afternoon.They include Dumbarton where Labour’s deputy leader Jackie Baillie clung on by whisker against the SNP in . Labour are likewise fighting hard to defend Edinburgh Southern and East Lothian against an SNP challenge. Despite speculation of a three-way fight, they believe either the SNP or Tories will take Edinburgh Central .Eastwood was a three-way fight in , won by the Scottish Tories. The big name race is in Glasgow Southside where new leader Anas Sarwar is challenging First Minister Nicola Sturgeon. He’ll lose, but get in on the regional list system instead and Labour are hoping to dent the SNP majority. And Airdrie and Shotts should be interesting - as there’s a Westminster by-election the following week. It’s Tory-held but Labour came close in . Friday  May: pm We’re due the first results from Wales, including the Parliament’s most marginal seat Llanelli where Plaid Cymru are challenging Labour. Welsh Labour will also be fighting off the Tories in Wrexham , a key brick in a so-called red wall.Elsewhere, we’ll start getting the first seven results for the London Assembly and the first police commissioners in Avon and Somerset and Staffordshire. And an avalanche of English council results begins as the afternoon wears on. Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire turned blue recently and a strong Labour performance should at least kick them into NOC. Ex-minister Edwina Currie - yes her! - is standing against Labour ex-MP Ruth George to become a Derbyshire councillor. Seizing back Trafford from the Tories was Labour’s big victory in  so the party must hold on now to avoid a reverse humiliation.Cornwall is run by a Lib Dem-Independent coalition but the Tories have the most seats and will be hoping to gain. Ex-UKIP territory Basildon will be a hard Labour-Tory fight but could stay in NOC. On a bad night for Labour the party could lose Bury , Sheffield or West Lancashire to NOC, while Tories could gain Maidstone in a tussle with Lib Dems. Tories have no seats in Sheffield or Sandwell - will they up their count to one Friday  May: pm The Tees Valley metro mayor result is due, with Tory Ben Houchen tipped to hang on against his Labour challenger in the former ‘red wall’. And in Wales we’ll get the Labour marginals of Caerphilly and Vale of Clwyd where Plaid and Tories respectively are putting up a fight. Lib Dems are also defending their only seat in Brecon and Radnorshire - and will Rhondda stay Plaid in the Valleys Over in England, about  councils are due to declare in the space of just  minutes.The biggest races include Norfolk , Cambridgeshire , Essex, counties up for all-out election that are Tory-run but could give Labour inroads.Cambridge also has all its seats up for election in a battle between Labour and the Lib Dems. On good nights for the main parties, Labour could win Wirral and Crawley or the Tories could win Pendle and Elmbridge from NOC. Labour’s first county, Durham , should stay red - as should Doncaster but the Tories might look for small in-roads asall its seats are up. Labour only need to lose a few seats in Plymouth to lose to NOC but the Tories wouldn’t be able to form a majority. Likewise Tory-run Walsall could fall to NOC on a bad night for Boris Johnson.Solihull is unusual - it’s Tory-run but with a Green opposition and the Conservatives will lose controlthey’re docked one seat.Friday  May: pmMore than a dozen final results flood in for the Welsh Parliament, making clear whether Labour will need to form a coalition.Key declarations include Tory target Vale of Glamorgan and First Minister Mark Drakeford’s seat Cardf West. Likewise by the end of the night we’ll have results for  of the  Scottish Parliament seats, giving some early indication of whether Nicola Sturgeon’s on course for an outright majority.About a dozen more English council results should come in during the evening including Hull, where Labour want to keep Lib Dems at bay.Mole Valley has slim Lib Dem control with a Tory and Independent challenge while Worcester could go Tory or Labour.No results are expected overnight on Friday unless a particular council chooses to push things late into the night.Saturday  May: amNormally elections would be over by Saturday - but counting will resume in earnest this year. But go out for brunch or something - the results shouldn’t roll in until noon or so. There will be all remaining constituency seats and all regional seats in Scotland,  councils in England, the rest of the London Assembly and at least  police commissioners. Counts will also begin in the mayoral elections for London, Bristol, Greater Manchester, Liverpool City Region, North Tyneside, Salford, the West of England and the West Midlands.Saturday  May: Noon The first results from the  English councils counting on Saturday, including Lancashire which the Tories took from NOC in . Aside from this there may be few surprises in England until later in the afternoon. Oxford and North Tyneside are both Labour while Shropshire, Worcester, Broxbourne and Hertfordshire are all Tory . Eastleigh is solidly Lib Dem. We could get the Liverpool City mayor and the North Tyneside mayor , both likely Labour, and the West of England mayor , which the Tories won by a slim margin in . In Scotland we should get results in Aberdeenshire West, which the Tories took from the SNP by a slim margin in , and key target seat Perthshire South which the Tories want to take from the SNP this time. Saturday  May: pm The key result for the West Midlands mayor - which Labour ex-minister Liam Byrne wants to seize from Tory incumbent Andy Street. If he can pull it off it’d be a key symbolic victory for Keir Starmer in territory where the Tories gained much ground under Corbyn.We should get results from mid-afternoon for the rest of the London Assembly constituencies, but the mayor will only be later in the evening.We should however get confirmation ‘king of the north’ Andy Burnham has been re-elected as Greater Manchester mayor . And results for  police and crime commissioners are likely. The results for the Salford mayor are also due. About  more English council results should flood in mid to late afternoon including Hartlepool, where the Tories are part of a complex coalition and turnout should be high due to the by-election. Labour need just three seats to take control of Kirklees but the Tories have previously gained ground in the area. Meanwhile the Lib Dems would only need a few seats to seize Gosport from the Conservatives.Milton Keynes is a three-way fight between Labour and the Lib Dems, currently in coalition under NOC, and the Tories. The Lib Dems and Tories will both be vying to retake NOC Portsmouth while the Lib Dems and Labour will want to regain seats they lost in Tory Wiltshire.

The -year-old claims she was so stunned by the sighting she was forced to do a aposdouble takeapos. She said the size of the creature meant she ruled out it being a fox or a domestic cat, which she claims would have been covered by the apos inchapos grass. Only days before, the pairaposs neighbour claimed to have spotted a aposbig black catapos in the same field but Lisa says she remained unconvinced until she saw it with her own eyes, admitting aposuntil you see it, you donapost believe itapos. *What do you think they say  Do you believe it could be a puma  Join the debate below Footage of their aposunexpectedapos sighting shows a four-legged animal stalking across a field, stopping to listen and look around before disappearing into the distance. The clip convinced many of those who saw it being shared online, with some saying it could be a puma. Those commenting pointed out how the long grass only just obscured its feet, while others showed clips of house cats from a similar distance to show how small they are. Lisa, of Yeovil, Somerset, said: It looked like a big black cat - I definitely donapost think it was a domestic cat.

Your information will be used in accordance with ourPrivacy Notice.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeFor many children, the outdoors is a happy place that offers release but for deaf children like Ruby Jennings it can feel a lot more daunting. Ruby, , was given a cochlear implant when she was just three years old which has restored some of her hearing ability but in situations with lots of background noise such as a busy road, it becomes dficult to concentrate. Her mum Debbie calls the outdoor environment aposa nightmareapos for her daughter and worries about noise including wind, cars, people talking loudly and the birds. When crossing the road, Ruby says: I have to ask my friends to help me. Deaf Awareness Week, which runs from May  to May , aims to promote the positive aspects of living with deafness and raise awareness of the challenges people can face and the importance of social inclusion. As part of the campaign, Ruby and Debbie spoke to The Mirror about their experiences. Debbie, from Hertfordshire, noticed her daughter’s hearing loss at around  to  months old when it became apparent that her speech wasn’t developing at the same pace as other children her age. We did a test at home with her favourite TV programme, said Debbie. We turned her away and had it on really loud and had no reaction but when I turned her around, she went mad. The test prompted the family to visit an NHS GP who Debbie says dismissed her concerns based on the results of a newborn hearing test and says she was branded an overprotective first-time mum. Still worried, the family arranged a private appointment at the Portland Hospital in London. It was the day before Christmas Eve and he told us there and then that she was profoundly deaf. His words to us were thatan aeroplane took off next to her, she wouldn’t hear it. The first few months were dficult, we found it very hard to accept but after that, it is basically doing what we can to help her and trying to get her to lead as much a normal le as possible.  Ruby used hearing aids until she received the implant. She also continues to rely on lip-reading as part of her communication but mask-wearing due to the pandemic has made this dficult. Ruby said: When I’m trying to talk to my friends, sometimes I can’t understand them because I can’t see what they’re saying. Non-fabric masks are unhelpful too as Ruby notes that the see-through plastic iety steam up which makes lip reading dficult. Mum-of-four Debbie said: She’s got cochlear implants that sit on her ears, then she wears glasses. To have a mask behind her ears as well, it gets tangled up, it gets stuck behind her implant. It pulls her implant off her ears, it’s a bit of a pain for her. Now a pupil in Year , Ruby and her mum are adjusting to the challenges that secondary school brings.  Ruby had the chance to attend a specialist deaf senior school but opted for a mainstream school in the local area as she wanted to attend with everyone . Primary was easier because I had quite a few teaching assistants to help, Ruby said. Debbie adds: At primary school, I had a base to go in and leave things. At secondary school, it’s down to her. She has to be a lot more independent. Ruby has to remember to charge her implant and to carry spare batteries. The microphone that her teachers wear to help her hear must be cleaned after every use, and Ruby has to remember to collect to then take it to her next class. Classmates asked questions about her hearing loss when she first joined the school, but Ruby says they’re used to it now. Sheaposs happy to answer questions and to spread awareness, and she volunteered to share her experiences with classmates in a science class, which she says is her favourite school subject.  She said: I’ve told my science teacher about my hearing aids and he said that they are really cool. He asked me to find a video of how my implant hears sound. I sent it to him and I’m going to show all of my friends how I hear with my implants. Ruby described wearing cochlear implants as tiring and explained that she enjoys taking breaks from them. She said: I might sound selfish, when I’m at school, sometimes when I take my ears off, I just feel so much better. Debbie added that Ruby often takes an hour break from the implants in the bath and noted that the exhaustion caused by the intensity of the implants has caused Ruby to fall asleep at pm in the afternoon. I think people think once they’ve got a cochlear implant that they hear as we do. It’s so dferent. It sounds like a robot, it’s so dficult to work out what people are saying.

The JustGiving drive asked people to help “fleeing families” make their house a home by funding new carpets and flooring. Businessman Shahid Raqib, , from Leeds, was moved by the picture and knew he had to do something to help. In an amazing act of kindness, heaposs since pledged to donate  bedroom carpets - or more,his “accountant lets him” - to children whose parents can’t afford to purchase their own.What do you think  Share your views in the comments below... Speaking to Leeds Live, Shahid, who owns SR Carpets  Floors and runs a warehouse in Bradford and carpet shops in Leeds, said: “I saw the story on social media and I thought it was appalling that children had to live like that.“The picture just got me. I’ve worked in carpets all my le, my father had a carpet shop, so it struck me there was no carpets in the bedroom. “And even though the charity was fundraising for carpets and flooring, I just thought, ‘How can I have a warehouse full of carpets when there are children sleeping nearby without any carpets ’. “No carpets means there’s also a lack of warmth and I just couldn’t justy it in my head. It didn’t feel right not to help.” He added: “I am a father myself, I have three boys, andthey couldn’t afford carpets, imagine what  they’re struggling with. “If I can help to provide carpets, at least I can help take away one burden among the many others they may have.” Shahid has since been in touch with the charity to put a plan together for how best to donate the carpets and arrange the delivery. He said: “We’re currently putting a plan in place - I want to make sure they get a choice on the carpets they get, and we need to arrange delivery and to send people down to measure and make sure we get the right sized carpets.  “I’ll also, wherever necessary, add in underlay free of charge as well. “I just want to help as many people as possible that genuinely can’t afford it.” Shahid, who has previously donated carpets to those whose homes had been flooded, continued: “I always try to give back and help where I can. “We’re not a massive company but we have a big heart. “It’s only right that we do a good deed. If we’re taking business from local customers we need to give back where we can - we can’t always listen to the accountant. “Some businesses obsess over costs and don’t always have the heart to do it. But you have to be strong and courageous in business and take financial risks. “You have a business to earn a living, but it’s so fulfilling to give back when you can.” On the JustGiving page, Zarach founder Bex Wilson explained why it was vital for the funds to be raised.

Matthew Stubbings, , says Stormy, who was assigned female at birth, first began showing signs of being a boy aged  months, as he always hated pigtails, dresses and pretty shoes. He says that by the age of just three, Stormy, formerly known as Emerald, was able to say Iaposm not a girl, I think Iaposm a boy to both himself and his mum Klara Jeynes, . But the totaposs dad added that they have had a hard time getting some adults to accept Stormyaposs decision - as many who they encounter still insist on calling him a girl. The isional manager of a highways maintenances company recently posted a heartwarming tribute to his son on LinkedIn and shared a photo of Stormy rocking his new short and spiky haircut.Got a story  Email webnews@mirror.Matthew, from Doncaster, South Yorkshire, said: This is one of my sons. A bright, happy boy who loves his le. What many people donapost know is that when he was born he was apossexedapos as a girl. His gender identity, whataposs in his head, doesnapost match his physical sex. I am so proud that he knows who he is and isnapost constrained by societal norms and prejudices. We can all learn something from this small boy and I learn every day. Everyone is dferent. We all need accept that people are dferent and not try to force those around us to fit into a box that suits us. Accepting people for who they are is the only way to encourage innovation, embrace growth and harness the best in everyone. I have permission from my son to post this. He is proud of who he is. His post on LinkedIn received almost  reactions and dozens of comments from people heaping on praise for the aposinspirationalapos message. Matthew added: I decided to post about Stormy because Iaposm exceptionally proud of him. Heaposd just had his hair cut and he was really proud of his hair.  Stormy has never been a girl. He has never verbally expressed to us that heaposs a girl. Weaposve explained to him and his brother what dferent genders are, [that] non-binary is a thing and you can be that, but heaposs said aposIaposm not a girl, I think Iaposm a boyapos. Heaposs never been a girl. There are times, strange enough, when he says heaposs non-binary, whether his understanding of that is correct, I donapost know, but primarily, nine times out of , heaposll say heaposs a boy. Weaposre accepting who Stormy is. Heaposs got a referral to the Tavistock gender clinic. We went to the GP to explain what the situation was and got a referral. We got a reply from Tavistock in Leeds to say heaposs registered with them, but they donapost seem to do anything until theyaposre , or they start puberty - whichever comes first. I canapost stress how important I think it is to accept people for who they are. Itaposs so important in le. Itaposs not the first time Iaposve posted things [online] thataposs related to understanding others. I have previously posted a couple of things about trans awareness and gender awareness. Iaposm taken aback by the number of people I donapost know whoaposve sent me messages about it and posted nice things - and people I do know. According to his dad, little Stormy first started showing signs of gender dysphoria before he could even speak, eager to wear boys clothing like his twin Arlo.  The tot also showed interest in firefighters and police officers, while becoming distressed by his pigtails, leading his parents to have some aposfairly grown upapos chats with him about his identity. Matthew said: [When it started] Stormy would have been two, just before. We did the things that people do. Dressed his brother in boy clothes and gave Stormy pigtails. He got to the point where his hair started getting longer and he didnapost want his pigtails anymore. We took them out. He didnapost like wearing dresses anymore and it got to the point where unless he was wearing stereotypical boys clothes, he wasnapost happy. He refused to wear pretty shoes. It got to the point where he was upset about being forced to wear them. He likes being a firefighter and police officer, but theyaposre actually things girls can do too. His friends are all boys. Theyaposve always been all boys. By the time he was three years old, Matthew and Klara noticed Stormy was beginning to understand more about his gender, with their son confidently announcing he was a boy. The couple spent a long time trying to claryStormy was certain he was not a girl, but by his third birthday, they accepted their childaposs identity. Matthew said: When he started to speak, around two and a half, where he understood the context of what he was saying, he was very clear he wasnapost a girl. At some point, I canapost remember when, Stormy just said he was a boy. I canapost remember the moment when we first asked him, orhe just said it one day.  We had a conversation with him, which is dficult, when it was around his third birthday. We asked aposare you just not a girl, or are you a boy apos Both [myself and my we] have fairly grown up conversations quite regularly about his gender. He knows his gender is for him to decide, not us. It was maybe  months ago that we accepted he wasnapost a girl. When Stormy and Arlo started nursery at around one, the little lad had not started transitioning, but as the years went on and Stormy began to live as a boy full-time, Matthew says adults struggled to come to terms with the change. Matthew said: Weaposve had problems with adults. He now lives as a boy, goes to nursery as a boy, all his friends know heaposs a boy. I could talk for  minutes about the problems I have with adults accepting how he lives his le.

Meghan, , sued Associated Newspapers Limited , the publisher of the Mail On Sunday and MailOnline, over a series of articles which reproduced parts of a handwritten letter sent to Thomas Markle, , in August . She claimed the five articles, published in print and online in February , misused her private information, infringed herand breached the Data Protection Act. In February, the High Court granted Meghan summary judgment in relation to her privacy claim, meaning she won that part of the case without having to go to trial, as well as most of herclaim. At the latest hearing in the duchessaposs case against the publisher of the Mail On Sunday, the High Court heard that lawyers representing the Keeper of the Privy Purse, acting on behalf of Her Majesty the Queen told Meghanaposs solicitors they did not consider the Crown to be theowner.  At a remote hearing on Wednesday, Lord Justice Warby was told that the Keeper of the Privy Purseaposs lawyers had written to Meghanaposs solicitors disclaiming any claim toon behalf of the Crown. In written submissions, Ian Mill QC, for the duchess, also said Jason Knauf - formerly communications secretary to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, whom ANL previously said may have been involved in writing the letter - has emphatically denied being a co-author. Mr Knaufaposs lawyers confirmed he did not write the letter to Mr Markle and it has never been his belief that he was an author, Mr Mill said. The court heard that his lawyers said: Mr Knauf did not draft, and has never claimed to have drafted, any parts of the electronic draft or the letter and would never have assertedover any of their content. In our clientaposs view, it was the duchessaposs letter alone.  Mr Mill added: This unequivocal statement of Mr Knaufaposs position also gives the lie to the defendantaposs inferential case, in its defence to both the privacy andclaims, that the claimant considered using the letter aposas part of a media strategyapos. He said Meghan shared a draft of the letter with Harry and Mr Knauf for support, as this was a deeply painful process that they had lived through with her. Mr Knauf was responsible for keeping the senior members of the royal household apprised of any public-facing issues, the media spectacle surrounding Mr Markle being one such issue, Mr Mill added. He told the court that Mr Knauf suggested that a reference to Mr Markleaposs ill-health be included, which Meghan did, but that Mr Knauf did not suggest any specic wording. Mr Mill asked Lord Justice Warby to grant summary judgment in relation to the remaining parts of Meghanapossclaim, arguing that ANLaposs case on the ownership ofin the letter has been shown to be completely baseless.  ANL does not oppose summary judgment being granted, but the publisher does not consent to summary judgment because its appeal against summary judgment in theclaim remains live, the court was told. Andrew Caldecott QC, representing ANL, said in written submissions that it was a matter of regret that Mr Knaufaposs lawyers had not said he was not an author of the letter before the summary judgment hearing in January. When Mr Knaufaposs lawyers told ANL that he was not a co-author, the publisher swtly recognised the impact of the information in that letter upon part of itsdefence... and indicated that it would not oppose summary judgment, Mr Caldecott said. He also said it was a matter for the court whether it granted summary judgment on the rest of Meghanapossclaim, as summary judgment has already been entered on the issue ofinfringement. In the summary judgment ruling in February, Lord Justice Warby said ANLaposs publication of Meghanaposs letter to her father was manestly excessive and hence unlawful. He said: It was, in short, a personal and private letter.  The majority of what was published was about the claimantaposs own behaviour, her feelings of anguish about her fatheraposs behaviour, as she saw it, and the resulting rt between them. These are inherently private and personal matters. The judge said the only tenable justication for any such interference was to correct some inaccuracies about the letter, contained in an article in People magazine, published days before ANLaposs five articles, which featured an interview with five friends of Meghan. But Lord Justice Warby added: The inescapable conclusion is that, save to the very limited extent I have identied, the disclosures made were not a necessary or proportionate means of serving that purpose. For the most part they did not serve that purpose at all. Taken as a whole, the disclosures were manestly excessive and hence unlawful.

But the illustrations, set to hit bookstands on June , repeat another striking theme of the rare glimpses the public are offered of Sussex family le, a portrait photographer says. Glenn Gratton told the Mirror Meghanaposs book followed the organic and down to earth image the couple have curated in their bid for independence from royalty.Will you buy The Bench  Share your views in the comments below...What few pictures the couple have released in recent years have followed a similar theme of the young family embracing nature - a mot woven throughout Meghanaposs new book, the expert noted. Its front cover features a bench beneath a leafy tree, which recalls the coupleaposs recent pregnancy photoshoot. According to the first glimpses of award-winning Christian Robinsonaposs illustrations, that theme continues throughout its pages, which feature joyful images of erse families. When Meghan and Harry announced her pregnancy on Valentineaposs Day, it was with a photograph by celebrated British photographer, Misan Harriman, of the couple under a tree.  In the black-and-white photo, Meghan lies with her head on Harryaposs lap and her hand resting on her baby bump.The photographer snapped the picture of the Calornia couple from afar during the coronavirus pandemic, by taking it remotely from his iPad in London.To share the news the Sussexes were having a girl, Mr Harriman released a second black-and-white photo in March of the couple posing with Archie under a tree as they confirmed he was getting a baby sister.  Meghan wore a flowing, leaf-print maxi-dress as a barefoot Harry hugged her while she embraced their son. Mr Gratton, a photographer to the stars, told the Mirror that Meghan projected a “down to earth” brand. Her new bookaposs looked chimed with the organic photographs she and Harry shared on Instagram and during their pregnancy announcement this year, he added.  Mr Gratton said the pair had adopted Meghanaposs laid-back Calornian style which often shone through in the images they used to promote themselves. “She’s living a very beautul, very organic, lovely lestyle,” he told the Mirror. “Meghan is building a beautul brand and the Americans absolutely adore her. I think it’s going very well for her over there - she’s taking very nice pictures. The photographer said he had no doubt she also had a direct hand in the appearance of her new book. “I think she would have had the final say and chosen the cover and the images - she’s very in control of her brand.” Butthe couple wanted to expand on their green aesthetic, ditching their private jet lestyle for “eco-friendly” options would hone their image, Mr Gratton suggested. Meghan and Harry drove an electric vehicle to their wedding reception, and his father Prince Charles, a longtime environmentalist, drives an electric Jaguar I-Pace. But the Sussexes had since been photographed Stateside in gas-guzzling Cadillacs, which Mr Gratton said clashed with their eco-friendly interests. He added: “It’s almost necessary thatyou’re going to be that green, why aren’t you driving an electric car ” Mr Harriman had himself explained to British Vogue the reasons behind the choice of setting for the coupleaposs intimate pregnancy photoshoot.“With the tree of le behind them and the garden representing fertility, le and moving forward, they didn’t need any direction, because they are, and always have been, waltzing through le together as absolute soulmates,” he told the magazine. The coupleaposs shared interest in the natural world has been well documented in recent years. In , Harry revealed his own hidden passion for photography when he released a series of portraits from his travels.The Duke lay on his back to take a photo of a tree canopy soaring above him for his National Geographic Instagram takeover.He was pictured snapping the baobab trees in Liwonde National Park in Malawi during the coupleaposs Africa royal tour, in which they would go on to give an emotional interview about their struggles with living in the public gaze.

Nisbet seek to catch the eye of Steve Clarke and secure their place in the Scotland squad for Euro , there can be no better stage than Hampden Park.The national team will face Czech Republic and Croatia in Mount Florida during the tournament but, prior to those showpieces, both attacking hopefuls have the opportunity to prove they can thrive on that hallowed turf when Dundee United face Hibernian.A place in the Scottish Cup final — financially, the biggest Scottish Cup final in recent history, given the estimated £ million windfall awaiting the winners due to guaranteed European football until December — is at stake.And both players will be key to their sides’ hopes.Hibernian striker Nisbet has timed his run to perfection. The former Dunfermline and Raith Rovers talisman has scored four goals in his last seven club games and was selected in Clarke’s last squad to face Austria, Israel and Faroe Islands last month.He made his international debut, coming on as a th-minute substitute in a - triumph over the Faroes.The news of his omission in favour of Nisbet would have undoubtedly landed like a tonne of bricks on Shankland, who had become a well-kent face in the Scotland set-up.He has only made four appearances, but has been a steady pick since his maiden call-up in October  always relied upon to graft, press and, when needed, convert a crucial penalty, as he did in last year’s Euro  playoff semi-final win over Israel.However, Shankland has only scored eight times this seasoncompared to Nisbet’s tally of . If it comes down to a straight shoot-out, there will only be one winner.The question is: will it  Or will Clarke take into account the areas in which Shankland has continued to thrive, even as the goals dried up.So often seen as a one-dimensional goal-getter in his youth, Shankland’s game has undoubtedly developed during United’s campaign in the top-flight. He has illustrated versatility and a fine work ethic in Micky Mellon’s demanding --.‘Defend from the front,’ is the oft-repeated mantra and heat maps from Shankland#s last six starts in the Premiership — provided by Opta Sports — underline his willingness to work across the midfield line and defend deep on the flanks.Nisbet, by contrast, is afforded the chance to do the majority of his work in central areas. The -year-old will occasionally drop deep to collect possession, hold the ball up and find a teammate, but will then dash for the box.His movements into wide areas are sparse and rarely go beyond a foray to the left channel. However, the wing is the domain of the excellent Josh Doig.The vast dference in amount of time both players actually spend in central areas due to the dferent shapes and priorities of United and Hibs make it unfair to compare the players solely on goals.If Clarke is looking for a player to throw on in desperate search of a late goal a predatory front-man whose instincts have been sharpened following a season of playing as an out-and-out ’No.’, then Nisbet is the safer bet.If he intends to select a player who has proved adept at contributing to the game, whether in or out of possession, then Shankland is back in the game — as statistics from both players’ last  Premiership starts illustrate.Shankland may not ripple the net with the same regularity as Nisbet, but he affects the game more, has more touches, makes more passes and creates chances for others at a higher rate.UEFA’s decision to allow national teams to select three extra bodies —  instead of the usual  — has created a fascinating new dynamic, as has the unfortunate injury to Oli McBurnie.Ché Adams, of course, is a certainty.Is Leigh Grfiths a wildcard that Clarke will be tempted to include And, depending on where he lands on his other attacking dilemmas, will he go for the arch goal-getter, Nisbet, or the versatile grafter, Shankland.One suspects Clarke’s mind is not quite made up — and a standout performance at Hampden on Saturday could quite literally be a game-changer for either man.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE

These are collected on alternate weeks, meaning each bin is currently being emptied every two weeks.The local authority believes the current arrangement results in not enough material being recycled.However, North Kincardine councillor Colin Pike has branded the current waste and recycling system as #dysal# and believes that changing it would make it more confusing for residents.Mr Pike also fears that reducing the bin collection service in the region may result in an increase in fly-tipping incidents.Aberdeenshire Council reported a % increase in fly-tipping to , in the  months after lockdown compared with the same period before while issuing  fines over the last two years.% of the + residents who answered our reader poll disagree with the plans to change bin collections. Many have taken to social media to share their thoughts on the proposed changes.Some expressed concerns that the system already in place is not enough for larger families and those with small children.Lee Bell wrote: #We cannot recycle anymore than we do, with a family of five I am already taking bin bags in my car to dispose of because our bins are full after one week, this is crazy now!!!#A number of people posted that they believe this new system will not encourage recycling, explaining that they already do their best to recycle what they can yet their bins are still full.However, some have written that they believe it will help promote recycling.Shirley Cruickshank wrote: #Suits me, I try to have as little waste as possible. My black bin only goes out every  weeks, my food pod is never even half full, and my recycle bin is the only one that needs emptying. I think its goodit encourages people to think about what goes in their recycle bin. Way too much recyclable stuff gets chucked in black bins just now.#Others who already have this system in place have tried encouraging worried residents.Stephie Johnston explained: #You get used to it people. Makes you recycle more. We#ve been doing it in Mintlaw for well over a year.#Meanwhile, some residents are worried that reduced services will result in more fly-tipping incidents in the area.Paul Kennedy posted: #Absolute joke and you can#t even just turn up at recycling centre without booking which is madness. Fly-tipping will increase dramatically unfortunately.#Some residents think that having three bins will help to ide the waste, however, believe there should be changes made to the recycling centre to compensate.Jim Goodfellow wrote: #This is fine but the number of restricted visits to recycling centres needs to be increased.#This controversial system was suggested in .

We have to move fast and get going with this.#I’m really excited by this, and the more I think about it, the more the idea works bringing more le back to the Green, providing connectivity between Union Street and Union Square.#The project could also look to draw upon UK Government cash, as well as looking to Nestrans and Sustrans for financial assistance.Mr Lumsden added: #There is potential funding we can look for, the UK Levelling Up Fund is aimed at projects that are ready to go, and this pretty much is.#If approved by committee next week, we would be looking to purchase ASAP and then put in the application for the demolition and planning permissions like everyone .#Plans could also include pedestrianisation of Union Street, with councillors to also be asked to sign off on an initial redesign of the area # which Mr Lumsden said #there would not really be much point# in the redevelopment while leaving the Granite Mile as it is.The council#s chief corporate landlord officer, Stephen Booth, said in his report that the city was now at a #crucial# point, requiring #signicant change# towards permanent solutions to traffic, favouring pedestrians and public transport.#The central section of Union Streetshould be a proud destination in the city centre, with Union Terrace Gardens to the west and Aberdeen Market and former BHS to the east.#Strategically this section of Union Street is a focal point in the heart of the city centre, linking major retail and pedestrian connections and the gardens.#If councillors approve the plans, Mr Booth will be instructed to proceed with the purchase of the two properties and then enter a contract for their demolition.Last night, Liberal Democrat group leader Ian Yuill described the market building as a #blot# on city centre and said he would support the plans #the council was not left in financial risk by taking it on.He said: #This is certainly interesting and we look forward to seeing the detailed business case.#While the council shouldn#t be a property developer there can be occasions when it makes sense but it is essential the numbers add and the council is not exposed to risk.#If Union Street is to be pedestrianised, it should be done fully and we would welcome anything which assists with that.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium

been urged to be cautious to help curb a surge in Covid cases that has gripped the region.More than a quarter of students at the ,-pupil Elgin Academy have been required to self-isolate in recent weeks after  positive coronavirus cases were associated with the school.These cases have been confirmed since April , with many pupils accessing remote learning during this period.The current outbreak has been described as #some of the toughest weeks of the pandemic for our school staff and families# by Moray education chief Vivienne Cross.Now, Elgin Academy headteacher Kyle Scott has written to all the families with children at the school to thank them for their support and urge them to continue to follow the rules.He said: “I want to thank so many of our amazing pupils for following the rules both in and out of school.#I also thank parents carers for their support throughout it has been so encouraging to read and receive words of support and I personally thank all those members of our school community for taking the time to do this.“It’s by following the rules that we will suppress the virus, and as a school community, it is so important that we continue to work together in following the guidance and adhering to these rules.“If we continue to do these things and remain proactive in our response, I firmly believe that we will beat this virus where we are here for you as your school and we want to help in any way that we can.“We will continue to work hard, liaise with Public Health as necessary, and will do all we can to maintain the safety of our school and prevent any pupils from having to isolate and therefore miss time in school.”The Elgin Academy building is under an enhanced cleaning schedule, with daytime cleaners who continually clean touchpoints like door handles, toilets, and communal areas.It is also cleaned every night and sanitised so it is ready for the next day.Staff reinforces the importance of mitigations like face coverings and hand hygiene.Moray Council’s Head of Education, Vivienne Cross, said: “These have been some of the toughest weeks of the pandemic for our school staff and families.“We’re reassured by public health that our strong Covid protection measures mean that transmission is not happening within our schools, and ask our residents to make the most of the expansion of testing for ‘mild or extended’ symptoms, and community testing for those without symptoms, to help stop the spread and further disruption to our children and young people’s learning.”Covid cases have been confirmed at two Moray nurseries, St Sylvesters and Lhanbryde, while pupils at Hythehill Primary are self-isolating.Moray has the highest rate of Covid infections in Scotland, according to the latest figures.In the seven days between April  and May ,  cases were detected in the region, the majority of those centred around the Elgin and Lhanbryde areas.According to Public Health Scotlandthe seven-day positive rate per , people is .

We are also looking for volunteers to support the service.There are an estimated , armed forces veterans in Scotland, with an average age of .  The Comradeship Circles also welcome their partners, widows, and widowers.Participants simply dial into the weekly chat, with a facilitator on hand to assistnecessary. The service is popular with those who are unable or find it dficult to enjoy social connection online.Our Comradeship Circles has been a social leline for many over the last six months, so we’re delighted this funding means they can continue. Even before the pandemic, thousands of older veterans still felt isolated because of health conditions, disabilities, or living in a rural location. Although restrictions are now easing, we know that many are feeling lonelier than ever before.While more and more older people are getting online, there are still hundreds of thousands who are unable or prefer not to use the internet. This telephone service has been especially valued by older veterans who have a disability or health condition which means they struggle to use the video conferencing apps.Comradeship Circles mean they can enjoy banter and share stories and memories of military le. It’s been inspiring to see the care and support that the veterans’ community give each other, helping each other through dficult time. Many participants have told us that they’ve rekindled old friendships or made new ones, or look forward to a natter to get them through the week.If you or someone you know is a veteran aged  or over, we’d encourage them to give it a try.A call to the Age Scotland helpline     can open the door to camaraderie and extra support for older members of the ex-service community.Brian Sloan, Age Scotland chief executive "},{"url":null,"title":"argyll gardens bloom for 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Online records showed his birthplace as #Inchial Argileshire#, which turned out to be the parish of Glenorchy and Inishail at the head of Loch Awe.Alexander McNab was born there to Alexander senior and Margaret McNab in  # one of a family of three brothers and four sisters # and moved south to Burnley in Lancashire in the s. In Lancashire in , he married Janet Wardrope, who came from Milngavie outside Glasgow, and they went on to have  children.Going back a few generations, Clare#s research has traced Alexander#s great grandfather, John McNab, born in Kilbrandon in the area around Loch Melfort in .His son Peter, born around , went on to farm in Connel and is recorded in the  census as an -year-old farming  acres at South Ledaig, though is described as a #smith# in an earlier record.Born in , Peter#s son Alexander grew up to work in farming around Glenorchy. In the  census he is recorded as a ploughman at Barbreck.#Our# Alexander seems to have been a blacksmith when he moved from Argyll to Burnley to start a new le.Sadly, two of Alexander and Janet#s family died as young children.Later, however, they found themselves # like so many other families # caught up in the horrors of the First World War.They lost three sons # Andrew, aged , missing in action,  Alex, , missing in action  and John, , missing in action  # during the war.The grief the family must have borne is unimagineable. The boys# names are recorded on three separate First World War memorials in Belgium and France.Clare said: #What a tragedy losing your sons. Andrew, Alex and John were brothers of my great grandma, Grace McNab Bridge.#Alexander died in  at the age of , after being hit by a tramcar in Blackpool during the blackout. He was living with daughter Grace and her family at the time. A short newspaper report from the time describes him as a #retired blacksmith#.Clare was born in Blackpool and moved to Tees-side, via a spell in Dumfries, through her husband David#s employment.Though her great grandmother Grace passed away in , Clare believes she can detect echoes of the past in her own family today.She explained: #My son, who is in army, has just trained in music and learnt the bagpipes.#Little bits keep popping up. My other son is into blacksmithing, which is also in the family.#And while she has never visited Argyll, Clare would love to at some point once Covid restrictions have eased.#I had a look at images of Loch Awe and have been reading up about the area.

This has allowed us to concentrate on a purely on-the-water racing event which reduces contact possibilities. It is also important we reduce the movement of crew as much as possible.#By moving the event to the Clyde, we have taken a massive step towards achieving this goal, however, it is clear we need to take measures a bit further.

Each route takes visitors on a real pilgrimage to ancient Christian landmarks, through remote and impressive landscapes.#Whilst Faith in Cowal is a Christian organisation, the routes are open to people of all faiths and none and provide the perfect way to connect with the wild beauty Cowal has to offer. Some of the sites that book-end each trail date as far back as the th and th centuries as well as more ancient landmarks such as Auchnaha Cairn that are thought to be Neolithic in origin.#The walks take in locations close to the major settlements and population centres of Cowal including Strachur, Dunoon, Kilfinan and Colintraive but they#re unlike any other path you#ll find. These are not all neatly manicured and waymarked trails. We have deliberately kept them dynamic and wild by making use of forestry roads and ancient heritage paths. Many of the routes require short, improvised hikes between paths so you#ll feel like a real pilgrim forging your way through the landscape.#There are detailed guides on our website as well as downloadable GPS tracks. We hope as many visitors to Cowal as possible will take this opportunity to step in the footsteps of ancient pilgrims and travellers, enjoy the wonderful scenery of Argyll and explore fascinating sites of genuine spiritual and religious importance,# added Dan.PICS:A map of the routes. no_aFootstepsFaithPhotos: subtlesensorHistoric Kilmun church, on the shores of the Holy Loch. no_aFootstepsFaith_©subtlesensor_Kilmorich graveyard, Cairndow. no_aFootstepsFaith_KilmorichGraveyard©subtlesensor"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor april 16 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

One of the highlights from last year’s event included celebrity supporters dressing up as much-loved characters to recreate tea party scenes from the world of film. Phyllis Logan was Mary Poppins, music producer Naughty Boy was Jay Gatsby, Emma Barton was Holly Golightly and Jess and Natalya Wright were Alice in Wonderland and the Queen of Hearts.Families with dementia have been adversely affected by the lockdown for just over a year. Care home visiting restrictions, the closure of support and respite services and the resulting social isolation and loneliness has disproportionately affected people living with dementia and their family carers.Whilst Time for a Cuppa will be slightly dferent this year, we know dementia support is needed more than ever. We are so grateful to all of our fundraisers who will be whipping up treats, enthusiasm, funds and giving their time for others – in a socially distanced way, of course – in what will be a very special and important Time for a Cuppa.For more information about Time for a Cuppa and how to host a tea party with our free fundraising pack, visit the dementiauk.org timeforacuppa webpage.Dr Hilda Hayo, Chief Admiral Nurse and Chief Executive Officer of Dementia UK."},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead competitions galore","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Retailers in Scotland have invested tens of millions of pounds on safety measures including plexiglass screens, queue management systems, social distancing signage and floor markings, better ventilation, cleaning and hygiene. Shop workers have ensured the nation was supplied and fed throughout the past  dficult months.The reopening of non-essential shops and ability of food-to-go retailers to resume welcoming customers in-store will mark a crucial milestone for Scottish retail and the wider supply chain. Retail is Scotland’s largest private sector employer. So-called non-essential stores have been compelled to close in Scotland for  consecutive days. The SRC and Usdaw encourage shoppers to:Across Scotland, thousands of shops which have been shuttered for four long months are looking forward to getting back to doing what they do best, serving their customers.Re-opening is good news for our economy, for jobs and for our local communities. It has never been more important to play our part in keeping our towns, cities and retail destinations vibrant.Every purchase from a shop helps to support jobs in local retail and throughout the supply chain.Retailers and their colleagues continue to work around the clock to maintain a safe shopping experience, so customers can have the confidence toto their favourite stores.If we all follow the necessary physical distancing and hygiene measures and show consideration to those around us, including shop staff who are doing a dficult job, then everyone will be better off.David Lonsdale, director of the Scottish Retail ConsortiumThe reopening of stores on Monday offers a leline for many retailers. That is good news in terms of helping to safeguard jobs, but the virus is still out there.We expect employers to conduct full risk assessments, follow the agreed guidance and ensure that customers are fully informed of the necessary safety measures.Shoppers need to play their part in helping to limit the spread of the virus and avoid further lockdowns by following the rules and respecting staff.Regrettably, throughout this appalling pandemic, incidents of abuse towards shop workers doubled and Covid safety measures have now become signicant flashpoints.Abuse should never be part of the job and shop workers – who played a vital role in getting food and medicine into our homes during the pandemic – deserve our thanks and respect.In January, the Scottish Parliament unanimously voted for a ground-breaking new law to protect shop workers.Usdaw campaigned for many years to secure these legal protections and we will continue to work hard to ensure that shop workers are protected and treated with the respect they deserve.Tracey Gilbert, Usdaw deputy isional officer for ScotlandSir,Oxfam’s shops in Argyll and Bute have an urgent need for volunteers to help deal with an anticipated deluge of donations as they prepare to re-open from Monday April .Sales from the first day of trading following the re-opening of its English and Welsh shops were up  per cent on  figures, with it being the most successful Monday ever sales-wise for the organisation outwith Christmas periods.Money raised by the dedicated staff and volunteers in Oxfam#s shops in Dunoon and Rothesay helps fight poverty and injustice around the world providing people with lesaving essentials like clean water and soap as well as the hope of a better future.We know from the last lockdown that people will have taken the chance to have a good declutter and we’re anticipating a deluge of generous donations.Volunteers are asked to give as little as a few hours a week of their time and can take up a range of vital roles, from serving customers to sorting donations and arranging window displays.Each shop typically relies on a team of  dedicated volunteers and one or two staff, with more than , volunteers required across the country.As well as volunteers, Oxfam stores are also appealing for good quality donations.Protecting staff, volunteers and customers from Covid- remains Oxfam’s priority, with shop teams continuing to implement strict protocol, including social distancing, readily available hand sanitiser, masks and gloves for staff, screens at tills, regular and frequent cleaning, closed changing rooms and encouraging contactless payment.In advance of shops re-opening, people are invited to register their interest online via www.oxfam.org.uk # just click on #get involved#.Tom Richardson, Oxfam interim head of retailSir,The demands placed on Scotland’s health service by the pandemic have intensied pleas for an increase in funding for Scottish NHS.NHS funding in Scotland comes from the block grant from Westminster. If huge sums of Scottish taxpayers’ money were not being used to pay Scotland’s share of renewing and maintaining Britain’s nuclear submarine fleet, there would be funds available to properly support the Scottish NHS.

Our pretty Highlander girls have lost all interest in us now that the grass and rashes are a vivid, succulent green. They graze far and wide, ignoring their hay ring breakfast bar where they jostled and queued all winter.The sheep roam around the cattle’s hairy feet, no longer mooching for scraps from their breakfast table. So, it’s an easier morning round for us crofters with only the daft pigs to feed, who long ago foraged every root, acorn and pine-cone from their sizeable woodland.Their little forest is perfectly, porcinely ploughed, but they must still be finding some nourishment there as they seem less frantic at feeding-time, pausing their grubbling and guzzling for the occasional scratch and cuddle.The let-up in winter feeding has allowed much-needed attention to be given to the now stuffed-full Polycrub where every speck of soil, every hanging beam has been usefully employed in the mission to feed the family entirely from its harvest.Raspberry canes, lemon, orange and cherry trees should keep rickets at bay, while the plethora of weird and wonderful ieties of carrots, potatoes, asparagus, and squashes will nourish us throughout the season and beyond.Our newbie attempts to live off the land mirror the much more experienced efforts of families throughout theand breadth of this peninsula and in the village beyond. Thanks to those techie neighbours who set up email networks and social media groups there is a fantastic bank of information and expertise shared locally.Whether you want to learn how to plant oak trees, acquire foraging skills or find out how to run your home on renewable energy, somebody local has been there, done it and is happy to point you in the right direction.Over the last few months this valuable mine of knowledge and enthusiasm for environmental projects has been formalised into the Tayvallich Sustainability Plan, a  for sharing information and taking action to create a more sustainable community.The plan has grown organically from a pilot scheme run through the winter months with Keep Scotland Beautul to a website, action plan and monthly activities.Open to everyone with an interest in achieving a healthy, sustainable future for the village and its surroundings, the plan will work on the whole gambit: from food growing to flood mitigation foraging to forestry and heat pumps to bike pumps # a new cycle repair work-stand has been installed outside the village shop.Joining the online meetings throughout the winter, I was amazed to see not just the number of locals involved, but also the extraordinary talents and interests they share.We only entrenched ourselves full time on this wild wee bit of Argyll a month or two before lockdown so we’re not well-kent faces and, likewise, the faces of many villagers I’ve only ever seen strangely pixellated thanks to my dodgy connection to the Zoom meetings.Hopefully the same is true for wi throughout the area and that my, now ubiquitous, Zoom-accompanying glass of wine has stayed safely out of shot."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 30 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Most notably, throughout the pandemic, I have been supporting constituents and businesses with COVID- related matters such as sourcing financial help and dealing with concerns over vaccinations.I have delivered real results for the Borders. I campaigned for the poundm Borderlands funding for a Bordersrsquo Railway extension feasibility study, supported the successful re-instatement of Reston station and called for a fund to fix the crumbling roads. On the rural front, I put pressure on the SNP Government for more funding for agriculture and pushed for more resources to tackle rural crime and fly-tipping.As the Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Social Security and Older People, I worked with the Scottish Conservative strategy team, to formulate new policies to support older people and matters relating to Social Security Portfolio, such as narrowing the disability employment gap and improving digital inclusion.Looking ahead to the election I will campaign hard for local issues. When it comes to our fantastic NHS, I want a focus on reducing waiting times, improving mental health services and protecting local GP surgeries.As we emerge from the COVID pandemic, we must attract high quality, well-paid jobs to the Borders and improve infrastructure and digital connectivity to bolster the rural economy.On education, I support a national tutoring programme to help pupils catch up, more rural teachers and free school breakfasts and lunches to all primary school children.My campaign, alongside Doddie Weir OBE, continues on automatic access for people living with MND to receive a Blue Badge. Moreover, I have urged the Scottish Government to provide free dyslexia tests for adults to improve social mobility  opportunities.I continue to strongly oppose a second independence referendum and believe we can build back better with the strength of the United Kingdom.Barbra Harvie Barbra Harvie, Scottish GreensThe Scottish Green Party candidate for Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire, Barbra Harvie, is a semi-retired lecturer in Ecology, Environment and Countryside who lives in Selkirk.She says: \"Our isolated rural communities and small urban environments in South of Scotland have come together with resilience, determination and care to tackle the enormous challenge of COVID- but we are also facing a global climate emergency that can no longer be ignored.\"Scotland needs a Green recovery from the global pandemic that also confronts the global climate emergency.

Before politics I worked in the third sector as a fundraising assistant for Marie Curie, and then for international oil company National Oilwell Varco Mission Products handling customs and logistics. I now work part time as Office Manager for a member of the Scottish Parliament and as a Communications Manager for an MP. I decided to stand in the General Election in  in Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk because I was tired of the constitutional wrangling and wanted to bring the focus back to making a dference locally and further afield. Now, we need to put recovery from the pandemic first. From supporting tourism and local business to tackling the climate emergency, delivering a better education system, supporting the NHS, bettering mental health provision, and making the case for a truly federal UK, I will always stand up for the disadvantaged and will make fairness and tackling inequality central to everything I want to achieve. I want to remove the barriers to opportunity which face rural areas more than others. Everyone should have the chance of living the le they want and to be as successful as possible. During the last year the curtains have been pulled back on where the help is most needed and we need to have a needle sharp focus on getting help to all those in that position. Ultimately, I want to tackle to the root of inequality which is poverty, and keep the climate crisis at the top of everyonersquos agenda. We know our country is wracked by constitutional ision and inequality so now our representatives need to focus on healing and serving communities to the best of their ability at a time when it has never mattered more.

Indeed, I spent years at an Edinburgh healthcare technology company, collaborating with universities and NHS Scotland on articial intelligence software for cancer screening and diagnosis of stroke.Throughout this pandemic we have seen the power of our countryrsquos science base. Despite bumps in the road, the roll-out of testing and multiple vaccines has been impressive.But the pandemic tells another story too ndash of warnings ignored and preparations left unmade. We could and should have had a better plan for one of the highest-ranked known public health risks. We must learn from this collective failure.Scientists have warned for decades that the world is heading towards climate breakdown. They also now speak of a ldquonature emergency ndash an era of mass extinctions caused by humans. Yet greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere relentlessly rise and our forests and oceans continue in dangerous decline. Nowadays, I see scientists practically weeping as they watch this unravelling accelerate, with no believable action plan from politicians.The Scottish Greens recognise that technology will play a huge part in stepping us back from the brink. Our co-leader Lorna Slater is a renewable energy engineer, and our proposed poundbn Green Recovery investment programme will fund thousands of high-quality, unionised Scottish jobs in renewables. But letrsquos not kid ourselves. Itrsquos mostly not technology we lack, itrsquos political will.The Greens will invest massively in warm homes ndash upgrading insulation and converting to low-carbon heating systems. We have bold plans to improve rail, bus and active travel, and already won free bus travel for under-s from this summer. Finally, we propose an urgent programme to repair nature, dramatically accelerating the positive steps already taken by rural businesses, workers and charities.These solutions are not high-tech, not ldquosexy and may not generate huge profits for international investors and a rich elite.

He has lived in the Scottish Borders for  years.Vanguard Party champions the Union and Brexit. The UK, four nations in union, will prosper as an independent country, outwith the EU. If Scotland were to leave the Union and join the EU, it would not be an independent country. It would be a rule-taker from Brussels. There would be a hard border with the rest of the UK. Scottish exports to the rest of the UK are currently worth three times those to the EU. Funding via the Barnett formula would end. Scots would lose British citizenship.Vanguard Party believes Scotlands future should be decided by the people, not the courts. However, independence is not practical without the support of a simple majorityof the registered electorate, not merely a simple majority of valid votes. IndyRef must require a simple majority of the registered electorate of the whole of Scotland, for the whole of Scotland to leave. In  only  per cent of the registered electorate of the whole of Scotland voted for independence.Vanguard Party will preserve the distinction between sex and gender. It will protect womens rights to same-sex spaces. It will oppose self-identication. It will oppose any denial of biological truth.Vanguard Party will champion children of disadvantaged backgrounds by providing help and support to raise attainment. It will not promote quotas and targets that may excuse lower attainment.Vanguard Party will champion the NHS. It will recognise the true worth of all NHS staff. It will tackle hospital waiting lists and support GPs to resume face-to-face appointments for all.Vanguard Party will abolish hate crime including incitement of hatred in peoples minds. It will require crimes to be based on evidence, tested objectively, not on subjective perceptions of victims or others.Vanguard Party will champion traditional values and culture.

Most important was keeping in touch with you through my surgeries: in supermarkets, libraries, and my annual summer surgery tour through the villages. This past year of course has changed everything. We have all been stuck at home keeping in touch through emails. COVID has dominated and I have tried to help you with the problems it brought in its wake. Moving now through vaccination, queries arise as you await that appointment. At the same time other issues continue: unsuitable housing, planning concerns. This is the essential work and duty of an MSP to constituents no matter what their politics. I hope I have discharged that duty. I have also chaired the parliamentrsquos cross-party group on animal welfare for many years with two Bills to my name: The Control of DogsAct , now law, putting the blame on the owner not the dog and The Welfare of DogsBill which aims to end casual purchase of puppies. COVID prevented it proceeding butelected I intend to bring it back, especially with concern that some of those \"COVID\" puppies will end up in animal rescue centres. Yes, how le has changed, COVID has been hard: losing a business built over years, living with children trapped in a flat, not attending a funeral, delaying the wedding, the new baby not socialising with family. The list is endless of the sacrices, the losses. COVID has broken the link with the way we were, just as those World Wars changed society. Nicola Sturgeon has demonstrated true leadership and moving to recovery it must not be back to the same old, same old but to a socially just society, valuing people from cradle to grave, our public services, rejoining the EU as an independent nation. On May , I ask for your constituency vote on my record as your MSP and the list vote for the SNP, giving you and Scotland a democratic choice to move forward as a renewed nation.Shona Haslam Shona Haslam, Scottish ConservativesOn Thursday, May , voters are faced with a choice. Rebuild our communities after the pandemic by improving our childrenrsquos education, delivering record funding to our NHS and enhancing employment opportunities, or, once again, reopen the question of Scotlandrsquos place within the United Kingdom.Make no mistake: the next few weeks will see one of the most important elections of our letime.Nicola Sturgeon has demonstrated recently that she only cares about one thing, an independence referendum that most Scots do not want but one that she will still foist upon them anyway. The past year has been tough for us all. Many of us have struggled with the pressures of lockdown, myself included. But the way to recover from this pandemic is not to launch into another constitutional argument that threatens our livelihoods, our childrenrsquos futures and our way of le.As a mum to two lovely boys, I want to see a government that puts aside its own agenda and commits to focusing on whatrsquos best for the next generation of Scots. ldquoJudge me on my record said Nicola Sturgeon on education. Well, the attainment gap remains as large as it ever was, and Scotlandrsquos education system has plummeted in international rankings. It would seem the First Minister has been found wanting.Itrsquos not just our schools that under threat other public services are too. As leader of the Scottish Borders Council, I have fought tirelessly against repeated cuts to our budget, forcing councillors to make dficult choices simply because the Scottish Government finds it easier to pass the buck. After the strain of COVID, we need a Scottish Government that will step up, empower councils and work with them, not against them.Butthe SNP gain enough seats to form a majority in May then all that is at risk. Once again, they will push for another isive referendum.There is only one way to stop that: lend me your constituency vote, and the Scottish Conservatives your party vote, on May .ACMay AC May, Scottish Liberal DemocratsI intend to represent you the only way I know how - by working tirelessly with a keen eye on the future to ensure that there is investment and improvement in education, employment opportunities and business growth. I will stand up for better funded healthcare and demand that money is directed towards care homes, mental health and wellbeing to bring these up to the standards we all deserve. To do this will need a strong economy and the Scottish Liberal Democrats are putting recovery first ndash this must be Scotlandrsquos priority. A vote for me is a vote of confidence for a more secure future for you and your families.Its time for a change. The area needs someone who will heed the concerns of constituents, and voice these strongly in parliament, not just another person sitting in Holyrood applauding every word of the First Minister.Prior to the boundary changes, the Scottish Liberal Democrats had a long record of success here, and its high-time for ato rational, clear thinking on the issues that matter locally and nationally.Our high streets and town centres ndash the beating heart of our communities ndash need urgent help. This was apparent before the pandemic, but even more so now. Online commerce can bring tremendous benefits and is here to stay. Many businesses have transformed to the new normal, but many others have struggled. We need to focus on how growing online spend can coexist with a vibrant local economy, and work to restore community feeling.Im looking forward to getting stuck into the campaign. By their own admission, a ided Tory party has mishandled Brexit, driving Scottish voters in desperation towards nationalism, while the opportunist and populist SNP seeks to compound the disaster of Brexit by withdrawing from the UK completely, just at the point when we need economic recovery the most.A vote for me is a vote for progress through strong partnerships within Scotland, across the UK and with our European neighbours, so that together we can recover from the COVID crisis and move beyond the politics of ision.Katherine Sangster Katherine Sangster, Scottish LabourCOVID-rsquos impact on our families, our communities and our economy has been profound. We now need to start the hard work of rebuilding our country and that task needs new faces, fresh ideas and experience outside of Holyrood.I am a working parent who prior to  had never been involved in politics. However, I like many other parents soon realised that the SNPrsquos childcare policies sound good on the back of an election leaflet but donrsquot work in practice. So, in , I campaigned for fairer access to childcare and led Fair Funding for our Kids - a nationwide campaign that got childcare on to the national agenda, building a movement of mums that demanded action from Government. Our campaign secured more funded childcare from Government - a step towards equality, but there is still plenty to be done.Soon, I was speaking on television, writing for newspapers and lobbying politicians. All things I has never done before but I was speaking from the heart and articulating mine and othersrsquo experience. Now with five years plus experience in politics I still firmly believe that policy is best made by those with lived experience and the job of a politician is to listen and advocate on peoples behalf, and I will always put that at the heart of what I do.Working for an MP now, every day I support people with the issues that blight their lives from poor housing to an inhumane benefits system to bins not getting picked up. These are issues that affect people day in day out. Chatting to voters and speaking to constituents, I have experienced no appetite for debate on a second referendum just a desire from people that we as politicians and aspiring politicians listen to their concerns and respond to those concerns.We need to elect MSPs to Holyrood who understand these concerns and will fully use the powers of the Scottish Parliament to make peoplersquos lives better. Holyrood is one of the most powerful devolved parliaments in the world lets start using those powers. As Donald Dewar said at the opening of the Scottish Parliament in  ldquoA Scottish Parliament, not an end but a means to greater ends.On May  please use your vote carefully and letrsquos start the

And now, more than a week later and despite updates in the interim about the reopening of schools, they#re still waiting – and it#s not acceptable.Like everyone , islanders are desperate to know when they can reconnect with family and friends. Island businesses are equally frantic to know when and how they can make plans for the weeks ahead.But, unlike everyone , our islands are at a complete disadvantage. They still don#t know what is happening, or when. They deserve better. The Scottish Government needs to respond to our islands# call for clarity and let them, like the rest of the country, start to think and plan ahead.Now in its nd year, the Big Garden Birdwatch is a chance for people of all ages to count the number of birds that visit their garden helping the Royal Society for the Protection of Birdsto build up a picture of how they are doing.This year, more than a million people across the UK, including more than , in Scotland, took part, counting  million birds.The event, held over the last weekend in January, revealed the house sparrow held on to its number one spot. But  out of the top  bird species showed declines in average numbers in Scotland compared to last year.Starlings remained in second place, but numbers were down  per cent compared to . Goldfinches saw the greatest decline in Scotland’s top , falling four places from sixth position last year, with reported numbers  per cent fewer than .I am absolutely delighted with the number of people who have taken part, making it the biggest year ever for RSPB Scotland.This has generated a massive amount of data which will help our scientists with important conservation work, but it also shows how many of us have turned to nature after what has been a dficult  months.We need every voice raised to stand up for nature. The wildle that brings us so much interest and solace is now just a fraction of what should be there.Big Garden Birdwatch has shown that people across Scotland have a real passion for their wildle. We now need government to take the global leadership, policy and legislative opportunities open to it this year to reverse the decline and restore nature.It#s no exaggeration to say that when a dog goes missing or is stolen, it is heart-breaking.Dogs for Good has put together some tips to reduce the likelihood of your dog being taken.If the unthinkable happens and your dog is taken, remember, you are not alone. There are plenty online groups and pages offering guidance and support. DogLost is an excellent charity which provides a free lost and found service.You should also noty police, dog wardens, vets and local rescue centres.Tables for Dementia UK#s annual cake and tea event, Time for a Cuppa, have been reset.Dementia UK is the only charity dedicated to supporting the whole family through dementia specialist Admiral Nurses.The charity#s annual fundraising event takes place between May  and May .Since its launch, it has raised more than £ million with the support of fundraisers, Dementia UK staff and celebrities.One of the highlights of last year#s event was celebrity supporters dressing up as much-loved characters to recreate tea party scenes from the world of film. Phyllis Logan was Mary Poppins, music producer Naughty Boy was Jay Gatsby, Emma Barton was Holly Golightly and Jess and Natalya Wright were Alice in Wonderland and the Queen of Hearts.Families with dementia have been adversely affected by lockdown for just over a year now. Care home visiting restrictions, the closure of support and respite services and the resulting social isolation and loneliness have disproportionately affected people living with dementia and their family carers.Whilst Time for a Cuppa will be slightly dferent this year, we know dementia support is needed more than ever. We are so grateful to all our fundraisers who will be whipping up treats, enthusiasm, funds and who are giving their time for others – in a socially distanced way of course – in what will be a special and important Time for a Cuppa.For more information about Time for a Cuppa and how to host your own tea party with our free fundraising pack, visit the dementiauk.org timeforacuppa webpage."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week april 16 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

In our desire to understand it, we have created starry patterns in our minds like the Plough, the Bull and so on, however, the signs of the Zodiac were already known to the Babylonians in  BC so that is not something new.Today, constellations like Aries, Gemini and others continue to fascinate followers of both astronomy and astrology.One of the most interesting star formations is the Pleiades, better known as the Seven Sisters. Positioned a little to the right of Taurus, they are an unmistakable sight in the winter sky.Even a modest pair of binoculars will reveal that there are many more stars in that cluster than the naked eye can discern. The Pleiades along with Orion, are even mentioned in the bible, in the Book of Job, chapter ..With the aid of binoculars these stars are a truly dazzling sight.The bible is a collection of books coming from the pens of many dferent authors over a long period of time.

Retailers in Scotland have invested tens of millions of pounds on safety measures including plexiglass screens, queue management systems, social distancing signage and floor markings, better ventilation, cleaning and hygiene. Shop workers have ensured the nation was supplied and fed throughout the past thirteen dficult months.The reopening of non-essential shops and ability of food-to-go retailers to resume welcoming customers in-store will mark a crucial milestone for Scottish retail and the wider supply chain. Retail is Scotland#s largest private sector employer. So-called non-essential stores have been compelled to close in Scotland for  consecutive days.The SRC and Usdaw encourage shoppers to:Across Scotland, thousands of shops which have been shuttered for four long months are looking forward to getting back to doing what they do best — serving their customers.Reopening is good news for our economy, for jobs and for our local communities. It has never been more important to play our part in keeping our towns, cities and retail destinations vibrant.Every purchase from a shop helps support jobs in local retail and throughout the supply chain. Retailers and their colleagues continue to work around the clock to maintain a safe shopping experience, so customers can have the confidence toto their favourite stores.If we all follow the necessary physical distancing and hygiene measures and show consideration to those around us, including shop staff who are doing a dficult job, then everyone will be better off.The reopening of stores on Monday offers a leline for many retailers. That is good news in terms of helping to safeguard jobs, but the virus is still out there.We expect employers to conduct full risk assessments, follow the agreed guidance and ensure that customers are fully informed of the necessary safety measures.Shoppers need to play their part in helping to limit the spread of the virus and avoid further lockdowns by following the rules and respecting staff.Regrettably, throughout this appalling pandemic, incidents of abuse towards shop workers doubled and Covid safety measures have now become signicant flashpoints. Abuse should never be part of the job and shop workers – who played a vital role in getting food and medicine into our homes during the pandemic – deserve our thanks and respect.In January, the Scottish Parliament unanimously voted for a ground-breaking new law to protect shop workers. Usdaw campaigned for many years to secure these legal protections and we will continue to work hard to ensure that shop workers are protected and treated with the respect they deserve.The national charity for older people is encouraging people to get moving every day next month as part of a new fundraising activity challenge.Throughout May, Age Scotland is asking people across the country to Spring into Action to help support older people in Scotland.Fundraisers can take part however they choose, but the most important thing is to make sure they are active every day.All funds raised by Spring into Action participants will go towards Age Scotland#s vital services, including the national friendship line, which offers a place older people can turn tothey are in need of support, comfort and reassurance or even just missing a friendly voice.Running and walking events have always been a great way to help raise vital funds and, even with many regular events unfortunately cancelled over the past year, we#ve been overwhelmed by the kindness and generosity shown by fundraisers still going above and beyond.We hope to see as many people as possible taking up our challenge to Spring into Action this May. With nights getting lighter and better weather on the horizon, this is a great excuse to get out and about and support a worthy cause at the same time.#Whether you run one mile, walk five, or design your own challenge, your fundraising efforts will be making a real dference for older people in Scotland.#The money you raise will fund vital services like our friendship line. Every week we receive hundreds of calls from older people looking for support. Many are lonely and isolated and just want to hear a friendly voice.

Online records showed his birthplace as #Inchial Argileshire#, which turned out to be the parish of Glenorchy and Inishail at the head of Loch Awe.Alexander McNab was born there to Alexander senior and Margaret McNab in  — one of a family of three brothers and four sisters — and moved south to Burnley in Lancashire in the s. In Lancashire in , he married Janet Wardrope, who came from Milngavie outside Glasgow, and they went on to have  children.Going back a few generations, Clare#s research has traced Alexander#s great grandfather, John McNab, born in Kilbrandon in the area around Loch Melfort in .His son Peter, born around , went on to farm in Connel and is recorded in the  census as an -year-old, farming  acres at South Ledaig, though is described as a #smith# in an earlier record.Born in , Peter#s son Alexander grew up to work in farming around Glenorchy. In the  census he is recorded as a ploughman at Barbreck.#Our# Alexander seems to have been a blacksmith when he moved from Argyll to Burnley to start a new le.Sadly, two of Alexander and Janet#s family died as young children.Later, however, they found themselves — like so many other families — caught up in the horrors of the First World War.They lost three sons — Andrew, aged , missing in action,  Alex, , missing in action,  and John, , missing in action,  — during the war.The grief the family must have borne is unimaginable. The boys# names are recorded on three separate First World War memorials in Belgium and France.Clare said: #What a tragedy losing your sons. Andrew, Alex and John were brothers of my great grandma, Grace McNab Bridge.#Alexander died in  at the age of , after being hit by a tramcar in Blackpool during the blackout. He was living with daughter Grace and her family at the time. A short newspaper report from the time describes him as a #retired blacksmith#.Clare was born in Blackpool and moved to Tees-side, via a spell in Dumfries, through her husband David#s employment.Though her great grandmother Grace passed away in , Clare believes she can detect echoes of the past in her own family today.She explained: #My son, who is in army, has just trained in music and learnt the bagpipes.#Little bits keep popping up. My other son is into blacksmithing, which is also in the family.#And while she has never visited Argyll, Clare would love to at some point once Covid restrictions have eased.#I had a look at images of Loch Awe and have been reading up about the area. It looks amazing.#If you have any other information on this branch of the McNab family, please email editor@campbeltowncourier and this will be passed on to Clare."},{"url":null,"title":"from our files april 30 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

A big decision has been swept under the carpet.#The budget was reduced by £,, from £, to £,.Douglas Hendry, executive director of customer services, said: #Our process is not to fund routes where there is alternative transport available or where there are less than , people travelling annually.#TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOPiper#s march wins prizeThe Campbeltown piper who won a competition to compose a tune to mark a battle in which many of his comrades fought was presented with his prize on Tuesday # the battle#s rd anniversary.Mr George McIntyre from Meadowburn won a competition run by the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders to compose a   march in memory of the Battle of Longstop Hill in .On Tuesday, Longstop Day, Major Hamish Clarkof the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders travelled to Campbeltown to present George with a specially engraved quaich at a ceremony at the Argyll Hotel.Many Kintyre men fought at the battle which was one of the decisive moments in the Second World War against the Germans in North Africa.Major Duncan McMillan, who won the Military Medal at the battle, attended the ceremony along with many of George#s other old army friends.Before he handed the quaich to George, Major Clark said: #I really can#t think of anyone more appropriate to have won the competition than George McIntyre himself.#If George had not been taken prisoner in  he may well have fought at Longstop.#Receiving the quaich, George said: #It gives me great honour to achieve this.#Then Mr Ian McKerral from Kintyre and District Pipe Band gave the first public performance of the tune.FIFTY YEARS AGOThe end of the road for PaulPaul McCartney, who is at the moment staying at High Park Farm, Campbeltown, has just made one giant step forward towards severing all his connections with the other three Beatles.John Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr abandoned their appeal against a High Court order on Monday, putting the affairs of their company, Apple, in the hands of a receiver. The three now face a legal costs bill estimated at £,.Mr Morris Finer, QC for John, George, Ringo and Apple, told the appeal court on Monday that they now considered it was in the common interest to explore ways of allowing Paul to free himself from the partnership by agreement.Mr David Hurst QC on behalf of Paul said: #He will most willingly enter into the proposed negotiations to achieve his freedom from the partnership by consent rather than by court action.#Well, it looks very much like the end of the #long and winding road# to quote a well known McCartney ballad.What does Paul himself feel about the rise and fall of the Beatles Two Courier men drove up to High Park Farm — which has a long and decidedly bumpy road leading to it — to find out what the man in the centre of it all felt about things.Apart from being obviously excited about his latest and most important success, Paul did not like saying anything about the matter.Though very polite and friendly, he made it quite clear that he does not see any point in giving interviews or saying anything remotely sensational.After ten years of being harried and hustled by journalists and photographers never having a minute#s peace to himself always having been the centre of attraction never having been able to pop in to the #local#, is it any wonder that Paul is determined to live as quietly as possible He seemed as happy as a sand-boy, out there in the wilds.When we approached him, he had obviously been brushing down one of his horses because he still held a horse brush in his hand.His we Linda looked the essence of happiness as her golden hair mirrored the warm sunshine. The children yelled and gurgled contentedly and even Martha, the English sheepdog, seemed happy.The farm house itself has been extensively renovated, a new roof having been constructed and the farm work appears to be progressing normally.Paul himself has changed. Outwardly at any rate. Gone is the Beatle mop, the style which was copied the whole word over. Gone is the boyish grin, which once sent screaming thousands into ecstasy.What has taken the place of these characteristics  Paul now sports a beard the hair remains longish but it is brushed back, revealing the full extent of his forehead the smile is no longer boyish.The former bass-guitarist song-writer with the most influential and certainly most famous foursome the world has ever known has changed.Paul will probably continue to compose such brilliant songs as Maybe I#m Amazed and Another Day but to millions of people, from Campbeltown to Honolulu, pop music will certainly never be the same again.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOSparks and flashesThere would be some fluttering this week among the ladies in the town who are liable to serve on a jury, summonses to appear on the occasion of a forthcoming jury trial having been issued to  ladies and  gentlemen.

Eight designs will be chosen to become stamps which will be on sale across the UK.Children may choose to illustrate frontline workers in health or social care.They may want to celebrate other key workers who have kept the country going, such as refuse collectors, cleaners, teachers, supermarket workers, public transport staff, delivery drivers or, indeed, postmen and postwomen.Or they might highlight the volunteers who have helped in their local communities or raised money for charity, such as the late Captain Sir Tom Moore.The competition is open until Friday May . A special  of judges will select the winners. As with all special stamps, the final eight designs will be sent to HM The Queen before they can be printed and issued as stamps. The winners will be announced in the autumn.We cannot wait to see who children choose to honour on their stamp.

If you are taking a long-term view then a garden full of reliable flowering shrubs is also an option.Whatever garden you have, watering and weeding are the key watchwords for May. It is essential to water newly planted fruit trees, roses and shrubs regularly to help their root systems get established.It is also the time of year when many plants# demand for water increases as they start their major growth period. Top watering tips include – every time you plant something, water it in well, make a moat of soil round newly planted plants so that water doesn#t run off and goes to the roots, water pots and containers so that water appears right to the top of the pot and get a water butt.If you have a drainpipe, you have a natural water supply so a simple garden solution for May is to ensure that you have adequate water storage. If you buy and fit a water butt, it will provide you with water for the garden in an environmentally friendly way and on a regular basis.Annual weeds will be popping up now, so weeding borders once a week to prevent weed seedlings establishing is a good idea. The problem with the most common weeds such as nettles, dandelions and bindweed, is that they are very, very tough. They can continue to grow in conditions that make most garden plants simply fade away – and they do that, in part, by using the moisture, nutrients and light of the plants around them.A great plant to get you into the summer gardening spirit is the pretty petunia – perfect for containers and hanging baskets and a great choice for instant colour. It can flower all summer long, providing you deadhead regularly, and comes in a iety of colours to suit any garden palette.Petunias are also available in dferent blooms including single, double, ruffled or smooth petals. They can be striped, veined or solid in colour and most sold today are hybrids developed for specic design purposes such as fragrance.They need full sun and can#t tolerate frost but can grow in a wide range of soils and thrive in multipurpose compost when planted in containers.Keeping on top of garden maintenance is crucial in May. The garden is coming alive so there is plenty to keep you busy. Here are some jobs you should be thinking about this month from the Royal Horticultural Society:"},{"url":null,"title":"calls for patience as vaccination programme continues","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Community benefit and shared ownership must, they say, be made a requirement of all future wind farm projects.They also believe residents are at a disadvantage when dealing with complex, jargon-filled planning proposals, and called for the Scottish Government to enforce better community engagement and provide funding towards professional advice for community councils affected by larger developments falling under section  and  of of the Electricity Act .The government must explore alternative arrangements, added the group, for the re-opening of the Machrihanish wind turbine factory.The height and number of turbines is of increasing concern, with recent applications proposing towers up to  metres high # some  per cent taller than many existing structures.The group believes the cumulative effect will negatively impact the area#s scenic beauty and therefore tourism.Bob Chicken, planning convenor for Tarbert and Skipness Community Council, said: #Our communities# needs are being ignored. We believe that our proposals will strike a fairer balance between the need for greener power and the needs of the remote and rural populations who live and work in the lands used to generate it.#The group#s specic concerns were put to renewable energy industry body Scottish Renewables.Claire Mack, chief executive of Scottish Renewables, replied by saying that rural Scotland had a #central role# to play in delivering clean power for climate change targets.She continued: #The latest UK Government figures show that only  per cent of Scots are opposed to the development of onshore wind farms. That data is supported by further research, carried out specically in rural Scotland, which additionally showed higher support for onshore wind power among young people.#Renewables now provide the equivalent of  per cent of Scotland’s electricity consumption, with onshore wind delivering the bulk of that power, employing , people across the country and supporting a thriving supply chain of businesses from the central belt to the Borders, Highlands and Islands.#"},{"url":null,"title":"man drove on forestry road whilst disqualified","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I think the idea is you canrsquot fold anything more than seven times, so we would try to.ldquoWell, he still does it.Ewen smiled but it was a sad one. Izzy wasnrsquot sureshe was making things worse or better for him by telling him such things.ldquoDoes he like his boots  he asked.ldquoLoves them and they fit perfectly.Ewen nodded, then clenched his hands together on the table. Izzy could feel his pain. She placed her hands on top of his.ldquoEwen, you are doing amazing, this must be hell for you, I know how much you love Finn and want him to know it. But please, be careful. He could have seen you at the Falls of Leny, and he definitely saw you talking to me at Balquhidder. Hersquos seen your car. We have to be super careful to ensure he doesnrsquot recognise you or realise.Ewen nodded: ldquoSally comes up with a dferent hire car tomorrow, so that should make things less obvious. I think shersquos worried about me.ldquoMe too, you be OK tonight  asked Izzy.ldquoIrsquoll be OK. This evening, even though it was for a brief moment and he didnrsquot know it, I was with Finn. Irsquoll know hersquos near and will have a distant view of him in the morning. I feel closer to him than I have for four years, although itrsquos making me feel like a stalker.ldquoYoursquore not a stalker, Ewen, yoursquore a dad who loves his son.Ewen clenched his hands again. ldquoThank you.ldquoIrsquom doing it for Finn as much as for you, said Izzy. She was still sure she was doing the right thing, but was terried of the risks.ldquoPlease remember to be careful and stick to the plans we made, she pleaded. ldquoWe have to keep him safe. Hersquos been through enough already.ldquoI will, I promise.Ewen finished his tea and left the hostel.Izzy sat a while, trying to calm herself, eyes closed and breathing deeply.ldquoYou all right, honey She opened her eyes: it was a woman who had come into the kitchen. Izzy wanted to say yes but the womanrsquos concern and kind words triggered a flood of tears. It was her turn to be comforted, by a stranger who knew nothing of the burden she carried, of her guilt and overwhelming feeling of responsibility.ldquoThank you for being so kind, she said to the woman. ldquoI feel much better now after a wee greet.ldquoNo man is worth such upset, my lovely, the kind woman said. Izzy just nodded and smiled at her. If only it was that simple, she thought.She ed to the room and opened the door slowly Finn was sound asleep. Izzy felt emotionally exhausted and hoped shersquod fall asleep quickly, but as she lay in her bed after a hot shower, she couldnrsquot stop her mind racing it had been so close, whatFinn had woken  She trusted Ewen to be careful. But she must be careful too. Finally, under the gaze of MacFarlanersquos Lantern, sleep overtook her.Finn was first to wake in the morning.ldquoAunty, aunty, itrsquos morning! he said while looking out of the window. It was daylight but the sky had clouded over and thick mist hung on the hills.ldquoA typical Highland morning, he said cheerfully.Izzy got things packed as Finn had his shower and they left the hostel before most of the other residents were out of their beds. After a phone call to Finnrsquos mum, they set off.ldquoWhere we having breakfast  asked Finn.ldquoVery close by, on the banks of Loch Dochart.They drove for just a few minutes and pulled into a layby. Izzy performed her usual routine of bringing her rucksack. They walked through some woodland and arrived at the waterrsquos edge.ldquoWow, is that an island with a castle on it  asked Finn.ldquoIt is, said Izzy, ldquoand what stories are here! Irsquoll tell you some over breakfast.Finn helped Izzy set up her stove and they took turns stirring the porridge. There were midges in the air, at times annoying, but it was late in the season and their biting was minimal. A breeze from the loch kept them away most of the time.She told Finn of the castlersquos history, how the island was once a MacGregor stronghold, but that lsquoBlack Duncan Campbellrsquo built the castle they saw now after he took the land.Then Izzy told an ancient legend: ldquoIt was here that Fionn MacCoul met his death, at the hands of a giant named Taileachd.Finn scooped more porridge into his bowl but he nodded, showing he was listening and wanted Izzy to continue.ldquoThe giant lived with his sweetheart, who was a beautul faery maiden.ldquoOf course, said Finn, smiling cheekily.Izzy ed the smile and continued: ldquoSome versions of the tale say they had their home on an island on Loch Lubhair, just downstream, while others an island here on Loch Dochart, maybe even that one.Finn studied the castlersquos ruins, which peered out from the trees which covered the island. It looked so mysterious.ldquoOne day, Taileachd discovered that his sweetheart had met Fionn and they had fallen in love.ldquoSo Fionn ran off with her, thatrsquos ironic! laughed Finn.ldquoNo, you see she loved them both, maybe in dferent ways, but she was now torn between them. They were going to fight over her, and she knew one of them would be killed, so she came up with an idea.Finn put his bowl down and listened as Izzy acted out the tale.ldquolsquoPlease put your anger awayrsquo, said the faery woman. lsquoI love you both, but whoever can leap the furthest I shall be with.rsquoldquoA jumping competition! exclaimed Finn.ldquoExactly!Izzy dramatically described how the two competitors leapt from the island trying to outperform each other. They were equally matched but when they jumped backwards, Fionn momentarily lost his balance and the giant, fearful he was going to lose his sweetheart, took the opportunity to cut off Fionnrsquos head!ldquoAw, ouch, foul! cried Finn.Izzy nodded and spoke with a solemn tone.ldquoIn that moment of violence, they all lost everything. The faery woman fled: she no longer loved Taileachd because of his brutal act, and Fionn, whom she loved, had lost his le. His body floated down the river, and was found by the Fiann, his band of warriors. They buried him at Killin and now they were full of vengeance, so went to search for Fionnrsquos murderer.ldquoDid they find him ldquoWell, Taileachd fled to Rannoch Moor and Irsquoll tell you what happened when we get there, later today.ldquoAw, aunty!Finnrsquos protest was interrupted as his attention was suddenly caught by the sight of a man in a dinghy rowing out into the loch. They watched as he struggled a bit in the current, then vanished behind the eastern side of the island. A few minutes later, the man appeared on top of the ruined tower, half hidden by branches. He sat there.Finn waved and the man waved back.ldquoI really want to go onto that island and see the castle and where the giant lived. Maybe that man will lend us his dingy ldquoHersquos probably going fishing, Finn, and is just looking at the water to see where the fish are. Hersquoll be there all day.ldquoWe could swim ldquoThe current is too strong here Finn, but we could swim at out next stop: St Fillanrsquos healing pool, itrsquos part of the river, just upstream from here.Finn stood by the waterrsquos edge looking out to the island, disappointed. But he accepted his auntrsquos decision.They packed up and headed for the healing pool.

It seems very unfair that we should no longer be able to use a road that we pay for to access the hills.I noticed a picture on Facebook, taken on a sunny Sunday when people would normally be out enjoying a walk around the reservoir, but only one car seems to be using the car park.As East Lothian grows, we should be utilising as much of our outdoor space as possible to help our population exercise and take pressure off coastlines and popular woodland areas. The Lammermuir Hills are underused for recreation and have a superb network of paths, but woefully inadequate parking.Overriding everything in the letter you printed is the Scottish Governments Land Reform Act of , which clearly states the Right for Responsible Access in Scotland.. The overall framework of land rights, responsibilities and public policies should promote, fulfil and respect relevant human rights in relation to land, contribute to public interest and wellbeing, and balance public and private interests. The framework should support sustainable economic development, protect and enhance the environment, help achieve social justice and build a fairer society.. There should be a more erse pattern of land ownership and tenure, with more opportunities for citizens to own, lease and have access to land.The landownerrsquos decision to heavily restrict parking prejudices families, those with disabilities and groups who take people walking in the hills and need an access point. I understand that during the last year, the countryside has suffered littering, fires and irresponsible parking, but to punish responsible visitors because of the behaviour of a minority is a knee-jerk reaction and will only create animosity towards the estate at a time when public opinion is turning against grouse shooting. Instead, the landowner should be working with local residents, East Lothian Council and interested parties to help improve access and educate visitors on how to visit responsibly.Name and address supplied"},{"url":null,"title":"builders-merchant-built-instead-hotel-former-raceland-site","story":"The former Raceland karting site, between Gladsmuir and Longniddry, closed in early .Work is due to start later this year on a petrol station, two drive-thru restaurants and a drive-thru cafe on the southern section of the site.Initial proposals suggested a hotel could be built on the northern part of the former karting site, where the outdoor track was located, but that could now be ditched for a buildersrsquo merchants.The karting centre was given planning permission in  and also operated a paintball centre.

But they will need a rest at some point. I would repot later in the year, in the autumn, rather than the start of the year,\" says Bishop.Lambell, says spring is a better time for repotting. \"This marks the beginning of growing season , when your plant will be thriving, flourishing and even floweringits the type to produce blooms during the warmer months.\"How often should you repot them \"As a rough timescale, you will need to repot your plant every one to two years, depending on its growth rate,\" says Lambell.\"Most plants will happily repot, but as always, theres no one-size-fits-all rule when it comes to care and youll need to consider the inidual plants needs.\"For example, for a bird of paradise or peace lily to flower, they need to be in relatively small pots. If your plant is currently flowering, try to avoid repotting as this could lead to transplant shock.\"How do you know they need repotting If the plant looks a little lacklustre, or its roots are growing out of the potor is no longer growing quickly and is drying out fast, these are all signs it needs to be repotted, says Lambell.Some plants, such as sansevieria , will throw up new pups . Rather than repotting you can just split those, Bishop suggests.\"Cacti shouldnt need to be repotted because they are so slow-growing and dont have heavy root structures. You wont have to touch a large cactus for five or six years,\" she adds.How should you repot them \"Choose a new pot that is around -cm larger,\" Lambell advises. \"Try not to go much bigger than this - as a rule, dont go beyond two pot sizes bigger - as this can overwhelm the plant with soil and water it doesnt need.\"Once youve chosen the perfect pot upgrade, remove your plant from its existing pot and separate the roots, shaking off the old soil. Pack a layer of fresh soil in the new potand set the plant in. Surround with soil and give it a little water.\"Whatyou dont want a pot-bound plant to grow too big You could split a plant and transplant the pieces into two separate pots, Bishop suggests.\"Where small growths appear on plants such as sansevieria, you just take it out of the pot and just split it, taking off the smaller plants or just break the plant in half. They are really robust and will easily come back.\"Can plants die when you try to repot them \"A lot of plants do suffer from transplant shock, so when you first repot or split them they almost sag and look like they wont survive. But water them and put them back in the same conditions they were originally in and they should be okay,\" says Bishop.\"A lot of people make the mistake of repotting them and then putting them into a dferent room. Ideally put them back to where they originally were.\"Which are good plants for repotting Peace lilies, monsteras, sansevierias, ZZ plants . marantas , tradescantias and philodendron.Are any plants more dficult \"Calatheas are trickier, more sensitive houseplants. I would repot them in a slightly bigger pot, one size up, rather than splitting them. They are happy as long as you feed them and dont change their air conditions too much. Draughts and change of light levels can affect them.\"Flowering plants can be tricky becauseyou dont plant them at the right time you can kill the flower and cause the plant to go into shock,\" says Bishop.Is there a technique to splitting plants \"Be quite fearless,\" says Bishop. \"I tend to split it in half to be left with two big healthy chunks. Then a lot of the nutrients in the roots arent damaged.\"What about compost \"It depends on the type of plant. Theres cactus compost, theres citrus compost. My perfect mix is a houseplant compost to which I add a bit of perlite to allow more drainage.

It had a more focused suspension set-up too, while the bonnet air intake became a design feature for all future Cooper S models.Production ramps upIncredibly, by May  ndash just over a year since it went on sale ndash the ,th Mini was produced at BMW Groups Oxford plant. It was a testament to the success of the design and execution of the Mini, thats for sure.The Mini goes drop-topFlash forward to  and the Mini Convertible arrived, bringing that wind-in-your-hair experience to the already-popular model. It still retained space for four, but used a fabric roof that folds up behind the rear seats and didnt require a cover.The boot may have been small at  litres with the roof open, but as with the rest of the range, the Convertible sold like hotcakes.Arrival of the GPThings took a turn for the more serious, with the arrival of the GP in . Limited to just , models worldwide ndash with  made available to UK buyers ndash the lighter, faster and meaner GP sold out before a single customer had even driven a car.Arriving as the most powerful production Mini to date, it used the same .-litre supercharged petrol engine as the Cooper S, but it was boosted for more power while plenty of weight was stripped from the cabin to make the GP even more exciting to drive.The dficult second albumIn August , Mini chose to reveal its second-generation car. It retained the same retro look like the original but was bigger and more efficient than before. The .-litre engine was changed, while the Cooper S used turbocharging instead of supercharging for the first time. Prices increased, too, with the One starting from pound, and the Cooper commanding pound,.Here comes the ClubmanMini took its first step in expanding the range with the introduction of the Clubman in . Debuting a new, estate car-like layout, the Clubman offered more space than the conventional hatch but retained the standard cars nimble handling and punchy range of engines.The start of electricationAt the  Los Angeles Auto Show, Mini presented the E, an electric concept. It created  Mini E vehicles, which were shipped for testing by private customers in Calornia, New York and New Jersey, with the results from this trial relayed back to Mini. It also helped BMW to develop its electric i model.The Countryman hits the roadNot content with the Clubman, Mini expanded the range in  with the Countryman. Taking advantage of the growing appetite for SUVs, the Countryman effectively took the Mini recipe and raised it further off the ground.It had seating for five, four doors and a reasonably large boot. It also retained the same funky styling that you got from the standard hatch.The Roadster and Coupe add even more styleMoving along to  saw the introduction of the Mini Coupe, a two-seater version of the standard hatch which was famously styled to resemble a backwards-facing baseball cap. It was joined by a soft-top version ndash the Roadster. It used a fabric roof like the standard convertible, but had a sleeker, more aerodynamically focused design.A change of pace for MiniIn , Mini introduced the Paceman, which represented a mash-up of an SUV and hatchback. In truth, it was a slightly odd combination, as it had an upright body style but just three doors. Sitting alongside the rest of the Mini line-up, it saw the firms range of cars swell to seven.Third times the charmShortly after the introduction of the Paceman came the introduction of a third-generation hatch. It debuted a new interpretation of the cars classic styling, but was still built in Oxford and was centred around that fun-to-drive experience. Arriving in , the third-generation hatch was bigger in every sense and utilised .-litre three-cylinder engines ndash though the more powerful Cooper S benefitted from a four-cylinder, .-litre petrol.The Mini gains a set of doorsShortly after the arrival of the third-generation Mini came a new, five-door iant, which brought improved rear legroom, a third rear seat, and a more accessible cabin. It has continued to be a great option even today.The Clubman ndash betteredMini followed on from the revitalisation of its hatchback with the introduction of a revised Clubman. It was bigger than before but retained the useful split rear doors, which gave access to a larger boot than before.An electried CountrymanIn , Mini showcased a real attempt at electrication with its Countryman Plug-in hybrid. The first hybrid model to be offered by the brand, it combined a three-cylinder petrol engine with an electric motor and batteries. Capable of driving for up to  miles on battery-power alone, it was easily the most economical car in Minis stable.The Mini goes electricThe year  proved to be a big deal for Mini, as it was when the companys first EV arrived in showrooms ndash the Mini Electric. Its styling was largely unchanged over the regular petrol and diesel models, while a zippy electric motor ensured it delivered the same winning driving experience. The Mini Electric has gone on to prove popular, despite its relatively short range of  miles.The present dayIn January , Mini presented the latest incarnation of its famous hatchback, delivering a new look and a range of technology updates. Though the styling was classical Mini, some key refinements ndash such as a new body-coloured front grille ndash ensure that it has remained looking sharp and up to date."},{"url":null,"title":"arlene-fosters-week-set-titanic-exhibition-know-sinking-ship-see-one","story":"RIGHT, thatrsquos me.

Like it or not, this is the \"Independence Election\" Thursdayrsquos vote sets the stage for constitutional crisis. That much we can depend upon. The Holyrood vote is essentially a proxy poll on indyref. However, we end this election ndash arguably the most important in the nationrsquos history ndash with no substantive discussion about what independence really means.The notion of independence permeates this election. In a nutshell, the narrative has been fairly straightforward:therersquos a majority of Yes parties in Holyrood, Scotlandrsquos Government will ask the Tory administration in London for a referendum once the pandemic is fully over. Unionists say no, now isnrsquot the time.That dynamic has locked the electorate into casting our votes along constitutional lines.

The parties donrsquot care they know this really isnrsquot an election about policy ndash or rather the parties have made sure this wonrsquot be an election about policy. Itrsquos all about that phantom indy.When it comes to what independence means, though, the SNP gets a little hazy. The party has clearly chosen not to level with the people before we vote. In one way, thatrsquos entirely understandable. The SNP doesnrsquot want to spook anyone, it wants to pacy the centre. Electoral logic demands that discussions about what independence really means ndash economically, socially and politically ndash are kept off the table by the SNP.Therersquos two problems with that, though ndash firstly, itrsquos deceitful. Donrsquot force people to make decisions without the full facts at their fingertips. Secondly, this sleight of hand, and dearth of detail, has backfired, allowing opposition parties to attack independence on their terms. With no discussion about finance, it allowed Alison Rose, chief executive of NatWest, to say the bank would sht its HQ to London post-independence. With no discussion about separation, it set traps for Nicola Sturgeon, with the First Minister branded \"delusional\" after touting, to Irelandrsquos media, Ulsterrsquos Brexit protocols as a possible ldquotemplate for independence all in the afterglow of street violence in Belfast over the same issue.Read more: Alex Salmonds Trumpian Alba Party could kill Scottish independenceThe SNP has turned independence into the Scarlet Pimpernel. By avoiding detailed discussion for politically expedient reasons at the ballot box, the party allows anyone to imprint anything they wish onto independence, for good or bad. A longitudinal look at polling, however, shows a fall in support for the SNP, and more severely for independence, as the consequences of the partyrsquos cack-handed prestidigitation around the constitution.The SNP has attempted the impossible ndash to both make this election about independence , and not about independence . The people donrsquot like that ndash we see through it ndash and itrsquos allowed an early Project Fear Mark  to lay down roots.Clearly, adopting the hardline \"independence first, last and always\" position of Alba wouldnrsquot have been a better path. It stinks of extreme nationalism. Nor do the majority of people want to see constitutional upheaval in the teeth of pandemic.However, a middle path was possible. The SNP could have clearly said this election is evidently about the constitutional future of the country , and also, crucially, given its vision of that future, without behaving like Saltire-wrapped obsessives. Providing a new, fresh prospectus for independence wouldnrsquot have undermined attempts to frame Thursdayrsquos vote as one about domestic issues and Covid recovery. The SNP appears, insultingly, to think Scottish voters cannot hold two ergent thoughts in our heads simultaneously.Itrsquos a phoney, duplicitous election. Therersquos a sense of boredom too, as most of us have made up our minds on the constitution.The SNP may not have wanted to talk much about independence, but it should have. The prospectus for independence hasnrsquot fundamentally changed much since , but the world is hugely dferent. While Brexit, and the sense of it as an attack on Scottish sovereignty, plays well for the Yes movement, the prospect of EU re-entry and the possibilities it presents around borders pose hard questions. As does currency, as does Nato, as does settlement with the rest of the UK ndash as does a myriad other matters.If we accept that, like it or not, this election is a proxy on the referendum, then wersquore being asked to vote blind.

Any change to the curriculum heralds the abandonment of spelling, or arithmetic, or history, or alternatively ato Dotheboys Hall. Mild scepticism about lockdown or masks seems often to progress to a conviction that Bill Gates, the World Economic Forum, Huawei, Big Pharma and lizard aliens have created a vaccine to control your DNA through G masts.But sometimes such positions become mainstream: no one calls it an obsession when itrsquos widely enough shared. Environmentalism, which from the s until the mid-s was the preserve of the crank Left, is now the principal enthusiasm of Boris Johnsonrsquos government, and the central priority for the CEOs of almost every major international corporation. The cranks are now those who fail to subscribe to the every utterance of a Swedish teenager who left school at  to start yelling at world leaders, or of Extinction Rebellion, a pressure group that likes shutting down city centres and impeding ambulances.Though not one of the dozens of disaster scenarios of environmental doomsayers ndash countries vanishing beneath the waves, famine caused by overpopulation, oil running out, global winter ndash has transpired, that doesnrsquot mean that there are not serious threats to climate and the environment.Itrsquos possible to question the extent to which those are man-made, or whether the cost of a particular change outweighs its benefit, without lurching into the tin-foil-hatted territory of those who deny the overwhelming scientic consensus that there are real, potentially very damaging, global challenges. ANDREW MCKIE:Boris Johnson is right: the rules donrsquot apply to him, by Andrew McKieRather as the current UK government has, despite constantly being characterised as ldquofar-Right, enacted the most Left-wing policies not just for a Tory administration, but of any party in nearly half a century, it has proposed the most far-reaching green policies ndash eventheyrsquore not enough to placate the protesters merrily smashing up bank windows with no heed for the climate costs involved in their replacement.Boris Johnsonrsquos enthusiasm for this agenda is such that his depiction of the UK as the most ambitious and committed country may even be true. The UKrsquos climate target is to keep temperatures lower still than those the Paris Agreement aims for, while banning all conventional and even hybrid cars within a decade, replacing gas boilersand reaching ldquonet zero by  are all measures that go further than almost anyone rsquos plans.The Prime Minister certainly seems to be genuinely committed to the United Nations Climate Change Conference, COP, being held in Glasgow in November, evensome critics uncharitably claim thatrsquos because hersquos looking forward to the swanking potential this jamboree offers him.Conventional wisdom is that the libertarian and fiscally prudent instincts of Tories should resist environmental restrictions on personal choice and the hugely costly public expenditure they may entail. There are still many in Mr Johnsonrsquos party that take that view.But there is an equally strong strain in Conservatismtowards conservation and environmental concerns. There is no reason to doubt the sincerity of those Tories who proclaim it ndash whether they do so because theyrsquore genuinely convinced of its importance, or from some sort of romantic pastoral vision, or simply because it has become a more mainstream and popular position. ANDREW MCKIE:How do you solve a problem like Russia The trouble with any realistically transformative environmental programme, however, is that it will have tremendous costs. There are obvious economic ones: swapping to fuels and technologies that are, at least initially, more expensive, or the fact that fewer food air-miles mean pricier groceries. But there are also those of convenience and opportunity: EVs place huge limits on range, foreign travel and even meat-eating need to be cut back. For some environmental purists, growth itself is a dirty word, and much of modern le ought to be abandoned.The principal argument of Mr Johnsonrsquos supporters in government is that technology can solve those problems, and indeed those costs. They believe that the more committed they are to the agenda, the more likely it is that prices will fall and innovations develop. Against the doctrines of traditional environmentalists, therersquos some solid evidence for that.The global population is three times larger than it was in , yet instead of mass starvation, we produce more food than ever before, and more cheaply. Infant mortality is a fraction of what it was  years ago, as is absolute poverty. UK emissions are the lowest theyrsquove been for a century and a half. Reforestation, along with many other environmental goods such as bioersity, is actually increasing and damaging practices decreasing in the majority of countries ndash and these trends are strongest in developed nations.On this view, environmental progress is aof economic prosperity, rather than its enemy. If thatrsquos true, Mr Johnsonrsquos green agenda might simultaneously be conservative, radical, and popular.

We cannot manage what we cannot measure, which is why it is often left out of the carbon equation.:Claire Taylor: Indyref and a blinkered green agenda could harm Scottish farmings futureThis could all be about to change. Last week saw the launch of a global farm metric ndash a common benchmark to measure the sustainability of food and farming. I attended a TEDx event hosted by the Sustainable Food Trust which is leading a new coalition to establish a standardised approach for assessing the sustainability credentials of dferent farms. A common toolkit which will be rolled out internationally and will allow us to present a harmonised approach to measuring and managing agriculturersquos global emissions.Finally, the role our grasslands play in storing carbon will be properly recorded and recognised for their valuable contribution towards our journey to net zero emissions. It is now up to the next Scottish Government to embrace this global farm metric and start recognising farming as part of the solution.Farming practices will have to change to be part of this journey and I believe from speaking to farmers and reading the manestorsquos of dferent farming organisations that they are ready and up to the challenge, but this sht in production will require long term commitments over future funding.If farmers are going to be tasked with producing more environmentally friendly food which comes with a higher price tag, this has to be reflected in the value of food or  farmers will continue to need subsidies in order to keep food affordable for the public.Farmers today are producing food which is sold at the same price as it was  years ago. The same certainly canrsquot be said for the price of clothing, petrol or house prices.If we as consumers really value a future where low carbon produce becomes a staple in our shopping baskets, then we might have to start footing some of the bill.We all go into our local supermarket with the moral intentions of choosing food which supports good animal welfare and boasts environmental protections, but % of us go in and buy based on price.Food is cheap and we are so disconnected from the way it is produced that we often donrsquot value it and think nothing of throwing it away. Why  do we allow % of UK food to end up in the bin But are we lazy consumers with a disregard for seasonality and the origins of our food, or is it simply that we are overwhelmed by too much choice on the shelves that we canrsquot begin to understand the impact of our purchases :Claire Taylor: Blue Peter has no right to push an anti-meat agendaWe all might recognise a free-range egg label or red tractor assurance mark, but do we really feel equipped to make informed choices on the sustainability of our purchases  I back the proposals by the Scottish Greens and the SNP to introduce carbon labelling, but will it not all ultimately come back to a case of price During the TEDx event, the Chief Executive of Morrisonrsquos explained: ldquoChoice often means the balance between price and quality, price and provenance, price and healthier ingredients, but it always comes down to price.Morrisonrsquos have a clever solution to remove the pressure from consumers and place the onus on themselves to provide sustainable produce on their shelves. In March they announced that they would only be supplied by net zero carbon farms by  and will be working with their  farmers and growers to produce affordable net zero carbon meat, fruit, vegetables, and eggs. This takes away the uncertainty and ambiguity for its customers.As a nation emerging from a pandemic with rising levels of poverty and social inequality, we cannot expect the public to be putting sustainability at the top of their list, but longer term the responsibility will have to be shared by consumers.We as the public need to play our part in tackling the climate emergency and committing to responsible food choices is a good place to start. We need to start valuing the produce on our shelves and nipping in the bud the throwaway culture which has resulted from our disconnect.There is an urgency to rebuild our relationship with food and our understanding of how it Is produced. All roads lead back to education, and by introducing sustainable food production as part of the national curriculum will equip the next generation with the knowledge to make responsible food choices.Constitutional issues cannot be allowed to dominate and ide discussion over the next five years. A collaborative approach is needed to properly address and tackle the looming climate emergency and how our food is produced, purchased, and consumed has to be front and centre of policy decisions."},{"url":null,"title":"uzma-mir-cant-scots-scotland-use-scots-words-without-called-jakeys","story":"Here is a language that is at least  years old, was spoken by kings and ordinary people, used to write official records, was the language of most of the work of arguably one of the worldrsquos most famous poets, Rabbie Burns, is part and parcel of a nationrsquos identity and, at the last census, was spoken, read or understood by . million people.A language so dferent from English that in , Englishman and scholar Henry Saville described the English and Scots tongues as being dferent as Spanish and Portuguese.

He likes to get a ldquoguid pile on the lassies who defiantly answer back.Men like Irvine Welsh and the character ldquoBegbie are fine in his book, because men can speak, write and perform in their own Scotrsquos tongue, but women shouldnrsquot.:Janey Godley on David Cameron, Greensill and the lobbying sleaze sagaI suspect we should be wearing an underskirt in case the Scottish sun shows through our longline cotton skirts and reveals an outline of our upper thighs and that in itself is ldquopure mockitGeorgeexplained that BBC Scotland is putting out content with people like me speaking badly, he disliked the use of slang and Scots words then explained I was a ldquoJakey which is a Scots word can be used to describe ldquoworking class, drunk, slovenly, unkempt addict.Mr Gallowaysays he expects more from BBC Scotland, he doesnrsquot want Scottish people using their own accents, this from a man who speaks fluent cat.Yes, I know. BBC Scotland have a plethora of programmes showcasing the Gaelic language and Scots speaking home grown talent all putting their skills on show.No programmes feature men in lycra being really good at lsquosupping milkrsquo but who knows there might be space after the election.He appeals to the most self-hating Scottish unionist and union flag waving Scots on twitter who yearn for every Scottish TV show to be set in Crammond with a perfectly well spoken Miss Jean Brodie presiding over the local tea shop, she has a poster in the window of Nicola Sturgeon that has a big red X across her face and she wears two underskirts for safety.There will be no broad accents, just lovely well-spoken Blue Peter type men in yellow cords and wax jackets talking about the rugged coastline and the wonderful memories of the time they put down their Barbour coat so Mrs Thatcher could step over a puddle when she looked out into the slashing rain and watched Ravenscraig struggle for survival.The good old days when poor people knew their place and never spoke on TV unless it was to tell us how grateful they were for Tories letting them buy their council house.There will be no one speaking like they once had a veranda, menage or sold football cards to pay for a local lassie to get a pram for her baby. Local accents are not to be heard on BBC Scotland, we must stamp out anything that says ldquoworking class and ldquolived experience.Of course itrsquos utter accent snobbery, I know people who were drug addicts, who lived with extreme poverty and they spoke more sense that someone I knew with perfect pronunciation, itrsquos all relative.:Janey Godley: Why do union flag-waving patriots think they can decide who can and cant grieve Accent is just the noise and sound of your words it doesnrsquot matter how those words are phrased, itrsquos the intention behind them.ldquoLet the bodies pile high is a disgusting statement but I suspect it was spoken in perfectly received pronunciation. You see what I am getting at  Itrsquos not the sound of the words, itrsquos the intention of what is said that is disgusting.I think the most horric sentence I ever heard coming out of someonersquos mouth was ldquoYou wanted me to do it and that man got put in jail for abusing me back when I was  years old, but he spoke in perfect diction and was a celebrated flautist in the Orange Lodge. The accent is less important when the action is the thing to abhor.I can tell George Gallowaythat I am proud to come from lsquoJakeyrsquosrsquo my dad was a recovering alcoholic and my brother was a heroin addict who died from using.I won ldquoScots Speaker of The Year Award and my plays ldquoAlone saw over  Million people watch them through the National Theatre of Scotlandrsquos project Scenes for Survival. I didnrsquot change my accent and they were viral throughout the world.It seems odd that a man with a target as his political logo, is going public about alienating the working-class voter and their lsquojakeyrsquo accent, surely thatrsquos a mistake  But he must know best, after all he wonrsquot let it go.Mr Gallowayobsession with speaking about me on twitter is something that pleases me. I am an uneducated, bestselling, award winning author, playwright, actor and comedian and he canrsquot stop thinking about me and mentioning me.

Set in Europe between the wars and closely modelled on Nancy Mitfords own le, its the story of Linda Radlett, the most beautul daughter of an eccentric aristocratic English family led by a domineering racist misogynist TV adaptation by West. Linda goes in pursuit of the perfect husband before falling for a French duke. Mitford herself had a relationship with Gaton Palewski, a Free French commander and politician.Who were the Mitfords English aristocracy. Their parents were Lord and Lady Redesdale, who had seven childrenwho mostly grew up to become social gadflies.Come to think of it, was one of them not a Nazi  Not Nancy, I hope.Ah, no, you are thinking of Unity. Most of the Mitford children met Hitler but Unity was the one who was closest to him. She used to sign off letters \"Heil Hitler!\" Love Bobo.\"Diana Mitford also married Oswald Mosley, leader of the British Union of Fascists, in Goebbels drawing room with Hitler as a guest.So they were posh English fascists Well, they were all posh and terribly snobbish but not all were fascists. Decca ran away to become a communist. She was known as the \"red sheep\" of the family.They sound lovely. Any redeeming features Nancy, the eldest, was a novelist and a wit. Deborah became a duchess and the public face of Chatsworth House.Why do we care Well, theres a question. The sisters knew everybody who was anybody in the middle of the th century and recorded their encounters in both their letters to each other. Deborah, Diana and Jessica all published books, and Nancys novels are quite highly regarded, though the novelist Andrew OHagan once offered the backhanded compliment: \"If she had cared more about the lives of others she couldnt have written as she did.\"Isnt this obsession just another example of our forelock-tugging towards rich people Its an argument. Nostalgia for the British upper-class is a real thing in British culture, as can be seen in everything from our obsession with the Mitfords to Downton Abbey.

After all, therersquos nothing like a threat to one and all for some to see it simply as a threat to themselves alone and the rest be damned.Irsquom talking about the Covid- pandemic and the insightful and sometimes rather unedying responses to it by those countries that have adequate defences, towards those countries that do not.Be it vaccine, oxygen, ventilator stocks or general health care provision, you canrsquot help but notice a certain, ldquoIrsquom alright, Jack, mentality increasingly prevalent right now.Arguably, it was always going to be this way once those rich developed nations got over the initial shock of being caught wrongfooted by the virus and began to put their house in order. But my, how quickly and unreservedly that safety ladder has been pulled up letting others sink into the abyss.Donrsquot get me wrong, itrsquos only understandable that there should be a palpable sense of relief here in the UK and any country that has managed to turn a corner in the fight against the pandemic. Whatrsquos far less comprehensible though is the misguided notion of singularity or exceptionalism in a global crisis.If ever one detail was a sharp reminder of that, itrsquos the news that India, one of the worldrsquos biggest producers of vaccines, wonrsquot be exporting many for a while.This means that COVAX, the global initiative aimed at equitable access to the Covid- vaccine, has lost much of the supply produced by the Pune-based Serum Institute of India.In the words of one vaccine expert, ldquoright now COVAX has ground to a shuddering halt... wersquore at the point of where wersquore trying to rearrange the deck chairs on the Titanic.This in turn means that many of the poorer countries that were relying on such supplies will be impacted and even some of the richer ones in Europe and where who are beginning to exit the crisis could well find themselves affected.In other words, here once again is more proof ndashit were needed ndash of the truism that no one is safe until everyone is safe. Whatever happened to those leaders and governments that were once enthusiastic chanters of such a mantra  It didnrsquot take long it seems for them to forget the words to this chorus of caringFor the grim inescapable fact is that while many in the West are cock-a-hoop about the rapid roll out of vaccines, the pandemic is gathering pace where. India is the most obvious recent example, but many now fear that numerous African countries are about to plummet down that same terrible track.ldquoTwo months ago, India was doing a victory dance and handing out vaccines around the world like candies, observed Dr Ayoade Alakija, co-chair of the Africa Vaccine Delivery Alliance, which is co-ordinating distribution on the continent.ldquoThey were saying how wonderfully they had done because of the immunity and the youth of their population. Look where India is today, was Dr Alakijarsquos timely reminder this week.Indiarsquos catastrophe is all the proof needed, say health experts like her, of what could happen in Africavaccination campaigns are not rapidly accelerated, and the virus is allowed to spread and mutate. And Africa of course is not unique in this respect with South and Central America experiencing another surge that contributed this week to a record near million cases reported globally on a single day.So much of what has unfolded politically around the world during the pandemic has given us an insight, sometimes chilling, into the way global politics and many governments and leaders worldwide operate.What lessons might we take for example from the fact that the top five slots in the geographical mortality rankings all belong to countries run by populists when the pandemic began ndash the US, Brazil, Mexico, India, and Britain.As Gideon Lasco, a leading global medical anthropologist at the University of the Philippines, noted recently ldquomedical populist politicians like Indiarsquos Prime Minister Narendra Modi, President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, and former US president Donald Trump, all rose to power and ruled in populist styles.This allowed for an oversimplication of the pandemic and enabled them to flag up their own frequently misguided solutions while forging isions across their nations in the process.What to make then of the call this week by Gordon Brown to the foreign ministers of the worldrsquos leading economies, meeting in London as part of the G Summit, to fund a bn two-year vaccine and healthcare support package for poor countries On the face of it, Mr Brownrsquos humanitarian rallying call makes sense. But coming as it does in the wake of the UK Governmentrsquos bafflingly stupid decision to cut le-saving overseas aid for water and sanitation projects amid the pandemic, it only underlines the mixed motives and messages coming from nations in the developed world.At its most cynical and some might even argue predatory level, there are those countries, too, who now clearly view their capacity to supply vaccines through the prism of international competition.If we give you desperately needed vaccines, you give us concessions goes the current thinking. These concessions might take the shape of access to natural resources and markets or helping turn the screw on political rivals as China has done in pressuring other countries into derecognising Taiwan infor vaccine supplies.Itrsquos all a far cry from those early days of the pandemic when some global leaders spoke of universal vaccines and aid as a moral course of action and the way to bring about the swtest end to a disease that affects us all.If the pandemic has perhaps taught us anything and is still teaching us, itrsquos the lesson that responding intelligently to a global crisis of this kind depends on people in high office being smart enough to listen and co-operate with one another. Admittedly, there have been some examples of that, but in the main precious few that really matter.Instead, what we are witnessing now is an ever-more clearly defined demarcation line between those nations able and those less able to cope. The ladder is undeniably being hauled up behind the latter. It has become a tale of two pandemics, not one in which we can claim any longer to be ldquoall in this together.David Pratt is Contributing Foreign Editor.

The Michelin star has brought great joy and while it was disappointing that we couldnrsquot share it with people at the time in lockdown, it makes it all the more exciting when we do open the doors and welcome people in, said Ms McNee, who trained with the late Andrew Fairlie at his two Michelin star restaurant at the five star Gleneagles hotel.ldquoI donrsquot think there is any feeling like it having a Michelin star. It is amazing and for me as a young chef starting out that is what I strived for. It is quite surreal.ldquoReopening will be about a celebration and it is a time when people will once again be able to mark important milestones and come together in a way they have not be able to recently. It is not just about making great food, it is about being able to bring people into the restaurant and to start to enjoy themselves again.Read more: Covid Scotland: Pandemic set to open floodgates for damages claims, says legal expertWhile diners have still be able to connect with Cail Bruich through the hugely successful dine at home menus, reopening as a Michelin star restaurant while undoubtedly spark a lot of interest.ldquoI think we will get a iety of people through our doors. There are people who travel to Michelin star restaurants from all over the UK, we have our loyal customers and then there might be people in the Glasgow area who havenrsquot had the opportunity to go to a Michelin star restaurant before and will come along, added the -year-old from Morayshire. ldquoWe know that what we do wonrsquot be to everyonersquos tastes, but there will be people who will want to come now because we have the Michelin star.Congratulations came in from the Glasgow hospitality industry and further afield when the announcement was made. There was also messages from fellow Michelin starred chefs now that Ms McNee and Cail Bruich have joined the elite club. Following on from the Michelin star, champagne house Krug invited Ms McNee to become an Ambassade, part of a network of top chefs who develop dishes paired with the fine brand.ldquoGlasgow was very supportive of us when we received the award and we had lots of lovely messages,\" said the head chef who was just five months into her new role when they were awarded the star. \"We really felt that the city had got behind us. The Michelin star is a great boost to the city and the hospitality industry in Glasgow. It can make others more competitive and to strive to be as good as they can and it also made people happy that someone had brought a Michelin star back to the city.Menu planning has been underway for some time and the restaurant opened its reservation book last Friday, April , to welcome people back on Wednesday May . And while not giving too many secrets away, there is a little hint of what diners can expect.Ms McNee added: ldquoIt will be a tasting menu we have on offer when we reopen. There wonrsquot be a massive change, but we want to continually get better and better in everything we do.ldquoWhen we closed our doors before lockdown, it was autumn and as someone who is passionate about seasonal produce, so the menu is going to reflect summer and late spring. Scottish asparagus will be in season when we open so expect to see that on the menu along with langoustines which are my absolute favourite. We are also experimenting with duck dishes and how long we are going to age it.ldquoThe team have been tasters, from the kitchen to front of house. Their input and opinion is important. With young chefs they might not have a fully developed palate yet so it is about bringing them on and with front of house it is important they know about the suppliers, how it tastes, to be able to help diners make their informed choice.The Cail Bruich team already had a good relationship with suppliers in the area and across Scotland when they were awarded the Michelin star, but it did lead to some people getting in touch with them direct.ldquoThere have been some places who got in touch such as Blackthorn Scottish Sea Salt [from Ayrshire] who sent their product which is phenomenal. So we will be using that because I think it is a great product and offers something in terms of taste.When bookings opened on Friday, general manager Chris Donnachie said they werenrsquot quite sure what to expect following lockdown closures. However, they werenrsquot left disappointed as by the end of the day they were fully booked to near the end of June, the period of time they had opened bookings up for.ldquoI think there was a little apprehension as we had been closed for some months now, but the response has been quite unbelievable, said Mr Donnachie. ldquoWe are fully booked through to near the end of June which was the point we wanted to get to as covid restrictions may well ease further from then.ldquoWhen Cail Bruich was awarded the Michelin star earlier this year, we would have loved to have been able to open the next day to mark that but it was a time of lockdown. Such a huge part of what we do and revel in is the social interaction with our guests. Scotland has such a warmth in the sense of its hospitality and we love providing that experience.Working in partnership with Scottish brands to develop their own offerings has seen Cail Bruich work with Glasgow-based The Garden Shed Drinks Company to stock their own gin, a collaboration with beer firm Pilot and they are also planning to stock their own tonic water through a link up with Walter Gregorrsquos handcrafted tonic firm.As for the future the Cail Bruich team believe a second Michelin star is not an unrealistic expectation and they have also added to the team with the addition of two new front of house staff and two new kitchen staff.ldquoWhen we reopen we want to smash it out the park and exceed expectations and we certainly do have aspirations for a second star, added Mr Donnachie. ldquoWe believe we have the capability to do that with a fantastic team."},{"url":null,"title":"iain-macwhirter-referendum-wont-happen-neither-side-wants-one","story":"Boring because there has been no contest ndash everyone knows the winner already. Signicant because it could mean the end of the United Kingdom. At least, that is the view of the London media. The reality is both boring and signicant: there is not going to be a referendum because neither side actually wants one right now.Curiously, the expectation of a referendum seems to be greater in Westminster than in Holyrood. Weve been hearing muffled cries of panic from Whitehall for months. Former Cabinet Office mandarins like Ciaran Martin insist that following this victory for the parties of independence there is ldquono democratically legitimate basis to refuse a referendum. Boris Johnson is still minded to say ldquonow is not the time, but his constitutional insecurity is demonstrated by the fact that hes afraid to show his face in Scotland to defend the Union at this critical juncture.There is talk of a court challenge against the SNPs forthcoming independence bill. Thatsthe Scottish Government doesnt get there first. Theres also going to be ldquobillions on road and rail spending with a Union Flag on it ndash even a ldquofixed crossing to Northern Ireland, or so were told. The Internal Market Act will allow the UK Government to spend over the heads of Holyrood and win hearts and minds. Well, perhaps.Read more: WhatBoris Johnson rejects second referendum Yet curiously, Nicola Sturgeon has insisted that this election ldquois not about independence. The very idea! Its about her ldquosensible leadership and recovery from Covid, under the only political leader who seems to want the job. A referendum will not happen until ldquothe crisis is over, which could be many years since the economic Covid crisis has yet to begin.This may seem like a remarkable about-face for the SNP leader. For the past two years, she has talked of little  but a referendum on independence. Even Covid was expressed in constitutional terms: ldquoAn independence referendum is an essential priority, she said repeatedly,Scotland was to build back better after the pandemic.As recently as November, her Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, insisted that there would a referendum ldquonext year by which he meant . The Constitution Secretary, Michael Russell, said in January that the referendum would happen by Christmas, with or without a Section  Order from Westminster. ldquoThe Franchise Act was approved last year, he said, ldquoso the nuts and bolts are there.Buttomorrows election is really all about ldquoseeking a clear endorsement for a referendum on independence as Ms Sturgeon told parliament in September, you might have thought it would be right up there, centre stage. Yet two words absent from the SNP leaflet that came through my door last week were ldquoindependence and ldquoreferendum. It seems it no longer regards it a necessary precondition for Covid recovery or for keeping Mr Johnsons grasping Brexit hands off the fragile powers of the Scottish Parliament.The UK Government regards all this as devious down-playing of indyref rhetoric, all the better to propel Scotland into holding one. On Saturday, it thinks, she will suddenly declare that this election had ldquoof course been about an independence referendum, and that the mandate for holding one is now unanswerable. Ms Sturgeon will no doubt say something like this, but I dont think that means there will be a referendum on the timescale her minions had been suggesting. Ms Sturgeon isnt a loser, and her recent silence on crucial post-Brexit issues of border, currency and debt betrays her lack of confidence in winning any early referendum.Read more: Sturgeonrsquos border problem could possibly kill Yes vote stone deadThe First Minister made clear this week that she favours turning indyref into a battle in the courts. When ldquothis crisis is over Holyrood will pass a bill declaring a referendum and then defy Westminster to strike it down. Actually, it doesnt have to because no act of Holyrood, especially one on the constitution, can pass without the express endorsement of the UK Parliament.It was clear in the Miller case in  that the UK Supreme Court, which would ultimately decide this matter, takes a maximalist view of parliamentary sovereignty. It believes that Westminster can safely ignore any act of the Scottish Parliament. The Sewel Convention, which supposedly requires Westminster to consent to acts of Holyrood, is just that: a convention. The constitution is one of the reserved powers retained at Westminster under the  Scotland Act.In response, the Scottish Governments lawyers will argue that, while Holyrood cannot legislate for a legally-binding referendum on independence, it can legislate for and hold a consultative referendum. Ms Sturgeon has long accepted that a full-fat referendum would require a Section  Order from Westminster, but an indy-lite plebiscite, just asking the views of Scottish voters, is probably within Holyroods powers. Local authorities are empowered to hold referendums on water privatisation and road pricing, so why shouldnt Holyrood Whether she would actually want such a non-binding referendum is of course another matter. I seriously doubtshe would because it would likely be meaningless. Since it carries no constitutional weight, most unionists would likely boycott it. It would be like the  Catalonian referendum in which  per cent voted Yes on a % turnout. It might carry even less meaning than a series of opinion polls, which are probably a more accurate reflection of what Scotland actually thinks.So why bother with pursuing this through the courts  Well, perhaps because it would be a way of parking the whole independence issue. Indeed, fighting a phoney war about a referendum that will never happen might suit both sides. Passions would overflow in the synthetic world of social media while lawyers exchanged abstruse formulations of a problem that doesnt actually exist about a referendum that would never happen.Its something a French post-modernist, like Jean Baudrillard would instantly recognise: a meta-battle fought over signs and signiers of independence rather than self-government itself.

Throughout the campaign, Nicola Sturgeon has made much of her being the only serious contender for First Minister while opposition leaders have conceded that their focus is on securing second place.Every poll conducted during the campaign and for many months prior has pointed to an SNP victory less certain is whether the party can repeat its feat of  by securing the  seats needed for an overall majority, thus giving the party the strongest possible mandate to push for a second independence referendum in the next few years.This poll indicates that may still happen, suggesting an overall majority albeit by just two seats with the party tallying . Interestingly it also suggests that the SNP may achieve that milestone by virtue of the constituency part of the ballot alone, gaining  of the  seats available in that part of the election.Ironically of course this means that the emergence of new parties to try and encourage voters to use their regional list vote more tactically may prove to be mootthe SNP can govern as a majority administration.But eventhat does not happen this poll, putting Alba at % on the regional list ballot, suggests that the party of the former First Minister Alex Salmond is not poised to make any signicant breakthrough in terms of the independence lsquosuper majorityrsquo it craves.At % on the constituency ballot and % on the regional list, this poll follows the pattern of surveys from last weekend which suggest an uptick in SNP support following some more modest polls for the party where its vote share fell to around % on the constituency and % on the regional list, a result which would leave them short of a majority.:Dumbarton constituency profile as Holyroods tightest fightThe SNP mantra in the closing stages of the campaign is to reinforce its message to voters about the leadership of Nicola Sturgeon and it is true that her approval ratings signicantly outperform those of the other party leaders.

Read MoreCentenary poll: % in Northern Ireland want referendum but would not accept higher taxes to fund reunicationCentenary poll suggests only % of people in Northern Ireland consider Irish language to be importantEsmond Birnie:OpinionOur economy needs recuperation, not a constitutional shockThe Union would be better served by making strong economic arguments for its preservation, rather than politicians heading down the rabbit hole of poking their noses into people#s bedrooms and private lives.Our poll findings suggests that nationalists have a job of work to do to make a strong financial case for a united Ireland, although that is certainly not an impossible task.!fordocument.querySelectortThe Scottish Government produced a -page white paper laying out the case for independence in . There is no sign that a similarly comprehensive blueprint is on the horizon from nationalists here.Our poll indicates that the strongest argument unionists could employ is that Irish unity would hit people in their pockets on both sides of the border.More than half in Northern Ireland think they#d be worse off with just % believing they#d prosper. But % of people were unsure, meaning that the economic arguments on both sides really need to be formed and aired.!fordocument.querySelectortIn the Republic, four in  thought they#d be worse off in a united Ireland, one in five disagreed, and a staggering % didn#t know. If RTE hasn#t already planned it, another Claire Byrne Live to shed light on this part of the debate would be warmly welcomed.A majority on both sides of the border said they wouldn#t be prepared to pay more taxes to fund Irish unity.!fordocument.querySelectortNorthern Ireland currently receives a £bn annual subvention from Westminster. Almost half of people in the Republic said they#d match thator pay some of it . A third were totally opposed to doing so.But the £bn figure is disputed. It#s the UK statistical calculation that encompasses costs which nationalists believe wouldn#t transfer to a new united Ireland. Those costs include UK government debt interest, contributions to the UK armed forces and pension liabilities.!fordocument.querySelectortStill, Northern Ireland#s low cost of living and high number of public sector jobs will be extremely successful weaponsunionists are forced to do battle in a border poll.The jewel in the crown will of course be the NHS. Six in  voters here would be uncomfortable about transferring to the Republic#s health service.Changing it to a system similar to the NHS with free access and no prescription charges would surely be essential for nationalists in a future referendum. The British Treasury footing the bill during the pandemic for the furlough scheme also gives unionists strong ammunition.However, nationalists will be able to use Northern Ireland#s poor infrastructure, low wages, and very small private sector in their arguments. They will also suggest that considerable economic opportunities and potential investment could open up in the event of Irish unity.This poll gives Irish unity campaigners many reasons to pause for thought. Yet it also counters claims made by those who oppose constitutional change. The idea that the south doesn#t want the north is contradicted.More than two-thirds of people in the Republic support Irish unity with just % against.In Northern Ireland, there was a clear pro-Union lead - % to %, with % undecided.Some % of people here want a border poll compared to % opposed in the Republic two-thirds want one. Among referendum supporters, seven in  on both sides of the border want one now or within five years. Those figures suggest that the Taoiseach, who has dragged his feet on the issue and ruled out a border poll in coming years, is out of step with voters.The th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement in  is the date many nationalists are now speaking of for a referendum.The economic recovery of both the UK and the Republic post-pandemic will be key to the unity debate. If one state fares remarkably better than the other that will sway a signicant amount of Northern Ireland voters.Belfast Most ReadBobby Sands burial wishes ignored in favour of ‘politically beneficial’ Belfast funeralUTV’s Jane Loughrey goes from poacher to gamekeeper as she lands new job with South Eastern Health Trust#£ a pint#: Northern Ireland consumers foot the bill as retailers try to recoup lossesDerry Sinn Fein MLAs Martina Anderson and Karen Mullan stepping downIt’s personal: Former MLA Hussey in spat with Sir Jeffrey Donaldson over DUP leadership contender’s UUP departureTop VideosPlaySir Jeffrey Donaldson announces DUP leadership bidPlayTrial of two veterans accused of IRA leader murder collapsesPlayPro-united Ireland poster removed from Divis Tower in Belfast Latest The CentenaryThree young voices... why I feel Northern Irish, why I feel British and why I feel IrishCentenary poll: Public ided on terror amnesties as pardons for terrorists and troops leave people tornSuzanne BreenOpinionNorthern Ireland#s a powderkeg... but will of people must always prevailCentenary poll: #Irish unity would jeopardise peace in Northern Ireland# - survey confirms hardening of views in unionist communityCentenary poll: People from NI more likely to cross Irish border than southern counterparts LatestLine of Duty writer Jed Mercurio hits back at ‘exaggerated’ online disappointment to final episodeOle Gunnar Solskjaer felt protest by Manchester United fans went ‘too far’Mapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed Covid cases in your area and seven day rolling average outsiders hoping to make British and Irish Lions squad for South Africa tourDetectives investigating murder of PCSO Julia James release image,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Those who favour a united Ireland have responded in a number of ways to this situation:Deny the figures - yes, about £bn of the transfer is an attributing to NI of spending done by the UK central government . But, in a united Ireland surely some of such spending would continue Claim taxes could rise - they could, but, as this poll shows, there would be considerable opposition to that, especially in the Republic.Claim public spending in NI could be scaled back - it is one thing to argue our public sector is too large in relative terms, but any sudden adjustment would probably provoke a major recession. Claim a united Ireland could out-grow the problem - true, in recent years the Republic#s economic growth rate has surpassed that in NI, even discounting the tax-avoiding behaviour of multinationals, but can we really assume that unity per se would have a sudden transformative impact on NI#s economic performance Claim that the Dublin government could borrow to keep NI afloat - at the moment, interest rates are very low, but that won#t always be true.Argue that the UK Government would leave its cheque book behind - in the s, the London government wrote off the Irish Free State#s obligation for part of the UK#s public debt, but can we really imagine a UK government being so generous as to wipe out debt and continue to pay for some welfare benefitsand subsidise NI#s infrastructure To be fair, this existence of the big fiscal deficit is also problematic for unionists. They could claim other UK regions have deficits. They do, but none are so large. They could try to argue this is a form of UK solidarity payment, but will that really wash with taxpayers in south-east England The biggest danger is that a long-term dependency on subsidy from Great Britain has actually distorted economic behaviour. As RHI exemplied, free money trumps making necessary reforms.One particularly interesting area of Northern Ireland-Republic comparisons is healthcare: a major focus of the Kantar Belfastpoll.The south uses a mixture of state provision and private insurance. The polling response shows a very strong preferences in NI to continue with the NHS model. That said, the advantages of free at the point of use are blunted by our ening waiting lists.OECD data implies healthcare spending per person in the Republic now exceeds that in NI and the UK average.Of course, as indicated by US experience, very high spending does not necessarily bring better quality. We know the dference in Covid vaccination rates.To finish with a health analogy, for all its points of strength, the NI economy remains in need of intensive care - a period of recuperation, rather than a major constitutional shock is probably the priority.Dr Esmond Birnie is senior economist at Ulster UniversityBelfast Most ReadBobby Sands burial wishes ignored in favour of ‘politically beneficial’ Belfast funeralUTV’s Jane Loughrey goes from poacher to gamekeeper as she lands new job with South Eastern Health TrustDerry Sinn Fein MLAs Martina Anderson and Karen Mullan stepping down#£ a pint#: Northern Ireland consumers foot the bill as retailers try to recoup lossesIt’s personal: Former MLA Hussey in spat with Sir Jeffrey Donaldson over DUP leadership contender’s UUP departureTop VideosPlaySir Jeffrey Donaldson announces DUP leadership bidPlayTrial of two veterans accused of IRA leader murder collapsesPlayPro-united Ireland poster removed from Divis Tower in Belfast Latest The CentenaryThree young voices... why I feel Northern Irish, why I feel British and why I feel IrishCentenary poll: Public ided on terror amnesties as pardons for terrorists and troops leave people tornSuzanne BreenOpinionNorthern Ireland#s a powderkeg... but will of people must always prevailCentenary poll: #Irish unity would jeopardise peace in Northern Ireland# - survey confirms hardening of views in unionist communityCentenary poll: People from NI more likely to cross Irish border than southern counterparts LatestLine of Duty writer Jed Mercurio hits back at ‘exaggerated’ online disappointment to final episodeMalian woman gives birth to nine babies – having expected sevenUK hits out at ‘unacceptable’ French threats to sever Jersey’s powerKathleen Thompson inquest: Former soldiers seek to be excused giving evidenceOle Gunnar Solskjaer felt protest by Manchester United fans went ‘too far’,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

So Ill be in the kitchen prepping on Christmas Eve and then the dinner will be cooked and delivered on Christmas Day for anyone who’s alone or in need of one.Last year we actually had some spare meals left over so I went and delivered them up to the Fire Station, which was the highlight of my Christmas, she said.Paula has been provided with the names of people in the local community who would benefit from the scheme by the Operation Snowball at the OLT and staff at the Long Tower Youth Club.This service is free of charge of course, soyou or someone you know needs help this Christmas please send me a message to the Peggys Kitchen Facebook page,continued Ms Monk. googletag.cmd.push Last year we covered the cost of it ourselves, apart from the desserts, but this year Foyle Fruit have kindly offered to donate the potatoes and vegetables and we have also had donations of containers and cups. All donations are welcome andanyone wishes to help our efforts that help would be much appreciated.Ms Monk has enlisted the help of two delivery drivers to take the food to the Bogside, Brandywell and Creggan areas of the city.Like all cafes, Peggys Kitchen is closed at the moment due to current restrictions.Its sad that we cant open because we really miss our customers like the Over s Club that used to meet here every Wednesday and for a lot of them it was their only source of interaction but the safety of everyone needs to come first, said Ms Monk. googletag.cmd.push We cant wait to reopen again but until then please keep safe.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A series of  local stories are also included in the book, which gives a flavour of the areas native wit and ability to find humour in all situations. Originally from Killetra, near The Loup, Oacute Daacutela an Riacute said the book is a unique linguistic record. “This essential book will be a godsend for anyone intending to visit this famed region, just a good stretch a the legs from the City of Derry,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “It may also cause those from the area covered to scratch their heads in disbelief at the way they speak to one another, but carry on regardless with a wry smile. “In a world of increasing homogenization, Loughshore Lingo will stand as a valuable and detailed record of the lingual idiosyncrasies to be found in one small part of Ulster. “It might also make you laugh until you cry, and hiccup until you eventually pass out.” Ballinderry is one of the Loughshore villages on which the book centres.

Loughshore Lingo, by poet and writer Antaacuten Oacute Daacutela an Riacute, contains more than  alphabetical entries documenting the unique phrases and sayings of Lough Neaghs western shores. A series of  local stories are also included in the book, which gives a flavour of the areas native wit and ability to find humour in all situations. Originally from Killetra, near The Loup, Oacute Daacutela an Riacute said the book is a unique linguistic record. “This essential book will be a godsend for anyone intending to visit this famed region, just a good stretch a the legs from the City of Derry,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “It may also cause those from the area covered to scratch their heads in disbelief at the way they speak to one another, but carry on regardless with a wry smile. “In a world of increasing homogenization, Loughshore Lingo will stand as a valuable and detailed record of the lingual idiosyncrasies to be found in one small part of Ulster. “It might also make you laugh until you cry, and hiccup until you eventually pass out.” Ballinderry is one of the Loughshore villages on which the book centres. The following is an extract from one of the books many tales A Toast to Eternal Rest. googletag.cmd.push “Two local wags were carefully navigating their way home after closing time having enjoyed the free-flowing hospitality of a neighbouring licensed premises,” it reads. “With a thirst for more drink upon them, they approached the darkened form of the parish pub, above which resided the sleeping proprietor and his family. “After throwing stones at his bedroom window, the two managed to waken the weary innkeeper. “We just wanted to tell you that poor John James has gone to his rest, they exclaimed with grief-laden voices. “The landlord expressed shock and dismay at such a turn of events and immediately rushed downstairs, whereupon he admitted the messengers and set them up a whiskey each.     “After a few respectable minutes of quiet reflection the pub owner decided to tackle the elephant in the room. “So, when did John James die  he tenderly enquired. “Die , said one, We never said he was dead, only that hed gone to his rest. He went to bed about an hour ago. “They didnt get to finish their drinks.” Loughshore Lingo is available to purchase on eBay, Facebook Marketplace and via the online shop of Rebel Voice magazine, priced at pound..  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

His daughter and SDLP Causeway Coast and Glens councillor, Helena Dallat OrsquoDriscoll, reflects on the past year.Just weeks before my fathers passing, with the COVID death toll rising, Northern Ireland had entered lockdown in a bid to limit the spread of coronavirus. The Health Minister, Robin Swann, had described the potential scale of the impending surge as being of biblical proportions and for the next year, people would live a new normal - no unnecessary journeys, no mixing with other households, working from homepossible and many other restrictions on daily le. Two days after the announcement of the restrictions, we were hit with the news that my father’s cancer treatment had met an unexpected twist and he had weeks to live. googletag.cmd.push Like many families in Northern Ireland, we were to care for and say goodbye to a loved one in lockdown. It is hard to believe that a year has passed since dad died, in some ways time has stood still. I think most families bereaved in the last year will be experiencing a similar feeling. A lack of closure comes with a lockdown death, especiallyrestrictions were at their height. Although a small number of us were privileged to be with dad at the moment he died, we missed the rituals that we had all come to expect as normal. googletag.cmd.push As a society, we have such a respect for the dead and the bereaved, regardless of culture or faith but COVID upended all those customs and comforting gestures. As was the case for many families, we had no wake and we were unable to keep his remains at home. We didn’t carry his coffin. The church was almost empty for his funeral. The only physical touch at his graveside was from our very immediate family. From that moment, I realised that, even as a mum of two tactile daughters, I had totally underestimated physical touch and how it comforts and modulates emotions.     Having no visitors in the months following a death also adds to the feeling of isolation and I have felt particularly for those who might be living in remote areas or who don’t have their families close by.  All things considered, we were one of the luckier families. Although there was a feeling of isolation and loneliness due to the restrictions, at least the conditions were sufficiently safe for us to be with dad at the end. Thanks to first-class medical care from his consultant, our GPs, district nurses, carers and our NI Hospice community hospice nurse, we were able to care for him at home. Our community hospice nurse, in particular, taught us invaluable lessons. We quickly learned about symptom assessment and pain relief but also the preciousness of le and how to let someone with so precious little time left live as fully as possible until the end. He also died with nothing important left unsaid. Many other families never got a chance to nurse or say goodbye to their loved ones because of COVID circumstances and I find that unimaginably heartbreaking. It was a first lesson in just how vital our hospice services are. However, despite their critical nature, their futures are frequently faced with uncertainty. The demands on our palliative and end-of-le care services are steadily increasing but funding has not kept pace. The present funding methodology is flawed and operates without evidence base or up-to-date benchmarks. Last week at Stormont, cross-party support was achieved for the inclusion of death, dying and bereavement in the Programme for Government and I very much welcome that. It is progress but we have a long way to go. We need to give much more sustainable support to our end-of-le care providers. We must not forget that these organisations are lting the burden from the NHS which is why core funding is so important. Given the exceptional nature of this year, there is also a need for additional mental health resources to help deal with COVID’s psychological toll, especially for those grieving in our rural areas and those who have a limited network of support. This pandemic has reminded us that palliative and end-of-le care is a vitally important part of our care system and I believe it has opened up an important conversation around dying and bereavement.  Grief is a normal, albeit sad and challenging, part of le. We will all experience the pain of losing a loved one at some point. However, I believe there is no doubt that the current pandemic has posed unprecedented challenges to the grieving process, setting the stage for more complex and prolonged reactions for many who have lost loved ones.

His daughter and SDLP Causeway Coast and Glens councillor, Helena Dallat OrsquoDriscoll, reflects on the past year.Just weeks before my fathers passing, with the COVID death toll rising, Northern Ireland had entered lockdown in a bid to limit the spread of coronavirus. The Health Minister, Robin Swann, had described the potential scale of the impending surge as being of biblical proportions and for the next year, people would live a new normal - no unnecessary journeys, no mixing with other households, working from homepossible and many other restrictions on daily le. Two days after the announcement of the restrictions, we were hit with the news that my father’s cancer treatment had met an unexpected twist and he had weeks to live. googletag.cmd.push Like many families in Northern Ireland, we were to care for and say goodbye to a loved one in lockdown. It is hard to believe that a year has passed since dad died, in some ways time has stood still. I think most families bereaved in the last year will be experiencing a similar feeling. A lack of closure comes with a lockdown death, especiallyrestrictions were at their height. Although a small number of us were privileged to be with dad at the moment he died, we missed the rituals that we had all come to expect as normal. googletag.cmd.push As a society, we have such a respect for the dead and the bereaved, regardless of culture or faith but COVID upended all those customs and comforting gestures. As was the case for many families, we had no wake and we were unable to keep his remains at home. We didn’t carry his coffin. The church was almost empty for his funeral. The only physical touch at his graveside was from our very immediate family. From that moment, I realised that, even as a mum of two tactile daughters, I had totally underestimated physical touch and how it comforts and modulates emotions.     Having no visitors in the months following a death also adds to the feeling of isolation and I have felt particularly for those who might be living in remote areas or who don’t have their families close by.  All things considered, we were one of the luckier families. Although there was a feeling of isolation and loneliness due to the restrictions, at least the conditions were sufficiently safe for us to be with dad at the end. Thanks to first-class medical care from his consultant, our GPs, district nurses, carers and our NI Hospice community hospice nurse, we were able to care for him at home. Our community hospice nurse, in particular, taught us invaluable lessons. We quickly learned about symptom assessment and pain relief but also the preciousness of le and how to let someone with so precious little time left live as fully as possible until the end. He also died with nothing important left unsaid. Many other families never got a chance to nurse or say goodbye to their loved ones because of COVID circumstances and I find that unimaginably heartbreaking. It was a first lesson in just how vital our hospice services are. However, despite their critical nature, their futures are frequently faced with uncertainty. The demands on our palliative and end-of-le care services are steadily increasing but funding has not kept pace. The present funding methodology is flawed and operates without evidence base or up-to-date benchmarks. Last week at Stormont, cross-party support was achieved for the inclusion of death, dying and bereavement in the Programme for Government and I very much welcome that. It is progress but we have a long way to go. We need to give much more sustainable support to our end-of-le care providers. We must not forget that these organisations are lting the burden from the NHS which is why core funding is so important. Given the exceptional nature of this year, there is also a need for additional mental health resources to help deal with COVID’s psychological toll, especially for those grieving in our rural areas and those who have a limited network of support. This pandemic has reminded us that palliative and end-of-le care is a vitally important part of our care system and I believe it has opened up an important conversation around dying and bereavement.  Grief is a normal, albeit sad and challenging, part of le. We will all experience the pain of losing a loved one at some point. However, I believe there is no doubt that the current pandemic has posed unprecedented challenges to the grieving process, setting the stage for more complex and prolonged reactions for many who have lost loved ones. My SDLP colleagues and I will continue to press for more sustainable provision for the dying and bereaved and call for urgent, additional resources to tackle the poor mental health some of our bereaved families are likely to suffer as a result of loss in what have been traumatic conditions.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Harps wasted no time in making their intentions known and they could have had the ball in the net within two minutes following a well-worked move. Dave Webster’s pass forward was flicked on by Adam Foley into the feet of Karl O’Sullivan on the right, and his cross was met by the incoming Barry McNamee who side-footed the ball just wide of Nathan Gartside’s goal. googletag.cmd.push Harps were bright in the opening stages, yet it was Derry City who took the lead on  minutes with their first shot on goal. Will Patching picked up the ball in his own half on the left wing and played a superb ball in behind the Harps defence for James Akintunde. The forward still had work to do, but he cut inside two Harps defenders before curling a brilliant shot beyond Mark McGinley into the corner of the net to make it -. The goal was just what Derry needed and they came close to doubling their lead within minutes when Patching picked up the ball  yards from goal and curled an effort towards the net, but this time McGinley pushed it away to safety. googletag.cmd.push There was a really intense battle in the middle in what was a really congested midfield, and Derry knew they were in a fight, with Harps players not letting them settle for a second on the ball. Harps nearly equalised, an in spectacular fashion, when Will Seymour collected the ball  yards out and drilled the ball at Gartside’s goal, the City goalkeeper beaten and relieved to see it smack off the top of his crossbar. Harps kept the intensity up and they equalised  minutes into the second half. A McNamee free kick into the area found Webster, whose close-range header was pushed away by Gartside, but only to the edge of the area where Karl O’Sullivan drilled it goalwards, and the ball sliced off Cameron McJannett and ended up in the net.     Harps were full of belief now, but the goal sparked Derry into action, and not for the first time this season, McJannett found himself in an advanced position, drilling a low shot goalwards on his left foot, forcing McGinley to push the ball behind for a corner. Derry City came so close to winning the game with just five minutes remaining, when Will Fitzgerald battled to keep possession on the edge of the Harps area, and he played Jack Malone trough on goal, but, under intense pressure, the midfielder smacked a shot off the post and Harps survived. That proved a crucial moment as Harps snatched the points with a winner just one minute from time, when Barry McNamee played in Foley, who drilled it low past Gartside to seal a memorable win for Ollie Horgan’s side.  Teams DERRY CITY: Gartside, Lafferty, Toal, McJannett, Boyce, Harkin , Thompson , Barr , Patching, Fitzgerald, Akintunde. FINN HARPS: McGinley, Sadiki, Webster , Owolabi , Folan, O’Sullivan, McNamee , Coyle, Russell, Seymore, Foley.

The bars had been planning to open for outdoor eating and drinking as part of the latest easing of Covid- restrictions. However, they have now been told that they cannot reopen due to guidelines what constitutes an outdoor space. The Department of Health said the general rule of thumb is that outdoor premises should not be more than % enclosed. The definition of enclosed and substantially enclosed comes from the smoke-free legislation from  and is directly referenced in the restriction regulations, a spokesperson said. This was the same definition that was in place since last July and is not part of the recent amendments which will allow outdoor hospitality to open from  April. googletag.cmd.push Among the local pubs impacted are the Magnet Bar at Culmore, Molly Malones in Ballymagroarty and the Happy Landing in Eglinton. They have had to inform customers that they will not be able honour bookings made for Friday. These pubs will now have to wait until May  when indoor bars will be allowed to reopen. Colin Neill, the chief executive of Hospitality Ulster, said the interpretation of regulations was far too stringent. The idea of outdoor [hospitality] being opened again is meaninglessonly a relatively small number of venues can actually make it work, he said. Many will have prepared for reopening by buying thousands of pounds worth of stock to replenish their empty bars, only to be told that their set up does not meet the regulations, despite being open to the same standard in previous failed reopening phases. googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Mid Ulster MLA Patsy McGlone has welcomed the financial support and has urged DAERA Minister Edwin Poots not to delay payments any longer than necessary.

This marks the latest stage of the easing of the coronavirus restrictions. Hospitality businesses can also reopen but must only operate outdoors, with table service and limited numbers per table. Gyms and swimming pools, including those based in leisure centres, can only open for inidual training or for one-to-one coaching with a personal trainer. Restrictions on meeting up outside have also been slightly further eased, with  people from three households allowed to meet in a private garden. Earlier closing times for takeaway businesses and off-licences have also been removed. googletag.cmd.push Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Cllr BrianTierney, has asked the public to support local businesses as more prepare to reopen today. He said that it has been an incredibly challenging year for so many businesses within the district, and he asked that the public do what they can to support them while also adhering to health guidelines. I know there will be many businesses across our city and district really excited to open their doors today after a turbulent and dficult past year. I hope that everyone will support those businesses in the weeks and months ahead as they try toto normality, said MayorTierney. googletag.cmd.push In doing so, I would ask everyone to please make sure theyre following the health guidelines in place including wearing a face mask where required and always maintaining social distancing. It really is brilliant to see businesses reopen, but we also have to be mindful that the COVID- virus is still in our community so the best way that we can help our local businesses is by following the guidelines while in stores and out and about.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It is new ground and it will take time to adapt.Through his underage, ODoherty was often balancing school, club and county action. “You know what is happening and when it is happening,” he said. “It is set in stone, you will see going forwardit is successful and hopefully it is.“It is a dferent mindset. Players grew up playing dferent sports and it was every night of the week...it is something you got used to. “It is a bit of an adjustment, it is good to have that focus where you can give all that energy to one team.

In March , Derry City and Strabane District Councils planning committee refusedClanmil Housing Association permission to build a four-storey complex comprised of  apartments at Victoria Road. However, Clanmil appealed the decision and it has now been overturned. Local planning officers had described the location as ‘possibly the most dficult regeneration site’ in the city. However, the officers had recommended that councillors approve the application for the Victoria Road apartments as the application was ‘entirely compliant’. In their report, planning officers stated that they believed it would reinvigorate the riverfront land and put an end to anti-social behaviour at the site. googletag.cmd.push  Among the objections raised by councillors had been that there was no parking provided within the plans for the Victoria Road apartments. At the meeting in March , local councillors said they believed a parking ban ‘discriminated’ against people with disabilities. At last year’s meeting, Hugh Hegarty from the Victoria Park Residents Group said the apartment complex design looked like a ‘horric brutalist East German style eyesore’. Mr Hegarty said pollution and parking problems would be exacerbatedresidents were to park on Spencer Road and Duke Street. A lack of space in the area has already resulted in ‘hazardous parking’ on Victoria Road and he envisaged problems at the site with numerous couriers and taxis arriving. googletag.cmd.push In response, a representative for Clanmil said it is a ‘highly accessible’ location with bus stops and train travel nearby. The housing association claimed that the design respects the history of the site, the city’s shirt factory heritage and complements existing buildings. A report by the Planning Appeals Commission into the matter has now found that the objections were not sustained and overturned the decision to refuse planning permission. The decision to overturn the councils refusal decision has been criticised by local rail campaigners, Into the West. The land at Victoria Road was previously part of the Derry to Strabane railway line which closed in .     Into the West has been campaigning for the line to be reopened and they have described the decision to allow the apartment complex to be built on the site as a disaster. A building there will make it impossible to restore a railway line along that route in future – making it extremely unlikely we will ever see rail from Derry to Strabane or Letterkenny again, said Steve Bradley, chair of Into the West. Without a route to Strabane, there can be no direct rail services form Derry or Donegal to Dublin. And as Derry has a bigger population than every other town on the former Derry-Portadown rail route,our city can no longer be included in that proposed reopening then the viability of restoring rail to places like Omagh, Strabane, Enniskillen, Dungannon and Letterkenny also collapses. In short – building  apartments in that location will destroy any future for rail across the west of Ulster and prevent it being ed to Tyrone, Donegal and Fermanagh.

The book is called Our Days and Nights. In the final few months of , Tracey McRory, a project worker with Inishowen Development Partnership , gathered people from Derry and Inishowen to take part in a cross-border reminiscence programme jointly facilitated by Anne Tracey and Eamonn Baker. Tracey said: “We would have loved to have delivered this programme face-to-face but such gatherings proved impossible due to the lockdown restrictions. “Zoom worked better than we could have hoped however. “Participants—there were thirty and more- told us that even though they were meeting ‘through screens’, they really valued the human connections that grew from the storytelling, the recall, the craic and the song.” googletag.cmd.push “These zoom sessions were, by agreement, recorded, the audio faithfully transcribed by Kirstie Wright and then edited by Anne, Eamonn and myself to create a brand new publication ‘Our Days and Nights’. “It features many of the family stories, tall tales, faery stories, ghost stories, reminiscences, song lyrics, photos shared by participants during the autumn months of .” Tracey said that Anne Tracey, as well as being a highly regarded psychologist and counsellor, is also a noted singer. “Her singing brought an extra dimension of warmth to the sessions especially where we listened to local songs and remembered the ‘showband’ scene of the sixties and early seventies on both sides of the border. googletag.cmd.push “We also reflected on some tough times – living though the Troubles with shootings and bombs an everyday occurrence crossing the border during those precarious times. “We were privileged to welcome Margo O’Donnell as a special guest during one of the sessions that brought together the Derry and Inishowen groups. “As well as treating us to a couple of songs, Margo spoke about some of the challenges that she has faced in her le. We all felt moved by her openness and honesty. “Our zoom sessions were also graced, by amongst others, Joe Mahon of Lesser Spotted Ulster fame, Irish artists Luka Bloom and Mary Black along with local singer-songwriters Roy Arbuckle and Richard Laird. Local poet Maura Johnston along with author Keith Corcoran and local historian Dessie McCallion.     “One of the participants, Betty Beattie, regaled us with the following poem during one of our sessions. “Betty’s poem underlines the challenges Covid has brought and how human contact can make that vital dference. “I can’t go out, it’s much too wetI can’t stay in, I would just fretAbout the folks I would’ve met for coffee and a chatSo what am I to do I’ll do some household chore, no that won’t do, it’s such a boreI’ve decided just to watch TV, oh no, it’s all shows I’ve seen beforeSo what am I to do Out come the needles, I’ll find something to knitI’ll try on some clothes to seethey still fitOh no, I’m still boredWhat am I to do And then the doorbell ringsIt’s Tilly my friend, and what does she bring A bottle of wine, she says, we will enjoy a few glassesThe time will soon passWe don’t careits gonna rain or shine.” Some limited copies of the new book are available from Inishowen Development Partnership and other copies will be available through the Buncrana Library, Carndonagh Community Library, Free Wee Librariesand all libraries in Derry. Remaining copies will be distributed to local care homes and older people projects to be enjoyed on both sides of the border.For more information about the project, contact tracey@inishowen.ie.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Members of Long Tower Youth Club created the time capsule project to give young people from the area an opportunity to describe how the pandemic has impacted their lives in the past year. More than  children from the youth club and local schools took part in the project. Their stories have been placed in the time capsule which was buried on Friday evening at the play park beside the youth club.

It has been organised by the Outer West Neighbourhood Renewal Partnership in conjunction with the Rosemount Resource Centre. A spokesperson for the organisers of this time capsule said: “The past year has been challenging yet unique in that we have had to change the way we live, work, shop, study and socially interact. “During this time, the community spirit emblematic of the people of Derry has been evermore visible through increased effort, solidarity, and spirit of generosity. “To capture people’s experiences of this unique time we are creating a time-capsule.” googletag.cmd.push The spokesperson said the time-capsule project will create an archive of Covid  and lockdown experiences. “It is hoped that this will give future generations an opportunity to read first-hand testimonies from people of all ages including health care professionals and those who worked on the front line during this time. “The time capsule will be registered with the International Time Capsule Society and will be stored away for thirty years on  May . “Among those who have contributed to the project to date are Bishop Donal McKeown, the President of Ireland Michael D Higgins, the Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill, and Robin Swann Health Minister.     “To participate in this project all you need to do is write a short piece which captures your experiences and drop it in to the Rosemount Resource Centre. “For younger children we have created a template which can be collected from the Rosemount Resource Centre or requested by email.

The proposal, brought by Cllr Aaron Callan of the DUP, seconded by the UUPs Richard Holmes and supported by Alderman Alan Robinson , Cllr Russell Wattonand Independent Cllr McCandless, would see the Union flag flown on the buildings for  days a year. Despitedebate when Limavady, Ballymoney, Coleraine and Moyle councils were merged to form Causeway Coast and Glens, legacy council buildings followed their existing policies, with the flag flying all year round at council headquarters in Cloonavin. googletag.cmd.push Tonights motion is seeking to have the flag flown all year round on all council and civic buildings, with specic reference to Roe Valley Arts and Cultural Centre made within the proposal, which cites new guidelines drawn up by the UK Governments Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport as its foundation. That this Council falls in line with the new guidance published by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport to have the Union flag flown on Council and Civic buildings every day , it reads. Therefore the following buildings would fly the flag in accordance with this policy Coleraine Town Hall, Cloonavin Council Headquarters, Limavady Office , Roe Valley Arts and Cultural Centre, Ballymoney Town Hall, Riada House, Portrush Town Hall and Portstewart Town Hall. googletag.cmd.push This list of buildings will be reviewed on an ongoing basis. The Union Flag is the National Flag of the United Kingdom, and it is so called because it embodies the emblems of the constituent nations united under one Sovereign – the Kingdoms of England and Wales, of Scotland and of Northern Ireland. Over the last few weeks, Mayor Mark Fielding has sent a number of motions, including the proposed memorial to LGBTQ rights campaigner Mark Ashton, to ious committees. He will decidethe motion on flags will be heard tonight or moved to Committee.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I was working on my university dissertation with a friend when my coach phoned me and told me the news. I really went through the motions.Griggs told Hogan that she would be starting in the No  role, not her usual second row position on the pitch.ldquoAdam said that he knew I had to adjust to playing the role but that he was confident that I was capable of doing that, she continued.ldquoDue to the lack of playing time because of Covid- the coach wanted to try me out in dferent field positions to see what Irsquoll suit best.ldquoI knew from my background all the roles the second row has to do. I had been doing some back row work in training but itrsquos a dferent set-up in defence. So I wanted to make sure I knew what I was doing and where I needed to be.The third place decider took place in Donnybrook, Dublin, after the fixture was relocated from Parma due to quarantining issues.ldquoItaly decided to come over to Dublin due to Covid-, which was great of them. That acted as a comfort as I was in similar surroundings when we played France, said Hogan.Ireland started the match strongly, with the game plan of keeping the ball tightly in control until the hour mark. The green and white outfit betted on having the superior stamina over their Italian counterparts which would ultimately help them see off the game comfortably.ldquoWe certainly kept them into the middle of the field throughout the first half, said Hogan.ldquoWe knew coming into the game that we had to be patient andwe wanted the result we needed to be in control until at least  minutes had went on the clock.ldquoWe knew our test fitness is better than Italyrsquos and we would have the legs to get over the line.Ireland faced an early scare when they lost their captain Ciara Grfin to a head injury assessment within the opening quarter of the game. Grfin was subsequently replaced with Hannah OrsquoConnor.ldquoWe had prepared foranyone got a yellow card whilst in training, so when Ciara went off the field we had an idea on how to manage, said Hogan.ldquoWe had Hannah come on the pitch and with her leadership she showed great composure and intelligence. I think we did really well considering we lost our captain.Ireland maintained in control and comfortably seen out the contest to secure third place in this yearrsquos Six Nations. After the final whistle blew Griggs briefly congratulated Hogan on her performance. The local rugby ace said she was lsquomostly happyrsquo with the sht she put in.ldquoIn the first  minutes I made a few silly errors, but i just had to bounce back from that and I was happy with my defensive work.

This generation will not be the one that fails it.Last week, the health minister was asked to provide clarity on the future role of the Downe Hospital with the appeal by South Down MLA Colin McGrath coming after Mr Swann warned that the health service should not be used as a political football in the run-up to next Mayrsquos Assembly elections.He said attempts to rebuild and revitalise the health service in Northern Ireland must not be hijacked by politicians hoping to win votes and called on his Stormont colleagues to support transformation that will result in better patient outcomes.Outlining plans for the health service as the province edges out of lockdown, Mr Swann said it will see more services offered on a regional basis, meaning patients may have to travel further for hospital appointments and operations.The health minister said he believed that a campaign had already started for a long-term commitment to the Downe Hospital, suggesting that it is ldquothis sort of language that then unnerves staff.The health minister said there was ldquonothing more unnerving than social media campaigns for the people who are working in our health service at this minute in time about saving their hospital when their hospital is not under threat.Mr Swann said the health service did not have enough staff and needed more, insisting that ldquonobody is going to be done away with.The health minister added: ldquoWe donrsquot have a big enough footprint so we need every square foot that we have, but it may not be that everybody gets every service that they want delivered on their doorstep..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/28April2021-Danny.jpg","title":"Danny wins jockeys’ title  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK native Danny McMenamin crowned a great season on Saturday at Sandown Park when he was presented with his trophy as thechampion conditional jockey, finishing well clear of his closest rivals.He becomes the latest Northern Ireland jockey to land the title and he was full of praise for Anthony Dobbin, who was responsible for him joining the stable of Nicky Richards, and to his coach, Richardsrsquo former stable jockey, Cork-born Brian Harding.With Downpatrickrsquos next meeting due on May , it would be niceDanny was offered some rides at the venue.

Firefighters also used back pack sprayers but the majority had to use shovels and beaters to tackle the fire in harsh conditions.The environmental impact of the blaze mdash which could be seen up to  miles away mdash is immeasurable as work now starts to draw up plans up for a major conservation restoration programme following the loss of precious wildle habitats.National Trust officials who have surveyed the scale of the damage say they have never seen anything like it before, describing parts of the mountain range as resembling a ldquolunar landscape, estimating that the once rich habitat could take up to five years to recover.Over  firefighters were involved in the battle to contain the blaze with dramatic images captured last Friday night illustrating the scale of the task they faced and making the front pages of major UK newspapers.The following morning, the Fire and Rescue Service declared a major incident as the battle to contain the fire which was destroying everything in its path was ramped up, with firefighters from across Northern Ireland helping out.Firefighters have also been praised for preventing the wildfire from reaching Donard Forest on the slopes of the Mournes by using a blanket of foam as part of a fire break.When the flames were finally put out late on Sunday afternoon, exhausted firefighters who had to carry their equipment to remote locations began to pack up toto their bases after spending many hours working in challenging conditions.One of the driest Aprils on record increased the risk and challenges for those tackling the huge gorse fire with a blanket of smoke engulfing the spectacular mountain range, with the emergency response involving Coastguard helicopters from Dublin and Prestwick which airlted senior fire chiefs to provide them with an aerial view of the raging inferno so they could plan the on-the-ground response.Keen to do its part, the Newcastle community stepped up to help donating food and drink to the emergency services with an appeal launched by schoolboy Charlie Thompson raising over pound, to thank firefighters for their efforts.Stormont environment minister Edwin Poots and health minister Robin Swann were both in Newcastle last weekend to thank firefighters for the work they were doing with senior fire chiefs appealing to people to ensure nothing like this ever happens again.Mr Poots confirmed that the damage to the arearsquos rich bioersity spread over three and a half square kilometres could potentially take years to recover and said he was ldquoheart-broken and sickened by the events which unfolded last Friday night.ldquoIt is hard to grasp the scale of the fire and the devastation that occurred. While we do not know the full scale of the impact of the fire at this stage, we do know that it will be signicant for the environment and tourism economy that thrives on the unique natural beauty of this renowned area, he added.South Down MP Chris Hazzard described images of the fire encircling the Mournes as ldquoshocking and said confirmation the blaze was deliberate ldquosickens you to the heart of your stomach someone would be so reckless to skulk about in the middle of the night to set fire ti such a precious environmental habitat.He declared: ldquoMake no mistake, these arsonists should be dealt with in the exact same way asthey had set fire to a public building.Mr Hazzard also said it was not enough for the environment minister to ldquomaybe introduce fines for such behaviour.He said there was also a need for better management of the Mournes, highlighting the need for increased finances to be provided to the Mourne Heritage Trust and Newry, Mourne and Down Council to help them deal with a ldquoreally sensitive and fragile environment.Meanwhile fire chiefs say everyone must work hard to prevent fires like those which ravaged the Mournes last weekend from ever happening again,.They have appealed to the public to do all they can to help to prevent signicant environmental damage and placing a major strain on Fire and Rescue Service resources..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/28April2021-Down.jpg","title":"Down Leisure Centre to reopen doors again  ","story":"DOWN Leisure Centre in Downpatrick

back-to-back promotion aspirations as they travel to Mayo for a pm throw-in at MacHale Park.The following Sunday, they take on Meath at the neutral Athletic Grounds in Armagh, this time with a later start at .pm.Down then face off against Westmeath at Cusack Park in Mullingar on Saturday, May , with the throw-in pencilled in for .pm.Despite the Mourne men undergoing a serious revamp in recent times as they secured promotion from Division  at the end of last year, they have not been without controversy.Down previously accepted a punishment of losing a home fixture in this yearrsquos league due to breaching Covid- guidelines by gathering a large training group in early January.This is why their second league game against Meath has been moved to neutral Armagh.Manager Paddy Tally was also handed an initial -week suspension as a result of the collective training, but this was subsequently reduced to eight weeks.ldquoI think the whole thing has become a bit of a circus, said Tally.ldquoItrsquos not a nice thing to be dragged through the press and to be seen as some sort of a lawbreaker and some sort of an enemy of the public, which wersquore certainly not, he added.The ban concluded earlier this month and therefore will not affect Tallyrsquos involvement when the league commences.Down will be hoping to use their opening league game as an early indicator for the level of competition in store for them this year, as well as preparation for a new look gaelic gamesunder Covid- regulations.Down face Donegal at Paacuteirc Elser in the preliminary round of the

Indeed the maze lsquofestival of runningrsquo had been pushed back twice so Glenn had a ready supply of entrants poised to swing into action once the NI Executive indicated that ato competitive sport was on the cards.There had been a sense of growing anticipation and even though these races were announced with short notice, there were few who turned down the chance to take part.The venue was set at Down Royal with a half marathon distance held on the Saturday and K races on the Sunday.Unfortunately it was not possible to accommodate new entries as the organisers had to work with the overall cap of  attendees which had to include runners and all officials. The races were split into waves according to projected finish times and runners were warned that they were only to be on site for the duration of their wave and there were no additional spectators.Declan Teague was in the first half marathon wave aimed at those who were able to complete the . miles in one hour  minutes or less.He reported back that the course was four laps, a mix of country roads around the area and then part of the racecourse perimeter track.He added that it was a beautul morning to be out racing but there was a strong headwind on a two mile uphill stretch each lap, which was tough going.He was more than happy to record a time of :: which placed him th overall in the field of  once the times were ranked. Lockdown has obviously not been detrimental to this consistent performer.Next day conditions were also ideal for those ready to toe the line. EDAC had three runners out to give the K a go.Conaill MacNabb more often seen in triathlons is a new recruit to our club so he was racing in EDAC colours for the first time.In fact, he was so recently signed up that he had to borrow a vest but hopefully this is the first of many races for the club as he has talent to spare as a runner.His time of . was good enough for th place out of  and stands as a personal best for now.With a few more races under his belt it will not be that long until he betters this. Welcome to the club, Conaill.Jonny Holmes has been gradually building back up since a minor operation a few months ago and so was gratied to record a sub  minute timein order to edge back to his previous form. He has been ticking over with the EDAC lockdown plan and ious challenges so is ready now to push himself towards the next goal.His personal best stands at . so that is back in sight and given his competitive approach a sub  is not an impossible goal.Sharon Madine was the sole female to fly the EDAC flag. She trains hard and loves racing but she says that she went out a bit too hard in the first mile and then suffered in the final stretch.It may not have been ideal as far as pacing is concerned but her actual time of . wasnrsquot far outside her previous personal best so she canrsquot be too hard on herself.It seems likely that a sub  minute K is on the horizon. Great running all round from Team EDAC and plenty of goals ahead.It is uplting to see results and race photos appearing on social media and with any luck this will once again become a regular occurrence.ChampionChip have let it be known that their other postponed event is going to be staged in the near future andthey can allow some new entries it is sure to be sold out in no time so keep a lookoutyou are hoping to get involved..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/28April2021-CDiary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C May 2%2C 2001  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK ndash A Downpatrick firefighter who saved the lives of a local mother and her two children received a rare bravery award last week.James Fitzpatrick was presented with the award during a ceremony at Downpatrick Police Station on Thursday night.The recognition comes several months after the dedicated fireman came across a fire on his way to the Downpatrick Station to answer a call.On his way to the town centre to join the fire-fighting team, James came across a house at Racecourse Road with smoke billowing from its windows.Using a wheelie bin to reach an upstairs window, he brought Brenda Murphy and her daughters, Aimee and Ashlynne, to safety.Jamesrsquo efforts led Down Districtrsquos Divisional Fire Officer, Mr John Allen, to nominate him for the awards scheme which is run by the Royal Humane Society for Saving Le from Fire.Mr Allen admits that it is the first time, since he took up his post in the area, that he has been encouraged to nominate a firefighter for the award.ldquoI think Jamesrsquo actions typy the highest standards that we would expect from a firefighter, he said.ldquoHe stayed calm under pressure, he used the equipment available to him and as a result of these actions three people are now walking around with a quality of le which they may not have otherwise had.NEWCASTLE ndash Newcastle is to get a new ambulance base.

Any groups who were using it have now found alternative accommodation.Fr Murray said that during the Troubles the parish centre provided a safe haven for parish and cultural and social activities but plays and concerts stopped being hosted there about  years ago.ldquoParish le has changed, said Fr Murray. ldquoWhen the Troubles were on, people were afraid to venture too far so they went to Mass on Sunday, went to the bingo at the Parish Centre on Friday or to a dance.ldquoWhen the Troubles ended, people went back out to the bright lights of the city and we canrsquot compete with the money thatrsquos put into clubs. A lot of parish centres have died a death and even the ones that are going well are finding things hard.Fr Murray said that several interesting items were found in the buildings stores when they were clearing it out.ldquoDownpatrick Silver and Reed Band used to rehearse in the hall and we found a baton and a drum.

Obviously we have been dealing with Covid-, but there was also a large flood last year in Newcastle and now wersquore going to have to pick up the pieces after the fire.ldquoTherersquos not too many people who go into the Mournes a am on a Friday morning for a barbecue, he declared. ldquoWhat we need to see now is a moratorium on all gorse burning right across the island.South Down MLA Colin McGrath said he believed legislators need to ensure that structures are put in place to prevent such a devastating fire from happening again, highlighting the need for an an all-island strategy to address wildfires, with the focus on how they can be prevented and how people can be educated better about land management.Paying tribute to the bravery and determination of those tackling the blaze, he said he feared the huge fire will not only have a devastating impact on the natural landscape, but also the Newcastle economy that relies so heavily on tourism associated with the Mournes.ldquoHaving met with the Fire and Rescue Service it is clear that they are doing everything they can to combat these blazes. However, the issue of gorse and wildfires is something that affects our entire island and our response to it cannot just be a reaction to every outbreak of fire but a measured response that attempts to understand why these fires are happening so often and ultimately to prevent them, he continued.ldquoThat is why I tabled an oral question at the Assembly on Monday to the Health Minister asking for an all-island strategy to specically address the prevention, response, post investigation analysis of such fires and,necessary, what repercussions there would be for those who perpetrate these fires.Mr McGrath added: ldquoWhile gorse and wildfires do not recognise borders, they do recognise barriers. We have seen instances in the past where the blocking of land masses has ensured that fires were not able to get a grasp where they would have caused untold damage had this not been the case.Slieve Croob councillor Andy McMurray also thanked firefighters and revealed that he watched the fire spread from the Glen Fofanny area, across Leganabruchan and Millstone on Friday evening towards Thomasrsquos Mountain which was ldquoencircled in apocalyptic flames.He said the fact the fire covered such a distance underlines the intense ferocity of the blaze and seeing how close it came to the boundary of Donard Forest really puts into perspective the work of all those involved in the emergency response.Cllr McMurray said he took time off work last Friday morning to do a litter pick along the Bloody Bridge River and collected a number of discarded barbecues.He continued: ldquoThat people are taking these into the hills in the first place is a nonsense. But to do so during such a dry spell as we are experiencing and then only to leave them behind is just the height of irresponsibility and ignorance.ldquoThere are many factors which give rise to the wildfire scenario we have found ourselves in. The reality is that we have experienced this before only a few years ago in Tullybrannigan and last year at Dollyrsquos Brae near Castlewellan.Cllr McMurray said emergency and local agencies needed to receive support from Stormont andWestminster to be in position to regularly deal and investigate fires which are ldquocrimes against our natural habitat and need to be forensically examined in order establish responsibility.He added: ldquoFrom there, due process should be followed while in the longer term there is a need to explorethere are environmental management strategies which can be adopted to reduce the chances of such events happening.Mournes councillor Glyn Hanna has spoken of his shock at seeing images of the wildfires.He said he feared it may take years for the Mournes to recover from the devastation.ldquoThe images of fire on the mountains reminded me of similar pictures of lava flowing from volcanoes in Iceland, he said.ldquoThe images of Donard were just shocking, andthis was started deliberately then whoever did it should be ashamed.ldquoStarting fires on the mountains is no joke and is nothing more than a criminal act putting people in danger for no reason, Cllr Hanna added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/28April2021-Super.jpg","title":"Super supporter John signs off 18th book on Manchester United  ","story":"CARRYDUFF Manchester United Supportersrsquo Club branch secretary John White has released his th book about his beloved team.lsquoManchester United ndash The Making of a Football Dynastyrsquo is the latest instalment of Johnrsquos impressive book series in which he reviews the story behind  of their past matches.This book is part of a two volume set, with  games being detailed in each.The games could be substantial for a number of reasons, such as a notable playerrsquos debut, a record scoreline, a controversial moment and so on.ldquoThis is a book which will teach United fans the history of the club in a way that has never been approached before, said John.ldquoThere is a lot of interesting trivia mixed-in about players, the opposition, the competition and I end every game with a special did you know that The author insists this isnrsquot a ldquoglory glory Manchester United book, but rather it is one of ldquoovercoming adversity and learning.The Red Devils super-fan began writing about his favourite team whilst travelling to matches with the cross-community supportersrsquo club  years ago.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityMonday, April , marks the official ftieth birthday of Chapter Arts Centre in Cardf.The multi-artform venue was the first of its kind in Wales.CEO of Chapter, Andy Eagle said: ldquoChapter was originally set up by a community of artists and that remains its foundation and principal purpose. Itrsquos an eclectic and fascinating place that has, over the last fty years, evolved to be welcoming and inclusive to many dferent types of peopleChapter Arts Centre came to le thanks to the driving force of writer Mik Flood and artists Christine Kinsey and Bryan Jones.CEO Chapter Andy Eagle. Photo Kirsten McTernanDiscussions about the opening of an arts centre in Cardf started in  and were part of a vision for a space where artists could produce and present work, free from commercial pressures. Experimental work was seen as key to its identity, and the needs of artists were at its heart.The venue was formerly Canton High School, and the initial period of set up was a demanding time. The founders, and a gang of enthusiastic and dedicated volunteers, lovingly cleared, restored and adapted the building to make it fit for purpose as Walesrsquo first arts centre.The first official Board meeting was held on  April  and in July that year Chapter opened its doors with a temporary cinema, gallery and bar, and with former classrooms used as studios, workshops and offices. Chapter Fundraising gig, Pavilions in the Park. Photo courtesy of Christine KinseyToabout the history of Chapter and itrsquos early years between  and , visit: www.issuu chapter docs earlyyears_copy.Five decades on, Chapter has grown into one of the largest arts complexes in Europe, with two cinemas, two theatres, a gallery, a large number of artistsrsquo studios and creative industry offices, meeting places for the community and a cafeacute bar.Chapter in the early daysIt produces and presents the best in national and international contemporary visual art, experimental and thought-provoking performance, and challenging independent, mainstream and international films, all alongside an inclusive learning and engagement programme.     Every year, the venue welcomes , visitors to more than  film screenings,  live performances,  visual art exhibitions and  community classes, artisan fairs and events.Mr Eagle added: ldquoChapter is many dferent things to many dferent people. For some, it will be the international gallery exhibitions and the programme of independent films.\"For others, it will be the cafeacute bar and restaurant to meet friends before a Cardf City home game, or it will be for dance and theatre classes or a cup of tea before working in the community garden.\"But at its heart itrsquos a centre for contemporary art, supporting artists and creatives from Wales and beyond to produce and present work.Chapter works with practitioners at every stage in their careers, supporting and stimulating opportunities for exciting new talent as well as promoting the work of established artists.It is a springboard for the creative community of Wales with a focus on bringing the world to Wales and Wales to the world.Chapter is home to over  of Walesrsquo most dynamic creative companies and artists, including BAFTA Cymru, Printhaus, ie ie Productions, Everyman Theatre, Beryl Productions, Cardf Music School and Taking Flight Theatre. Chapter has remained open to this creative community during the pandemic.MORE NEWS:They also offer a range of spaces in support of local artists and companies for the research and development of artistic projects, including Hijinx Theatre.Like most art and entertainment venues, the last year has been one of the most dficult times for the organisation as they were forced to close their doors. MrEagle commented: ldquoClosure has had a massive impact on us. We are an arts organisation that generates almost all of its income through ticket sales, classes, hires, cafeacute bar and other activity.\"The small remaining amount comes fromArts Council of Wales and is used to support our arts and education programme. Our capacity to earn incomeliterally stopped overnight and that was profoundly scary.Support has been generated from extremely generous public donations and from a range of funders including Arts Council Wales, Welsh Government, BFI, Art Fund, Ffilm Cymru and Admiral.Since its closure, Chapter has offered an exciting Chapter from Home programme, consisting of over  virtual film screenings, online theatre productions and art exhibitions, monthly online comedy gigs presented by Welsh comedian Robin Morgan, virtual lectures with Arts Society Cardf, as well as outdoor theatre performances with Cardf-based companies including Theatr Iolo and Kitsch  Sync.Currently showing at Chapteris internationally focussed art exhibition Artes Mundi. The exhibition is available to view online ndash and in-venue as soon as itrsquos allowed.

Artes Mundi - Carrie Mae Weems RESIST COVID TAKE ! - Photo Stuart WhippsThe works focus on the global pandemic that continues to affect us all, and in particular its impact on people of colour. In the Gallery are immersive works by South African artist Dineo Seshee Bopape - objects, drawing and sound are presented in spaces with walls covered in washes of soil from Welsh sacred sites.Talking about the programme since Chapter closed, Director of Programme Hannah Firth said: ldquoWhen our doors closed in March last year we wanted to ensure that we could still talk to our audiences and the creative community that is our beating heart.\"Despite the uncertainty faced by many artists, they showed an astonishing resilience and desire to quickly adapt to other ways of working and engaging.\"Wersquove been lucky enough to be able to work with some of them to create a dynamic programme of events and activity online and outdoors, and have developed a number of key commissions to support artists including on our lightbox, in our cafeacute bar, in our gallery, around the Canton community, and online.Chapter is currently getting ready to re-open. Depending on Covid guidelines, they hope to welcome customers back outdoors sometime after Easter, and they have been working hard to improve their outdoor catering offer to keep visitors warm and cosy day and night.Although Chapter canrsquot bring everyone together for a big Birthday party as planned, they will celebrate their five decades through to next April with a series of special events, activities and online content - they particularly have some exciting plans for outdoor events this summer.Mr Eagle said: ldquoNeedless to say  is not the year we were anticipating for our th!ldquoWhile the move to digital is great in many ways, ultimately, people want to be able to enjoy themselves and meet and do things in person.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityVale of Glamorgan council put forward Aberthaw, a recently closed coal-fired power plant, as a potential site for a fusion prototype.The UK government last year called for suggestions for possible sites to pioneer the technology which could generate electricity with low carbon emissions.But opposition councillors on the Vale council have claimed the cabinet has ldquorushed through its decision to suggest Aberthaw as a site.More NewsCardf Tomasz Waga murder investigation sees two more arrestedFour coffee shops in Penarth for meeting a friend outdoorsThings to do in South Wales on May Bank Holiday weekend Plaid Councillor Ian Johnson said: ldquoIt was strange that the council leadership did not consult with other parties or ask a cross-party scrutiny committee to consider issues before making the expression of interest about a possible future use of the Aberthaw plant.ldquoEven though it is an early point, many people will have questions about the technology, the impact of the development and the process, and discussing this in scrutiny would open up the debate and ensure transparency.Fusion technology is still in its infancy and no fusion reactor has ever created more power than it consumes. But scientists say it could be cleaner and safer than fission, the nuclear technology currently used to generate electricity.If Aberthaw is chosen, the council is hoping the power plant could bring lots of high-tech high-paid jobs to the region. Westminster should decide on a site by the end of next year, and the power plant would be built by , costing about pound billion.But the Valersquos cabinet used controversial emergency powers last month to put forward Aberthaw as a site, without consulting the full council or any scrutiny committees. Council leader Neil Moore said this was due to the deadline for suggestions at the end of last month.     However, Westminster made the initial call for suggestions in December last year, meaning the council had four months in total to debate and scrutinise the decision to put forward Aberthaw. The council debated the issue in a meeting this week, after the deadline passed.Conservative Cllr Gordon Kemp said: ldquoThis is being dealt effectively without allowing any proper consideration or scrutiny. Itrsquos an extremely signicant matter, evenwe ignore the issue of public concern over such a proposal.ldquoWersquore looking at potentially a colossal, massive investment in the Vale. It could create many jobs, so I think itrsquos something that should have been discussed.ldquoI appreciate there are always deadlines on this. But Irsquom very concerned and surprised this wasnrsquot put before cabinet and scrutiny committees [earlier].Cllr Moore said the issue was ldquonot a debate, but promised to meet with the leaders of the opposition parties on the council, and to give a cross-party scrutiny committee a chance to consider the plans.He said: ldquoThis is just for noting. We used the emergency procedure because it had to be in by a deadline. This is not a debate about what we can do.ldquoBut Irsquom more than happy to have a meeting with the group leaders, and Irsquom more than happy to ask for an information report to go to the environment and regeneration scrutiny committee. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

No. claimed the ‘short, controlled procession’ was followed by a large police presence including eight police vehicles and ‘no less than three police cameramen videographers.However the PSNI pointed out that the Health Protection Regulations remain in place adding: “It is important that people continue to adhere to them.” Chief Inspector Barney O’Connor said: “Police were in attendance at a notied parade at Main Street in Markethill on Monday rd May.PSNI officers at the Markethill Protestant Boys Flute Band parade in the town to mark the centenary of Northern Ireland, on May , .“In relation to potential breaches of the Health ProtectionRegulations NI , warnings were given and an evidence gathering operation put in place. We will now review all the footage gathered.”In a statement on Facebook the Lodge said Markethill Protestant Boys Flute Band had concerns prior to the event as the Parades Commission had classied the parade as ‘sensitive’.On top of issues with the Parades Commission, which had determined the parade legal, the Lodge described the actions of the PSNI as ‘intimidatory’.“Before this short, controlled procession began several police officers began to gather around the band. No less than three police cameramen videographers were focused directly on the band. As they formed to start parading, a loudspeaker rang out directly at the side of the band. They were informed that they must disperse! PSNI officers at the Markethill Protestant Boys Flute Band parade in the town to mark the centenary of Northern Ireland, on May , .“As they moved off, several PSNI cameramen followed the parade akin to the ‘blocks’ of soldiers some will remember from past bad days. One PSNI cameraman continued to take  video for about half of the procession.“If that were not intimidating enough, it was observed that there were at least, at least eight marked police vehicles present in and in the vicinity of the town!“Tonight’s events are deeply disturbing for many in the local community. Over and above all Parades Commission and Covid related issuesthe proportionality observed this evening is hugely concerning. To have this single band of young men, women and children videoed and photographed in what many would consider as an overtly intimidatory manner, is worrying enough, but to have eight police vehicles present for an event of a few dozen people is blatantly disproportionate! “What possible reasoning and justication can be given for such an approach  “These issues need immediately addressed. Our political representatives locally and beyond need to make representation now and get questions asked.“All efforts to get the PSNI to officially detail the restrictions upon legally notied parades and the related legislation in advance, have been ignored. We are in the situation that so-called ‘illegal’ protests are not permitted, travelling with legal events not being permitted! For any outsider it would appear that these exercises are not about the law or health. To any outsider it would appear we are in the midst of an attempt to ensure Unionism and Loyalism voices are silenced.”TUV leader Jim Allister said: “The actions of the PSNI last night around a band parade in Markethill have further damaged confidence in policing within the Unionist community.“How it was thought that it would be a good idea to interfere in a small parade marking the centenary of NI in an overwhelmingly Protestant town well known for its parading culture is beyond me. It is certainly hard to square with the police approach to Republican funerals!“Outdoor band practices have been taking place across the country in full compliance with the law in recent days. Yesterday, in many parts of NI, inidual bands paraded in a manner which was compliant with the restrictions to mark NI’s th birthday without any interference from the police. Why was a dferent approach adopted in Markethill “It is important to note that this was a legal parade. Although it was marked as sensitive by the Parades Commission – a bizarre decision given the history of parading in the area – the organisers made every effort to keep within the law. This is, of course, in stark contrast with the actions of Republican lawmakers at a terrorist funeral last summer.“The issue is compounded by the fact that the PSNI were able to deploy no less than eight patrol cars and officers with cameras in an area where visible policing is often thin on the ground. “Frankly the PSNI need to take a hard look at how this matter was approached and the damage they have done to their image, not just in the Markethill area but across Northern Ireland.”  \"       \"  Most PopularLodge criticises policing of band parade celebrating NI centenaryTeenage girl taken to hospital after crash in NI townJamie Bryson to address Markethill protest - urges next DUP leader to ‘break a little delph’Appeal to help locate ‘high risk’ missing personNew job transforms the le of dog lover JoshuaMost PopularLoyalists claim PSNI approach to Markethill parade was ‘intimidatory’ due to scale of officers filming and vehiclesWedding plans afootafter girlfriend said ‘yes’ to MLA’s proposalMan due in court after £K of suspected heroin found in NI townDental practice crowned Practice of the YearApplication for eight new dwellings                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\" ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-kafWEX sc-feJyhm dbjzDR\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy  News you can trust since News\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessPublic NoticesFollow us          "},{"url":null,"title":"application for eight new dwellings ","story":"Minister visits town as restrictions eased   Teenage girl taken to hospital after crash in NI townNewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSportFootballOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoHomes and GardensLestyleCarsHomes and GardensPublic NoticesAdvertise My BusinessNewsPoliticsApplication for eight new dwellingsA planning application has been submitted that,successful, will bring eight semi-detached dwellings to Portadown.By The NewsroomWednesday, th May , : am  \"       \"  Agent Gray Design Ltd has submitted an application on behalf of applicantManx, to bring eight, three bedroom, semi-detached properties to a site m NW of no  Ballybay Meadows, off the Loughgall Road.The . hectare site is currently identied as vacant development land, says the land is not in a flood plain and that the surface water created by the development will be disposed of via the mains.Submitted on Monday, March , the application was validated on Monday, April .The neighbour consultation period expires on Wednesday, May , while the standard consultationperiod expires on Monday, May .

Had these been paid for, as they would have been in the   financial year, this could have generated £, for Council.Speaking at March’s meeting of Council’s environmental services committee, Council’s head of environmental services, Barry Patience, accepted  was not a “normal year” for data on the use of the service to be collected.Although he did note that prior to the introduction of free bulky waste collections, the service had been generating £-, in revenue for Council.SDLP Councillor Ciaran Toman made a proposal at that meeting for officers to bring a report back to the committee on the possibility of an extension of the fee free bulky waste collection service.The proposal was seconded by his party colleague, Councillor Thomas Larkham.Speaking to the Local Democracy Reporting Service this week, Cllr Toman welcomed the working group’s ability to speak with one voice on this matter.“It has been a tough year for everyone,” said Cllr Toman. “While Council carried out , bulky waste collections over the past year, the recorded fly-tipping incidents jumped from  in   to  in  .“This suggests some form of direct correlation between the closing of our recycling centres and the postponed bulky waste collections which were affected by the pandemic.“I very much see bulky waste collections as an essential service in Council’s efforts to tackle fly-tipping and keeping our streets and countryside clean.“I am pleased there was unanimous agreement to maintain the system as it is, fee-free and review it again in a further  months.”Editor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.
