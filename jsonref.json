Donald Trump? Who cared? He was just The Apprentice then,\u0027  photographer Keith Munyan, one of her close friends, said.Trump has always denied having sex with Daniels whose real name is Stephanie Clifford. At the time of their alleged encounter, he had been married to the first lady for a year. Last week, his long serving lawyer flipped on him and admitted paying Daniels $130,000 to keep her allegations to herself ahead of the 2016 election. Cohen admitted making a similar arrangement with former playmate Karen McDougal.   \u0027It was just normal person sex,\u0027 Daniels said of her alleged tryst with the president in 2006. Trump (pictured together at the Lake Tahoe golf tournament were they met) denies they ever slept togetherFor months, Trump said he did not know about the payments. In his plea, Cohen claimed the opposite and said he acted under Trump\u0027s instruction. Cohen pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations in doing so, among other criminal charges, and is now facing jail time. Daniels gloated on Twitter after his plea. She later told Vogue: \u0027Michael and I are vindicated, and we look forward to the apologies from the people who claimed we were wrong.\u0027 Her in-person interview  was completed months earlier when her fight against the president and his lawyer was still uncertain but others interviewed for it said they all knew about the payment and laughed at Daniels for not taking more money.\u0027We made fun of her because she took so little money,\u0027 Kelli Roberts who worked with Daniels in the porn industry, said. Roberts later said Daniels \u0027stood out\u0027 from others when she was in charge of porn shoots in the 1990s because she would \u0027rent mansions for the day\u0027 and \u0027bring bottled water and doughnuts to make the girls feel comfortable.\u0027 Daniel complained that she was living like a \u0027fugitive\u0027 with paparazzi camped outside her home in Texas if she ever stayed put for long enough. \u0027We’ve been in a couple car chases. We’ve had people put notes under the door, which means they know what hotel I’m in, which means we\u0027ve had to change hotels in the middle of the night,\u0027 she said, referring to herself and her lawyer Michael Avenatti.                             My fan base is completely different. It\u0027s pretty much these packs of women and they\u0027re like, You\u0027re going to save the world.                         \u0027We’ve been at restaurants when we order food and it’s taken too long or somebody was watching and we’ve had to leave—like that. That\u0027s why I\u0027m so skinny,\u0027 she went on. Avenatti was also photographed by Leibowitz for the interview. The pair jokingly referred to themselves as Thelma and Louise at one stage.\u0027Do you want to be Thelma or Louise, Michael?\u0027 she asked.  Avenatti replied: \u0027Who\u0027s driving the car?\u0027 Their exchange went on with Daniels asking, \u0027Yeah, who decided to go off the cliff?\u0027 When the Vogue writer interjected that it had been Thelma, Avenatti carried on: \u0027But was she driving?\u0027 After being told that she wasn\u0027t, he said: \u0027I want to be Louise.\u0027 Daniels, at that, said: \u0027Which one of us gets Brad Pitt?\u0027 Elsewhere, Avenatti described her as \u0027really f****** smart\u0027. After Cohen\u0027s plea last week, he told the magazine in an email: \u0027Trump is in a lot of trouble. His habit of disloyalty and stepping on people is about to catch up to him.\u0027 The interview also happened before Daniels was arrested in Ohio during one of her strip shows. She was accused of inappropriately touching patrons by slapping their faces with her bare breasts. Avenatti fought the charges successfully and they were dropped. Since she began her Make America Horny Again tour of strip clubs, Daniels said she has been faced with an unexpected outpouring of admiration from women who are pinning their hopes for a \u0027revolution\u0027 on her, their unlikely leader. \u0027My fan base is completely different. It’s pretty much these packs of women, and they are angry. People come up and they’re so emotional and they put so much on me. They’re like, You’re going to save the world, you’re a patriot, you’re a hero. \u0027When I started this, I just wanted to save my own a**. Not everybody else\u0027s,\u0027 she said.She also touched on her estranged relationship from her mother which had been well documented in previous interviews and said her upbringing was \u0027neglectful\u0027.  \u0027I haven’t talked to my mom in over ten years and I haven’t talked to my dad in 22 years,\u0027 she said, adding that she grew up in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, convinced that she had been adopted from a rich family because she felt so out of place with her own relatives.                             She knows that people date and do this and that, and she knows that Trump is somebody I hung out with or knew three years before I even met her dad, so that’s all fine                        \u0027My mom lives in a house that has a boat in the front yard that hasn’t seen water since 1982, and she’s content to just sit there and chain-smoke, and I just couldn’t be like that,\u0027 she said. She later said: \u0027I learned all my early life skills from the strippers at that first club I worked.\u0027 After her Ohio arrest, Daniels\u0027 third husband filed for orce and asked for full custody of their seven-year-old daughter. In the Vogue interview, she spoke candidly about her child and how much she knows about her battle with the president. \u0027She knows that people date and do this and that, and she knows that Trump is somebody I hung out with or knew three years before I even met her dad, so that’s all fine. \u0027The problem is they keep using the words, porn star, and she doesn’t know what a porn star is, because she doesn’t know what sex is, and I’m not quite ready to have that conversation,\u0027 she said. Her daughter has been with her father over the last several months while she tours the country. The pair have limited contact and Daniels must wait for her to call her because the child gets too upset whenever she gets in touch unexpectedly, she said. \u0027If I contact her, it makes her sad, so I just kind of have to wait until she wants to talk to me,\u0027 she said. She was forced to pull her daughter out of school and hire a private tutor when a man tried to take a photograph of her near campus, she said.  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/28/16/4F776AFB00000578-6106839-image-a-151_1535471603334.jpg","title":"Festival idiot dive bombed revellers tents slammed attention seeker loser","story":"    Ethan Potts has been selected to play for his county in Yorkshire.

She had this sensibility, she had a confidence, she had a vulnerability at the same time and she worked hard and she was wanting to please.‘And she was into it and she was a natural. I just knew that photographers would love working with her. It was obvious, you know it was in her DNA, that she would be in front of a lot of cameras.’The captivating black and white images during this shoot, which were published by Harper’s Bazaar Uomo, show Moss alongside Schenkenberg posing romantically with each other inside of a cab, on the New York City subway and standing in the street as the iconic Twin Towers loom in the background.

It was kind of plain and we had great music playing. I kept the crew small so it became intimate,’ she added.‘Keith’s shoot was a really intimate experience, it was like we were in a room in a lounge hanging out.’Of A-lister Nicole Kidman, Stylander said her 1995 shoot for Entertainment Weekly in Los Angeles with the actress was ‘very simple’ and easy, thanks to her wonderful spirit.           Of A-lister Nicole Kidman, Stylander said her 1995 shoot for Entertainment Weekly in Los Angeles with the actress was ‘very simple’ and easy thanks to her wonderful spirit.

It was a very simple shoot, but I just wanted a very natural beauty surrounding her.‘Something very feminine and simple, that was really what I was after - and she was very inspiring in front of the camera. I felt like she could move in a way that was so nonchalant and you could be captivated by her expression.’ Stylander’s cinematic vision has helped her to amass an impeccable body of work during her career, and the images she captured from 1990 to mid-2000s are all part of her wide-ranging collection to be included in her book.‘I really wanted to look and revisit the imagery that I did while I was living in Europe in the Nineties,’ said Stylander, who studied under the legendary photographer Art Kane before she kickstarted her career in the industry.‘I loved the period with the magazines I was working with it was very directed towards photographers’ style and I had a really particular style. \u0027This was the work that I loved so much, it really spoke to me and it just seemed to be around the beginning of the Nineties and to about the 2000s where I thought it would be a good time to revisit and put it out there.’  Stylander’s cinematic vision has helped her to amass an impeccable body of work during her career and the images she captured from 1990 to mid-2000s are all part of her wide-ranging collection to be included in her book.

It meant girls were twice as likely to self-harm as boysAnd Dr Max Davie, of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said: ‘Education around issues like appearance, gender stereotypes and sexuality is desperately needed and should be included in the new relationships and sex education curriculum.’A Government spokesman said last night: ‘Making sure children and young people have the right mental health care when they need it is vital.‘That’s why we are investing an extra £300million to provide more help in schools, which will include trained staff to provide faster support to children.’"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/08/09/4EEC8FA200000578-0-image-a-5_1533718619625.jpg","title":"Goats recognise happy humans drawn smiling faces study finds","story":"    Researchers at Queen Mary University of London tested 20 goats and found they spent about 50 per cent longer with pictures of smiling peopleFarmyard animals can react to humans with fear, indifference or occasionally – in the case of goats – hostility.But they can be won over with a smile, just like dogs, scientists said yesterday.Goats have been found to prefer people who are grinning rather than scowling when shown pictures of both. They mostly made straight for the smiling person, whose photograph they nuzzled.Researchers at Queen Mary University of London tested 20 goats and found they spent about 50 per cent longer with pictures of smiling people. It suggests goats, which have the reputation of being dim and partial to butting humans, actually have similar characteristics to dogs.The ability to read expressions may be a side-effect of being domesticated, kept in petting zoos or used to provide milk. Donkey gets a kick out of the blues: Music-loving rescue...The home for animal outcasts: A one-legged duck, a hen who...Share this articleThe ability to read expressions may be a side-effect of being domesticated, kept in petting zoos or used to provide milk. Dr Alan McElligott, who led the research published in the journal Royal Society Open Science, said: ‘The study has important implications for how we interact with livestock, because the abilities of animals to perceive human emotions might be widespread and not just limited to pets.’    Dr Alan McElligott, who led the research published in the journal Royal Society Open Science, said: ‘The study has important implications for how we interact with livestock, because the abilities of animals to perceive human emotions might be widespread and not just limited to pets’ "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/29/02/4F79A8E900000578-6108325-Kiara_and_Keyara_Wecker_hit_headlines_in_2001_when_Alan_and_Judi-a-3_1535506340001.jpg","title":"American twin girls sold 8 200 babies start uni","story":"    Ready for university: The twins, pictured together on social media, have grown into \u0027fine young women\u0027, says their adoptive mother  Kiara and Keyara Wecker hit headlines in 2001 when Alan and Judith Kilshaw (pictured with the children) tried to buy them for £8,200.

Now the sisters, who were brought up knowing about their extraordinary story, have turned 18 and are studying social sciences at university          In 2000, Kiera and Keyara were first adopted by US couple Richard and Vickie Allen (pictured), who said they had paid £4,000 for the children through an adoption agencyThe twins, rechristened Belinda and Kimberley by the Kilshaws, were at first cared for at the couple’s farmhouse in North Wales.But a protection order was served on the Kilshaws in January 2001 and the twins were taken into the care of Flintshire social services.Flintshire County Council later lodged an appeal to the Family Division of the High Court to make the twins wards of court.Then-Prime Minister Tony Blair even weighed in as the scandal grew, calling the sale of the children over the internet \u0027disgusting\u0027. In April 2001, the Kilshaws lost their battle to keep the children after a judge ruled it would not be in the ‘welfare interests’ of the twins.In California, Allens were forced to withdraw their custody claim after Mr Allen was arrested in the spring of 2001, when two babysitters, ages 13 and 14, said he had sexually molested them.          Social services remove the twins  from the care of the Kilshaws at The Beaufort Park Hotel in Wales in January 2001The outcome of that case is unclear, although he does not seem to appear on California\u0027s list of registered sex offenders. Now the twins’ adoptive father, 72, is speaking of how he first heard about the plight of the twins on television.He told the Mirror: ‘I remember seeing them on Good Morning America not long after they were handed over to the British couple. I remember thinking to myself what a heartbreaking situation it was.’The couple, from Missouri, were contacted by social services soon after the High Court case, who asked if they could take in twin girls who had been overseas.Their adoptive father added: ‘I felt it was my duty to take them.\u0027They brought them straight from the airport to our home and we have never looked back since.’The couple, from Missouri, said they lost some friends after adopting the girls, as some thought the children should be placed with their birth mother.Even though the girls were allowed to see Miss Wecker if they wished, their adoptive mother said Keyara does not want to see her.Growing up, the twins enjoyed playing sports such as lacrosse and basketball and are now playing in their university band.Even though the pair share similar interests, Keyara is more extroverted while Kiara is more shy.The twins, who have been brought up under different names, still live with their adoptive parents but are hoping to leave home next year.  You\u0027re welcome to her: Alan Kilshaw was only too happy for ex Judith to wed her toyboy after their marriage fell apart in wake of baby buying scandalBy Helen Weathers for the Daily MailGiven the humiliating manner in which their 15-year marriage came to an end, former solicitor Alan Kilshaw could be excused for feeling a little bitter towards his ex-wife Judith.Not least because, on March 21 2009, Judith, then 55, married her 42-year-old fiance Stephen Sillett - the \u0027toyboy lover\u0027 she met in a nightclub and for whom she left Alan and their two sons in 2007.But in what must be one of the most bizarre wedding ceremonies ever, Alan gave his ex-wife away to the \u0027other man\u0027 - happily, ecstatically even, bestowing upon them every blessing under the sun.\u0027It\u0027s a bit unusual, but there are probably quite a lot of husbands who\u0027d like to give away their ex-wives, so perhaps I\u0027ll start a trend,\u0027 said Alan ahead of the wedding.          Alan and Judith Kilshaw are pictured together with Judith\u0027s new husband Stephen Sillett shortly ahead of their marriage in 2009\u0027I don\u0027t feel jealous of Stephen, nor bitter in the slightest. Once a marriage has expired, it\u0027s best just to move on. Judith didn\u0027t have anyone else to give her away. Her father Ralph died a long time ago, so I was pleased to accept her invitation, although no doubt it will raise a few eyebrows on the day.As for Judith, for whom this would be third time lucky, she said Alan was the obvious choice to give her away because - despite everything - he was still her \u0027best friend\u0027.And luckily for her, Alan is the forgiving, magnanimous type - unlike the rest of her family. Judith has a certain knack for alienating her nearest and not so dearest.Louisa Richardson - Judith\u0027s estranged eldest daughter from her first marriage - was not invited to the nuptials following an ugly catfight in 2008, when the pair met briefly at the home of Judith\u0027s late mother Brenda shortly after her death.Nor will her younger daughter Caley Richardson who once accused Judith of being an \u0027unfit mother\u0027.          For two months, the babies were raised by another couple, only for the twins’ natural mother Tranda Wecker (pictured) to suddenly get in touch to say she wanted two days to say a ‘final goodbye’She disappeared to America two years ago after falling out bitterly with her mother over the relationship with toyboy Stephen. So while almost all of the 20 guests at Judith\u0027s wedding were from Stephen\u0027s side, only a stoic Alan was there for her, as well as their bewildered sons James and Rupert who were encouraged by their father to accept Stephen and recognise their mother\u0027s right to happiness.\u0027We all get on really well. We\u0027ve tried to be very mature about it for the sake of the boys,\u0027 Judith said. \u0027Alan is giving Stephen driving lessons and they often go for a drink together.\u0027Sometimes I joke that Stephen should be marrying Alan instead of me, they spend so much time together.\u0027           The Kilshaws, who maintained they were unaware that the twins had already been through two sets of parents, had been dealing with Internet adoption broker Tina JohnsonAlan stopped short of saying that Stephen is welcome to Judith but confirmed, rather firmly: \u0027No, I don\u0027t want her back.\u0027Together as \u0027The Kilshaws\u0027 they achieved the kind of notoriety few marriages would have the mettle to withstand.It was in 2001 that the Kilshaws were propelled from anonymity to universal figures of hate when they paid £8,200 to an unscrupulous baby broker in the United States to adopt six-month-old, mixed-race American twins Belinda and Kimberley.It was only after they arrived in the U.S. to collect them that they discovered that the twins\u0027 mother, Tranda Wrecker - who\u0027d put them up for sale on the internet - had already placed them with an American couple, Richard and Vickie Allen, who\u0027d paid £4,000.The Allens would later claim they\u0027d been tricked into handing back the twins to Wrecker for a final goodbye before the adoption was finalised, only to discover they\u0027d been gazumped and the girls had been handed over to the Kilshaws instead.With the Allens in hot pursuit, the Kilshaws drove 2,000 miles across America and after formally adopting the twins in the U.S., they booked flights home to Manchester and into the eye of a media storm - where their unconventional lifestyle was put under intense scrutiny.Not only did Judith already have two daughters, Louisa and Caley, from her first marriage, to civil servant Mike Richardson, and two sons, James and Rupert, with Alan, but the couple regularly threw vicars and tarts themed parties at their North Wales farmhouse (a police officer who once arrived to ask them to turn down the noise was mistaken for a strip-a-gram).           Alan and Judith Kilshaw speak to reporters outside their farmhouse in Buckley, north Wales shortly after the twins were taken out of their custodyJudith\u0027s daughter Louisa would also later claim that her mother, desperate to give Alan the daughter he so desired, offered her £3,000 to act as a surrogate, and tried to persuade her to have an abortion when she fell pregnant with her own child.Tony Blair called the adoption deal \u0027disgusting\u0027 as the Kilshaws dragged the twins from pillar to post for countless press interviews.Then weeks after their arrival in Britain, Flintshire social services seized the twins and they were returned to the US after a High Court judge annulled the American adoption, branding the Kilshaws as \u0027media obsessed\u0027 with no genuine concern for the welfare of the twins.The couple then did themselves no favours by agreeing to take part in a documentary called Meet The Kilshaws in which Judith came across as a foul-mouthed, volatile harridan with Alan as a henpecked milksop. The scandal, plus changes to legal aid regulations, resulted in the loss of 90 per cent of Alan\u0027s income almost overnight.More than £50,000 in debt following the twins fiasco, their £230,000 farmhouse in Buckley, North Wales, was repossessed.          Mrs Kilshaw holds her head as her husband speaks to media seconds after social services removed the twins from their careJudith had until then been scraping a living as a part-time cleaner.Only Stephen, a orced father of two grown-up sons and an anthropology graduate and musician, has regular work as an agency administrator. There are times, he admitted, when he wondered what he had got himself into and in 208 briefly called off their relationship.\u0027When I first met Judith, I didn\u0027t know anything about her past and didn\u0027t particularly want to,\u0027 said Stephen, who proposed to Judith in December when he took her on the Santa Express to the Welsh Lapland tourist attraction.\u0027But she told me her story and I understand why she did what she did. She lives a very normal, ordinary life now. I\u0027m hoping that when she becomes Mrs Judith Sillett it will draw a line under the past.\u0027 Both Alan and Judith, who first met through a newspaper lonely hearts column, believe they\u0027d probably still be married today if they\u0027d been allowed to keep the twins.          Judith and Alan Kilshaw leave Birmingham High Court in March 19, 2001 as they battled to get back the twinsAmazingly, neither of them believes they did anything wrong or immoral, preferring to blame the babies\u0027 mother, Flintshire social services and the Government.   It was Judith\u0027s daughter Caley who found the details of a number of American baby-brokers on the internet.Tina Johnson of the Caring Heart Agency was the only one to respond to the Kilshaws\u0027 inquiry and introduced them to Tranda Wrecker.\u0027When we arrived in America, we had no idea the twins had been placed with the Allens,\u0027 said Judith, whose late parents used to run a children\u0027s home in Cheshire, which she says inspired her to adopt.\u0027What Tranda Wrecker did was very cowardly, but she obviously already had concerns about the Allens before we came along.\u0027She had the right to change her mind about the adoption and she chose us over them. We didn\u0027t buy those babies.          Then-Prime Minister Tony Blair called the adoption deal \u0027disgusting\u0027 as the Kilshaws dragged the twins from pillar to post for countless press interviews\u0027We had to bring all the appropriate paperwork to show the American court, proof of income and address, to show that we had the means to provide for them. I still believe we could have given those twins a very happy life.\u0027Alan continues: \u0027The adoption was legal, we didn\u0027t break any laws and we were not charged with any criminal offence.\u0027Alan and Judith prefer to believe that the twins were taken away from them for racial reasons that politically correct social workers were aghast at the thought of a white couple bringing up mixed-race children in a predominantly white area. Shortly after the twins were taken away from them, Alan - staggeringly - agreed to donate his sperm to the sister of the woman who\u0027d previously donated her eggs to Judith for an unsuccessful IVF treatment.\u0027It was a gift in return for a gift,\u0027 said Judith. \u0027This woman\u0027s sister was desperate for a baby, but had no partner and she wanted a child by Alan because she knew he was intelligent and had no health issues.\u0027We agreed that Alan would not interfere in their lives, but that she would send us the occasional picture or letter letting us know how her child was getting on.\u0027          The couple received much criticism after they appeared on a TV show called Meet the Kilshaws on Channel 4"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/28/12/4F60266300000578-0-image-m-15_1535457121758.jpg","title":"Elon Musk doubles pedo guy claim British diver","story":"Share this articleElon Musk Details ‘Excruciating’ Personal Toll of Tesla Turmoil - The New York Times"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/28/09/4F74DF0100000578-0-image-m-20_1535444041160.jpg","title":"Women officially better drivers men revealed new study","story":"    Men are four times more likely to wind up in court for motoring crimes and twice as likely to make insurance claims, study shows.

They claimed £3,271 per payout on average, while typical payouts for women were slightly cheaper at £3,121.This could be down to the fact that men often own more expensive cars, with an average value of £8,654. Women, however, are driving around in cars with a value of £7,090 – a hefty £1,564 difference.Amanda Stretton of Confused.com, said: ‘As a female racing driver, I know women can hold their own when it comes to driving, and data suggests that they are in fact safer on the roads.’The report found men are more likely to have bad driving habits.

ISIS chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi addresses worshippers at a mosque in the Iraqi city of Mosul in 2014Its cross-border state now destroyed, ISIS is instead likely to focus on spreading shock and terror around the world through dramatic attacks, the official added. ISIS will have to find \u0027a new way of doing things, especially to recruit after heavy losses\u0027, said the official, who asked to remain anonymous, told AFP. At its peak, the self-proclaimed caliphate included 35 \u0027wilaya\u0027 (provinces) mostly set within a swathe of territory ning either side of the border between Syria and Iraq.But following major military defeats - including the jihadists\u0027 loss of their de facto capitals of Raqqa in Syria and Mosul in Iraq - ISIS propaganda outlets now only mention six \u0027wilaya\u0027.Former ISIS provinces like Mosul, Raqqa and Kirkuk - an oil-rich province in Iraq - no longer exist.Instead, the term \u0027wilaya\u0027 is now used to refer to large chunks of territory like Iraq and Syria, along with Somalia, East Asia, Tajikistan and the Egyptian Sinai.The administrative reshuffle marks a clear switch from 2014, when ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi boasted of having erased the \u0027imperialist\u0027 design that ided the Middle East.The proclamation was made with great fanfare as jihadists drove bulldozers across the Syrian-Iraqi border, symbolically destroying one of the frontiers drawn up by colonial powers as they carved out the modern Middle East from the ruins of the Ottoman Empire after World War I.After years battling ISIS, Iraqi troops are now redeployed along most of the border with Syria, across which jihadists and weapons have long flowed unimpeded.On the Syrian side, separate offensives by forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and a US-backed coalition have pushed ISIS jihadists out of most of the territory they once controlled.\u0027The change proves Daesh\u0027s weakness and the loss of much of its leadership,\u0027 the security official told AFP, using an Arabic acronym for ISIS.ISIS\u0027s restructure \u0027shows its central command lacks confidence in its wilaya commanders in Iraq and that it is reducing their powers to one (central) leadership\u0027, the official said.Iraqi authorities regularly announce the arrest or death of ISIS leaders and relatives of Baghdadi, such as his son, who was killed in Syria in July by Russian missiles.Baghdadi himself was thought to have been killed several times, and the US has offered up a $25 million (21.5 million euro) reward for information leading to his capture or death.          The jihadist group has been pinned down to its last desert holdouts in Syria having lost all urban centres previously under its control in neighbouring IraqIn a purported new audio message released on Wednesday to mark the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha, Baghdadi called on his followers to \u0027not give up the jihad against their enemy\u0027.\u0027Baghdadi\u0027s speech was one of consolation and condolence,\u0027 said Hisham al-Hashemi, an expert on radical Islamist groups.It was an \u0027acknowledgement of defeat... but (Baghdadi) urged those remaining to persevere\u0027, he said.In a first, Baghdadi used his 55-minute recording to call for attacks in the West, saying an operation there would be \u0027worth a thousand\u0027 at home.Much of the address was reminiscent of approaches long used by Al-Qaeda, according to Hashemi.In it, the ISIS leader scorns the US, blasts Shiite Iran, and calls on Sunni Muslims in Iraq to denounce the Shiite-dominated paramilitary units of the Hashed al-Shaabi.Tore Hamming, a jihadist specialist at the European University Institute, said Baghdadi\u0027s speech falls into the same category as his last three - \u0027crisis management\u0027."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/28/16/4F776AFB00000578-6106839-image-a-151_1535471603334.jpg","title":"Festival idiot dive bombed revellers tents slammed attention seeker loser","story":"    Ethan Potts has been selected to play for his county in Yorkshire.

Now the sisters, who were brought up knowing about their extraordinary story, have turned 18 and are studying social sciences at university          In 2000, Kiera and Keyara were first adopted by US couple Richard and Vickie Allen (pictured), who said they had paid £4,000 for the children through an adoption agencyThe twins, rechristened Belinda and Kimberley by the Kilshaws, were at first cared for at the couple’s farmhouse in North Wales.But a protection order was served on the Kilshaws in January 2001 and the twins were taken into the care of Flintshire social services.Flintshire County Council later lodged an appeal to the Family Division of the High Court to make the twins wards of court.Then-Prime Minister Tony Blair even weighed in as the scandal grew, calling the sale of the children over the internet \u0027disgusting\u0027. In April 2001, the Kilshaws lost their battle to keep the children after a judge ruled it would not be in the ‘welfare interests’ of the twins.In California, Allens were forced to withdraw their custody claim after Mr Allen was arrested in the spring of 2001, when two babysitters, ages 13 and 14, said he had sexually molested them.          Social services remove the twins  from the care of the Kilshaws at The Beaufort Park Hotel in Wales in January 2001The outcome of that case is unclear, although he does not seem to appear on California\u0027s list of registered sex offenders. Now the twins’ adoptive father, 72, is speaking of how he first heard about the plight of the twins on television.He told the Mirror: ‘I remember seeing them on Good Morning America not long after they were handed over to the British couple. I remember thinking to myself what a heartbreaking situation it was.’The couple, from Missouri, were contacted by social services soon after the High Court case, who asked if they could take in twin girls who had been overseas.Their adoptive father added: ‘I felt it was my duty to take them.\u0027They brought them straight from the airport to our home and we have never looked back since.’The couple, from Missouri, said they lost some friends after adopting the girls, as some thought the children should be placed with their birth mother.Even though the girls were allowed to see Miss Wecker if they wished, their adoptive mother said Keyara does not want to see her.Growing up, the twins enjoyed playing sports such as lacrosse and basketball and are now playing in their university band.Even though the pair share similar interests, Keyara is more extroverted while Kiara is more shy.The twins, who have been brought up under different names, still live with their adoptive parents but are hoping to leave home next year.  You\u0027re welcome to her: Alan Kilshaw was only too happy for ex Judith to wed her toyboy after their marriage fell apart in wake of baby buying scandalBy Helen Weathers for the Daily MailGiven the humiliating manner in which their 15-year marriage came to an end, former solicitor Alan Kilshaw could be excused for feeling a little bitter towards his ex-wife Judith.Not least because, on March 21 2009, Judith, then 55, married her 42-year-old fiance Stephen Sillett - the \u0027toyboy lover\u0027 she met in a nightclub and for whom she left Alan and their two sons in 2007.But in what must be one of the most bizarre wedding ceremonies ever, Alan gave his ex-wife away to the \u0027other man\u0027 - happily, ecstatically even, bestowing upon them every blessing under the sun.\u0027It\u0027s a bit unusual, but there are probably quite a lot of husbands who\u0027d like to give away their ex-wives, so perhaps I\u0027ll start a trend,\u0027 said Alan ahead of the wedding.          Alan and Judith Kilshaw are pictured together with Judith\u0027s new husband Stephen Sillett shortly ahead of their marriage in 2009\u0027I don\u0027t feel jealous of Stephen, nor bitter in the slightest. Once a marriage has expired, it\u0027s best just to move on. Judith didn\u0027t have anyone else to give her away. Her father Ralph died a long time ago, so I was pleased to accept her invitation, although no doubt it will raise a few eyebrows on the day.As for Judith, for whom this would be third time lucky, she said Alan was the obvious choice to give her away because - despite everything - he was still her \u0027best friend\u0027.And luckily for her, Alan is the forgiving, magnanimous type - unlike the rest of her family. Judith has a certain knack for alienating her nearest and not so dearest.Louisa Richardson - Judith\u0027s estranged eldest daughter from her first marriage - was not invited to the nuptials following an ugly catfight in 2008, when the pair met briefly at the home of Judith\u0027s late mother Brenda shortly after her death.Nor will her younger daughter Caley Richardson who once accused Judith of being an \u0027unfit mother\u0027.          For two months, the babies were raised by another couple, only for the twins’ natural mother Tranda Wecker (pictured) to suddenly get in touch to say she wanted two days to say a ‘final goodbye’She disappeared to America two years ago after falling out bitterly with her mother over the relationship with toyboy Stephen. So while almost all of the 20 guests at Judith\u0027s wedding were from Stephen\u0027s side, only a stoic Alan was there for her, as well as their bewildered sons James and Rupert who were encouraged by their father to accept Stephen and recognise their mother\u0027s right to happiness.\u0027We all get on really well. We\u0027ve tried to be very mature about it for the sake of the boys,\u0027 Judith said. \u0027Alan is giving Stephen driving lessons and they often go for a drink together.\u0027Sometimes I joke that Stephen should be marrying Alan instead of me, they spend so much time together.\u0027           The Kilshaws, who maintained they were unaware that the twins had already been through two sets of parents, had been dealing with Internet adoption broker Tina JohnsonAlan stopped short of saying that Stephen is welcome to Judith but confirmed, rather firmly: \u0027No, I don\u0027t want her back.\u0027Together as \u0027The Kilshaws\u0027 they achieved the kind of notoriety few marriages would have the mettle to withstand.It was in 2001 that the Kilshaws were propelled from anonymity to universal figures of hate when they paid £8,200 to an unscrupulous baby broker in the United States to adopt six-month-old, mixed-race American twins Belinda and Kimberley.It was only after they arrived in the U.S. to collect them that they discovered that the twins\u0027 mother, Tranda Wrecker - who\u0027d put them up for sale on the internet - had already placed them with an American couple, Richard and Vickie Allen, who\u0027d paid £4,000.The Allens would later claim they\u0027d been tricked into handing back the twins to Wrecker for a final goodbye before the adoption was finalised, only to discover they\u0027d been gazumped and the girls had been handed over to the Kilshaws instead.With the Allens in hot pursuit, the Kilshaws drove 2,000 miles across America and after formally adopting the twins in the U.S., they booked flights home to Manchester and into the eye of a media storm - where their unconventional lifestyle was put under intense scrutiny.Not only did Judith already have two daughters, Louisa and Caley, from her first marriage, to civil servant Mike Richardson, and two sons, James and Rupert, with Alan, but the couple regularly threw vicars and tarts themed parties at their North Wales farmhouse (a police officer who once arrived to ask them to turn down the noise was mistaken for a strip-a-gram).           Alan and Judith Kilshaw speak to reporters outside their farmhouse in Buckley, north Wales shortly after the twins were taken out of their custodyJudith\u0027s daughter Louisa would also later claim that her mother, desperate to give Alan the daughter he so desired, offered her £3,000 to act as a surrogate, and tried to persuade her to have an abortion when she fell pregnant with her own child.Tony Blair called the adoption deal \u0027disgusting\u0027 as the Kilshaws dragged the twins from pillar to post for countless press interviews.Then weeks after their arrival in Britain, Flintshire social services seized the twins and they were returned to the US after a High Court judge annulled the American adoption, branding the Kilshaws as \u0027media obsessed\u0027 with no genuine concern for the welfare of the twins.The couple then did themselves no favours by agreeing to take part in a documentary called Meet The Kilshaws in which Judith came across as a foul-mouthed, volatile harridan with Alan as a henpecked milksop. The scandal, plus changes to legal aid regulations, resulted in the loss of 90 per cent of Alan\u0027s income almost overnight.More than £50,000 in debt following the twins fiasco, their £230,000 farmhouse in Buckley, North Wales, was repossessed.          Mrs Kilshaw holds her head as her husband speaks to media seconds after social services removed the twins from their careJudith had until then been scraping a living as a part-time cleaner.Only Stephen, a orced father of two grown-up sons and an anthropology graduate and musician, has regular work as an agency administrator. There are times, he admitted, when he wondered what he had got himself into and in 208 briefly called off their relationship.\u0027When I first met Judith, I didn\u0027t know anything about her past and didn\u0027t particularly want to,\u0027 said Stephen, who proposed to Judith in December when he took her on the Santa Express to the Welsh Lapland tourist attraction.\u0027But she told me her story and I understand why she did what she did. She lives a very normal, ordinary life now. I\u0027m hoping that when she becomes Mrs Judith Sillett it will draw a line under the past.\u0027 Both Alan and Judith, who first met through a newspaper lonely hearts column, believe they\u0027d probably still be married today if they\u0027d been allowed to keep the twins.          Judith and Alan Kilshaw leave Birmingham High Court in March 19, 2001 as they battled to get back the twinsAmazingly, neither of them believes they did anything wrong or immoral, preferring to blame the babies\u0027 mother, Flintshire social services and the Government.   It was Judith\u0027s daughter Caley who found the details of a number of American baby-brokers on the internet.Tina Johnson of the Caring Heart Agency was the only one to respond to the Kilshaws\u0027 inquiry and introduced them to Tranda Wrecker.\u0027When we arrived in America, we had no idea the twins had been placed with the Allens,\u0027 said Judith, whose late parents used to run a children\u0027s home in Cheshire, which she says inspired her to adopt.\u0027What Tranda Wrecker did was very cowardly, but she obviously already had concerns about the Allens before we came along.\u0027She had the right to change her mind about the adoption and she chose us over them. We didn\u0027t buy those babies.          Then-Prime Minister Tony Blair called the adoption deal \u0027disgusting\u0027 as the Kilshaws dragged the twins from pillar to post for countless press interviews\u0027We had to bring all the appropriate paperwork to show the American court, proof of income and address, to show that we had the means to provide for them. I still believe we could have given those twins a very happy life.\u0027Alan continues: \u0027The adoption was legal, we didn\u0027t break any laws and we were not charged with any criminal offence.\u0027Alan and Judith prefer to believe that the twins were taken away from them for racial reasons that politically correct social workers were aghast at the thought of a white couple bringing up mixed-race children in a predominantly white area. Shortly after the twins were taken away from them, Alan - staggeringly - agreed to donate his sperm to the sister of the woman who\u0027d previously donated her eggs to Judith for an unsuccessful IVF treatment.\u0027It was a gift in return for a gift,\u0027 said Judith. \u0027This woman\u0027s sister was desperate for a baby, but had no partner and she wanted a child by Alan because she knew he was intelligent and had no health issues.\u0027We agreed that Alan would not interfere in their lives, but that she would send us the occasional picture or letter letting us know how her child was getting on.\u0027          The couple received much criticism after they appeared on a TV show called Meet the Kilshaws on Channel 4"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/29/06/4F7BBF8800000578-6108937-image-a-2_1535521873678.jpg","title":"US Open slammed Alize Cornet reprimanded taking shirt off","story":"    US Open officials have come under fire for reprimanding a female tennis player for taking her shirt off on court Wednesday          French tennis player Alize Cornet (pictured) returned from a heat break when she realized her sports top was on backwards          Cornet exposed her black sports bra during the quick change, which lasted about 10 secondsTwitter users took to social media to express their fury after the punishment - calling the rule \u0027ridiculous\u0027 and \u0027sexist\u0027.Scottish tennis coach, Judy Murray, said in a viral tweet: \u0027Alize Cornet came back to court after 10 minute heat break.

For cyclists, it is “absolutely terrifying” and “if you are in a car you haven’t got a clue where you are going. All around it are new towers. It could have been so much better”.Lane said substandard student accommodation has repeatedly made it into the Carbuncle Cup shortlist and 2018 was no exception.Beckley Point in Plymouth is a 23-storey student housing block which, at 78-metres high, is now the tallest building in the south-west. The magazine characterises it as “Vegas heads to Plymouth by way of New York” in that it is “disturbingly similar” to the Las Vegas hotel New York New York, a fun-size caricature of New York skyscrapers stacked side by side.“The difference is Beckley Point is no joke,” Lane said.The building is bad enough, the magazine argues, but worst of all is the wider impact on Plymouth’s townscape. It is located on one of the highest points in the city centre and “ensures that the soulless incoherence that often characterises much of central Plymouth’s postwar reconstruction has been recycled for another generation”.The smallest building on the shortlist is a type that often appears on best architecture prizes. The house at 20 Ambleside Avenue in Streatham, south London, meets demanding Passivhaus standards for low-energy designs but looks like an electricity substation.The use of a single shade of red stock brick with matching pointing, orange guttering, tiles, shutters and gates gives the house “the appearance of a red-faced child who has said something gauche in a room full of grownups”.Lane said the prize was not all about bad architecture. It shone light on serious planning failures, too.A case in point is the “grotesque” rooftop extension to the Shankly Hotel in Liverpool voted through by the city council’s planning committee. After the architect was sidelined the hotel developers put in a new submission that the magazine argues is a “blight on the Liverpool skyline”.The other shortlisted candidates are Redrock Stockport, a £45m leisure centre that includes a 10-screen cinema and is a throwback to “the ugly, garish out-of-town container sheds that once encircled British towns and cities”, and Haydn Tower in Vauxhall, south London.The cup’s name is a nod to a speech Prince Charles gave in 1984 when he called the proposed National Gallery extension “a monstrous carbuncle on the face of a much-loved and elegant friend”.Previous winners have included the Drake Circus shopping centre in Plymouth, Liverpool Ferry terminal, MediaCity in Salford, and the Cutty Sark renovation in London.Readers of the magazine have nominated the buildings they hate most. This year’s winner will be announced on 5 September, chosen by a panel that includes the writer and former  architecture critic Jonathan Glancey, the commissioner for Historic England, Rosemarie McQueen, and Building Design’s architecture correspondent, Ike Ijeh.Above all Lane said he hoped the prize, which began in 2006, would stimulate debate. He also stressed that the magazine had contests that celebrated great architecture as well.He admitted that architects themselves are not big fans of the Carbuncle Cup. “To be honest, there isn’t actually any kind of trophy or a ceremony. I don’t think anybody would turn up,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f6557a34b2fb5a5be518284a92b20afde11e659/0_35_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=0e72483594c95e343ec69d408b6eff70 1320w","title":"help me marianne power review","story":"Power’s expanded blog on living each month according to a different manual floats over Bridget Jones and Fleabag territoryIf, like me, you spent your 20s, 30s and maybe a bit more reading self-help manuals, then the titles that Marianne Power name-checks in this memoir will feel like dog-eared old familiars. There’s Susan Jeffers’ Feel the Fear and Do it Anyway, Stephen Covey’s The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, Paul McKenna’s I Can Make You Rich (although it was actually his companion text I Can Make You Thin that became my personal bible), Rhonda Byrne’s The Secret and Jack Canfield’s Chicken Soup for the Soul. Some were better than others, but one of the biggest challenges was trying to map a mostly American worldview on to another thousands of miles away. Should you put a picture of “your dream condo” on your vision board? Did it matter that you had never featured in a high school yearbook or flown across the country to celebrate Thanksgiving with your folks? And what about the whole business of “dating”, an elaborate etiquette of call and response that bore no relation to what actually went on in the UK in the 1990s, where lifelong relationships usually began in a mutual lunge after a long night in the pub?Perhaps the greatest surprise of Power’s Help Me! is the revelation that, 20 years later, these are still among the books that worried thirtysomethings turn to for advice about how to change – for which read “improve” or even “rescue” – their love life, bank balance or body mass index. A few years ago, 36-year-old Power, chronically broke, single and hungover, created a blog in which she described her year-long experiment in living each month according to a different self-help manual. January would be Feel the Fear and Do It Anyway, requiring her to pose naked for a life-drawing class and chat up strange men (not, mercifully, at the same time), while February would be all about Kate Northrup’s Money, a Love Story, which meant Power actually opening her bank statements and selling her unworn but still ticketed clothes. By the end of the year she planned to be solvent, healthy and loved by a handsome man.Back in the 90s, Helen Fielding debuted Bridget Jones’s Diary in the Independent, before being asked by Picador to expand her pseudonymous column into a book. So it is no surprise that Picador has swooped on Power’s blog and is bringing it to market in expanded form. Indeed, its publicity makes much of the connection, hinting shamelessly that Help Me! will do the same cultural work that Bridget Jones performed so stunningly two decades ago.But how can that be? Bridget Jones was telling a particular story about a specific time. In an era of “post-feminism” – how quaint that sounds now – “having it all” had become not so much an option as a tyrannical obligation for educated young women. Bridget’s failure to acquire simultaneously the thighs of a gazelle and a position as CEO of an international aid agency were not just a trigger for funny writing but also a sly commentary on the way that second-wave feminism of the 70s and early 80s had resulted not in women’s liberation from society’s hobbling expectations but capitulation to a whole new, sneakier, version of them.Help Me!, by contrast, is a series of anecdotes about spending a “rollercoaster” year in which “every bit of me was turned inside out” (Power is not immune from using the cliches of the books she is trying to critique). She does some public speaking, walks on hot coals (literally, Tony Robbins, the American motivational speaker, is still making people do that, years after he first suggested it as a way to Unleash the Power Within), and almost auditions for The X Factor. What disrupts her plan to humiliate herself at Wembley stadium is the sudden death of her uncle at 59, a family catastrophe that requires her to fly to Ireland to be at her mother’s side. And, in fact, it is these lightning bolts of real-life experience, including what sounds like a painful breakdown three-quarters of the way through her experiment, that stops Help Me! floating off into inconsequence.Still, the book retains a certain generic weightlessness. Making art, really funny art, out of the gap between how young women are and how they think they ought to be is still possible 20 years on from Bridget Jones: just think of Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s darkly sublime Fleabag. Help Me! floats over the same territory but left me, just like the self-help texts it sets out to interrogate, hungry for something more. What’s missing, ultimately, is that sharp crack of insight that tells us what it feels like to be youngish and female here, now, at this very moment in history.  • Help Me! is published by Picador.

It has been the reverse, in a\u0026nbspsense, of the anxiety of viewers waiting for the next\u0026nbsptranche of TV’s Game of Thrones, where the rushed writing of epsiodes has felt more like\u0026nbspa cartoonish laying of tracks before a hurtling locomotive.Such is Knausgaard’s literary celebrity that even a\u0026nbsprecent piece he wrote for the New Yorker about the\u0026nbspnegative effects of dog-owning on his creativity comes under scrutiny. Indignant dog-loving writers and fans of dog-loving writers immediately mobilised. His face appears on the cover of several editions in the series, and for a time it was the thing to pose for\u0026nbspa\u0026nbspcover photograph with one’s head partially obscured, in order to create a “Knausface”.It is exhausting, and this is before you even get to\u0026nbspthe first paragraph of the 1,150-page The End.Some of these noises off are explained by the fact that we don’t know quite what to do with Knausgaard. Is he a chancer, who mined his family history and his\u0026nbspdaily life for content and passed it off as a radical dismantling of how identity is constructed and fiction\u0026nbspmade or unmade? Are the novels simply a\u0026nbspmirror of our own neuroses? Should we be so bored\u0026nbspwith a book in our hands?If The End doesn’t provide the answers, it provides additional context for the questions. It opens with Knausgaard, his wife Linda and their three small children living in a Malmö apartment and with Karl Ove, who has briefly escaped to have lunch with friends in the countryside, contemplating the novel he will write when finally he rids himself of My Struggle. It will be the story of an elderly man living in happy rural isolation who each evening jots down his thoughts in a notebook, untroubled by the demands of domesticity, or earning money, or accounting for each moment of his time. There is a backdrop of ecological catastrophe, but since nobody can agree on its cause, he sets it to one side.One can see the allure: Knausgaard’s life is humdrum, but demanding, and fairly short on beauty. Each day, he attempts to preserve his writing time while dutifully making his children breakfast, taking them to and from kindergarten, shopping and preparing for the publication of the first volume of My Struggle. The rapturous early days of his relationship with Linda have given way to a mild irritation with the ision of household duties, and perhaps his closest confidant is his friend Geir (one of several Geirs in the book, which confusion is true to life, but nonetheless requires the reader to pay attention).And now, cataclysm: Knausgaard’s uncle Gunnar, his father’s brother, has responded to the copy of the manuscript Knausgaard sent him with an email headed “Verbal rape”. Gunnar’s anger and determination to block publication send his nephew into a tailspin, not least because his faith in his own recall of events has been shaken. As Knausgaard frets and calls his editor, Linda and Geir on rotation, it is an unavoidable fact that he must still fry fishcakes for his children’s tea and make sure they watch that day’s episode of Bolibompa.Knausgaard’s rendering of this crisis – the jitteriness, the relentlessness with which he goes over events again and again, his overwhelming sense of transgression and shame – is riveting. He is willing to expose not only his visceral fear, but the almost gauche lack of forethought he has given the matter of publication. In spite of himself, he allows abstractions to flourish: “I\u0026nbspbegan with a\u0026nbspblank page and a will to write,” he explains, “and ended up with the novel as it was. In that there lies a belief in the intuitive that is as good as blind, and from that basis a poetics might be derived, and an ontology too …” Well, possibly so. But a poetics and an ontology are not particularly helpful in the present emergency. There is, however, a far more substantial digression on the horizon, as Knausgaard plunges into more than 400 pages that, by way of an analysis of\u0026nbspthe work of the poet Paul Celan, narrates Hitler’s formative years, the writing of Mein Kampf, the nature of Nazi antisemitism and the development of the industrial killing of Jews.It is a departure at once strikingly bold and utterly bizarre. Occasionally, it is also breathtakingly banal: “But what was World War I all about?” the author muses, to which the short answer might be: here’s a\u0026nbspcopy of Barbara Tuchman. But gradually it begins to shift into focus and to illuminate Knausgaard’s project. His fascination with Mein Kampf becomes inextricably linked with his anxieties about his own work, its style, its significance: “The fact that his prose renders everything small is not to say that Hitler’s feelings in respect of the things he described were small, nor indeed that those things in themselves were small,” he writes.Everywhere is the suspicion that Hitler’s commitment to his work, his “mythologisation of the essentially quotidian”, is psychic compensation for his inadequacies and his feelings of being disconnected from the rest of society. Knausgaard dwells on the disruptions of Hitler’s teenage years, trying to pinpoint the moment that an awkward, serious adolescent became a nascent dictator, but it is hard to read his earnest ponderings without calling to mind the boy we encountered in\u0026nbspA Death in the Family, the\u0026nbspfirst volume of Knausgaard’s magnum opus.Throughout the series, the issue of Min KampMein Kampf has hovered disquietingly, but now it emerges more fully as an expression of fear: what if Knausgaard too is a monstrous narcissist, a fanatic, a\u0026nbspman capable of crossing a line without, perhaps, even realising it? The End is a kind of reckoning with that terror, both on a practical level – writing into the story the consequences of publication, from legal manoeuvrings to his wife’s depression – and a more amorphous one. How do you know, Knausgaard asks,\u0026nbspwhat damage has been done to you, and what damage you are doing?Every changed nappy, every cigarette smoked on the balcony, every cup of coffee poured from that damn vacuum jug – and seriously, who could read this\u0026nbspbook without being fundamentally lowered every time Knausgaard reaches for the Thermos? – is another alibi the creation of the normal life that distracts from the roiling mess within. He knows it, we know it we are locked in a claustrophobic folie à deux.Except now, of course, it is over Knausgaard, by his own declaration, is free and so are we. That we cannot quite name what we’ve experienced is part of the brilliance of its failure, and how could it do anything other than fail? “The regulatory mechanism,” he writes, “is shame.” But once you have named shame, will another kind of life come into view?

These customers were overcharged by £782,450, according to Ofgem.It also said British Gas wrongly informed 2.5 million customers that exit fees were chargeable during the 49-day switching window and incorrectly charged exit fees totalling £64,968 to 1,698 fixed-deal customers.Ofgem, which opened its investigation in July last year, said before it had concluded its investigation British Gas refunded all customers overcharged by more than £1 and paid out £502,633 in compensation to them. The provider has also agreed to pay a further £244,770 in compensation to customers wrongly charged exit fees and the standard variable tariff and pay £1.1m into Ofgem’s consumer redress fund.Anthony Pygram, the director of conduct and enforcement at Ofgem, said: “British Gas failed its customers who were coming to the end of their fixed contracts and switched supplier by unfairly penalising them and applying charges in error. Many more customers could have been deterred from getting a better deal due to the incorrect terms and conditions.”He added: “Our enforcement action against British Gas sends a strong message to all suppliers that they must respect their customers’ rights during the switching window and always treat customers fairly.”Ofgem said the system error at British Gas that led to customers being rolled on to more expensive rates also led to 18,095 customers who decided to switch being wrongly charged at a cheaper rate.British Gas has since corrected its terms and conditions for customers to make clear they would not be charged exit fees during the switching window and changed its procedure for providing this information. It also agreed to appoint an external auditor to review the relevant policies and procedures and has committed to implement its “reasonable” recommendations.A Centrica spokesman said: “A system error led to a small proportion of customers being incorrectly charged. We’ve apologised to the customers affected. Those who were charged too much were promptly refunded as soon as we identified the issue and were paid an additional goodwill gesture.“Some customers were provided with initial communications containing incorrect terms and conditions – but all other communications they received were correct.”Ofgem said that under licence conditions, energy customers are generally entitled to switch at any time during or after the so-called switching window without having to pay an exit fee.The switching window is designed to encourage customers to switch to a better deal before they are rolled on to a default tariff at the end of their contract."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ded4692d2f75a9641d092a745452f99d59a50e3/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c9b2f76d1f25fd0f835268ead05ff56","title":"uk shop prices rise for the first time in more than five years","story":"Spell of unusually cold winter weather followed by heatwave pushes up cost of fruit and vegBritain’s shop prices have risen for the first time in more than five years as the heatwave pushed up the cost of fruit and vegetables.The lowest rate of deflation for non-food items for more than five years also led to the return of shop price inflation, according to the shop price index.The figures come as concerns grow that consumers may face a food price shock over the coming months.It estimated that households could see food bills rise by about £7.15 a month.Farmers have also been hit by rising costs of oil and agricultural products on global markets, according to the British Retail Consortium.Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the BRC, said: “Despite significant increases in costs in the supply chain, this month’s figures show that retailers are keeping price increases faced by consumers to a minimum.“However, current inflationary pressures pale in comparison to potential increases in costs retailers will face in the event the we leave the EU without a deal.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/679fbd1f9ba4c7c1913a7f0c897f8030d5982c81/0_0_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c801fd3e5199b174aca2ba4c0c7fe3f","title":"flint michigan story modern american city photo essay zackary canepari","story":"Photographer Zackary Canepari arrived in Flint in 2012, before a scandal about tainted water brought the city to international attention. For six years he has documented a place of struggle, and strengthFlint is a city long infamous for poverty, crime, and more recently the water crisis that has plagued people here for four years. It seems everyone in America knows what to expect when they hear the name Flint: economic, political and social dysfunction. Flint is a place of struggle, but that’s not all it is.For the last six years I’ve been working in Michigan on the Flint is a Place project. It’s an immersive e into a city that is more layered and nuanced than commonly portrayed, telling the story of a community living on the fringes. After 40 years of economic struggle, Flint is a place where the abnormal has become normal.In the 1980s, Flint had the highest median income for under-35s in America. Today it has one of the lowest. The city has consistently been on the FBI’s top 10 most violent list and has the highest ratio of abandoned homes in the country. Over four decades it went from living the American dream to an American nightmare.The water crisis continues, and Flint just shut one of its last remaining high schools. Things have not got better, but there are still people fighting for change.As the water crisis was unfolding, these police cadets were being trained to deal with civil unrest at the Mott Police Academy. The Flint Police Department is barely holding it together. A decade of budget cuts has decreased their number from nearly 300 to fewer than 100 officers as crime continued to increase in a city of 100,000. It’s the lowest ratio of officer to citizen of any comparable city in America.The officers are disgruntled. They feel overwhelmed and under-appreciated. The veterans, many of whom are from Flint, have endured numerous pay cuts and layoffs and have watched their city decay. The younger officers, who haven’t been around long enough to feel loyalty to the city, are leaving to join other departments that pay better and include a real pension.Officer Bridgette Balasko was eating breakfast and watching the post-presidential election coverage before heading to work in 2016. “I didn’t know who I wanted to vote for. I didn’t want to vote,” she told me. “I didn’t want to vote for either candidate because I thought they were both terrible.”These people were handcuffed after police raided a house of drug users. The raid was performed by the crime area target team (Catt), a “zero-tolerance” unit created to focus on drugs and guns in Flint. The raid didn’t yield much – a handful of drug users but not much product. This particular house has been raided multiple times by the police, but they’re unable to evict the owners.In 2014, the city started drawing its drinking water supply from the Flint river, without using lead corrosion controls. Despite public outcry, city officials insisted the water was safe to drink. It wasn’t, and a public health crisis ensued. By 2015, the water crisis became national news.One-year-old Hazel Eilber was being given a bath by her grandmother, Sabrina. She would only bathe Hazel in bottled water because she feared that even touching the tap water could make her sick. Sabrina has since moved out of Flint, vowing never to return.On election day in 2016, friends and family came to pay respects to Montel Kenyatta Wright, 46, who had been killed in a drug deal two weeks earlier. Wright was one of three homicides in Flint that weekend.During the summer, Bluebell Beach is full of families and people having barbecues, but it is also well known for fights and violence. Over the last few years the parks department has made it more family-friendly by increasing security and police patrols, extending the play area and installing a big fountain for kids to play in. The crime and related problems have decreased, and there are now more families around. Locals participate in an environmental rally and sermon at the First Trinity Missionary Baptist Church with Flint mayor Karen Weaver, Russell Simmons (co-founder of hip hop music label Def Jam) and a number of national pastors. Simmons is one of a number of high-profile celebrities who have visited Flint since the water crisis became national news.This was the last football game played at Northwestern High School before the school merged its athletics programme with Southwestern, the only other high school in Flint. Both schools have had an ongoing problem with low enrolment numbers and poor facilities. The schools hope that joining forces will help to tackle the issue. These graduating seniors are affected by generational poverty and a lack of resources. The city has one of the highest unemployment rates in the country. The students from Northwestern are proud and strong, but they undeniably also have the odds stacked against them.I’d been working with the police department for months and scenes like this were fairly typical. The Catt squad was investigating a call about drugs being sold on this block. In this case, they didn’t find anything and the guys were let go.Flint is at the frontline of so many important themes in America: poverty, race, infrastructure, education, crime, corporate greed, unemployment. I first went there in 2012 to work on a documentary film about Olympic boxer and Flint native Claressa “T-Rex” Shields. I found a community that was far more charismatic and switched on than what had been portrayed in the media. Flint is a complicated place. On one side it’s deep in struggle and tragedy on the other it has a strong, resilient spirit.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c93184f202f8b7db97a3476703a666074cddd12f/0_0_1891_1134/master/1891.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f3a08c629f59a53882475c572c3b2e02","title":"how spanish influenza helped create sweden modern welfare state ostersund","story":"The 1918 pandemic ravaged the remote city of Östersund. But its legacy is a city – and country – well-equipped to deal with 21st century challengesOn 15 September 1918, a 12-year-old boy named Karl Karlsson who lived just outside Östersund, Sweden, wrote a short diary entry: “Two who died of Spanish flu buried today. A few snowflakes in the air.”For all its brevity and matter-of-fact tone, Karlsson’s journal makes grim reading. It is 100 years since a particularly virulent strain of avian flu, known as the Spanish flu despite probably originating in America, ravaged the globe, killing somewhere between 50 million and 100 million people. While its effects were felt everywhere, it struck particularly hard in Östersund, earning the city the nickname “capital of the Spanish flu”.“Looking back through contemporaneous accounts was quite creepy,” says Jim Hedlund at the city’s state archive. “As many people died in two months as generally died in a whole year. I even found out that three of my forbears were buried on the same day.”There were three main reasons why the flu hit this remote city so hard: Östersund had speedy railway connections, several army regiments stationed in close quarters and a malnourished population living in cramped accommodation. As neutral Sweden kept its armed forces on high alert between 1914 and 1918, the garrison town’s population swelled from 9,000 to 13,000.By 1917, when navvies poured in and construction started on an inland railway to the north, widespread food shortages had led to violent workers’ demonstrations and a near mutiny among the army units.The city became a hotbed of political activism. Its small size put the unequal distribution of wealth in early industrial society under the microscope. While working-class families crowded into insalubrious accommodation, wealthy tourists from other parts of Sweden and further afield came for the fresh mountain air and restorative waters – as well as the excellent fishing and elk hunting (passionate angler Winston Churchill was a regular visitor). “Many of the demonstrators’ concerns seem strikingly modern,” says Hedlund, pointing to a copy of a political poster that reads: “Tourists out of our buildings in times of crisis. Butter, milk and potatoes for workers!”It wasn’t just the urban proletariat demanding better accommodation. At Sweden’s first ever national convention of the indigenous Sami peoples held in Östersund in early 1918, delegates demanded an end to discriminatory policies that forced them to live in tents.Social inequality in the city meant the Spanish flu hit all the harder.As the epidemic raged in late August, when around 20 people were dying daily, the city’s bank director Carl Lignell withdrew funds from Stockholm without authorisation and requisitioned a school for use as a hospital (the city didn’t have one). “If it hadn’t been for him, Östersund might quite literally have disappeared,” says Hedlund. For a brief period, Lignell worked like a benevolent dictator, quarantining suspected cases in their homes – and revealing the squalor in which they lived.As his hastily convened medical team moved through Östersund, they found whole families crowded into wooden shacks, just a few streets away from the proud, stone-built civic structures. In some homes, sick children lay on the floor for want of beds.The local newspaper Östersunds-Posten asked rhetorically: “Who would have thought that in our fine city there could be such awful destitution?”People of all political convictions and stations in life started cooperating in a city otherwise riven by the class isions of early industrial society. Östersunds-Posten itself moved from simply reporting on the epidemic to helping to organise relief, publishing calls for money, food and clothing, and opening its offices for use as storerooms. The state had proven itself inadequate, as historian Hans Jacobsson wrote: “The catastrophic spread of the Spanish flu in 1918 was in no small part down to the authorities’ bewilderment and often clumsy reactions.” He cites the fact that Stockholm High Command refused to halt planned military exercises for weeks, despite the fact that regimental sickbays were overflowing. “What is interesting is that, after the epidemic, the state dropped investigations against Lignell and made tentative steps towards a cooperative approach to social reform. Issues such as poor nutrition and housing were on the political agenda,” says Hedlund. Anyone trying to date the inception of Sweden’s welfare state cannot overlook the events of autumn 1918.One hundred years on, there are few better places than Östersund to see the effects of Sweden’s much-vaunted social model. The city is once again growing rapidly, but nothing could seem further away than epidemics and political radicalism. The left of centre Social Democrats have been in power in city hall since 1994, and council leader AnnSofie Andersson has made housing a priority – new developments are spacious, well-ordered and equipped with schools and playgrounds.“There’s nothing that shows confidence like building stuff,” she says. “In fact, our local authority building partnership should, in my view, keep a small excess of flats in hand, because without a reserve people won’t move here.”Östersund attracts a net inflow of people from southern Sweden. “It’s partly a quality of life issue,” says Andersson. “You can drop your kids off at kindergarten in the morning on the way to work and be out hiking or skiing by late afternoon.”The city has recovered from the relocation of the Swedish armed forces fighter jet squadron in the 1990s by playing to its strengths: sports and tourism. A university now occupies the old barracks with a special focus on sports materials and technology. The airbase has become a thriving airport, handling half a million passengers a year.Despite the net inflow of working-age people however, Östersund is facing a demographic challenge as baby boomers begin to retire. The shortages are being felt most acutely at the regional health authority, which occupies the Epidemisjukhus – the building hastily converted into wards during the Spanish flu by Carl Lignell. Clinical staff are proving hard to find and retain, and the region’s health service is underfunded. Some residents still suggest solving that lack of funding from central government “the Jämtland way”, like Lignell once did.History doesn’t repeat itself identically, though. Sweden’s consensus-orientated political model now tends to defuse conflict even in proud cities with a liking for mavericks. One of Andersson’s strategies for dealing with the approaching lack of labour, for instance, is cooperating with local and national institutions to train up the young refugees the city has welcomed since 2015.“School starts tomorrow – for the last time,” confides Karl Karlsson to his journal on 4 September 1918. “I leave in spring and it feels melancholy. I like farming, but I would still prefer to continue at school and study. But it’s impossible.” Ten days later, he notes that his family’s food stores are running low. “We’re almost out of flour and bread, the barley hasn’t dried yet, and we shan’t get any more rations, everything is being requisitioned.” One hundred years later, a city – and a society – once unable to educate or even feed its youth is now one of the world’s wealthiest and fairest.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/993bab86edbe4d18f5af2d988dd6a3eff437775c/0_44_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=038c9502725ce5ec3ef9b4bbc2a7cbdb","title":"palestinian struggle jeremy corbyn zionism","story":"Opposition to Zionism on these grounds is a moral stance, is neither antisemitic nor racist, and is founded on the belief that the creation of Israel has a profound injustice at its roots.Jewish opposition to Zionism has a long and distinguished history. Furthermore, the Palestinian historical narrative has been largely vindicated, in part by Israeli and Jewish historians, and Jewish voices in support of Palestinian rights today abound. Using the charge of anti-Zionism as a tool to silence critics of today’s Israel is the last resort of those seeking to deflect attention away from the egregious path that Israel appears to have chosen. It wants to have it both ways, on the one hand to charge with racism those who conflate anti-Zionism and antisemitism. On the other hand,it accuses those who refuse this conflation, of antisemitism on the grounds that anti-Zionism denies the Jews the right to self-determination. By this token, any criticism of Israel or Zionism becomes a slur on the Jewish people. The insidious goal of the “anti-anti-Zionist” campaign is to silence the Palestinians and their supporters and to smother them with the charge of racism. No one should fall for this or accept it.The question of rooting out antisemitism from Labour or elsewhere is not open to debate. But sympathy for the Palestinians is not antisemitism, and those who stand in solidarity with the Palestinian struggle and its dead have no reason to apologise for doing so. It behoves those who pretend to be offended by such gestures to remember that no side has had a monopoly over virtue in the 100 years of this conflict.They would do well to recall the Jewish terrorist bombings of Arab marketplaces in 1938, the bombing of the King David hotel in 1946, the massacres of Deir Yassin, Illut, Kafr Manda, Saliha, Jish, Safsaf, Hula and other places in 1948, the ethnic cleansing of Lyd and Ramla in 1948, the mass killings in Gaza in 1957, the massacre of Egyptian prisoners in 1956 and 1967, the bombing of an Egyptian children’s school at Bahr el-Baqar in 1970, the shooting down of a Libyan civilian aircraft in 1973, the bombing of Beirut in 1981, the complicity in the Sabra and Shatila massacres of 1982, the killings at Qana in 1996, and the repeated assaults on Gaza since 2005.Be that as it may, it should be clear that the Palestinian case is in no need of any Nazi or any other analogy. It stands soundly on its own moral and political grounds. Those who genuinely sympathise with our cause should understand that evoking the Nazis is not only wrong, but bad politics, as it allows the other side to obfuscate its own crimes while hiding under the mantle of outrage at the very comparison.The Nakba was not a holocaust, and the Israelis are not Nazis. Full stop. But Israel, its armed forces and the pre-state Haganah and Jewish terrorist gangs have all committed heinous crimes, and those who seek to deny or ignore this have no right to be offended by gestures of support for the Palestinian victims of Israel’s continued assaults, or by opposition to Israel’s ideological foundations.The Labour party’s Zionist roots run deep – its intellectuals and party leaders have all been deeply immersed in a Zionistsocialist ethos that has long been bent to defend and serve the Zionist enterprise both pre- and post-state. The party’s 1943 adoption of ethnic cleansing (“let the Arabs be encouraged to move out as the Jews move in”) sent a strong signal to the Jewish leadership as to the boundaries of the possible in Palestine. Today Corbyn stands alone among Labour leaders for his open support of the Palestinian cause. This is a remarkable historical turnabout and one that the Palestinians should be unequivocally grateful for. The trouble is that he has singularly failed to make the case in his own defence. Under a barrage of attacks on the antisemitism issue, he has retreated and backtracked, mumbled and fumbled as if he has something to hide, thereby undermining his credibility as leader and peacemaker alike.Corbyn’s faltering in his own defence is no reason to abandon his principled stance, or for suppressing the debate over Zionism. Indeed, by raising the issue of Zionism and its moral grounding, he has done everyone a favour in spite of himself.• Ahmad Samih Khalidi is a senior associate member of St Antony’s College, Oxford, and co-author of A Framework for a Palestinian National Security Doctrine"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37dab9b3c57ed801cfd831655acabd982a9caec2/0_341_6016_3611/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0def21e4280ea2f15f171a6a0df2e0b","title":"forget profit love fun innovation parkrun","story":"The weekly 5km runs are a global phenomenon. But they were born out of a desire to change lives without charging for itEvery Saturday morning at 9am sharp a little bit of anarchy breaks out across the country. This being Britain, it happens, naturally enough, in our parks. Not that it’s billed as such. It’s meant to be a 5km run, which is why at Richmond Park in south-west London this morning the grass is carpeted with well over 400 people in sports gear. But it has none of the intensity you’d expect at a track or even on a gym treadmill. One woman tugs balloons, to celebrate her 100th run others prepare to push baby buggies or keep pace with their dogs. Although supported by the charity Parkrun, this and the 559 other events across the UK set to start in a few minutes are entirely self-organised.What they share is an ethos. Parkruns are free to all, and all are treated equally. No hierarchy intrudes between the hares and the tortoises, the old-timers and the debs. Members volunteer to mark the course or keep time or to aid stragglers. So early this morning, as the weekend still brims with promise, on these hectares of parkland owned by the Queen, a little anarchist world briefly comes into focus. One devoid of government nagging or corporate profiteering, but reliant instead on mutual aid and human kindness.“It is the new church,” says Karen Weir, who started the Richmond parkrun in 2006. The former City management consultant would give up 10 hours a week just to ensure Saturdays went smoothly for everyone else. “The idea of the community has broken down. People don’t go to church any more. But here, you come together with a load of people – and you feel embedded in the local area.”Even though he’s not running today, Gary Wimbledon is here to meet friends. When the 41-year-old first came with his brother, Steve, back in 2011, he’d never even run for a bus because, being partially blind, he explained: “I’d fall over.” That first go was grindingly hard, but then came the finish line: “Never before have I had people cheering me on. And they were cheering my name! Just thinking about it, I can feel the hairs on the back of my neck stand up.”When he started, Wimbledon carried an extra 60 kilos. Running in Richmond Park helped sort that out, and his depression. A few years into the new pastime he got married – and celebrated with a group parkrun on his wedding day. Now he’s heading for his third marathon.It’s almost nine, and a man hops on to a tree stump to brief us. He welcomes first-timers, and we applaud the volunteers and whoop a husband and wife about to start their joint 250th run. Then it is announced that a regular, Fred Croft, died of cancer the previous Tuesday. Taking the stump, his son tells the crowd that Fred had always loved running in this park, “the varying seasons, the views, the deer”. Most of all, he “talked about parkrun as his family”. James quotes from a race report his dad wrote of the very course we are to run – a fragment from the Old English poem The Battle of Maldon: “Our spirits must be firmer, our hearts stronger  And our courage greater as our strength diminishes.” Heads bow, before the shout goes up: “Let’s run!”Here to break me in for my first parkrun is the man who started it all. By October 2004, Paul Sinton-Hewitt was “in a bad way”. Sacked from his marketing job, he’d also suffered a training injury that ended any hopes of doing a marathon. Isolated and low, his response was “to give something back”: to organise a weekly run around the local park in nearby Teddington, where he would time friends’ runs, before they all had a fry-up. He bought a bag of steel tokens from Halfords, stamped them with numbers and after each race would sit in a Caffè Nero, typing up the results. That was fine at first, when only 13 runners would pitch up. But no one else was putting on a regular free 5k run, and as numbers grew friends would fret. Sinton-Hewitt had no permission from the park, no insurance: he was heading for a mishap of Wile E Coyote proportions.Both “altruistic” and “a complete bugger”, Sinton-Hewitt justified every breach by pointing to the spirit of the races. Free and fun, what harm were they doing? Only now it was no longer diehards running, but mothers with kids – and they were clamouring for runs to be put on in other parks. He had both a big success and a stonking headache.Never an elite runner, Sinton-Hewitt had by accident become a world-class innovator. Today Parkrun is the largest running event on the planet, with more than 1,600 events. The London Marathon may attract the wacky costumes and the BBC scheduling, but last April not many more than 40,000 people finished it – and that was a record. In one good weekend, Parkrun’s adult and junior events pull in more than 235,000 participants around the world within five years that’s expected to hit a million.Innovation is one of the most overused words in business, drizzled across both gold and bullshit. When Subway announced a couple of weeks ago that market research would help it to – gasp! – tweak its menu, it said: “Global innovation is key to driving our brand forward, and we are disrupting the way we’ve traditionally managed the process.” When Sports Direct featured this summer in a list of international shopping chains, it rushed out a press release highlighting the “top five list of global innovative retailers”, with quotes from somebody called the “head of elevation”. That Marks \u0026amp Spencer cauliflower steak? You just know that some ideas meeting at head office signed it off using the i-word.For the right, innovation is a private sector virtue – one that you and I must encourage by paying a lot of money. Last tax year, businesses claimed tax relief on research and development worth £3bn, according to estimates from Her Majesty’s Revenue \u0026amp Customs. That is more than Britain spends each year on prisons, and big companies do not even have to pay corporation tax to qualify. Then there are the special handouts, such as the £5m George Osborne hoped to collar for AstraZeneca’s Alderley Park research centre in Cheshire, just a few months before the pharmaceutical giant closed it down.Others argue that it’s the government that enables radical innovation. Think of space programmes and arms manufacturing, or look at your smartphone in which, as the economist Mariana Mazzucato observes, all the smartest bits were first developed in US government labs.Where both left and right agree is that innovation is about lab coats and metal-bashing, Silicon Valley and science. In other words, it looks nothing like my slight and softly spoken running partner, who is even now encouraging the two women behind us to overtake.In those early years, Sinton-Hewitt had to write his own software, get permission from park officials who’d never heard of such a thing, devise an entire ethos for this movement he’d started. “I wanted to disrupt things, I wanted to take on all the people making so much money out of running.” In his more lucid moments, Elon Musk might say something similar – except, unlike other innovators, Sinton-Hewitt wasn’t seeking profit, or on a government payroll.Parkrun started in the same year as Facebook, and Sinton-Hewitt could by now be sitting on a mountain of money to rival Mark Zuckerberg’s. But he has what the organisation’s chief executive, Nick Pearson, describes as “the strongest moral code of anybody I’ve ever come across”. When I ask where that comes from, Sinton-Hewitt pauses and coughs that it’s a long story.Born in Zimbabwe, but raised in South Africa, he was put in a home at five after his parents split. He was tiny – “until I was about 16 I weighed only 60lb” – and was beaten and bullied by the other boys. They hanged him from his neck, slashed him from ear to ear, and threw darts at his back. “You were never allowed to show emotion” – so at first he appeared calm and driven, but in 1995, a few years after coming to Britain, he had a breakdown. It is from those experiences that he traces the ethic that underpins Parkrun: “I treat everyone as I would treat myself give everyone the right to do what they want.”The status we give people like Musk and James Dyson has long historical roots. We might trace them back to 1911, and a book written by an Austrian economist sometimes called “the prophet of innovation”. Joseph Schumpeter was just 28 when he published The Theory of Economic Development, but its arguments are made with bone-rattling certainty. When it came to how innovation happens, he saw a hierarchy: “It is … the producer who as a rule initiates economic change, and consumers are educated by him if necessary they are, as it were, taught to want new things.”A century later, innovation no longer inevitably rolls downhill, nor does change always come from the centre. If you want to read up on a subject right now, you’ll probably go to the fifth most visited website in the world, Wikipedia. It has just 300 staff and contractors but tens of thousands of unpaid users who write and edit its pages. By comparison, Yahoo! – the sixth most popular website – still has 8,600 full-time staff.If you want to get rid of your old table or cot, you might advertise it on your local Freecycle board. The world’s largest nonprofit recycling network, Freecycle has 5,000 gifting groups with 9.4 million members in 110 countries, including the Palestinian Authority. The global HQ for this vast operation is in Tucscon, Arizona, and has a grand total of two employees, including the chief executive. (They share the office with two other nonprofits, and if you ring, the CEO has to go outside so as not to disturb anyone.) They rely on 2,000 or so moderators, who run their boards for their communities for free.And if you fancy jogging 5km next Saturday, you might go on a parkrun, whose core organisation is just 23 people working on an island in the Thames, in an office reached by walking through a boat yard. The only reason those runs happen is because of the 1.1m hours given by Karen Weir and other volunteers around the world over the past 12 months – work that won’t show up in the GDP data because no money changes hands.“I know what it means to have targets and to sell. I get all that,” says Sinton-Hewitt. “But there is another economy here. An economy of helping people be the best they can be, to change their lives and to grow as iniduals.”Wikipedia and Parkrun are both examples of “people’s innovation”, according to Steve Flowers at the University of Kent’s business school. They’re driven by users rather than producers, by volunteers rather than professionals they’re horizontal rather than hierarchical, and they’re not primarily about making money. What drives these citizen innovators isn’t pay, but purpose: to have fun, gain work experience or just help others. This is an inversion of how we have come to think of work – it is more the gentle anarchism that you see in your local park every Saturday.Flowers sees examples of this spirit everywhere, from open-source software to the reviews posted on TripAdvisor to the way games-maker Valve encourages users to modify its software. “It’s the invisible industrial revolution,” he says. “It’s hiding in plain sight, and once you see it, it totally changes the way you look at innovation today.”In his book Postcapitalism, Paul Mason writes with persuasive urgency about how this bottom-up economics could topple our existing order. Yet in the shorter run it may not challenge capitalism, but sit alongside it. You wouldn’t want a bunch of enthusiasts to design your local nuclear power station – but you might welcome their thoughts on how to reform social care reform.At Sheffield University, Richard Jones points out that drug companies have spent tens of billions over decades on a cure for Alzheimer’s. The success rate so far has been zero. “For at least the next decade or two, practical advances to mitigate the condition are as likely to come from the informal innovation of patients and their carers and we ought to be doing much more to support that.”Just as Gary Wimbledon promised, we are greeted with cheers at the finishing line. Sinton-Hewitt kindly refrains from letting on how much harm I have done to his run record. The number one thing sceptics ask him about parkrun is “Where’s the trick?”. “They think it’s too good to be true, but right from the beginning I decided this was going to be a beautiful, pure enterprise. There would never be a trick.”• Aditya Chakrabortty is a  columnist and senior economics commentator• This article was amended on 29 August 2018. An earlier version said that Parkrun had more than 400 events that figure is more like 1,600. In addition, the 235,000 adults and juniors taking part on a good weekend, are from around the world, not just in the UK as an earlier version suggested."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/278eef519fc38da5eb5ac561a30a5130e9a0cb0a/0_129_5100_3061/master/5100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a6e11cfcd0fee9f468cf9b450cc573b2","title":"london north midlands wages quality of life","story":"The number leaving London for the Midlands or the north has tripled since 2010. Wages may not be so high, but the quality of life is worth itI always wanted to live in London. I grew up in Lancashire, but my best friend’s father lived in the capital and we would sometimes go and visit. He was the only person I had ever met who ate out for breakfast, and he did so every day, ordering poached eggs at a Kensington cafe called Dino’s. He dined out most nights too, and when he came up north, could not believe that everywhere stopped serving food by 8pm. He lived in a basement, which I thought was incredibly sophisticated – no one I knew even lived in a flat. I was determined to live this decadent, metropolitan life and I did, for much of my 20s. It was mega.But by the time I reached 31 I was still living in a one-bed apartment, sleeping in the same room as my wet laundry and dreaming of an outdoor washing line. The novelty of being able to eat dinner any time of the night had worn off. I wanted to live like a grown-up, even if that meant accepting a gastronomic curfew. Fed up of living like a student when friends back home were having their second babies, I moved to Greater Manchester. I was not alone. Research from estate agents Hamptons International found the proportion of Londoners leaving the capital for northern England or the Midlands had tripled since 2010.The average Londoner quitting the capital pays £424,610 for their new property, which, as my colleague Patrick Collinson pointed out, buys a large detached house in a good Birmingham neighbourhood – or a two-bed flat above a shop in east London. My four-bedroom house in a Stockport suburb cost less and I can see Kinder Scout from my bedroom window. It’s 20 minutes on the train to Manchester: albeit on a Pacer, a screeching, juddering bus on rails which went out of service in London many moons ago.People love this stuff: Collinson’s report was the third best read article on the  website on Monday, beaten only by news of a former Spice Girl entering rehab and the discovery of a miracle diet pill. Northerners like to feel smug, with their spare rooms and driveways, even if they are stuck up a career cul-de-sac. Londoners – Rightmove and Zoopla addicts to the last – will read anything to do with house prices.I presented a report for Radio 4’s Broadcasting House on Sunday asking whether London was going out of fashion for young people. In it, Siân Berry, a Green member of the London Assembly, said that prices in the capital had got so crazy that “unless you’ve got a very good reason to be in London, you will be looking elsewhere”. She mentioned one big company in the capital that had bought up an entire building to rent out affordable homes to its graduate recruits.But Jack Brown, a senior researcher at the Centre for London, a thinktank advocating for the capital, thinks the London exodus is old news. “For decades, people have been leaving London when they reach their 30s. For a long time now London has grown because of international migration,” he told me.Yet his bosses are sufficiently concerned that earlier this year he was dispatched on a listening tour around Britain, asking senior leaders in Manchester, Glasgow, Cornwall and Boston in Lincolnshire about London. Just over two-thirds of his interviewees had lived in the capital previously. Pretty much the same proportion said they never would again. “Even on their salaries they said they would have to sacrifice on quality of life if they moved back,” said Brown.Unless significant powers are devolved to the provinces we will never be like Germany, where national media organisations and the biggest businesses are based outside the capital, paying top whack for talent.Moving back north I swapped career progression for a nice view and the ability to park outside my own house. I’ve never regretted it.• Helen Pidd is North of England editor of the "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30cf27b0697a81679c4e40b1652ff37b5dbfbcba/0_143_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=004e4075e01ba92a61748ae94a466e97","title":"lower flag john mccain shared rituals grief genoa","story":"The list of people with more dignity than Donald Trump grows by the day. This week we can add football fans. On Sunday, supporters of Genoa spent the first 43 minutes of their team’s match against Empoli in almost unbroken silence, to remember the 43 people who died when a bridge collapsed in the city. The next day, the White House churlishly raised the stars and stripes which had been standing at half-mast for senator John McCain, when the convention is for it to remain lowered until the funeral.Trump soon bowed to criticism and quietly lowered the flag once more. Both this reversal and his initial refusal to grant his dead adversary a customary honour are tacit acknowledgments that such rituals matter. Communal commemorations may take arbitrary or even baffling forms, but they have an important role to play in civic life.Take, for instance, the way in which politicians pay sombre tribute to the very people they were savaging when alive. This is often derided as hypocrisy, but it is right and fitting that when the reaper calls, we call truces. Life is full of conflict and struggles, all of which expire when we do. By suspending our hostilities when opponents die we give ourselves a chance to stop, think and make sure that we are not bringing more animosity to our dealings with others than we must. Tributes to our adversaries are at their best sincere acknowledgments that however ided we are, we are united in the frailty of the human condition.This is another thing better understood in football stadiums than in the Oval Office. Like most football fans, supporters of Bristol City do not typically express loving kindness towards their local rivals. But still, when nine-year-old Bristol Rovers supporter Bailey Cooper died of non-Hodgkin lymphoma last Christmas Eve, City fans applauded him for a full minute as his picture was put on the display boards at their next home game.The way we temporarily unite in death is also striking evidence that we do not live in as much of an atomised, inidualistic society as it sometimes seems. When the Notting Hill Carnival fell silent for 72 seconds on Monday to remember the victims of the Grenfell Tower fire, the crowds were acknowledging that the tragedy was a collective loss. Society is a network of iniduals and when you rip out a part of it, the hole in the whole is palpable.It’s not that we all feel each other’s pain deeply. Intense grief is for people we know and love. Communal grief is something different: a brief, solemn pause to remind us of our shared mortality and the preciousness of life. I don’t think it’s a coincidence that many rituals around this involve a cessation of ordinary life – a silence, a lowering of the flag – and then, just as importantly, a marked return to normality. The flag goes back up, the crowd roars, the show goes on. Far from exaggerating our depth of feeling for others, the modesty and simplicity of such ceremonies has an unsentimental honesty.Compare this with the post-Diana trend for people to go on a pilgrimage to a death scene and leave something behind like a flower, a hand-written message or a teddy bear. Here there is a mismatch between the ostentatious display of grief and the lack of personal relationship with the deceased, as though the mourner’s life has really been changed by the passing of a stranger. In place of an understated, genuinely shared memorial the focus, is on each inidual, one by one, taking turns to have their own moment with the dead. In more traditional forms of remembrance, it’s not about what you do. We’re all the same, standing silent together. That’s why it’s good that we don’t choose our own way to remember but do whatever is done, however, arbitrary, being it lower a flag or observe a silence.One way in which public commemorations have evolved positively is that they are performed as much, if not more, for ordinary people as for the great and the good. It is right and proper that those who made extraordinary contributions to society receive special treatment, but as Warwick says in Shakespeare’s Henry VI, “Why, what is pomp, rule, reign, but earth and dust?  And, live we how we can, yet die we must.”The democratisation of public remembrance in which citizens and senators alike are mourned is in keeping with the reality of death as the great leveller. A flourishing society depends on the contributions of both the democratic many and the exceptional few. The passing of both merits the pausing of civic life for sober, quiet, shared reflection.• Julian Baggini is a philosopher and the author of A Short History of Truth"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef39efbc595bdc5e6e2369190bfdf4d6a0328028/0_43_4374_2624/master/4374.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=17d9d144abc9add639ca3d1c3e0a51f8","title":"menopause cafes women creative surge","story":"Menopause Cafes are springing up across Britain as women spread the word about how productive later life can beStraight out of university, landing a job as a junior curator at the Royal Museum of Scotland, I was lucky enough to have a female boss. Clever, confident and with one eye determinedly fixed on her progress up the steep incline of the civil service ladder, she was everything I aspired to be. She leaned in, decades before Sheryl Sandberg thought to do the same.Although desperate to impress her, I quickly lost any professional credibility in her eyes when I was forced to petition her for time off because my periods were abnormally heavy. Once a month, I would appear at her office, deathly pale, practically passing out as a result of extreme blood loss, yet she begrudged sending me home. One time, she explicitly told me I was letting the feminist side down. That stung.This was in the late 1980s. I am thrilled that today my former boss’s mind-over-matter brand of feminism looks distinctly shabby for failing to take account of women’s lived experience – their bodily reality. Today’s feminists are much more inclined, if not to make a virtue of biology (personally I stop short of an out-and-out celebration of monthly bleeds, or a revelling in labour pains), then at least to make political grist of the practical accommodations that our bodies demand.I was reminded of my former boss when I read about Andrea Davies’s initiative to make menopause a\u0026nbspregular topic of conversation with male colleagues: the female body – once a source of shame, its outlaw flesh forever misbehaving, oozing, bleeding, backfiring and renegading – at long last accorded a little respect. Davies, an academic at Leicester University, wants to encourage men to mention menopause several times a\u0026nbspday, as a female-friendly mantra designed to overcome their natural shyness. In the interests of solidarity, she has instituted a Menopause Cafe at work, where co-workers gather over cake to compare notes about the way hot sweats, aphasia (language problems), insomnia, dry vaginas and the ins and outs of HRT might affect women’s sense of wellbeing at work. Male colleagues wanting to better understand how to support their female partners are warmly welcomed.Menopause Cafes are a thing. Already this year 14 have been set up by working women across the UK, from Perth to Petersfield, following the lead of their founder, Rachel Weiss, a counsellor who was inspired to emerge from the menopause closet after watching Kirsty Wark’s televised struggles with her own\u0026nbspsuddenly wayward biology. But do Menopause Cafes do enough? Wark is not alone in coming forward to discuss menopause. Kate Garraway, Gillian Anderson and Emma Thompson are among a\u0026nbspsmall army of high-profile women who have made a\u0026nbsppoint of outing menopause. Kim Cattrall became a\u0026nbspposter girl for menopause with her series Sensitive Skin, as did Angelina Jolie after publicising the elective double mastectomy and oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries) that plunged her into early menopause.Jolie, 39 at the time, remarked: “I feel at ease with whatever will come, not because I am strong, but because this is a part of life. It is nothing to be feared.” I thought this statement perfectly picked up on women’s apprehensions over menopause while at the same time dismissing simple-minded notions of female empowerment. As I argue in my memoir The Middlepause, the kind of cheerleading that insists we can become strong by embracing menopause does women few favours, since it makes those of us who suffer and struggle with it feel cowed by failure and self-recrimination. We have a right to complain, damn it.Still, a combination of top-down and grassroots activism, combined with renewed awareness of women’s vulnerability in the workplace – a byproduct of the #MeToo movement – goes a long way towards improving the treatment of menopausal women in professional life. The key is understanding that accommodating women’s biology does not equate with compromise. Men, your female colleagues are not operating under a handicap!The next step perhaps is to recognise that we are all of us embodied. It is the human condition. But we are not just meat machines, our bodies mere locomotive vehicles for carrying our minds around. Our physical selves interact with the world at every level.They are the prime sensors of pleasure and pain, heat and cold. We learn about our environment through our bodies, acquiring a sense of the world we inhabit – how it invites or inhibits our interaction. Our bodies “remember” how to play the piano or ride a bike they “know” when to cross a busy road. We possess a bodily understanding of whether we have enough spring in our jump to take that narrow bend in a stream. And anyone whose hand has unconsciously caught a\u0026nbspfalling object dropped from a table top has direct experience of the mysterious way the body navigates its immediate surroundings, without us being the least aware of its proprioceptive talents.The philosophical underpinnings of the new materialism may not have yet trickled into everyday feminist thinking, but there are plenty of vocal and visible women on the comedy circuit and in popular culture, from Hannah Gadsby to Loose Women, making bodily functions a part of ordinary conversation.Every woman is inidual, of course, and will experience menopause differently. But in my experience, most feel a surge of creative energy in midlife that is directly at odds with the physical and psychological debilitations of menopause. Multitasking like dynamos from dawn to dusk, they are receptive, inventive and curious, while bringing a depth of knowledge to whatever problems work throws their way. It is a shortsighted employer indeed who does not capitalise on this energy surge (what the anthropologist Margaret Mead termed “zest”) that their silverback staff are riding high on – into\u0026nbsptheir 60s and beyond.• Marina Benjamin is the author of The Middlepause"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0a9fbf7db87375967245f63df2a215e38b137d9/0_0_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b7bdc1e71d5c1f619eb0b25cb2116d7","title":"should i get a tattoo you asked google heres the answer","story":"Every day millions of people ask Google life’s most difficult questions. Elle Hunt, a  editor, answers one of the commonest queriesI got my first tattoo 14 months ago. I see it every day except when I am especially absentminded in washing myself. Yet, still, the sight of it takes me by surprise.A tattoo does not inspire trepidation in everyone. My colleague – with whom I authoritatively talked through the pros and cons – seems to have easily acquired four or five tattoos in a matter of months. But for years I couldn’t get past the question: “What if I regret it later?”People do – at the very least, the 1,000 of them in the UK who were recently surveyed about it for Casino.org. A fifth said they’d spent “no time at all” settling on the tattoo they now regret. Star constellations, Asian characters and tribal designs in particular – and especially on the lower back – did not age well beyond a split-second decision.My younger sister and I had long talked about getting a shared tattoo to commemorate the sailing holidays of our childhood. Jess already had a yacht on her ankle, acquired during her gap year in Spain. She’d been given a discount because the apprentice had done it. “Bargain,” she’d told me triumphantly. I thought, at the time, that it was not a purchase that I personally would be looking to scrimp on.She outdid herself with her second, when her then-boyfriend’s colleague revealed himself to be an aspiring tattooist at a work drinks. He later demonstrated his skill back in the office after-hours, on a massage table, I think – my memory of the details is hazy, as is Jess’s. The succulent plant on the back of her calf is somewhat more precise.Another tattoo would be no big deal for her. For me, however – so fundamentally risk averse that as a child I got down on all fours to traverse cracks in the pavement – my first felt momentous. Yet I’d always entertained the idea in a vague, indulgent way. I think many people do, even if they never act on it.For years I noted down symbols and imagery I gravitated towards. A protea. A tornado. “PRE FTN”, an acronym that, reviewing the long list of possibilities today, I am at a loss to decipher. Jess and I periodically revisited the idea of “sister tatts”, often instigated by her sending me a possible concept she’d sketched herself.“What about this?” she asked of a highly detailed pen drawing of a flying fish that, on a conservative estimate, would run from elbow to wrist.“Uhhh,” I wrote back, “maybe something smaller.”The bar that every potential design was assessed against was “forever”. Forever was a long time. I thought back to bands I’d obsessed over in high school that I now felt deeply embarrassed to have even passing knowledge of. Better to have written “DAVE GROHL IS GOD” in Tipp-Ex on your pencil case than permanently on your body.But as the idea settled in my mind, the unequivocal indelibility of a tattoo became a selling point. I was 26 and about to move as far away from my family as I’d ever been. I was leaving a permanent job for a contract I was not in a relationship I was nowhere near home ownership, or even dog ownership.There wasn’t much in my life that felt permanent, and it had recently dawned on me that maybe there never would be. For the first time a tattoo felt like a desirably declarative statement, a steadying stake in the ground. It was not often that I agreed with Lena Dunham, but her explanation for her tens of tattoos appealed: “I think it gives me a sense of control and ownership of a body that’s often beyond my control.” Not just a body. A life.After much back and forth, Jess and I eventually found a compromise between our different aesthetics and bravery levels, with a design referencing our maritime history and my own newfound commitment to embracing the unknown. It would last forever, yes – but the act of going through with it would be inoculation against overthinking, and the result would be a constant amid change.The week before I was due to leave the country, Jess and I took a road trip to visit our parents. We stopped at a cafe, where she sketched a design on a napkin based on a few I’d found on Instagram, while I made a phone call to an artist she’d found. Six hours later, we were in a basement tattoo studio, and Jess was gingerly sliding off the table, her ribs lined with black and red after what had seemed a sometimes gruelling 90-minute session. It was my turn.The artist traced the same design on to my side in temporary ink, and I reviewed it in the mirror. It looked bigger than I’d pictured. “How much smaller could you make it without losing any of the detail, d’you think?” I asked the artist, my pitch a semitone higher than that of a casual inquiry. Jess rolled her eyes. “Don’t worry,” I said quickly.I couldn’t back out now. Not when Jess had paid full price.The next morning I was quietly shocked by the sight of my new reflection. It seemed outrageous that something so significant – harder to overturn than a marriage, in some ways more intimate than sex (certainly longer lasting) – could be procured for mere money. For a moment I intensely regretted what I’d done. But only a moment.Because I wear clothes and keep my arms down by my sides in all but exceptional circumstances, my tattoo mostly goes unseen and unremarked upon. I sometimes have a flash of surprise on noticing it in the mirror: “What is THAT?” then “Oh, yes, that.”Before I got a tattoo, I would have thought that at this juncture I’d pause, even for a second, to reflect on its significance – to dig out the kernel of truth at its core to carry with me in the coming day. I’d thought a tattoo would act like a meditation prompt – that’s why it had to mean something.Instead, on the rare occasions I think about it, I wonder how it is that an original line sketch, amalgamating three or four carefully chosen designs to the deliberate exclusion of hundreds of others, could nonetheless end up looking exactly like Hokusai’s Great Wave.Then I think, warmly, without any regret: ah, well.• Elle Hunt is a commissioning and communities editor with  Cities"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b60a02d963c86d119923be00cec03bed0823657a/0_185_4774_2864/master/4774.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b4f8efe2ab91104b371476a34a9eb2c","title":"like nicotine bees develop preference for pesticides study shows","story":"Insects’ acquired taste for pesticide-laced food is similar to nicotine addiction in smokers, say scientistsBumblebees acquire a taste for pesticide-laced food that can be compared to nicotine addiction in smokers, say scientists. The more of the nicotine-like chemicals they consume, the more they appear to want, a study has shown. The findings suggest that the risk of potentially harmful pesticide-contaminated nectar entering bee colonies is higher than was previously thought. In a series of studies, a team of British researchers offered bumblebees a choice of two sugar solutions, one of which was laced with neonicotinoid pesticides. They found that over time the bees increasingly preferred feeders containing the pesticide-flavoured sugar. Dr Richard Gill, from the Department of Life Sciences at Imperial College London, said: “Given a choice, naive bees appear to avoid neonicotinoid-treated food. However, as inidual bees increasingly experience the treated food they develop a preference for it. “Interestingly, neonicotinoids target nerve receptors in insects that are similar to receptors targeted by nicotine in mammals. “Our findings that bumblebees acquire a taste for neonicotinoids ticks certain symptoms of addictive behaviour, which is intriguing given the addictive properties of nicotine on humans, although more research is needed to determine this in bees.” Controversial neonicotinoid pesticides are chemically similar to nicotine, the addictive compound in tobacco. In 2013 the European Union imposed a partial ban on three widely used neonicotinoids because of evidence that they may be harmful to bees. The ban has now been extended to cover all crops not grown in greenhouses, despite strong opposition from some groups including the UK’s National Farmers’ Union. Scientists carrying out the new research tracked 10 bumblebee colonies over 10 days. Each colony had access to its own foraging area in which the researchers had set up sugar-dispensing feeders. Lead scientist Dr Andres Arce, also from Imperial’s Department of Life Sciences, said: “Many studies on neonicotinoids feed bees exclusively with pesticide-laden food, but in reality, wild bees have a choice of where to feed. We wanted to know if the bees could detect the pesticides and eventually learn to avoid them by feeding on the uncontaminated food we were offering. “Whilst at first it appeared that the bees did avoid the food containing the pesticide, we found that over time the bumblebees increased their visits to pesticide-laden food. “We now need to conduct further studies to try and understand the mechanism behind why they acquire this preference.” The findings are reported in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Dr Gill added: “Whilst neonicotinoids are controversial, if the effects of replacements on non-target insects are not understood, then I believe it is sensible that we take advantage of current knowledge and further studies to provide guidance for using neonicotinoids more responsibly, rather than necessarily an outright ban.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/306a579a0b89836ac4df5f68a8d3e3052a36b34d/31_53_2495_1497/master/2495.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=07d5c7381f00a65b075c7d170e326935","title":"who are the premier league possession kings in a single match","story":"Plus: repeat results, comedy clubs and referees scoring goals.

What’s the longest run of a team having exactly the same sequence of results to start a season?” asks Paul Oxenbury.Cheltenham ruined a good start when Immanuelson Duku’s last goal gave them a 1-1 draw at Macclesfield in their fourth league game, but a run of three 1-0 defeats to start the season registers high on the consistencyometer.Before we look at teams who have bettered that, we should give a nod to Carlo Ancelotti’s Chelsea, who started the 2010-11 Premier League season with back-to-back 6-0 victories over West Brom and Wigan before their season went to seed.As for the actual question, Oliver Forrest points out that, in 2013-14, Liverpool won their first three Premier League games 1-0, with Daniel Sturridge scoring the winner each time. Dirk Maas, meanwhile, points out that Dynamo Kyiv starts this season’s Ukrainian Premier League would four consecutive 1-0 wins, the same score by which they beat Shakhtar Donetsk in the Ukrainian Super Cup.Can you beat Kyiv’s four consecutive 1-0 wins to start the season?

What could persuade someone to call their pride and joy a carnival union or a foundation of clowns or jesters?” Timo Langlotz has a comprehensive answer to this one. “Mainz and Cologne are sometimes referred to as Karnevalsverein. Both cities are traditionally very busy during carnival season, culminating in huge parades on Rose Monday and Shrove Tuesday. Many cities and towns have one or more actual Karnevalsverein who build floats, organize parades, have special uniforms etc. “FC Cologne, more so than Mainz, has seen a lot of unrest and infighting in the not so distant past. This led to them being called Karnevalsverein, a mocking term indicating they’re a bunch of clowns who can’t be taken seriously. Mainz, financially speaking, are minnows and have been similarly mocked. It’s a bit like calling Newcastle your favourite comedy club.”Mainz, it seems, are happy to laugh at themselves. “The club plays a signature carnival song (the Narrhallamarsch) every time a Mainz player scores a goal at home. An example of this is here. You will probably find that the tune is actually quite lovely.”We’ll let you, dear reader, be the judge of that.“Has a referee ever scored a goal, either accidentally or in more controversial circumstances, in a top-flight European match?” asked Daniel Turner in May 2005.While José Mourinho bitterly claimed “the linesman scored for Liverpool” to win their Champions League semi-final, we haven’t stumbled across any record of such a real incident taking place in the professional game. However, an official did take the law into his own hands during an amateur match in Essex in 2001. Referee Brian Savill volleyed home from a corner, bringing Wimpole 2000 back into their Great Bromley Cup tie against Earls Colne Reserves. Well, sort of Wimpole were 18-1 down before Mr Savill’s intervention. Luckily, players from both teams saw the funny side as Earls Colne clung on for a 20-2 win.The referee said later: “I just signalled a goal and went roaring up the field. Half of the fans were standing in bewilderment, the other half were cheering.” The FA weren’t smiling as they charged Savill with bringing the game into disrepute, giving him a seven-week ban. Savill duly resigned in protest. Referee Gordon Shaw proved far more decisive in the Swindon and District Under-12s league, when he inadvertently scored the only goal of the game between Park Youth Centre and Dorcan Boys. Shaw stuck his leg out at the wrong moment during a goalmouth scramble and put the ball past the stranded Dorcan keeper - and then ruled that his goal had to stand.• For thousands more questions and answers look through our archive.“Which assistant manager has won the most trophies?

After a summer facelift at Forest, there are sky-high expectations but also lingering frustrations at their start to the season. In Karanka, assistant to Mourinho across three years, they have a relaxed, studious coach, determined to imprint his stamp on the club, and depending on whether you are a glass half-full (they are unbeaten) or half-empty (they have won one of their first six matches) punter, Forest are either just getting started or struggling.Karanka knows the state of play after fighting back to earn a 2-2 draw against Birmingham City at the City Ground on Saturday, he said his players cannot keep fooling themselves and that they must start games better, after also rescuing a draw against Wigan the previous week. Their next, against Newcastle United in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday, may provide a welcome distraction.Asked how far away Forest are from reaching top gear, Karanka admits his team need time. “Hopefully it’s as soon as possible, but the aim is always the following game,” he says. “The expectations are really high, not just here in the city but the expectations of Nottingham Forest are really high. We have a plan, we know the plan and we cannot change every single week if we have lost or not played the best.“In the way they are training every day, the way they are approaching the games, you can feel the desire to win games in their faces. One day everything will be perfect and we will win a lot of games, for sure.”It was a summer of sea changes on the banks of the River Trent, with 13 new faces arriving for around £25m, the most high-profile being £13.2m Joao Carvalho, one of the three Portuguese to sign in June. Such investment has stemmed from the backing of the owner, Evangelos Marinakis, the Greek shipping magnate who acquired the club for £50m last year.With the new signings yet to make a splash, some of Forest’s more unfashionable players have delivered, with substitute Joe Lolley scoring a sublime strike with his first touch against Birmingham and Daryl Murphy making a dent in opposition defences. After re-signing Michael Dawson, their former trainee who left for Tottenham Hotspur almost 14 years ago, they have further beefed up their defence with Sam Byram and Michael Hefele.For a Karanka team, Forest have been unusually frail at the back, keeping just one clean sheet so far this season. At Middlesbrough, his tactics were accused of being too defensive. Of Dawson, an injury doubt, the Spaniard says: “Michael hasn’t come here just to be on the bench or in the stands, he did a very good pre-season and to have players like him in this moment when we are not winning and performing as everybody was expecting, it is really, really important.”In attack, they have signed Lewis Grabban, a serial goalscorer in the Championship, plus Hilal Soudani, the Algeria striker, who wears the No 2 shirt and already has as many goals to his name since joining from Dinamo Zagreb, where he played in the Champions League. “It’s normal that he needs time, it’s not the same as the league in Croatia, and intensity is completely different,” Karanka says.There are reasons to be cheerful, reflected by the 20,000-plus season-ticket sales, but patience might ultimately be key. Karanka is not afraid to be ruthless, though, taking off his captain Ben Watson midway through the second half against Birmingham. “When I have to pick the team, I forget their names, I forget their CVs, I forget everything,” he says.Over the season, Forest should see the best of graduates of their revered Nigel Doughty Academy, namely Ben Osborn and Matty Cash, though Ben Brereton, the teenage striker, is poised to join Blackburn Rovers on loan with a view to a £7m move in January before the transfer deadline, while Tyler Walker, son of former England international, Des, and Jorge Grant continue to earn their stripes lower down the football pyramid.It was for Bilbao that Karanka played against Kevin Keegan’s Newcastle in the Uefa Cup in 1994, vying with Andy Cole and Peter Beardsley. As well as providing Karanka, who recently added his younger brother, David, to his backroom staff, the chance to duel with Rafael Benítez, another managerial pragmatist, on the touchline for the first time, Forest have an opportunity to show their real guise against Newcastle.“We will fix for sure, because everybody’s working really hard in the training ground. I have always said, ‘the games a reflection of how you are working in the training ground’. We need to know why and where. I am calm and the players are calm because they trust what they are doing. We need to be ourselves. Newcastle is a big game to show we are good team.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ccefd183c8284b2eefe503a88b81f53b522cf752/0_158_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c9454e2e44d86329ca38c635ee9921d","title":"alexandria little venice egypt climate change frontline","story":"In Alexandria’s ‘Little Venice’, a poor fishing community faces the demolition of its homes and loss of its livelihood thanks to rising seas – and a local government keen to clear its slumsOn the banks of the El Max canal near the Egyptian port city of Alexandria, one man untangles fishing nets in his turquoise-painted boat as the sound of a sledgehammer hitting bricks ricochets down the waterway.Others lean out of their windows on one bank of the canal, staring at the growing piles of rubble of what was once rows of homes on the opposite bank. The previous occupants as well as those looking on are a harbinger of thousands who will be forced to leave their homes due to climate change. Abir Mohamed Abdel-Salam says she doesn’t remember exactly when the canal water first rose above the height of her front window, pouring into her house. “It would reach the top of my thighs,” she says. Black fumes rise overhead from the adjacent petroleum factory. For years, flooding has been a regular occurrence, and now she knows her emergency response by heart.“First I would send someone to turn off the pumps,” she says, referring to the nearby pumping station designed to prevent flooding on an adjacent coastal road, one driven by wealthy Egyptians en route to their summer homes. “Then we would build a fort inside our house with the furniture.” The three tiers of crumbling cement houses in El Max once formed the backbone of a 1,000-strong fishing community. But since March, the local authorities have forced half the residents out of their homes and into bleak tower blocks overlooking the canal they once depended on for their livelihood. Those that remain await the demolition of their homes, gazing at the rubble on the opposite bank as a reminder of what awaits them. Alexandria is a city on the frontline of climate change. According to United Nations figures, even a 50cm sea-level rise will destroy its beaches entirely, while “the Alexandria lowlands – on which the city of Alexandria originally developed – are vulnerable to inundation, waterlogging, increased flooding and salinisation under accelerated sea-level rise”. The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said that global sea levels are expected to rise by as much as 68cm by 2050, flooding parts of Alexandria and seeping into the groundwater. It will also cause building collapses and force saltwater into vital farmland in the nearby Nile Delta region, destroying livelihoods and forcing more internal displacement. The plight of El Max’s residents is an early warning sign, the first wave of thousands who will be forced to move due to the effects of climate change on the area, in particular nearby Lake Mariout. These displaced people will form part of a growing global problem. The UN estimates that since 2009, one person every second has been displaced by a climate-change related disaster. El Max is an unknown corner of the city to many Alexandrians, tucked away between a tangle of concrete overpasses, flat planes of polluted industrial wasteland and dust-choked streets where thick, dark clouds from nearby factories have coated every visible surface. Much of the surrounding area appears almost hostile to human life, despite its placement between the fertile Nile Delta and the Mediterranean coast.The area is known as Alexandria’s own Little Venice, a community of people dependent on the water for their way of life and the rows of pastel-coloured homes that once sustained them. The decades-old informal dwellings are considered “slums” by the local government. The area has also featured in Egyptian film as a place of gangsters and illicit trading, generating rumours of real-world crime.“This is Venice-El Max!” laughs Ahmed Saber, guiding his boat through the soupy brown water on the canal. Pollution from nearby factories has turned it into thick sludge, killing off many of the fish needed for the fishermen to survive. “It feels like Venice – I have a boat like they do in Europe. But it’s all about to be destroyed,” he says, as his boat passes another with rows of teeth painted at the bow to resemble a shark. Saber, like many others in El Max, has repeatedly refuted signs of flooding that are all around them, from layers of rust on the bars on windows and doors to the water-worn steps that run between the houses. It seemed that admitting to the problem meant taking the side of the local authorities, who they said had been threatening the move for several years. But by June this year, when half the community were forced to relocate, some residents were willing to be more open about the flooding. The original problem, explains El Raey, stems from Lake Mariout. “The lake is almost 3m below sea level, so waste water dumping there causes fluctuations in the canal,” he says. “The buildings along the canal are also located below sea level.” The situation is worst in the winter, when the sea level rises.Annual rainfall on Egypt’s coast has recently reached unprecedented levels, such as in 2015, says Dr Khayal Zahra of Egypt’s Coastal Research Institute. “Climate change-related problems meant that the amount of rainfall exceeded 227mm in two days.” The average rainfall had been 250mm a year, for the past 100 years. Excess rainfall exacerbates the rising levels of polluted water in El Max, overloading the nearby pumping station and raising the water levels of the canal until it floods residents’ homes. But the rising waters on Egypt’s coastline will not affect everyone equally: Egypt’s poorest, living on the water’s edge or dependent on its resources, are vulnerable to the first and worst effects of climate change. They are also the authorities’ frequent target for forced relocation plans aimed at alleged illegal construction in areas they seek to reclaim.“The state is working to end the issue of slums by 2022,” says Mohamed Sultan, a spokesman for the governor of Alexandria, referring to a state-wide initiative by President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi to eradicate informal housing, known as ashwiyyet – urban working class centres often associated with both poverty and social discontent. Although several generations of families live in El Max and have paid rent for decades, the government claims the homes were built illegally and that the only solution is forced relocation, and demolition. “The governorate has already started relocating the residents to a much safer area,” says Sultan, in reference to an austere cluster of red and sand-bricked tower blocks. The buildings are closer to the nearby beach, putting them in the path of future rising tides. “The previous houses were considered dangerous for the lives of the residents, as the water level increased and entered the homes, risking the lives of those who lived there,” he says. The governorate insists that a new port will allow residents to fish, and store their equipment. But none of the residents the  speaks to in El Max seem aware of the opportunity, viewing the move as a blow to their way of life and a shove into potential unemployment. They also cite a steep rise in rent, from under £1 a year to almost £9 each month – a sum that is untenable for many. It will mean packing extra family members into homes that residents like Abdel-Salam brand tiny compared with the houses they had before.“The water is an excuse for the government to relocate people,” says Ali Abdel Rahman, a 63-year-old fisherman who sits inside the small blue-and-white-painted hut where he stores his fishing equipment. The room smells of saltwater, and most surfaces are encrusted with either salt, or rust. Outside the shop he sometimes cooks his catch on a small grill, and chats to his neighbours. He is cynical about government promises.“I’m 63. There’s nothing I can do other than fish,” he says. “They say they’re building us new homes – but these houses aren’t homes, they’re just offices,” he adds bitterly. Abdel Rahman, Abdel-Salam and other residents are certain that their lives in the new tower blocks might be a reprieve from the floods, but that the move will tear them away from their way of life. “There, we have a sea view – but nothing else,” says Abdel-Salam.

Flat Tummy Co, an online retailer that had previously existed almost exclusively within the digital confines of Instagram, arrived in New York City like Stanley Kubrick’s Lolita updated into a 21st-century boss babe.The product for sale – 35 calories worth of flavored cane sugar laced with an extract of saffron that supposedly curbs hunger – sparked immediate backlash for a company that had built its brand selling so-called “detox” teas. Good Place actor Jameela Jamil called out Kim Kardashian West for promoting the lollipops to her 116 million Instagram followers (“You terrible and toxic influence on young girls,” Jamil tweeted), and more than 100,000 people signed an online petition calling for the billboard’s removal.Flat Tummy Co’s response has been to keep calm and ’gram on. The company is the ultimate Instagram brand success story: a perfect example of how unregulated social media marketing practices can repackage questionable science in the feelgood trappings of a wellness brand and spin women’s insecurities into cash. And Instagram, which claims to want to be “one of the most kind and safe” places on the internet, has neither the power nor the will to police it.“It’s not a positive message for women, is it? It’s pretty bad,” said one former Flat Tummy Co employee, who spoke to the  on condition of anonymity, about the company’s move into selling appetite suppressants. “The ex-employees are all quite close … Everyone’s just kind of, ‘Ugh, we were a part of that.’”The former employee argued that the outrage toward the Kardashians was misdirected: “Why is no one calling out the company? This isn’t about them. It’s the company that’s the problem.”Flat Tummy Tea debuted on Instagram on 14 June 2013. It took time for the company to develop its current Instaesthetic: the tea was originally sold in transparent plastic bags that showed off the product’s earthiness the label was a purplish blue the font had yet to lose its serifs.But the beginnings of a brand identity were apparent from the outset: aspirational images of beautiful women with tiny stomachs and big butts, before and after shots of customers’ bloated and deflated bellies, and a studied mix of pseudo-feminist millennial boss bitch attitude: mason jar smoothies, jokes about alcohol, girl power slogans, an assortment of healthy-ish dishes, junk food and pink workout gear, and the odd inspirational quote from Nelson Mandela.Laramie Taylor, a professor of communication at UC Davis who researches media and idealized bodies, described the body image the brand promotes – “a very flat and toned stomach but the bust and posterior of someone whose body mass index is considerably higher” – as absurdly unrealistic.“It comes down to this idea of setting expectations for women that are frequently contradictory and impossible to satisfy,” Taylor said.The company was a humble affair at first, according to an interview founders Bec and Tim Polmear gave to a Tasmanian business publication in 2017 (they declined to speak to the ). The tea was reportedly formulated to treat Bec Polmear’s “digestion and bloating”, and they manufactured it in their home garage in Australia with ingredients purchased from a local herbalist.The company’s first coup was a social media post by a popular nutrition blogger from New Zealand. “We had 17 orders in an hour and thought we’d struck gold,” Ted Polmear explained.From there, the company started paying Instagram influencers and built an algorithm that could predict a model’s sales potential, Polmear said. By November 2015, the brand had racked up 500,000 Instagram followers and was sold to Canada’s Synergy CHC Corp for $10m in cash and stock.In interviews with the , two former Flat Tummy Co employees described the process by which the company flooded Instagram with thousands of paid-for posts.Each week, they were tasked with identifying and contacting between 150 and 200 new influencers, with the goal of getting 50 to 60 of them on board for a series of four promotional posts each. The ideal model was a woman with at least 100,000 followers.“They had a rating system, depending on how ‘on brand’ you were,” explained one of the former employees. “You don’t want someone who already has a six pack. You want a mum who is on her fit journey trying to lose weight after having kids.”African American and Latina models were prized because their posts “converted” well into sales, while models were downgraded if they were too “slutty” on the assumption that their followers would be mostly male.“If someone is a little bit bigger, they get a higher rating than if someone’s skinny,” one former employee said. “No one is going to a listen to a skinny white girl say that she bought this tea and it’s great.”Added the other former employee: “If they were sexier, showed a lot of skin, or showed too much boobs, it was like, ‘Don’t pay them, try to get free posts.’”Valentina Barron, a spokeswoman for Flat Tummy Co, told the  by email: “The ambassadors we collaborate with are a mix of all different types of women, because that’s what our customers are. Women can experience bloating, digestive issues or anything else in between no matter what their size.”The former employees said they were pressured to keep the cost of influencer posts down. While the Kardashians reportedly earn six-figure fees for their Instagram ads, the influencers that the former employees worked with were “lucky to get $25 to $50”, one of the former employees said. “You basically had to cut them down and say, ‘You’re not worth that much money.’”Once an influencer agreed to the deal, the staffers would direct how their photos should look and write copy for the captions: “We never expected them to actually use the tea. It just had to look like it.”Barron disputed that point: “We specifically request and most certainly expect, that all of our ambassadors try and love our products. That’s why they’re our ambassadors!”Both employees said they were disappointed with the company’s current direction.“They always used to preach this whole, ‘We’re not a weight loss company. We just want to be healthy,’” one said. “Which has obviously changed with these lollipops.”Flat Tummy Co nevertheless still claims that it cares about “health” above all.“Our brand is all about helping women look and feel like the best versions of themselves and our mission statement is to empower women to lead a healthier lifestyle,” Barron said.But medical and nutritional experts harshly criticized the company’s products and claims.“Dietary supplements sold for detox or weight loss are snake oil, plain and simple,” said Dr S Bryn Austin, a Harvard Medical School professor who specializes in eating disorder risks. “The liver and kidneys already do the the so-called detox and adding junk products into the diet only makes their job harder. And weight loss claims for these products are either outright sham or a result of adulteration of the products with potentially dangerous stimulants, laxatives or diuretics.”Dr Rachel Scherr, a researcher at UC Davis’s department of nutrition, reviewed the ingredients included in Flat Tummy Co’s products at the ’s request, and raised numerous concerns. All the products rely on ingredients that are classified as nutritional supplements, rather than drugs, which means that they are untested and unregulated.Flat Tummy Co’s tea contains senna, a laxative, which Scherr said could help with bloating but could also lead to dependence on laxatives. The company’s meal replacement shakes include “patented and clinically studied Super Citrimax” – an extract of garcinia cambogia, which has been hawked as a miracle weight loss drug by the likes of Dr Oz but which Scherr noted has been “conclusively determined” to have no link to weight loss or fat loss.As for the lollipops, they include Satiereal, which Flat Tummy calls a “clinically proven safe active ingredient”. Scherr pointed out that the study touted by Satiereal’s French manufacturer is from 2010, while a study published in 2018 found “no effects” on weight loss.Scherr also criticized the “tips” for your “health kick” published on the company’s website, which include “Cut back on veggies.”“Does this company really recommend eating fewer vegetables?” Scherr asked. “That is not good advice!”Barron defended Flat Tummy Co in her statement, writing: “We never have, and never will – promote unhealthy eating behaviours or anything of that nature. Every product we’ve created for this brand, and everything we do with this brand, is all about motivating women to make positive, healthy changes in their lives, and our products are designed to give them the boost in the right direction that they might be missing.”To Claire Mysko, the chief executive officer of the National Eating Disorder Association (NEDA), this is nothing but a rhetorical ploy.“There is a shift away from language that explicitly talks about weight loss and a shift toward wellness and lifestyle changes,” she said. “It’s the same old products marketed in new language.”Both Mysko and Taylor, the UC Davis professor, expressed special concern over the marketing of the products on social media, especially since influencer posts are rarely labeled as advertisements, despite Instagram’s creation of a “paid partnership” label.“We’re comparing our real self to someone else’s made-up, photoshopped, carefully composed, idealized self,” Taylor said. “And ultimately that is exactly what the people who want to sell us these products need. They need us to feel bad about ourselves so we buy their product.”Instagram is fully aware of the dangers of spreading unrealistic body expectations. The company has banned various “thinspiration” and pro-eating disorder hashtags, and worked with NEDA on initiatives like an eating disorder help page and eating disorder recovery hashtag.“Every day people come to Instagram to build communities of support, particularly around body image,” spokeswoman Stephanie Noon said in a statement. “We are committed to making Instagram one of the most kind and safe platforms, and we will continue to shed light on the people redefining body image and encouraging body positivity in our community.”Indeed, Instagram has a number of policies designed to combat advertiser efforts to “generate negative self-perception” in order to sell health, fitness or weight loss products. Ads for such products are prohibited from targeting minors and from using “before and after” images or images that feature on “zoomed body parts”.And yet Flat Tummy Co is almost entirely immune to Instagram’s strictures because those policies only apply when an advertiser pays Instagram to promote their posts, not when the advertiser pays an influencer. So Flat Tummy Co can run as many “before and after” shots of zoomed in bellies as it wants – and it runs a lot of them – as long as it doesn’t pay Instagram to boost the posts’ audience. And if Flat Tummy Co wants to target teenage girls, it need only find an influencer with a young fanbase.Asked about this giant loophole, Noon responded, “We are looking at this area closely and trying to understand areas for improvement, so we can help our community navigate this type of content.”In the meantime, the combination of Instagram and Flat Tummy Co remains an astonishingly unhealthy brew.“Personally I will never buy something that has been recommended to me on Instagram,” said one of the former Flat Tummy Co employees. “I just know that there’s someone pulling the strings.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97965039afe8c9d49ef010d1ce0f83e514ff91b8/0_176_3969_2382/master/3969.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d0d04212c600b38be174fbb6ee94dba9","title":"ikea safety recall hob carbon monoxide","story":"I noticed it was on a recall list because of dangerous fumes ... but that was six weeks ago To my surprise, about six weeks ago, I noticed on the Ikea website the kitchen hob I bought from them in 2016 was being recalled.

Campaigners say dozens of local parties have passed motions urging the leadership to back a vote on the final deal.In an email sent to GMB members, the general secretary, Tim Roache, wrote: “GMB wants to hear from members about your views on Brexit, and whether you think there should be a public vote when we know what the deal looks like.”Labour MPs keen for their party to endorse a second referendum hope union leaders, who will meet at the TUC’s annual congress in Manchester, will send a message to the party leadership calling for voters be given the chance to reverse Brexit.Separately, the grassroots pro-Corbyn movement, Momentum, is expected to ballot its members on Brexit in the coming weeks.Mike Buckley, the director of Labour for a People’s Vote, which is organising constituency parties to send motions to the Labour conference, said: “As we approach conference, there’s clearly increasing pressure from the left of the party for a shift in the leadership position.”Buckley’s group is urging constituency Labour parties to pass a motion calling for an immediate general election if parliament rejects the deal, and for that election to be fought on a manifesto that promises a second referendum, with remaining in the EU as an option.It adds that Labour policy should be: “If we cannot get an election, campaign for a public vote and call for an election following a government defeat in that vote.”Unite, whose general secretary, Len McCluskey, is a strong backer of the leadership, passed a motion at its policy conference last month supporting the “possibility” of a “popular vote” on Brexit.Several of the smaller unions, including the Royal College of Nursing and the steelworkers’ union, Community, have come out in support of a fresh referendum.As negotiations between the government and the EU27 on an exit deal enter their final phase, the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, has insisted the option of a referendum must be kept on the table if the deal is rejected by MPs.However, the shadow international trade secretary, Barry Gardiner, last week suggested a second referendum could spark social unrest, saying: “If people feel that the route to change is no longer a democratic route, then you look to social disruption, perhaps civil disobedience, in a different way.”Which motions reach the floor of Labour conference is determined through an arcane process by the conference arrangements committee."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ae0ec98be040e8484ebf54142aa275dd732d871/0_234_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4da518419e2807d2d1bed8e1e885e889","title":"brexit dominic raab frustrated by michel barnier lack of availability on talks","story":"EU negotiator allegedly keeps turning down requests to meet Dominic Raab due to diary constraintsDominic Raab, the Brexit secretary, has expressed his frustration to EU officials over Michel Barnier’s alleged failure to make himself available for face-to-face talks.Despite the EU negotiator’s claims that he was available “24-7” for talks, Barnier was said to have turned down requests for lengthy meetings with Raab to discuss the details of the UK’s proposals, hammered out at Chequers.The British cabinet minister was granted only a two-hour meeting with Barnier last week, and has only been offered a three-hour slot this Friday, due to the former French minister’s diary constraints, the  has learned.Barnier – who tweeted a picture of himself on Sunday posing in the sun in Albertville, in his home region of Savoie in the south-east of France – has been in Germany, and was understood to be leaving Brussels on Friday afternoon, following the proposed morning meeting with Raab, which was yet to be confirmed or publicised.UK diplomats complained that the commission’s repeated claims, made again by a spokesman on Tuesday, that Barnier was available for high-level talks at any point, night or day, had proven to be hyperbole.Representations have been made to the EU in which commission officials were told that Raab required lengthy meetings to discuss the detail of the Chequers plan, which the UK believes is not being given the attention it deserves.The two sides pledged earlier this summer to have continuous Brexit talks in the final stage of the negotiations, with Barnier insisting that a deal needed to be struck by “the beginning of November, but not much later than that”.But UK officials were said to be “tearing their hair out” at the EU’s failure to live up to their pledges to intensify talks at the highest level. The issue has been a reversal of the positions earlier in the talks, when Barnier made the point to EU diplomats in private that he would have liked to see more of David Davis, the then Brexit secretary, in Brussels.Davis, who left much of the detailed discussions in Brussels to the prime minister’s Brexit adviser, Olly Robbins, found joint press conferences with Barnier particularly irksome, and complained that they merely offered the EU’s negotiator an opportunity to criticise the British positions.The tension in the talks has been exacerbated by a lack of progress in the negotiations last week, despite claims by both sides that the discussions had been “positive”. has learned that discussions over Northern Ireland proved to be some of the most difficult yet, with both sides digging in.Irish government officials, briefed on the meeting, were told that the UK side had insisted that progress on avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland could not be made unless there was progress on Chequers.The EU, in turn, repeated that the British government needed to live up to the commitments it made on an “all weather” solution to avoiding a hard border through a backstop solution in the withdrawal agreement, which would snap into place if a wider deal or bespoke technological solution did not solve the problem.Sources said the talks were so difficult that the only positive that could be taken was that the clash between the officials had been aired now rather than later in the year.Raab indicated his frustration with Barnier during a brief press conference last week when he expressed hope for a longer meeting this week, and suggested that a deal would require “energy on both sides”.The Department for Exiting the European Union said: “Both the secretary of state and Michel Barnier are committed to weekly discussions to ensure that both sides get a good deal.“Over the next few weeks, our teams will work at pace to finalise the terms of the United Kingdom’s orderly withdrawal from the European Union, and lay the framework for a new deep and special partnership.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ea013b3ddc064c60fcd8141c61fbcd5d3a2bcac/0_30_5270_3162/master/5270.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1cb40fe84f04324d0033557da8ad8a6","title":"no deal brexit plan medicine supplies cost 2bn","story":"Campaign group Best for Britain warns of cost to health secretary’s stockpiling strategyThe health secretary’s plan to set aside six weeks’ worth of vital medicines to avoid supply disruptions in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost up to £2bn, campaign group Best for Britain warns today.Matt Hancock wrote to healthcare providers last week, saying the government would set in motion plans to “ensure the UK has an additional six weeks’ supply of medicines in case imports from the EU through certain routes are affected”.Data collated by thinktank the King’s Fund earlier this year suggested the total drugs bill for the NHS in 2016-17 was £17.4bn.Best for Britain suggests that could make the cost of the temporary stockpile – which would presumably then be run down over future months – £2bn.Owen Smith, the former shadow Northern Ireland secretary and a supporter of Best for Britain, said: “I don’t remember anyone warning that Brexit would mean we’d have to stockpile drugs or that this would cost the NHS and taxpayers up to £2bn. Maybe they should have slapped that on the side of the bus.“Every day it seems as though there is another hidden cost being revealed.”Hancock’s letter urged local GPs and pharmacists not to hoard medicines themselves, but to rely on the official scheme. It added that the government will also put in place “separate arrangements for the air freight of medicines with short shelf-lives, such as medical radioisotopes”.It is unclear whether the taxpayer will bear the cost of the stockpiling scheme. A Department of Health spokesman said at this stage the government was only “asking suppliers to provide specific information on their stockpiling programme to gauge how prepared the industry is before we decide the next steps”.He added: “We have put in place a dedicated team to support suppliers in making arrangements for stockpiling and we will work with companies to develop plans to minimise any additional costs.”Hancock’s plan was published last week alongside 24 no-deal “technical notices” intended to inform consumers and businesses what would happen if Britain exits the EU next March without a trade deal.The Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, will return to Brussels to resume negotiations later this week, and has insisted he expects to reach agreement with the EU27.But the notices included warnings that British citizens living in EU countries could lose access to payments from their pensions and bank accounts, credit card payments could become more expensive and exporters would immediately face tariffs for goods on sale to the EU.Theresa May, who is travelling in Africa this week, told journalists a no-deal outcome – which some hardline Brexiters believe would be preferable to her Chequers plan – was “not the end of the world”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f8f92e0d3b9121679b3a40e3b3e45be239aefb7/0_234_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ea5ecde7b8f75171e310581bd4e6d59","title":"low income tenants face heat eat or pay rent choices study","story":"Housing benefit freeze leaving poorest private renters with shortfall of up to £140 a weekLow-income tenants in the private rented sector face a “heat, eat or pay rent” problem because housing benefit rates have failed to keep up with the soaring cost of accommodation, a study has found.The four-year freeze on local housing allowance levels, which has been in place since April 2016, means some families must meet a shortfall of hundreds of pounds a month on their rent support, according to the Chartered Institute of Housing (CIH).It said the ongoing housing benefit freeze meant even the lowest private rents were out of reach for many low-income families in most areas – making it more likely that tenants would be forced to choose between living necessities or paying the rent.“Our research makes it clear just how far housing benefit for private renters has failed to keep pace with even the cheapest private rents. We fear this policy is putting thousands of private renters on low incomes at risk of poverty and homelessness,” said the CIH’s chief executive, Terrie Alafat.The biggest “rent gaps” – the difference between rent and housing support levels in the cheapest third of rented properties in a local housing market area – were in London, where the median shortfall was £66 a week for a four-bedroom property and £43 for a two-bedroom, although this masked larger gaps of more than £140 a week in the inner city – adding up to more than £600 a month.The problem was noticeable in locations near the capital that have been popular with commuters, such as Cambridge, Milton Keynes and Chelmsford, where the weekly shortfalls on a four-bed property were £68, £62 and £59 respectively.There were striking shortfalls in areas such as Greater Glasgow (£82 a week on a four-bedroom home), Bristol (£71) and southern Greater Manchester (£53). The median national weekly rent gap on a four-bedroom home was £17. In a handful of areas, including Liverpool and Leeds, there was no rent gap for this size of property.The weekly shortfall on two-bedroom private rented homes has followed a broadly similar pattern – highest in London, with significant gaps in places such as Bristol (£40), south-west Hertfordshire (£39) and Bath (£34). The median national weekly rent gap on this size of property was £8, according to the research.The CIH said that although ministers introduced a “targeted affordability fund” in 2014 to bridge the biggest gaps, the impact of this had been negligible because it had failed to meaningfully shrink the shortfall in the worst-hit areas.The CIH called on the government to end the freeze on benefits. It estimated that the cost of realigning local housing allowance – which has lagged behind rent increases in many areas since 2013 – would be £1.2bn.Matt Downie, the director of policy at the housing charity Crisis, said: “This report highlights just how much housing benefits for private renters are falling short of the levels needed, leaving many homeless people stuck in a desperate situation and putting yet more people at risk of homelessness.”A government spokesperson said: “We spend £24bn a year on housing benefit each year. And since April we’ve provided additional, targeted housing support for low-income households by increasing more than 200 local housing allowance rates.“Since 2011, we have provided a further £1bn in discretionary housing payment for local authorities to support vulnerable claimants with their housing costs.“We have also delivered over 378,000 new affordable properties since 2010 and we are investing a further £9bn in affordable homes to buy and rent.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/391d6e595c6f341c6163f33415589648fd6b62fd/0_803_2136_1281/master/2136.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b762603d2bd9c7681463e0443a60b2c7","title":"quarter of 14 year old girls in uk have self harmed report finds","story":"Children’s Society analysis suggests tens of thousands hurting themselves on purposeMore than 100,000 children aged 14 in the UK are self-harming, with one in four girls of this age having deliberately hurt themselves, according to a new report.In figures that show the scale of the mental health crisis affecting young people, the Children’s Survey analysed a survey of 11,000 14-year-olds which found that a quarter of girls and nearly one in 10 boys had self-harmed in a year.The charity estimated that 110,000 children aged 14 may be self-harming, including 76,000 girls and 33,000 boys.Experts have put the behaviour down to a combination of pressure from school, austerity and gender expectations.“It is deeply worrying that so many children are unhappy to the extent that they are self-harming. Worries about how they look are a big issue, especially for girls,” said Matthew Reed, the chief executive of the Children’s Society.The charity analysed figures from the millennium cohort survey, carried out by researchers from University College London, which follows children born in the UK in 2000-01.The report also included a survey of children aged 10-17 and their parents across 2,000 households, which found that the issues of most concern to children were school and their appearance.The mental health campaigner Natasha Devon, who works with young people in schools, said that while the self-harm figures were upsetting they were not surprising.“Self-harm at its root is a coping mechanism like having a glass of wine or smoking a cigarette … these are all self-harming activities … most people say they started doing it as it felt good,” she said. “They did it in response to not feeling heard or not being able to articulate what was wrong. Over time it is addictive.”Devon put some of the blame on austerity.“The world is just a more difficult place to navigate,” she said. “You can see a sharp rise in mental health conditions such as anxiety and self-harm since 2010 and that is when austerity began.” The number of girls under the age of 18 being treated in hospital in England after self-harming has nearly doubled compared with 20 years ago, NHS figures show. There were 13,463 cases last year, compared with 7,327 in 1997. In contrast, the number of admissions for boys who self-harmed rose from 2,236 in 1997 to 2,332 in 2017.Devon said that more needed to be done to treat the causes of self-harm. “We need to look at the environment young people exist in at home and in school so these issues don’t arise in the first place rather than fire-fighting once they have manifested.”The Children’s Society report suggested that both boys and girls can be harmed by gender stereotypes and the pressure to live up to them. Children said they felt under pressure from friends to be good-looking, but those who felt boys should be tough and girls should have nice clothes were least happy with life.Reed said: “Issues like appearance, gender stereotypes and sexuality should be included in the new relationships and sex education curriculum.“However, early support for vulnerable children and families in the community, which can help prevent mental health problems from developing, is also vital, and ministers must urgently address the £2bn funding shortfall facing council children’s services departments by 2020.”Luciana Berger, the MP who is president of Labour Campaign for Mental Health, said: “These shocking statistics on self-harming among children show the extent of the mental health crisis in our country. Children in Britain urgently need more mental health support but the children and young people’s mental health green paper lacked the ambition needed to solve this crisis. The government’s continued disregard for early intervention and prevention is failing a generation.”“I started self-harming when I was 13. I don’t really know why I started doing it. I guess I had a lot going on and wanted to feel in control of something. The first time I did it I was in the bath and I accidentally cut myself shaving. At first I was panicking but then it felt kind of nice so I started doing it on purpose with various different objects. I would do it all the time, it became addictive.“I would feel euphoric afterwards. I found physical pain easier to control than what was going on in my mind. The moments I felt pain were the moments my thoughts stopped and all I focused on was the physical discomfort.“I thought I was the only one doing it, but my friends were too. It came up in conversation and I tried to help them. I encouraged them to seek help, although I never told them I was also doing the same. As well as cutting myself I also developed issues with food. I think both things stemmed from all the pressure I was feeling. Girls feel pressure from a younger and younger age these days. We feel pressure to be perfect and when they don’t achieve that they punish themselves.“I am not sure why girls are more prone to this, perhaps it is because there is more pressure on us to look a certain way. You tend to see more female models, and girls strive to be like them. The gender stereotype is that boys are manly and girls have to be pretty. This leads to people feeling self-conscious and like they need to look and act a certain way. It makes you feel like you cannot be yourself. I saw a girl this weekend and she was so young but plastered in makeup and fake tan and acrylic nails. She was way too young to feel that pressure.“The solution is better education about mental health, so people know where to go if they are struggling. There needs to be more resources. I am getting better now and on the road back to recovery but it’s been a long journey. The most important part of getting better for me was knowing I am not alone and others have experienced this.”Jessica, 18, from south Wales"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b198d28080f34f8560a243391ac6e4d0b30d580/0_530_7957_4775/master/7957.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28fdcdc94756baa570fa76d0a5977735","title":"teens desert social media","story":"Generation Z has grown up online – so why are a surprising number suddenly turning their backs on Instagram, Facebook and Snapchat?For 17-year-old Mary Amanuel, from London, it happened in Tesco. “We were in year 7,” she remembers, “and my friend had made an Instagram account. As we were buying stuff, she was counting the amounts of likes she’d got on a post. ‘Oooh, 40 likes. 42 likes.’ I just thought: ‘This is ridiculous.’”Isabelle, an 18-year-old student from Bedfordshire who doesn’t want to disclose her surname, turned against social media when her classmates became zombified. “Everyone switched off from conversation. It became: ‘Can I have your number to text you?’ Something got lost in terms of speaking face to face. And I thought: ‘I don’t really want to be swept up in that.’” For 15-year-old Emily Sharp, from Staines in Surrey, watching bullying online was the final straw. “It wasn’t nice. That deterred me from using it.”It is widely believed that young people are hopelessly devoted to social media. Teenagers, according to this stereotype, tweet, gram, Snap and scroll. But for every young person hunched over a screen, there are others for whom social media no longer holds such an allure. These teens are turning their backs on the technology – and there are more of them than you might think.This is part of a wider trend. According to a study by US marketing firm Hill Holliday of Generation Z – people born after 1995 – half of those surveyed stated they had quit or were considering quitting at least one social media platform. When it comes to Gen Z’s relationship to social media, “significant cracks are beginning to show”, says the firm’s Lesley Bielby.She believes we will definitely see an increase in younger people quitting or substantially reducing their use. “And as younger Gen Zers notice this behaviour among their older siblings and friends, they too will start to dial down their use of social media.”As the first generation to grow up online, Gen Z never had to learn social media, or at least not exactly. They glided through every iteration: Facebook (2004), Twitter (2006), Instagram (2010) Snapchat (2011) in real time, effortlessly adopting each one. But a life lived in pixels from your earliest age is no easy thing.“You start doing things that are dishonest,” says Amanuel, who quit social media aged 16. “Like Instagram: I was presenting this dishonest version of myself, on a platform where most people were presenting dishonest versions of themselves.”Like Amanuel, Jeremiah Johnson, 18, from Luton, grew weary of the pressures of sustaining an online persona. “It’s a competition for who can appear the happiest,” he says. “And if you’re not happy and want to vent about it on social media, you’re attention-seeking.”After being “bugged” by his friends to get Instagram (he had stopped using Facebook aged 16), Johnson joined. He lasted six months. “If you’re having a bad day and scrolling through it, you’re constantly bombarded with pictures of people going to parties. Even if that’s not an accurate portrayal of their lives, that’s what you see. So I stopped using it. It became depressing. It was this competition of who’s the happiest.” He pauses. “Participating in that is not something I’m interested in.”Hyper-connected teens have been faced with a surfeit of clicks, retweets and likes – and the dopamine rush of online validation – since the neural pathways in their brains were formed. “They’re becoming overwhelmed with the responsibility of maintaining their social sites and with upholding the somewhat inflated persona many have created on these sites, where they are constantly seeking approval via the amount of likes they get for any given post,” Bielby says.“The people who are the most honest about themselves do not play the game of Instagram,” Amanuel says. “The game of Instagram is who can maximise their likes by being the most risque, outrageous or conformist as possible. I didn’t want to play that game.”At school, social media can be a brutal barometer of popularity. “If you meet someone new and they ask for your Instagram and you only have 80 followers,” says Sharp, “they’re going to think: ‘You’re not that popular’, but if you have 2,000 followers they’re going to be like: ‘You’re the most popular person in school.’” Sharp quit social media at 13. “I’d rather not know what other people think of me.”A desire to build authentic, offline friendships motivated some to quit. “I’m so much better at real-life socialising now,” says Amanuel. “Not just those people you accept on a friend request who are friends of a friend.”For Tyreke Morgan, 18, from Bristol, being a hard man to get hold of – he has no social media presence at all – has its advantages. “Everyone goes through other people to find me,” Morgan laughs, “and when I hear that they’re been trying to get hold of me I say: ‘Great!’ Why would I need 500 flakey friends?”But when you are from a digitally native generation, quitting social media can feel like joining a monastery. Amanuel was recently asked by co-workers if she had Snapchat. “I said no,” Amanuel remembers, “and I instantly heard, like, gasps. It was like I’d revealed something disgusting.” She explained that she did have a Snapchat handle, but never used it. “Relief came out of their eyes! It was really weird.”“I don’t know how people doing their A-levels or GCSEs have the time for it,” says Isabelle. “They’re constantly studying, but their only distraction is social media.” Rather than get sucked into a “mindless vortex of never-ending scrolling,” as she puts it, when Isabelle isn’t studying she prefers to be outdoors.The fact that Gen Z have had their every move documented online since before they could walk, talk, or even control their bowels helps explain their antipathy to social media: it makes sense for them to strive for privacy, as soon as they reach the age when they have a choice over their online image.“I’ve seen parents post pictures of their child’s first potty online,” says Amy Binns of the University of Central Lancashire. “You think: ‘Why are you doing this to your child? They wouldn’t want this to be public.”Gen Z has an interest in privacy that subtly sets them apart. “Young people want to get away from the curtain-twitching village, where everyone knows everything about you,” Binns says. So while today’s teens spend a lot of time online, they don’t actually share that much personal information. And when they do share, it’s strategic. “You’re painting a picture of who you are and your image,” says Binns. “It’s your own shop window or brand.”“Framing a picture and posting it on there is not a five-minute thing,” says Amanuel, explaining that any post will be well-thought-out in order to project a certain image and maximise likes. “It takes hours of deliberation.”“When social media started, we didn’t really know what it was going to mean,” says Binns. “Young people are more aware of the value of privacy than we were 10 years ago.”Some of the teens I spoke to were concerned about how technologies such as Snap Map – a Snapchat feature that tracks your friends geographically, in real time – were spreading through their schools, and mistrustful of the privacy consequences of being surveilled by your followers wherever you go. “Snap Map is this big thing with a lot of my friends, but there is a sense of privacy that is being breached as well,” Isabelle says. Teenagers are also educated about the ramifications of an offensive tweet, or explicit picture, as well as the health consequences of too much screen time. “Young people are being taught in schools about sharing nudes and how tweets can travel around. They’ve seen the horror stories,” says Binns.But quitting social media can create new anxieties. “Our research shows that the biggest fear of quitting or pausing social media is missing out,” Bielby says. Some are more sanguine than others. “Do I miss out on stuff?” Morgan asks. “Yeah, of course. People find it hard to keep in contact with me. They say: ‘It would be easier if you had this or that.’ But I don’t think it’s that hard to type in my number and send a text. You’re just not willing to do it.”Others struggle with the fear of missing out. “It’s like everyone in your friend group has gone to a party without telling you,” Johnson says. At times, he questions himself. “I second-guess myself a lot. There are some days I’m really convinced I want to reinstall it, not for myself, but because I want to appear normal.”Still, refuseniks such as Johnson may not be outliers for ever. In a world in which everyone is online, renouncing social media is a renegade, countercultural move: as quietly punk as shaving your head or fastening your clothes with safety-pins. Morgan has become a svengali for classmates wanting to escape. “My friends come to me and say: ‘Tyreke, I don’t have social media any more,’ and I go: ‘Why? I thought that’s what you guys do.’ And they say: ‘Thanks to you, because of the things you said and the stuff you’re doing.’ It’s quite cool.”Quitting social media is a determined move: apps including Facebook and Instagram are designed to be addictive. “Social media is so ingrained in teenage culture that it’s hard to take it out. But when you do, it’s such a relief,” Amanuel says. She has received a lot of “admiration” from her peers for quitting. “They wish they were able to log off. People feel like social media is a part of them and their identities as teenagers and something you need to do,” she says. “But I’m no less of a teenager because I don’t use it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db5b8fc7e156893a9e6ad8aa450585be6b0e76cc/62_19_2163_1297/master/2163.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44953f70324ccf9562ad60016f78d553","title":"us open jo konta novak djokovic heat","story":"As the mercury climbed, the players fell – literally in some cases – on a day better for tanning than tennis at the US Open. Britain’s No 1 woman, Johanna Konta, brought up on the northern beaches of Sydney but vulnerable to extreme heat in the past, was one of the non-medical casualties, while four others quit through exhaustion, cramping or injury.Konta lost to the sixth seed, Carolina Garcia, 6-2, 6-2 in an hour and a quarter as the afternoon sun battered the exposed Grandstand Court, where Marius Copil had earlier retired against Marin Cilic. He said a “left-arm strain” caused his withdrawal, although he was limping heavily and appeared spent and distressed.Novak Djokovic, meanwhile, remains the chief threat to the defending champion, Rafael Nadal, after looking out on his feet playing Marton Fucsovics. Against expectations the Serb recovered to see off the determined challenge of the unseeded Hungarian 6-3, 3-6, 6-4, 6-0 in just under three hours on the main court, winning the last 10 games on the spin. He plainly benefited from the 10-minute break the tournament organisers introduced here on Tuesday for the first time, after the third set.“We both struggled,” Djokovic said immediately afterwards. “Towards the end of three sets I started hitting the ball. Before that it was survival mode.” To the amusement of the crowd and perhaps the bemusement of his wife, he added, “We both needed that break at the end of the third set. We had two ice baths. We were naked next to each other. It was quite a magnificent feeling, I must say.”Looking ahead to his second-round match against his compatriot Viktor Troicki on Thursday – expected to be another sweltering day – he said: “I’m praying to feel better. But you have these kind of days. A lot of players struggled today.”Having reached the semi-finals at Wimbledon last year and climbed to No 4 in the world, Konta has failed to get past the second round of any of this season’s four majors, tumbling 42 places in the world rankings. She did not blame the conditions, acknowledging her downfall was due solely to her opponent. “It was bloody hot,” she said. “My eyes are still burning – and I wasn’t even out there for very long.”Konta batted aside doubts about her American coach, Michael Joyce. “I feel happy with the relationship that we have. Coming into this year I was in a very unhappy place. The number one job was to get me into a happy place. I feel definitely that we’ve achieved that. We’ll work together as long as we feel it’s mutually beneficial.” The rest of her season reads: Tokyo, Wuhan, Beijing and Moscow.Garcia said courtside: “Today I served very well and I was able to read her serve better than usual but there were a lot of tough games.”Konta, unseeded in a major for the first time since Melbourne in 2016, when she made the semi-finals, hung on as best she could but Garcia was too savvy and sharp. She struck seven aces in a superb serving display that Konta could not match.Konta had reason to be concerned about the conditions, having collapsed here twice, most recently in the second round two years ago when she experienced a spike in her heart rate before recovering to beat the Bulgarian Tsvetana Pironkova in three sets.Earlier Caroline Wozniacki, one of the fittest players in tennis, found unique inspiration to beat the heat and Sam Stosur: alcohol.“I had the ice towels and used the shade a little bit,” the 28-year-old second seed said standing in the frying pan that is the Arthur Ashe stadium after a 6-3, 6-2 win sent her into the shelter of the locker room and on to round two. “It helped. But, to be honest with you, I imagine I’m on the beach with a margarita in hand. It was just about trying to think cool thoughts.”Pointing to her fiancé in the stands – the NBA star David Lee, hatless and dressed in a black T-shirt – Wozniacki observed, “He should buy a hat.”Stosur said later: “Everyone always talks about how hot Melbourne is, and, ‘Oh my god, it’s so bad and everything,’ but the US Open’s way worse than Melbourne.“There are more retirements here but, for some reason, we get the bad rap in Australia.”Kiki Bertens, who beat Kristyna Pliskova 6-0, 7-5, said: “It’s really warm and it’s tough to play, but I guess that’s the same for everyone.”Latvia’s Jelena Ostapenko, who beat Andrea Petkovic in three sets, agreed. “It was very humid and also very hot but it was the same for both of us,” she said.Naomi Osaka, the Japanese 20th seed who grew up in Florida and beat Germany’s Laura Siegemund, 6-3, 6-2 in an hour and 18 minutes, saw it differently. “Everyone was complaining about it. I thought it was pretty decent. Florida summers are way worse,” Osaka said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e1a0b8510ae5cc5a167d51aa7ecf3522fc6f355/0_166_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b47261df945450349c65cf23c9ff8190","title":"joe root virat kohli five fourth test pointers england india ageas bowl","story":"After England’s heavy defeat to India at Trent Bridge, captain Root must lead from the front at the Ageas BowlIt is now a full year since Joe Root scored a Test century, which is to say that he has failed so to do in 24 innings against a cross-section of Test-match attacks. In the meantime, England have been thrashed by Australia, beaten by New Zealand, and held to a home draw by Pakistan. Though he has still delivered a consistent diet of 50s, a batsman of his epochal brilliance is obliged to do more. Like Alastair Cook before him, he was appointed captain not because he has a natural feel for the game or its players, but because, even in cricket, the most important element of leadership is consistent excellence of inidual performance. So if, like almost every captain before him, the demands of the job are compromising his standards – it is a long time since he’s looked as uncomfortable at the crease as lately – then he, national selector Ed Smith and head coach Trevor Bayliss must have a long, painful talk, because England are nowhere near good enough to do without their best player playing his best.India’s superb pace attack – and what a pleasure it is to write those words – has settled very nicely into this series. But though Mohammed Shami is reliable, Hardik Pandya improving, and Ishant Sharma can suddenly happen upon a flow, Jasprit Bumrah is another matter entirely. The variation he supplies – in angle, bowling from wide of the crease, and in action, arms all over like Mr Tickle doing the floss – clearly disconcerted England’s batsmen. In the first innings at Trent Bridge, they found him hardest to get away and he also dismissed the top-scoring Jos Buttler. Then, in the second, he took them apart. If England’s batsmen cannot work him out and quickly, his arrival could yet prove to be the turning point in this contest.Though, in favourable conditions, England have a decent attack, and though, in favourable circumstances, England have a decent top eight, neither are devastating. As such, Joe Root must opt to field first only in extreme circumstances. At Lord’s, the weather and pitch insisted, but the same was not so at Trent Bridge and more generally, England have lost seven of the last 11 Tests before which the captain has made that call. And this tactic is especially risky against India, who have the world’s best batsman – Virat Kohli duly cashed in when offered first hit – and the world’s best spinner – Ravi Ashwin was not even needed to rustle the three left-handers in England’s top five. Root is unlikely to be similarly tempted at Southampton or the Oval, but looking longer-term, his team must improve significantly before contemplating such a risk in future.England’s batsmen have collapsed prolifically over the last couple of years, each iteration adding a revitalising wrinkle to an old story. The last time this behaviour was so common, in the 90s, it felt almost unavoidable – often, the opposing bowlers were all-time greats, and mainly, it felt like the batsmen were doing their best. But that is not the case now. Roughly, the problem can be split into three: naive, carefree attitude that has long since ceased to be charming bad judgment that has delivered more teachable moments than an American sitcom and mental weakness illustrated by how differently they fare when under rather than applying pressure. Perhaps, though, this latest humiliation will finally bring about a change, because, in England’s second innings at Trent Bridge, they were shown how to build a Test-match innings by Jos Buttler, their most destructive batsman, and by Ben Stokes. If things do not improve from here, they never will.In the 16th century a Turkish miniaturist managed to gain entry to the Sultan’s art collection and, before he left, deliberately blinded himself so that the last thing he saw was the work of the great masters. It is impossible to fathom his reaction had he been so fortunate as to experience Virat Kohli. Though Kohli’s batting is otherworldly – he has more than twice as many runs in the series as anyone else and his conversion rate is now the equal of Don Bradman’s – to focus solely on the numbers is to entirely miss his measure. He has dedication you can barely believe and the moxie of a million men, suffusing everything around him with a fanatical aggression and enthusiasm – also known as love – that is both moving and inspiring, a man doing precisely what he should be doing, to the highest degree and with maximum effect. He is the greatest of his time and a great of all-time, with lessons to teach not just Root and the England team, but the rest of us too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b1533649d948640bb01e162c3506333910eb4bb/86_347_1925_1155/master/1925.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2af4e14d67c03e23ec0598688c1028ea","title":"county cricket lancashire v worcestershire surrey v notts and more live","story":"A query from Barcelona airport where Finbar Anslow writes... “Good morning from Barcelona airport.

All heads turn to The Oval where Championship favourites Surrey, who have a whopping 32-point lead at the top of Division One, entertain Nottinghamshire. Current silver-medallists Somerset are away at Headingley, where Yorkshire find themselves in relegation danger after that thrashing by Worcestershire at Scarborough, and there’s a wooden-spoon face-off here at bonny Southport where Lancashire and Worcestershire fight it out for oxygen.

In the chasing pack, Middlesex and Sussex battle at Lord’s – which is co-currently hosting a beer and cider festival.The last draw here was in 1989, and both sides are desperate for points. Worcestershire moved off the bottom after their win against Yorkshire and Lancashire replaced them after the six-run defeat thriller against Surrey – a game which the Worcestershire team watched on the team coach on the way back from Scarborough. Maharaj makes his debut on a Southport pitch which often helps spinners. Moeen Ali may join Worcester on the second day if not needed by EnglandBoth sides are safeish… but a win will bring precious ballast. Hampshire are without James Vince, wanted by England, and Dalye Steyn, who injured his groin in the win against Nottinghamshire.Surrey can almost pocket the title this week if they win and Somerset lose against Yorkshire . Tom Curran makes his first Championship appearance of an injury-interrupted season, replacing younger brother Sam if he plays in the Test. Jade Dernbach is out with an injured groin muscle sustained during the nail-biting win against Lancashire. South African Test opener Dean Elgar returns for his second spell as overseas player this season and Gareth Batty could make his first Championship appearance of the year alongside Amar Virdi. Notts, not-so-fresh from the Blast quarter final defeat at Taunton, are still missing Chris Nash – but Ben Slater, their recent signing from Derbyshire, could make his debut.Yorkshire are still missing Steven Patterson and Ben Coad, but Mat Pillans, who recently signed from Surrey, could make his debut, and Kane Williamson is available for his last appearance of the season. Jack Brooks is in the squad to play the team he will join next season. Somerset are buoyant after last week’s Jack Leach-inspired victory over Essex kept them in the race.Third-placed Kent’s chase for promotion is boosted by the return of New Zealander Matt Henry, fabulous in early-season. Derbyshire have made a loan signing of Tom Lace, a young opener from Middlesex, after losing Ben Slater to Nottinghamshire, with Luis Reece out with long-term injury.Durham earned their third win of the season last week against Glamorgan in Cardiff,  Mark Wood will continue in their seam attack. Northants, who somehow managed to lose to Middlesex after enforcing the follow-on last week, are without Ben Duckett with a broken fingerThe first and only time top-of-the-table Warwickshire have travelled to Colywn Bay they won, with a youthful Jonathan Trott scoring a hundred.

He apologised for the remark last month after Unsworth threatened to sue, Tesla shares ed and the company’s investors issued an open letter demanding Musk apologise.“Did you investigate at all? I’m guessing answer is no. Why?” he wrote in subsequent tweets that are still online.Musk has been under pressure from Telsa investors over his erratic behaviour on social media and record losses posted by the electric vehicle manufacturer.He told the New York Times this month the past year had been “excruciating” and the “most difficult and painful of my career”, claiming he had been working up to 120 hours a week and neglecting his health and family.He is also being sued by investors for tweeting earlier this month his intentions to take his publicly traded company private, with the assurance: “Funding secured.”Lawyers have warned the tweet may have broken a law that bans public companies from announcing plans to buy or sell securities if executives do not intend or do not have the means to complete the deal, or if they are trying to manipulate the stock price."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/971d35312fffcf33a835422891acf4ef2a8856fe/0_369_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea6797ca7ea3e35dd2d554c2b0d5738a","title":"natural cycles app highly accurate contraceptive claim misled consumers","story":"The UK’s advertising watchdog rules against company over its marketing of the appAn advert describing a smartphone app as a “highly accurate” method of birth control has been found to be misleading by the Advertising Standards Agency (ASA) in the latest blow to the much-hyped Swedish company, Natural Cycles.The offending advert, which appeared on Facebook, promoted the app by saying: “Natural Cycles is a highly accurate, certified, contraceptive app that adapts to every woman’s unique menstrual cycle.”However, last month the ASA began investigating the advert after it received five complaints about the app. Now the ASA has banned it, saying it was misleading and exaggerated the app’s effectiveness.“In the context of the ad, the claim ‘highly accurate contraceptive app’ would be understood by consumers to mean that the app had a high degree of accuracy and was therefore very reliable in being able to prevent unwanted pregnancies,” the ruling said.The ruling also discussed a video which accompanied the ad and talked about the app’s credentials.“We further considered that the claim ‘clinically tested alternative to birth control methods’, presented alongside the ‘highly accurate’ claim would be understood to mean that the app was a reliable method of contraception which could be used in place of other established birth control methods, including those that were highly reliable in preventing unwanted pregnancies,” the ASA said.Natural Cycles has been heavily promoted as a non-hormonal and non-intrusive form of contraception. The app costs £39.99 a year, or £5.99 a month, and comes with a thermometer.It uses a set of algorithms that indicate by means of “red” or “green” days whether a woman is at risk of pregnancy in the event of unprotected sex. To reduce the number of red “at risk” days in a month, women must take their temperature at the same time every morning to allow the app to track ovulation and menstrual cycle phases. However, if anything disrupts the routine – being hungover, smoking or getting up to go to the bathroom can affect body temperature – a reading must be skipped.However some experts have been sceptical, noting the app was less effective than many forms of birth control and required strict adherence to a temperature-taking routine, with the studies based on a self-selecting pool of users. Others have raised concerns about unwanted pregnancies. In January, the app was referred to Swedish authorities after 37 of 668 abortions sought at one hospital in Stockholm were for women who had been using the app as a method of contraception.Natural Cycles said in response to the ruling: “We respect the outcome of the investigation by the ASA into one Facebook advertisement, which ran for approximately four weeks in mid-2017. The investigation was initiated nearly 12 months ago and the advertisement was removed as soon as we were notified of the complaint.”The ASA warned the company behind Natural Cycles that it must not exaggerate the efficacy of the method as a form of contraception.Bekki Burbidge, of the Family Planning Association, said women needed to take care to avoid potential problems with such apps.“It’s important when using Natural Cycles that women are aware of all the things that might make it less effective, so we’re very cautious about using apps to prevent a pregnancy without getting help and support from a trained fertility awareness teacher,” she said.

And the Channel 4 team are just getting into their strideCan there be anything more delightful than a giant penis rendered in pink royal icing? Hours later, I’m still laughing to myself about it. “What are you holding?” Kim-Joy asks fellow baker Dan. “A baby,” says the stay-at-home dad, referring to the showstopper tableau of almond sugar cookie that supposedly depicts him carefully cradling his first child. It doesn’t look like a baby. “It looks like …” says Paul Hollywood, with a smirk, when Dan brings the baked portrait up to be judged. Go on, say penis. “A massive prawn.”The Great British Bake Off (Channel 4, 8pm) is back, and it is still a joy. Now in its ninth series, and the second in its new Channel 4 home, it shows no sign of getting stale. Aside from a few nods to evolving trends – there will be a vegan week, the makers announced – it is unchanged. Because why change a recipe as good as this? New judge Prue Leith, her confidence grown – despite a good joke at the start of the show about her gaffe last year when she tweeted the name of the winner ahead of the final – has proved to be a great successor to Mary Berry. She is tarter, to Berry’s icing-sugar sweetness. The presenters, Sandi Toksvig (enough of an anarchic edge to stop her going full head girl) and Noel Fielding (kind-natured, with a new ElvisShakin’ Stevens haircut) are endearing and more assured this year. Hollywood, the only survivor from the original, seems to have weathered the lingering feel over the last series that he was being grabby by staying with the show. Sun and birdsong drench the famous tent (“Like, the actual tent,” says Briony, from Bristol, and one of my favourites): the producers continue to resist updating the pastel fantasy farmhouse kitchen decor, and one or both of the judges will turn their nose up at any inclusion of rosewater. It is all comfortingly familiar.The three patisserie-under-pressure challenges begin. We kick off with biscuit – rather than cake – week, which is apparently what passes for controversy in the Bake Off tent. The bakers have to make 24 identical “regional biscuits”. The 12 contestants seem an intriguing bunch, but could be more representative (there’s a weirdly large number of people from Yorkshire). Rahul, a nuclear scientist, says his mum loves his biscuits mental health worker Kim-Joy’s orange blossom-flavoured biscuits are inspired by a hair conditioner she likes Terry, an artist with one of those pleasingly twiddly moustaches, is decorating his ginger shortbread biscuits with pictures of lambs. Everyone finds it all very stressful, of course, except for Karen, who works in a supermarket she easily finishes her Yorkshire parkin biscuits and has time to sit down with a celebratory packet of salt and vinegar crisps. “Would you like a crisp?” she asks Dan, clearly trying to put him off his game under the guise of generosity.One of the enjoyable tensions of Bake Off is the feeling of gentle, cosy unity, when everyone really just wants to win. Spot the sour faces when someone’s bake is praised. The psychology of the bakers is endlessly fascinating. What makes someone like Terry seem to sag like a sunken sponge when his biscuits are criticised (“It’s a rough old biscuit,” says Hollywood), when Ruby, a project manager, comes out fighting? “I thought biscuits were meant to be dry,” she says, punchily.The technical challenge is to make a Wagon Wheel, which immediately put those not born in Britain at a disadvantage. Antony, an Indian-born banker, has never heard of them Manon, from France, calls it a “wheely wagon”, although she manages to comes third. Toksvig confesses she has never eaten a Wagon Wheel – but then again, she adds, she didn’t have a Pot Noodle until she was 55.The showstopper challenge seems unusually difficult for a first episode: the bakers have to make a picture using several layers of biscuit and icing, depicting themselves in a memorable scene. It is stressful to watch – there’s a lot of huffing, red faces and shaky hands. “I’m losing it,” says Ruby of her triple-layer, 40-piece marathon – literal and metaphorical – scene. She confesses she has never managed to finish it in time during her practice runs at home, and she can’t get this one done.One of the best things about Bake Off is that it values effort and pride in one’s work compare this with, say, the tiresome Celebrity MasterChef, which started last week, where the contestants like to boast about how rubbish at cooking they are. Yes, it is cosy and mostly middle class, and the catastrophes – a dropped baking tray, a rubbery marshmallow – are safely contained within this little bucolic world, but for an hour a week, it is the television equivalent of comfort food. As we slide into winter and beyond, it feels like a valuable public service. A treat."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b6de9d0f037f602462e9a883cc3fb18d0868675/0_213_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e176535f7fbbd88d948927b00b73304","title":"greece alexis tsipras cabinet shakeup syriza","story":"Alexis Tsipras brings in younger ministers to refresh government in run-up to crucial electionsThe Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, has attempted to revive his flagging government with an array of younger cabinet figures in preparation for a general election he has described as “the mother of all battles”.Ahead of crucial polls in 2019, the once radical leftist has brought in 13 ministers, many in their 30s and 40s, in what has been hailed as a concerted shift to claim the centre ground. Six of the newcomers are women. Key posts, however, have been untouched, with the finance, foreign, defence and labour ministers remaining. Speaking before the reshuffle, Tsipras told his Syriza party the changes were precipitated by the need for renewal as debt-burdened Greece entered a new era days after exiting the biggest economic bailout in global financial history.  “It will be the mother of all battles,” he said, firing the opening shot in what is expected to be a heated campaign elections must beheld by autumn next year. “Our country, the government and the party need new blood and more appetite for work.” Tsipras’ popularity, already dented by the implementation of the austerity measures he once vowed to overturn, took a further hit this summer after his government’s bungled handling of catastrophic wildfires outside Athens. The death toll climbed to 97 this week, with authorities announcing that 25 remained in hospital, five in intensive care. The public outcry over a disaster now seen as one of the worst in living memory has exacerbated outrage over the government’s enforcement of budget and pension cuts in return for international rescue funds to avert the country’s euro ejection. Latest opinion polls show the main opposition New Democracy party leading by between five to 10 percentage points, more than three years after Syriza assumed office with the small rightwing Anel party. The embattled leader’s effort to make up lost ground is now focused on broadening his government’s appeal. In an attempt to remould itself as a progressive force capable of claiming centrist votes, a former socialist minister, Mariliza Xenogiannakopoulou, replaced Olga Gerovasili as minister of administrative reform. Myrsini Zorba, a professor of cultural theory and erstwhile socialist MEP, became culture minister, while the former conservative MP-cum-independent, Katerina Papacosta, was elevated to the post of deputy minister at the key citizens protection ministry. Gerovasili, a senior Syriza cadre, took over this ministry’s helm, marking the first time that two women have overseen public order in Greece.“He is not the Tsipras of 2015,” said the independent MP Haris Theocharis. “The radical rhetoric has gone and he is now clearly trying to establish Syriza as one of the two pillars in a two-party system. To do that he has to open up to the centre, but how successful he can be is another question.”Signalling he had taken stock of the criticism the government has faced over the fires, Tsipras attempted to inject new life into his administration with leadership changes at the interior and justice ministries. In a nod to younger Greeks, who are expected to play a vital role in the elections, the 41-year-old deputy economy minister Alexis Charitsis took over the powerful interior ministry, replacing Panos Skourletis, Syriza’s new secretary general. Michalis Kalogirou, a 42-year-old lawyer, was made justice minister. Tsipras has defined the coming battle as a fight between the old and new with his own party facing off the “bankrupt and corrupt” forces that brought Greece to the brink of economic collapse. Instead of being revitalised by the reshuffle, criticism was widespread that the new government reeked of tried and tested faces. Yet even the Greek prime minister’s fiercest opponents concede that at a time of tumult and unprecedented political drama, he has proved to be the country’s wiliest politician.

The last few crops were badly damaged. It’s a huge problem. I ward them off with my son’s cricket bat but they keep coming back,” said Tyagi.The stray cows, numbering hundreds, belong to dairy farmers in the area. Once they cease to give milk, farmers can’t afford to keep feeding them. Previously, they used to sell unproductive cows to the local abattoir for a small sum of money. But now, with the Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) government in Uttar Pradesh aggressively enforcing anti-cow slaughter laws, the situation is very different.The BJP has closed down the small butcher’s shops (mainly Muslim-owned) that used to dot the countryside. In addition, it has mobilised its supporters: bands of right-wing Hindu “gau rakshaks” or cow vigilantes who patrol the countryside like private militias, ready to rain violence on anyone selling or buying a cow for slaughter.Having stoked Hindu passions over the cow to come to power, the Narendra Modi government effectively legitimised cow vigilantes who have lynched Muslims and Dalits, who they believe are slaughtering cows.Human Rights Watch reported that in the two years up to April 2017 at least 10 Muslims, including a 12-year-old boy, were killed during mob attacks related to the campaign against beef consumption.Fear of these attacks has meant that in many parts of India, cows have become the farmer’s enemy. Sleep-deprived and frantic to protect their crops, farmers hold night-long vigils, spend money they can ill afford on fencing or putting barbed wire around their fields, and arm themselves with sticks and stones. In some cases, they have thrown acid on cows.As a Hindu, Tyagi reveres the cow. But not so much that he is willing for them to ruin his livelihood.“It’s madness. The dairy farmers in my village don’t let their cattle loose here because we know them. They let them loose in another village. The cows from other villages are let loose in my village. I can’t spend my life shooing away cows. I’ve got other things to do. But the BJP cares more about cows than farmers,” said Tyagi.Cow slaughter has been banned for years in about 20 of India’s 29 states out of respect for the sentiments of Hindus who venerate the cow. But in reality, officials were rarely bothered about what was happening on the ground in remote villages where Hindu farmers regularly sold their unproductive cows to the local Muslim butchers. This trade, albeit technically illegal, flourished.In March 2017, the Uttar Pradesh government closed down hundreds of what it called “illegal” abattoirs, leaving farmers with nowhere to take their cows. Other BJP state governments have also shut down cattle fairs where farmers used to sell unproductive or ageing cows either for meat or leather. “All farmers used to sell, under the radar, their old cows. Do you know much fodder costs? Do you know how many men it takes to lift a sick cow to clean the shed? After stopping giving milk, a cow can live for another 20 years. Do they feed their children or their cows? It’s absurd to expect a farmer to keep them just because your ideology says so,” said political commentator Chandra Bhan Prasad.Radha Kant Vats who runs a cow shelter in the Indian capital, says that farmers should hand over unproductive cows to cow shelters like his. “We will look after them and give them an old age full of dignity and love.”Most BJP politicians also say the same thing but state-run cow shelters are in short supply and in many of them cows are kept hungry and in overcrowded and filthy conditions. Many of the animals die of starvation or neglect.Earlier this month, angry villagers chased a herd of cows into a shelter in Chhattisgarh state and locked them in. Reports said 18 died of suffocation.Meanwhile, the cow’s enhanced social status has become something of a running joke in India. Stand-up comic Varun Grover asks audiences if they have noticed a distinctly more confident demeanour in the stray cows on the roads.“Before they used to be apologetic, clinging to the sides of the roads, taking up little space. Now, they park themselves bang in the middle as though to say ‘hey, it’s our time now’.” "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3566502.1531728066!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"cao 2018 what to do if you don t receive an offer","story":"Whether you receive the offer you want from the CAO or are having second thoughts about the course you chose, it is worth noting that further education has some excellent options for Leaving Cert students who do not receive a CAO offer to their liking.Further education (FE) colleges are still taking enrolments and students can go on to any college website to apply online. These routes from school into adult life provide opportunities for tens of thousands of young and not so young learners every year to develop their abilities and skills, and consequentially their sense of self-worth and personal self-confidence.Classes start in early to mid-September, so there is plenty of time to find a course. Some colleges hold open days over the coming week, so check out your local colleges’ websites.Assessment and certification for FE courses is based on both work during the year and exams at the end and the vast majority of FE courses offer progression back into a CAO course through reserved places.An example of this progression is the FE college in Blackrock (BFEI) which offers a two-year level 6 advanced certificate in business.There are similar arrangements for its certificate in creative multimedia course. Also at BFEI is a one-year level five applied psychology course.Graduates can go on to second year of a three-year honours BA counselling and psychology at the University of Wales.As with many FE colleges, BFEI offers a one-year level 5 computer science course. Graduates can apply through CAO for degree courses in UCD, DIT, IT Tallaght and ITB, Blanchardstown.In the City of Dublin Education Training Board (CDETB) area, Rathmines College has a long tradition in business, marketing, accounting, media, office administration and computer programming.It also runs a liberal arts access course where students can move to arts in UCD and Maynooth University.Courses are at level 5 and 6, with the latter giving direct advanced entry to second year of degree programmes in various colleges.One interesting point to bear in mind is that someone wishing to get an accounting qualification doesn’t have to do a business degree first.A primary degree is not a prerequisite for entry to professional accounting. Rathmines students can take an ACCA diploma in accounting and business with three higher level Cs plus two O6 grades at ordinary level in the Leaving Cert.After completing this programme and a research project, student get a BSc in accounting from Oxford Brooks University in the UK.For students without these grades, there are options through the Accounting Technician of Ireland and the Certified Accounting Technician courses in Rathmines, which both provide access through the professional accounting route.Rathmines also has employment orientated programmes in medical and legal administration, with almost guaranteed employment. The fees in Rathmines College are €460, or €210 with a medical card.The private education sector has a wide range of courses still available, either through vacant places on the CAO or by direct application to the college. Fees are about €5,000-€6,000 and tax relief of €400 can be claimed.Given the increase in the points for law degrees, disappointed students might consider Griffith College.Its programme involves students in clinical practice through the college’s Innocent Project which reviews cases where miscarriages of justice may have occurred.Recently, work by Griffith law students participating in the Griffith College-based Irish Innocence Project helped lead to the murder conviction of Harry Gleeson, who was executed in the 1940s, being overturned.Griffith also offers a film degree covering direction, production and editing of film and TV, and a four-year computer science degree with a six-month work placement, which has virtually a full employment record.Dublin Business School (DBS) has a range of level 8 degrees which may be attractive to those disappointed by the rise in CAO points. These programmes include a BSc in computing, BA in psychology, and a BA in business accounting and finance.Study through English in Europe Although the application deadlines have passed for many continental European degrees , they are still open for a wide range of courses for entry this September, particularly in the Netherlands. A wide selection of these programmes is on eunicas.ie, together with application deadlines and fees. Studying abroad is a fantastic opportunity, but I would hesitate if I was yet to celebrate my 18th birthday. European universities are relatively easy to get into, but successfully completing first year can be a real challenge, so constant and intensive commitment to the programme is essential if you want to make it into second year.Repeating the Leaving Cert is not for everybody. The numbers doing so in publicly funded schools have dropped by nearly 50 per cent in the past five years.You can repeat in the public school system, for example at the CDETB in Rathmines, Plunket, Pearse and Ringsend colleges.There are also private providers such as the Institute of Education in Dublin, Bruce College in Cork, the Tutorial in Limerick and Yeats College in Galway.If you are considering repeating, unless you had a specific reason why you missed a significant amount of time in school over the past year or so, there needs to be a major change in your approach to all aspects of study and exam preparation, if you are going to improve on your result from this year. As the saying goes, “if you always do what you’ve always done, you’ll always get what you’ve always got”.Take a year out Not everybody is ready to go directly to college after the Leaving Cert, particularly if they are under 18. If so, do not take a college course just to be with your friends or to feel part of the group.There are many creative ways to spend a year, including volunteering at home or abroad, while you figure out what you really want to study in college. Step back and reflect at leisure. It’s far better than charging in and dropping out after a few months.Details of every FE course on offer in Ireland are available through the qualifax.ie website."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3611190.1535535571!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"second round cao offers delivered this morning","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEngineering, teaching  and nursing saw some of the biggest points increases in this year’s round one offersClick here to download a PDF of the CAO’s 2018 round one offers: https:iti.ms2N1opT7Applicants who did not get the course of their choice when the Central Applications Office (CAO) issued the first round of college places last week are finding out this morning if they were successful the second time around.Last week, the CAO issued 73,652 round one offers to 50,746 CAO applicants.

File photograph: Joe O’Shaughnessy Letters purporting to come from the occupant of a property owned by Pat McDonagh of Supermac’s objecting to a competing fast food outlet proposed for Eyre Square in Galway was the subject of a private investigation which could not find the alleged objector living at the address given.The proposal for a fast food outlet at No 30 Eyre Square was made in 2012 in the name of BEB Practical Property Partnership. When the Hillbilly’s plan was being considered by Galway City Council, objections were submitted from an Ashling O’Doherty who gave an address at “24 Eyre Square Townhouses”.No 24, and at least five other apartments in this development, were owned at the time by Mr McDonagh.On behalf of BEB, a private investigating company, Premier Investigations Insurance and Legal Services, sought to deliver a letter to Ms O’Doherty at this address but was not able to.According to a report, dated February 5th 2013 and written by Áine O’Friel of Premier Investigations, the actual occupant of No 24 Eyre Square Townhouses, was not Ashling O’Doherty but one Tony O’Brien who told Ms O’Friel that “Ashling O’Doherty was not living at the address and that he had been living there since September 2012”.A fast food outlet eventually obtained planning permission but No 30 is now a branch of the Caffè Nero franchise.Meanwhile, it has emerged an environmental consultant, Howard Williams, chief executive of Inis Environmental Consultants Ltd, wrote a personal letter of support for Mr McDonagh’s Supermac’s motorway service station plans for the M18 near Ennis in Co Clare. Inis was retained by Mr McDonagh to assist with the Ennis planning application, including carrying out a bat survey. Mr Williams’ name also appears among the 180 or so alleged letters sent to Clare Council purporting to support the planning application for the M18 service station. But the address given – 25 Cloonbeg, Shanballa Estate, Lahinch Road – while registered as owned by Mr Williams is not the address at which he resides.Questions to Mr Williams – sent to him by email and text last week and again yesterday – went unanswered. However, he told Clare FM on Tuesday he had no part in generating the letters and was merely the delivery man.He said he was not hired by Mr McDonagh to orchestrate a campaign of support for the service station plan. Mr McDonagh has said that he (Mr McDonagh) agreed to underwrite the €20 fee for each of the letters of support submitted.Mr Williams has admitted being the person who delivered the 180 or so supportive letters to Clare County Council offices.At least 40 of the people in whose names the letters were submitted under forged signatures have said they did not submit letters. One was submitted in the name of a dead person and contained a signature.“The letters weren’t dealing with planning issues,” he said. “They were dealing with, they were letters of support . . . so there was no planning issues raised in it. The planning process is not influenced by letters of support.”A series of questions to Mr McDonagh’s public relations spokesman yesterday went unanswered."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3611198.1535536393!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"elon musk doubles down on pedo claims against cave diver","story":"Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has hit out at Vernon Unsworth, a British cave er instrumental in the Thai cave rescue, after Unsworth dismissed Musk\u0027s submarine rescue idea as a PR stunt. Video: CNN\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMusk was responding to another critic on Twitter on Tuesday night when he appeared to reaffirm the accusation. Tesla boss Elon Musk appears to have doubled down on his claim that a British explorer who was instrumental in freeing a group of Thai boys trapped in a cave is a “pedo”.The Tesla chairman was widely criticised last month for making the unfounded allegation against Vernon Unsworth, who was part of an international team that freed the young footballers and their adult coach from the Tham Luang cave complex in northern Thailand.Musk responded by calling Unsworth a “pedo guy”, later tweeting: “Bet ya a signed dollar it’s true.” He deleted both tweets soon after.He has never presented any evidence for the allegation nor claimed to have any. He apologised for the remark last month after Unsworth threatened to sue, Tesla shares ed, and the company’s investors issued an open letter demanding Musk apologise.“Did you investigate at all? I’m guessing answer is no. Why?” he wrote in subsequent tweets that are still online.Musk has been under pressure from Telsa investors over his erratic behaviour on social media and record losses posted by the electric vehicle manufacturer.He told the New York Times this month the past year had been “excruciating” and the “most difficult and painful of my career”, claiming he had been working up to 120 hours a week and neglecting his health and family.He is also being sued by investors for tweeting earlier this month his intentions to take his publicly traded company private, with the assurance: “Funding secured.”The tweet caused Tesla’s share price to surge 11 per cent, hurting the short-selling investors whose return depends on the company losing value.Lawyers have warned the tweet may have broken a law that bans public companies from announcing plans to buy or sell securities if executives do not intend or do not have the means to complete the deal, or if they are trying to manipulate the stock price. –  Service "},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

This differs from current dietary advice.”Professor Jeremy Pearson, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation said: “Eating well means looking at your diet as a whole, rather than focusing too much on inidual elements. Meat and dairy can contribute to a healthy, balanced diet as long as they’re eaten in moderation along with plenty of fruits and vegetables, pulses, wholegrains and nuts.”Until two years ago, Public Health England advised that around 15 per cent of calories should come from dairy. But two years ago it cut this to 8 per cent - and recommended consumption of low-fat versions.Nutrition and dietingHow Met Office weather data is being used to predict cholera outbreaksHolly Willoughby to replace Ant McPartlin on I\u0026#39m a Celebrity...Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe taken to hospital after panic attacks in Iranian prisonDonald Trump warns of Left-wing violence if Republicans lose control of CongressDisabled EastEnders actor criticises casting of Stranger Things star in BBC\u0026#39s The Elephant ManHow popular is Donald Trump?

We need to give the police more pressure to take this problem seriously,” he said.“We handed the case to the police for investigation. We are still waiting for advice from lawyers for further action.”The motives behind the case are not yet known. However, mainland residents with a spouse in Hong Kong can apply for a one-way permit to settle in the city. The young woman told reporters that she had wanted to work in the beauty industry and had first been lured by an advert for a make-up artist job on Facebook which offered free training and did not require previous work experience. When she applied for the job she was told that she could earn more money as a wedding planner but that she would be required to play the role of a bride and sign a marriage certificate as part of the qualification procedure. A friend later convinced her that she had become a victim of a scam and she sought help.  There was no money involved. “My biggest loss was having a marriage record,” she said.   Please review our commenting policyHolly Willoughby to replace Ant McPartlin on I\u0026#39m a Celebrity...Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe taken to hospital after panic attacks in Iranian prisonDonald Trump warns of Left-wing violence if Republicans lose control of CongressDisabled EastEnders actor criticises casting of Stranger Things star in BBC\u0026#39s The Elephant ManHow popular is Donald Trump?

The poll predicted that prices in the capital will fall 1.6 per cent this year, and 0.1 per cent in 2019, while for the UK in general they are set to rise 2 per cent this year and next, and 2.3 per cent in 2020. The average price nationally for a property was £301,973 in August, while in London this rose to £609,205. “The weight of evidence suggests that housing is overvalued once more,” said Hansen Lu at Capital Economics.Experts said there was a one in three chance of a “significant correction” in the London market. When asked what effect a disorderly Brexit would have on prices, answers ranged from “short-term fall” to “damaging” to “disaster”. When asked about the likelihood of a significant correction in London’s housing market before the end of 2019 the specialists gave a relatively high median of 29 per cent, with the highest at 75 per cent.One respondent predicted house prices could fall by as much as 40 per cent. “We see little upward or downward pressure on house prices at current near-zero interest rates. However, risks lie substantially to the downside,” said Andrew Brigden at Fathom Consulting.“Were interest rates to return to pre-crisis levels or higher, which may prove necessary if there were a sharp fall in sterling after a General Election, for example, then house prices could fall by around 40 percent.”UK house prices should be frozen for five years, think tank saysThis London area has seen the highest 20-year house price growth in UKThe Bank of England recently hiked interest rates above 0.5 per cent for the first time since the financial crisis, and said the rate would continue to increase at a gradual pace over the next few years. The experts also noted that the weaker pound - sterling fell to a one-year low against the euro this week - should be attracting foreign investors to the UK property market, but said uncertainty around Brexit was keeping them away. “Central London is tanking because the traditional international buyers are staying away - and the quantum of buyers is falling. A disorderly Brexit will exacerbate this trend,” said Tony Williams at property consultancy Building Value.Recent data from Rightmove showed asking prices dropped by more than £7,000 in August due to more sellers in the market.Additional reporting by newswiresEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":null,"title":"wasp parasite fossil discovery insects x rays","story":"Created with Sketch.Rare fossils capture parasites sustaining themselves by feeding on developing fliesClick to followThe IndependentPrehistoric parasitic wasps found frozen inside fossilised victims named \u0027Xenomorphia\u0027 after terrifying creature in Alien filmsScientists have found rare evidence of ancient parasites in action, using advanced techniques to reveal the unpleasant process by which long-extinct wasps preyed on developing insects.\u0026nbspDr Thomas van de Kamp and colleagues examined over 1,500 tiny fossilised fly pupae from around 23 to 66\u0026nbspmillion years ago discovered in France.Within these cocoon-like structures that maggots form before emerging as flies, the scientists used advanced X-ray techniques to reveal adult parasitic wasps growing.In total they found 55 cases of parasitisation taking place, frozen in time inside the tiny fossils for millions of years.Based on this evidence, it seems these wasps injected a single egg inside each pupa, which they grew and consumed the developing fly for sustenance.The scientists\u0026nbspdescribed four new species of wasp, and used a combination of imaging techniques to produce animated reconstructions of one of them, which they termed Xenomorphia resurrecta.The genus “Xenomorphia“ is named after the creature from the Alien\u0026nbspscience fiction film series, which is known as Xenomorph and\u0026nbspdevelops in a similar way to these wasps.\u0026nbspFossil evidence of parasites in action is extremely rare, and the researchers welcomed the opportunity to study the history of parasitic wasps similar to species observed today.“Our project proves that it is worthwhile to study old collections afresh with latest technology,” said Dr\u0026nbspvan de\u0026nbspKamp.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":null,"title":"subscribe to the daily edition our newspaper for your tablet","story":"For full functionality of this site it is necessary to enable JavaScript...Please follow the instructions in the link below.Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience."},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/02/20/16/sex-scenes-film-0.jpg  width= 1134  height= 756  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/02/20/16/sex-scenes-film-0.jpg","title":"toni collette orgasm bbc one wanderlust first woman ever","story":"Created with Sketch.The actor appears in new BBC drama \u0027Wanderlust\u0027 which she praised for its honest portrayal of female sexual pleasure\u0026nbspClick to followThe Independent CultureToni Collette claims she\u0027s the first woman to have an orgasm on the BBC, but is that true?In 2018, the female orgasm is still considered somewhat illusive, apparently to the point that actress Toni Collette is convinced she is the first actress to have one on the BBC.\u0026nbspThe star of BBC One’s new show\u0026nbspWanderlust\u0026nbspspoke with the\u0026nbspRadio Times\u0026nbspabout the new drama, where she praised it for its honest portrayal of female sexual pleasure. She appears as therapist Joy Richards, who is trying to save her marriage to husband Alan (Steven Mackintosh)\u0026nbspafter she suffers an accident. The show also stars Zawe Ashton, Deborah Bartlett, and Joe Hurst.\u0026nbsp“It’s so honest and fresh in the way the women are portrayed,” Collette\u0026nbspsaid. “To be a middle-aged woman, to be in a long-term relationship and to be alive, dealing with a lot of things – it’s tough.“Certainly a middle-aged woman’s sense of self-esteem, of sexuality, is not often talked about.”She added: “Someone told me I was the first woman to have an orgasm on the BBC... and I’m happy to take the accolade.”While it does sound as though\u0026nbspWanderlust\u0026nbsphas achieved a positive portrayal of female sexuality, TV fans have already pointed out that Collette’s claim can be quickly proven wrong.\u0026nbspWriting for\u0026nbsp,\u0026nbspZoe Williams pointed out that the BBC’s 2002 adaptation of\u0026nbspTipping the Velvet, a show that caused uproar among conservative campaigners,\u0026nbspfeatured more than one female climax. In an adaptation of Alan Tollinghurt’s\u0026nbspLine of Beauty, starring Hayley Atwell as Catherine Fedden, the author himself said he was unable to identify whether an audible orgasm was real or fake.\u0026nbspJoely Richardson as Lady Chatterley\u0026nbspdefinitely had an orgasm, thanks to Sean Bean’s gamekeeper Oliver Mellors, in Ken Russell’s 1993 adaptation. And who could forget the moment a BBC Breakfast journalist was interrupted during a live broadcast by what appeared to be the sound of a woman climaxing?

Children from lower-income households also had a higher than average risk of self-harming.One in four children worry about their appearance, poll showsOne in 10 teenage girls referred to mental health services last yearChildren needing specialist mental health treatment up by a thirdThe findings have prompted concerns that a shortfall in social care funding and difficulties accessing mental health support are pushing a growing\u0026nbspnumber of teenagers to crisis point.One young person told the charity: “I felt like self-harming was what I wanted to do and had to do as there was nothing else I could do. I think there is help for young people but not the right kind of help.She added: ”Feeling not pretty enough or good enough as other girls did contribute towards my self-harming.”The research found girls were significantly less happy than boys with their lives as a whole, and with each aspect of life measured in the survey. The largest gender gap was for appearance – over 1.5 points difference on a 10-point scale.It comes after a study by the University of Manchester last October found self-harm among teenage girls (10-19) had\u0026nbsprisen by 68 per cent in three years.Matthew Reed, chief executive at the Children’s Society, said: “It’s vital that children’s well-being is taken more seriously and that much more is done to tackle the root causes of their unhappiness and support their mental health.“Schools can play an important part in this and that is why we want the government to make it a requirement for all secondary schools to offer access to a counsellor, regularly monitor children’s well-being and have their mental health provision assessed as part of Ofsted inspections.“Issues like appearance, gender stereotypes and sexuality should be included in the new Relationships and Sex Education curriculum.“However, early support for vulnerable children and families in the community, which can help prevent mental health problems from developing, is also vital, and ministers must urgently address the £2bn funding shortfall facing council children’s services departments by 2020.”Dr Bernadka Dubicka, chair of the child and adolescent faculty at the Royal College of Psychiatrists said the huge rates of self-harm among were largely due to a shortfall in social care funding and family support, as well as a lack of community child and adolescent psychiatrists.“These disturbing figures highlight the sheer number of young people continuing to struggle with mental health issues,” she said.“Bullying at school – including being teased about your sexuality - has been highlighted as a particular worry for young people, and so we welcome the additional funding promised by the government for early intervention in schools.“Children must be able to access help for their mental health difficulties from services before they fall into crisis.”Cllr Roy Perry, vice chairman of the Local Government Association’s children and young people board, said cuts to local authority budgets meant councils were finding it increasingly difficult to support children.“Many councils are being forced to cut early intervention work, including youth services, which helps children avoid reaching crisis point, perform better at school and avoid mental health issues in later life,” he said.“This is why we are calling for councils and schools to be given the funding to offer independent mental health counselling so pupils have access to support as and when they need it.Dr Max Davie, officer for health promotion for the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) said: “Mental health is one of the biggest health epidemics of our time and is strongly linked to social disadvantage. These latest figures further emphasise this and highlight just how urgent the need for appropriate action is.\u0026nbsp“We know that poor mental health can lead to poor employment prospects and an increased risk of drug and alcohol use, so it is important that support is fully inclusive, joined up and offered to children and young people early to give them the best possible chance in later life.” \u0026nbspHealth news in pictures152 Vaping could lead to cancer, US study findsA study by the University of Minnesota\u0027s Masonic Cancer Centre has found that the carcinogenic chemicals formaldehyde, acrolein, and methylglyoxal are present in the saliva of E-cigarette users252 More children are obese and diabetic352 Gay, lesbian and bisexual adults at higher risk of heart disease, study claimsResearchers at the Baptist Health South Florida Clinic in Miami  focused on seven areas of controllable heart health and found these minority groups were particularly likely to be smokers and to have poorly controlled blood sugarNew guidance by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the body which determines what treatment the NHS should fund, said lax road repairs and car-dominated streets were contributing to the obesity epidemic by preventing members of the public from keeping active552 New menopause drugs offer women relief from \u0027debilitating\u0027 hot flushesA new class of treatments for women going through the menopause is able to reduce numbers of debilitating hot flushes by as much as three quarters in a matter of days, a trial has found.652 Doctors should prescribe more antidepressants for people with mental health problems, study findsResearch from Oxford University found that more than one million extra people suffering from mental health problems would benefit from being prescribed drugs and criticised “ideological” reasons doctors use to avoid doing so.752 Student dies of flu after NHS advice to stay at home and avoid A\u0026ampEThe family of a teenager who died from flu has urged people not to delay going to A\u0026ampE if they are worried about their symptoms.

Longer commutes also appear to have a significant impact on mental wellbeing, with those commuting longer 33 per cent more likely to suffer from depression2252 You cannot be fit and fatIt is not possible to be overweight and healthy, a major new study has concluded. The study of 3.5 million Britons found that even “metabolically healthy” obese people are still at a higher risk of heart disease or a stroke than those with a normal weight rangeWhen you feel particularly exhausted, it can definitely feel like you are also lacking in brain capacity. Now, a new study has suggested this could be because chronic sleep deprivation can actually cause the brain to eat itselfDavid Lloyd Gyms have launched a new health and fitness class which is essentially a bunch of people taking a nap for 45 minutes. The fitness group was spurred to launch the ‘napercise’ class after research revealed 86 per cent of parents said they were fatigued. The class is therefore predominantly aimed at parents but you actually do not have to have children to take part2552 \u0027Fundamental right to health\u0027 to be axed after Brexit, lawyers warnTobacco and alcohol companies could win more easily in court cases such as the recent battle over plain cigarette packaging if the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights is abandoned, a barrister and public health professor have said.2652 \u0027Thousands dying\u0027 due to fear over non-existent statin side-effectsA major new study into the side effects of the cholesterol-lowering medicine suggests common symptoms such as muscle pain and weakness are not caused by the drugs themselves2752 Babies born to fathers aged under 25 have higher risk of autismNew research has found that babies born to fathers under the age of 25 or over 51 are at higher risk of developing autism and other social disorders. The study, conducted by the Seaver Autism Center for Research and Treatment at Mount Sinai, found that these children are actually more advanced than their peers as infants, but then fall behind by the time they hit their teenage years.2852 Cycling to work ‘could halve risk of cancer and heart disease’Commuters who swap their car or bus pass for a bike could cut their risk of developing heart disease and cancer by almost half, new research suggests – but campaigners have warned there is still an “urgent need” to improve road conditions for cyclists.2952 Ketamine helps patients with severe depression ‘when nothing else works’ doctors sayKetamine helps patients with severe depression ‘when nothing else works’ doctors say3052 Playing Tetris in hospital after a traumatic incident could prevent PTSDScientists conducted the research on 71 car crash victims as they were waiting for treatment at one hospital’s accident and emergency department. They asked half of the patients to briefly recall the incident and then play the classic computer game, the others were given a written activity to complete. The researchers, from Karolinska Institute in Sweden and the University of Oxford, found that the patients who had played Tetris reported fewer intrusive memories, commonly known as flashbacks, in the week that followed3152 Measles outbreak spreads across Europe as parents shun vaccinations, WHO warnsMajor measles outbreaks are spreading across Europe despite the availability of a safe, effective vaccine, the World Health Organisation has warned.3252 Vaping backed as healthier nicotine alternative to cigarettes after latest studyVaping has been given an emphatic thumbs up by health experts after the first long-term study of its effects in ex-smokers.3352 Common method of cooking rice can leave traces of arsenic in food, scientists warnMillions of people are putting themselves at risk by cooking their rice incorrectly, scientists have warned.3452 Contraceptive gel that creates ‘reversible vasectomy’ shown to be effective in monkeysAn injectable contraceptive gel that acts as a ‘reversible vasectomy’ is a step closer to being offered to men following successful trials on monkeys.3552 Shift work and heavy lifting may reduce women’s fertility, study findsWomen who work at night or do irregular shifts may experience a decline in fertility, a new study has found.3652 Breakfast cereals targeted at children contain \u0027steadily high\u0027 sugar levels since 1992 despite producer claimsA major pressure group has issued a fresh warning about perilously high amounts of sugar in breakfast cereals, specifically those designed for children, and has said that levels have barely been cut at all in the last two and a half decadesScientists have made a “monumental leap forward” in the treatment of pancreatic cancer after discovering using two drugs together dramatically improved patients’ chances of living more than five years after diagnosis.3852 Japanese government tells people to stop overworkingThe Japanese government has announced measures to limit the amount of overtime employees can do – in an attempt to stop people literally working themselves to death.3952 Over-cooked potatoes and burnt toast ‘could cause cancer’The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has issued a public warning over the risks of acrylamide - a chemical compound that forms in some foods when they are cooked at high temperatures (above 120C).4052 Cervical cancer screening attendance hits 19 year lowCervical screening tests are a vital method of preventing cancer through the detection and treatment of abnormalities in the cervix, but new research shows that the number of women using this service has dropped to a 19 year low.4152 High blood pressure may protect over 80s from dementiaThe ConversationIt is well known that high blood pressure is a risk factor for dementia, so the results of a new study from the University of California, Irvine, are quite surprising. The researchers found that people who developed high blood pressure between the ages of 80-89 are less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease (the most common form of dementia) over the next three years than people of the same age with normal blood pressure.4252 Most child antidepressants are ineffective and can lead to suicidal thoughtsThe majority of antidepressants are ineffective and may be unsafe, for children and teenager with major depression, experts have warned. In what is the most comprehensive comparison of 14 commonly prescribed antidepressant drugs to date, researchers found that only one brand was more effective at relieving symptoms of depression than a placebo. Another popular drug, venlafaxine, was shown increase the risk users engaging in suicidal thoughts and attempts at suicide4352 \u0027Universal cancer vaccine’ breakthrough claimed by expertsScientists have taken a “very positive step” towards creating a universal vaccine against cancer that makes the body’s immune system attack tumours as if they were a virus, experts have said. Writing in Nature, an international team of researchers described how they had taken pieces of cancer’s genetic RNA code, put them into tiny nanoparticles of fat and then injected the mixture into the bloodstreams of three patients in the advanced stages of the disease. The patients\u0027 immune systems responded by producing killer T-cells designed to attack cancer. The vaccine was also found to be effective in fighting “aggressively growing” tumours in mice, according to researchers, who were led by Professor Ugur Sahin from Johannes Gutenberg University in Germany4452 Green tea could be used to treat brain issues caused by Down’s SyndromeA compound found in green tea could improve the cognitive abilities of those with Down’s syndrome, a team of scientists has discovered. Researchers found epigallocatechin gallate – which is especially present in green tea but can also be found in white and black teas – combined with cognitive stimulation, improved visual memory and led to more adaptive behaviour. Dr Rafael de la Torre, who led the year-long clinical trial along with Dr Mara Dierrssen, said: “The results suggest that iniduals who received treatment with the green tea compound, together with the cognitive stimulation protocol, had better scores in their cognitive capacities”4552 Taking antidepressants in pregnancy ‘could double the risk of autism in toddlers’Taking antidepressants during pregnancy could almost double the risk of a child being diagnosed with autism in the first years of life, a major study of nearly 150,000 pregnancies has suggested. Researchers have found a link between women in the later stages of pregnancy who were prescribed one of the most common types of antidepressant drugs, and autism diagnosed in children under seven years of ageParents have been warned that giving children paracetamol-based medicines such as Calpol and Disprol too often could lead to serious health issues later in life. Leading paediatrician and professor of general paediatrics at University College London, Alastair Sutcliffe, said parents were overusing paracetamol to treat mild fevers. As a result, the risk of developing asthma, as well as kidney, heart and liver damage is heightened4752 Connections between brain cells destroyed in early stages of Alzheimer’s diseaseScientists have pinpointed how connections in the brain are destroyed in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease, in a study which it is hoped will help in the development of treatments for the debilitating condition. At the early stages of the development of Alzheimer’s disease the synapses – which connect the neurons in the brain – are destroyed, according to researchers at the University of New South Wales, Australia. The synapses are vital for brain function, particularly learning and forming memories4852 A prosthetic hand that lets people actually feel throughThe technology lets paralysed people feel actual sensations when touching objects — including light taps on the mechanical finger — and could be a huge breakthrough for prosthetics, according to its makers. The tool was used to let a 28-year-old man who has been paralysed for more than a decade. While prosthetics have previously been able to be controlled directly from the brain, it is the first time that signals have been successfully sent the other way4952 Research shows that diabetes drug can be used to stop first signs of Parkinson’sScientists in a new study show that the first signs of Parkinson’s can be stopped. The UCL study is still in its research period but the team are ‘excited’. Today’s Parkinson’s drugs manage the symptoms of the disease but ultimately do not stop its progression in the brain.5052 Drinking alcohol could reduce risk of diabetesA new study shows that drinking alcohol three to four days a week could reduce the risk of diabetes. Wine was found to be most effective in reducing the risk due to the chemical compounds that balance blood sugar levels. 5152 NHS agree, after loosing legal battle, to fund HIV prevention drugHaving lost the legal battle over who was to pay for the drug the NHS have finally agreed to fund the HIV prevention treatment. National Aids Trust, whom Princess Diana supported, said that it was a ‘pivotal moment’.Scientists have discovered that the switch is controlled in the hypothalamus area of the brain. The switch acts on insulin receptors and involves the protein TCPTP. Scientists have discovered the switch in mice and are hopeful but yet to find out if the switch would be the same in humans.152 Vaping could lead to cancer, US study findsA study by the University of Minnesota\u0027s Masonic Cancer Centre has found that the carcinogenic chemicals formaldehyde, acrolein, and methylglyoxal are present in the saliva of E-cigarette users252 More children are obese and diabetic352 Gay, lesbian and bisexual adults at higher risk of heart disease, study claimsResearchers at the Baptist Health South Florida Clinic in Miami  focused on seven areas of controllable heart health and found these minority groups were particularly likely to be smokers and to have poorly controlled blood sugarNew guidance by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the body which determines what treatment the NHS should fund, said lax road repairs and car-dominated streets were contributing to the obesity epidemic by preventing members of the public from keeping active552 New menopause drugs offer women relief from \u0027debilitating\u0027 hot flushesA new class of treatments for women going through the menopause is able to reduce numbers of debilitating hot flushes by as much as three quarters in a matter of days, a trial has found.652 Doctors should prescribe more antidepressants for people with mental health problems, study findsResearch from Oxford University found that more than one million extra people suffering from mental health problems would benefit from being prescribed drugs and criticised “ideological” reasons doctors use to avoid doing so.752 Student dies of flu after NHS advice to stay at home and avoid A\u0026ampEThe family of a teenager who died from flu has urged people not to delay going to A\u0026ampE if they are worried about their symptoms.

Researchers have found a link between women in the later stages of pregnancy who were prescribed one of the most common types of antidepressant drugs, and autism diagnosed in children under seven years of ageParents have been warned that giving children paracetamol-based medicines such as Calpol and Disprol too often could lead to serious health issues later in life. Leading paediatrician and professor of general paediatrics at University College London, Alastair Sutcliffe, said parents were overusing paracetamol to treat mild fevers. As a result, the risk of developing asthma, as well as kidney, heart and liver damage is heightened4752 Connections between brain cells destroyed in early stages of Alzheimer’s diseaseScientists have pinpointed how connections in the brain are destroyed in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease, in a study which it is hoped will help in the development of treatments for the debilitating condition. At the early stages of the development of Alzheimer’s disease the synapses – which connect the neurons in the brain – are destroyed, according to researchers at the University of New South Wales, Australia. The synapses are vital for brain function, particularly learning and forming memories4852 A prosthetic hand that lets people actually feel throughThe technology lets paralysed people feel actual sensations when touching objects — including light taps on the mechanical finger — and could be a huge breakthrough for prosthetics, according to its makers. The tool was used to let a 28-year-old man who has been paralysed for more than a decade. While prosthetics have previously been able to be controlled directly from the brain, it is the first time that signals have been successfully sent the other way4952 Research shows that diabetes drug can be used to stop first signs of Parkinson’sScientists in a new study show that the first signs of Parkinson’s can be stopped. The UCL study is still in its research period but the team are ‘excited’. Today’s Parkinson’s drugs manage the symptoms of the disease but ultimately do not stop its progression in the brain.5052 Drinking alcohol could reduce risk of diabetesA new study shows that drinking alcohol three to four days a week could reduce the risk of diabetes. Wine was found to be most effective in reducing the risk due to the chemical compounds that balance blood sugar levels. 5152 NHS agree, after loosing legal battle, to fund HIV prevention drugHaving lost the legal battle over who was to pay for the drug the NHS have finally agreed to fund the HIV prevention treatment.

The European Parliament, which also has its own veto, has made a similar threat.Both Britain\u0026nbspand the EU\u0026nbspsay they want to prevent a hard border in Ireland the EU has proposed Northern Ireland staying in the EU customs territory\u0026nbspto accomplish this. The UK has rejected this proposal on the basis that it would be a breach of British sovereignty, but the EU has argued that it would not be, and suggested the UK “de-dramatise” its response to the plan – effectively telling Britain to chill out.The EU says the UK’s own proposal would not prevent a hard border, and UK officials have suggested they have no plans to offer any further solutions.Apart from the Ireland issue, UK and EU also want to come to a separate political declaration on what their future trade relationship will look like. Though the main talks for finalising this relationship would be held after the UK leaves, the British government says it needs detail on the future relationship to pass the plan through Parliament.Theresa May’s Chequers plan, the UK’s blueprint for the future relationship, has effectively been rejected by the European Commission. The EU raised fundamental issues with the British unique proposals for customs, as well as unhindered special UK access to the single market for goods.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesJohn Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

There were, however,\u0026nbspoverall incentives to beat removal targets, he added.After the firm waived concerns about commercial sensitivity, the Home Office sent the committee the section of the contract detailing the incentive scheme, which showed the it was paid between £10.58 and £22.63 per person contacted who left the UK voluntarily.Separate documents released\u0026nbspby Mr Javid to the Committee also reveal that the department is producing only “case summaries” for the iniduals identified to be shared with the independent reviewer, Wendy Williams, for further examination.Ms Harman said it was “crucial” that the case files of\u0026nbspWindrush\u0026nbspcitizens caught up in the scandal were revealed in full.

That was probably lacking.\u0026ldquoWhat is the direction? What is the horizon for which you want to bring us?

The answer is no.My decision comes from an accumulation of disappointments. I don\u0027t have faith in the state anymore.I don\u0027t want to give the illusion that my presence in the government means we are up to the task of meeting environmental challenges.Mr Hulot was known to be furious at the government\u0027s vow to relax hunting laws in a bid to a boost Mr Macron\u0027s appeal in rural areas.The left-winger also hit out at Mr Macron\u0027s decision to persist in a nuclear industry that is a useless madness, economically and technically.The French President faces further political turmoil as he embarks on a new wave of controversial reforms in the coming weeks.Mr Macron has promised to reform France\u0027s pensions system, overhaul public healthcare and change the highly unionised public sector.But his reform drive will be complicated by forecasts that France\u0027s economic growth is slower than expected.

It was a horrible time.”In light of his apology, some people might talk about rehabilitation. He’s said he’s sorry and he won’t do it again.People have to be given a ­second chance — right?Before I answer that, let me flag up a few other stories that caught my eye this week.There’s the tale of Sean Simmons, 28, a domestic abuser from Hull who waterboarded one of his ex-partners, tying her to a bath before covering her face with a towel and pouring cold water over her, saying: “This is what I do to people who lie. I’m going to make you tell the truth.”Later, he produced a knife and said he’d “have to kill her”.And Darren McKie, a 43-year-old police inspector who was jailed for life after strangling his wife Leanne, 39, at their home in Cheshire, then dumping her body in a lake.And Glyn Leedell, 39, who threatened to kill a woman with a kitchen knife within hours of meeting her in a Rotherham pub.Oh, and the news that Ian Stewart, 57, who was jailed for 34 years after smothering his wife, children’s author Helen Bailey, is being questioned over the death of his first wife, Diane Stewart, who died after collapsing in the garden of the couple’s home in Cambridgeshire.I could go on, but it’s too depressing.If you read the same stories you may have taken a moment to despair that the papers are full of similar stories every day — of women being killed, brutalised and attacked by the men who purport to love them.Or, you may have barely noticed because these stories are so ­commonplace.Of course, not all men who threaten to kill their partners go on to do so.But you can be sure that most of the women above had probably suffered years of traumatic intimidation and abuse before their partners actually acted on their threats.Meanwhile, those women were ­living in fear — that’s what these chumps get off on. They want to make their victim feel helpless and powerless.So, let’s talk about forgiveness and rehabilitation.Do I think people who really regret being a perpetrator of domestic violence deserve a second chance? Yes, I do.If someone is genuinely ­repentant about anything they’ve done wrong, you can’t refuse ­forgiveness forever.Do I think that Dan Osborne’s second chance should take the form of a public platform on which to rehabilitate his image and, no doubt, earn a pretty penny or two into the bargain?No, I really, really do not.Sure, it was three years ago and no, he didn’t actually go on to act on his threat to knife his ex.But by letting him into the CBB house, Channel Five are sending a strong message that domestic violence allegations are a trivial affair, not to be taken seriously.By welcoming him in, despite his “scandal”, they are normalising and turning a blind eye to the kind of behaviour that too often ruins — and sometimes ends — women’s lives.People on TV are role models. And to allow a man who has made verbal threats to kill his girlfriend to become a role model is irresponsible in the extreme.ITV recognised this when they decided to boot him off Towie.Channel Five should have done the same.SHIRLEY BALLAS has revealed she weighs herself every day in the run up to Strictly in order to get “telly ready”.You might think that sounds extreme but, believe me, the only way to get telly ready is to take very seriously the old adage that the screen adds a stone.I don’t exactly weigh myself before filming The Apprentice or Give It A Year but, in the three months leading up to filming, I always manage to lose – by hook or by crook – a stone.In fact we all do – Lord Sugar and Claude Littner are watching what they eat as well.Then, as soon as filming stops, we all immediately put the weight back on again as normal life resumes.And, let me tell you, it’s a lot harder to take it off than it is to put it on.I’M a big believer in benefits being available to people who need help because they can’t help themselves.But the story of Bangladeshi immigrant Abdul Jalil, a father of six who came to the UK in 1969, really makes a mockery of the system.Jalil, who is 64, hasn’t worked since 1988 for “health reasons”.But a probation officer found the only problem he had is a slightly tender right knee.In 2008, he exceeded the amount of cash that claimants are allowed to have when he was loaned £25,000 to buy his council house.He did not notify the Department for Work and Pensions and continued wrongly claiming more than £28,000 over the next eight years.He then lied to the DWP about his assets as he filled out his benefits review form in 2012.He had re-mortgaged his council flat in May that year for roughly £148,000 and given the money to his children so they could purchase their own properties keeping around £86,500 for himself.Then at court this week he was spared jail – in favour of community service and even had the cheek to say he would do it if it was “light work”.I know that some people need benefits to get back on their feet, and I’m proud to live in a country that provides that.But once a person is back up, they need to actually stand on their own two feet – rather than abusing the system that helped them.Like all benefit cheats, he should pay the money back or go to jail and never be allowed access to benefits again.AS taxpayers we give almost £14BILLION a year away in foreign aid of which almost £1billion goes to the EU, and this week the Government was threatening to withdraw our cash if there was no-deal Brexit.Why wait until Brexit? Just stop it now.We need this money to fix our own country – our NHS, our police forces, our schools, benefits and housing all need it desperately.And the worst part of all this is that we have to borrow the money to give it away.Our country has almost £2TRILLION of debt, which costs around £50billion a year to service in interest.Borrowing money to give it away, it’s the economics of the madhouse.I KNOW our prisons are full, but it beggars belief that Allan Williamson, 45, was let off with a two-year community order and 30 days rehabilitation.When police raided his flat in Hulme, Manchester, they found more than 600 images – including 68 films classed as Category A, the highest level of children being sexually abused.To be clear, the images showed children as young as seven being sexually abused by adults.Still, Judge Elizabeth Nicholls,  decided prison wasn’t necessary, saying Williamson had been “open and frank” with the police about his behaviour and because the man has allegedly taken “tentative steps to address these issues”.So the guy was in possession of 600 images including many of the worst kind of paedophilia – and he’s still in the community?Who in their right mind would want this guy in their community?I know the prisons are buckling, so let’s just build more – even if that includes sending prisoners out to sea in containers.When is the justice system going to start thinking about the victims as opposed to the perpetrators?I BET the boyfriend of Kay Longstaff – the air hostess who spent ten hours in the water after plunging from a cruise liner – is feeling a bit embarrassed.Longstaff was miraculously rescued ten hours after falling – or jumping – from the Norwegian Star, 60 miles off the Croatian coast last week.It’s not quite clear what happened beforehand but other passengers and crew claim to have seen Ms Longstaff in several arguments with her partner Craig Rayment, above with Kay, on the evening of the incident.Once she’d been rescued, Mr Rayment’s estranged wife Kelly offered Ms Longstaff some unsolicited support, saying: “If I was on a ship with him, I would get off any way I could.”Oh dear.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

with this and accepted, regardless of the fact I have never fiddled my expenses or taken cash for ­questions, some of those who come before me have damned all politicians to the sin-bin.I do, however, think there is one very simple thing all politicians could agree to do that would help rehabilitate us to the public.We could answer a straight question with a straight answer.This week doing the rounds on Twitter was a clip of Jeremy Corbyn on Channel 4 News being asked six times: “Do you honestly believe Britain will be better off outside of the EU?”Each time he answered with a iation of, “Labour wants to maintain good relations with the EU to protect jobs”.His words are not bad — it is certainly the answer he and his team would have practised.But it is not an answer to that question and that’s the problem.To the average punter it just looks like politicians can’t be straight.The answer, as far as I’m concerned, is a big fat no.Gavin Williamson, the Defence Secretary, suffered a similar cringeworthy encounter with Richard Madeley in May.The question in the wake of the Salisbury poisonings was: “You told Russia to ‘shut up and go away’.Do you regret that now?Do you think it was too informal?”He started by answering an entirely different question about paying tribute to healthcare workers, which had absolutely nothing to do with what he was being asked.God only knows why he didn’t just say: “Yeah, it wasn’t my finest hour but I guess I was just really cross that people in Britain were being poisoned.”He could then have gone on to say all the nice things about Salisbury health workers.Instead, Madeley savaged him and all that anyone remembers of the encounter is that Gavin Williamson should avoid interviews.Mind you, at least both Corbyn and Williamson gave an answer.At least they bothered to take part.Boris Johnson would just have offered his questioner a cup of tea as if he was Mrs Doyle from Father Ted.I honestly despair.I’m not sure when the art of just repeating the same message over and over again, even if it in no way answers the question, started.Most people put it down to the Tony Blair years of slick media management, but times have surely got to move on.Politicians spend too much time hedging their bets, trying to keep all the people happy and end up pleasing no one by waffling through an answer that is basically six of one and half a dozen of the other.I get that it is hard when your job is basically a massive popularity contest, but I am not sure we are made more popular by dodging questions and refusing to give our own opinions.People contact me every single week telling me they don’t always agree with me but they appreciate that I stand up for what I believe.I honestly don’t think the British people want politicians to say an approximation of a safe answer, or to try to be pals with everyone.People have a damn sight more respect for people when they say what they think, even if they disagree.For too long politicians have been especially scared of upsetting working-class people, without recognising that most people don’t even think of themselves that way any more.I have absolutely no idea where the idea came from that the average member of the public can’t stand a bit of discussion and disagreement, or are so fragile that they will all fall apart if someone says something not to their liking.I have never once voted for someone who I agreed with 100 per cent of the time.I didn’t marry someone I agreed with a 100 per cent of the time and, frankly, if he tried to please me, placate me and pander to all my views I would no longer stay married to him, because it would be dishonest.Don’t get me wrong — saying what you think is not a universally appreciated characteristic and some do get in touch with me to tell me to shut up and go away.Much like Russia probably felt when Williamson said it to them, I pay little mind to this and crack on.Journalists do sometimes ask stupid questions.Politicians do have to be careful about what they say as it can sometimes get twisted and misrepresented.Things are not always simple, and giving a quick answer on a complex issue takes some skill.All that said, it has got to be time to stop the waffle and give the public a break from shouting at their telly each night: “For God’s sake, answer the bleedin’ question!”IT’S that time of year where slow news weeks turn to how much wine we should drink and if swearing at work should be banned.Apparently no amount of alcohol is safe, which will change absolutely no one’s behaviour, and swearing at work is bad for morale.I cannot agree on the swearing front.I am not advocating we all run around barking sweary orders and aggressive expletives at our colleagues but I find sometimes, especially in times of high stress in the office, nothing will quite explain it like a collective FFS.I have seen how a bit of good old Anglo Saxon can be used to break down barriers between me and my constituents.It stops me seeming like some lofty bureaucrat who cannot understand their problems.In some cases it makes them physically relax if we get a bit sweary about their crappy landlord or their benefits being stopped.We all swear, and most of us drink, I doubt that’s going to change.PADDY DOHERTY of My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding and Celeb Big Brother fame was in the papers this week, leading the funeral procession for his nephew.A sad affair, of course, but the diamond-encrusted funeral casket is reported to have cost £100,000.I remember organising my own mother’s funeral and balking at spending around £2,500 for an event I’d rather have not had to attend.I could hear her voice in my head saying, “How much?” as we wrote out cheques for cars and coffins. My wedding only cost £3k and I thought that was a bit much.When my time comes, I implore my family to keep their cash. I wouldn’t be thankful for money being literally burnt.THIS week’s, in fact this year’s, feminist icon goes to the unlikely Stormy Daniels.There is, of course, no reason why feminism would not extend to women performing in pornography but there are few crossovers.Stormy Daniels is a hero.World leaders across the globe pander to Trump, few are brave enough to publicly call out his racism, sexism and terrible decision making.Our own PM holds his hand, allowing him to make her look weak and feeble.Ms Daniels has been brave enough not only to take on the most powerful man in the world but also some pretty tooled-up lawyers too.After apparently receiving payment and signing a non-disclosure agreement to hush her up about an affair she had with Trump in 2006, she broke rank.This was not just a kiss and tell, this was a story that has caused Donald Trump’s lawyer Michael Cohen to plead guilty to breaking election campaign rules.He explicitly stated that he was told to pay her the money by “the candidate” meaning Trump. Donald Trump will probably get away with this misdemeanour, but it is the closest he has come to being in real trouble.Without Stormy Daniels and her courage to face down legal threats, vicious hate mail and a campaign to discredit her, powerful men would continue to use women as playthings and just pay them off when they are done.Stormy Daniels is every woman who has been messed about and we salute her for fighting back.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Project Fear forecast dramatic downturns in the economy if the people were so unwise as to vote for Brexit. Wrong again.Since then, we have had record levels of employment, huge investments from the likes of Google, Microsoft, SoftBank and a long list of other companies.They demonstrated their confidence in the future of this great country in the best way possible — with their money.This time round the wise insight came from Andy Haldane, the best economist at the Bank of England.Ruefully he said “economic forecasting is having a Michael Fish moment”.Michael Fish was the weather forecaster who completely mispredicted the huge 1987 storm that struck Britain.If only economic forecasters were even as good as weather forecasters, we would be a lot better off. But they are not, and they are at it again.This week Chancellor Philip Hammond predicted the Treasury would need to raise an extra £80billion in 15 years’ time in the event of a no-deal Brexit.And yet the Chancellor insists on ­trotting out yet another bogus forecast, on the very day that my successor as Brexit Secretary, Dominic Raab, is ­presenting the first set of preparation for no deal.Coincidence? I do not think so.The great departments of state are very careful about what they put in the public domain, and exactly when.For nobody is this more true than the Treasury, which has to judge the public perception of everything it does, if only because of its effect on the markets. So this was either spectacularly incompetent, or deliberate. I know what I think.And even more disgraceful, by doing so it will undermine the Government’s hand in striking a deal with the EU.If they do not think we dare walk away, then they will give us the worst deal they can think of. Bear in mind that the Chequers deal already concedes enormous amounts to the EU.It would not be long before our world-leading position in life sciences, gene technology, artificial intelligence, self-driving cars and a whole range of other modern industries would be being actively undermined by the Europeans.As for being out of reach of the ­European Court, pull the other one.But now the Treasury is beginning to fear that even these spectacular concessions the Government has made in the Chequers deal will not deliver agreement from the European Commission — or if it does, the Commons will turn it down.In that event you can expect attempts by the Remainers in Parliament to try to scupper our departure by delaying it beyond the General Election, or offer some other enormous raft of concessions to give back control of the EU.Hence the ridiculous suggestion that the Army would be used to move food around the country.Why? What conceivable aspect of European policy would handicap British hauliers moving British products from Kent to Cumbria?None of course, but it was just the bogus nonsense some of our Remainer media is only too happy to carry ­completely uncritically. Similarly, we have heard suggestions of all sorts of shortages, based it seems mostly on the idea that the French might impede the flow of goods between Calais and Dover.It would not be the first time we had dealt with such issues. We had about 30 days of such delays in 2015. I remember queues of lorries, but I do not remember shortages of food or medicines.And on other issues, are the Europeans really going to pick a fight on data with the biggest IT power on the continent, on banking are they going to refuse to cooperate with the greatest financial ­centre in the world?Are the Greeks, Italians and Spaniards going to disadvantage the UK residents on whom many of their local economies depend? Or stop tourism? I think not.I suspect we are quite likely to have the odd hiccup when we leave the EU, but we will be able to cope, which is what Dominic Raab was demonstrating this week. And any problems we have will be over in months not years.So in 15 years’ time, far from worrying about Mr Hammond’s £80billion bill, the country will have trouble remembering what all the fuss was about.The biggest question will be whether we have made the most of the opportunities created by Brexit.And that is what we should worry about today, creating the circumstances where this great country can take its proper place in the world. We will only be able to do that if we allow ourselves the freedoms a clean Brexit will deliver.So my advice to all my old colleagues in Cabinet is simple: Ignore the misery merchants of the Treasury, stop fearing things that will never happen, and start planning for the real opportunities that this great country can grasp when it sets its mind to it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Its GDP is growing rapidly. Similar to India, its middle classes are rocketing. And its workforce is estimated to be larger than China’s by 2035.Over 17 millions Brits voted for a Brexit that would make us a freer, richer country.This is exactly the type of buccaneering move that will make that vision a reality.THE EU’s threats regarding a No Deal Brexit are total bluster.The bloc claims there will be chaos if we leave without a deal, that the impact on trade and travel will be so severe we will crawl back to the negotiating table.But behind closed doors, the EU admits this is codswallop.The EU Commission has drawn up secret No Deal plans that are “very similar” to Britain’s Brexit preparation.In other words, in the event of a No Deal they will keep things almost exactly the same because they don’t want to be hit.What a surprise.WHEN will Labour moderates realise their party is beyond repair?Jewish Labour MPs need bodyguards for the party conference next month. There is a backlog of anti-Semitism complaints that could take YEARS to probe. And their leader is an ­anti-Semitic IRA-apologist, who counts the former BNP leader and the KKK among his cheerleaders.By staying in the party, Labour MPs signal that they want Corbyn to be PM.No amount of tribal loyalty can make them think that is a good idea.IT is shocking that deadly diet pills are being brazenly flogged on Instagram.The Facebook-owned company must better protect youngsters.It should hire a proper workforce to establish oversight of what is put online.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I dont enjoy the smell of vomit or stool, but the two mixed together was one of the worst things Ive ever smelled.One doctor on chat site Quora said one of the worst things he had witnessed was a patient battling a flesh-eating disease in his arm and leg that had maggots crawling around in it.And of course, theres US-based doctor Sandra Lee - aka Doctor Pimple Popper who has become a breakout star, with her videos of lancing giant boils  - some as big as bowling balls - as well as spots and cysts gaining a staggering five million views on YouTube.Earlier this year, Dr Lee even removed a unicorn horn worth of pus from a lump that had been growing on a mans head for six years.It took 20 minutes for the doctor to remove all of the pus - which poured out in a manner resembling cottage cheese - before stitching the resulting wound back together.“People sometimes think the real doctors work in hospitals and GPs only treat coughs and colds,” Dr Amir Khan, star of Channel 5’s GPs: Behind Closed Doors, tells Sun Online.“But that’s far from the truth.We deal with all sorts of problems every day and some of them would make your eyes water.Dr Khan said: “We deal with all sorts of problems every day and some of them would make your eyes water.“It’s the same for every GP, it’s just a part of the job.“There’s no way you could be a GP and let being squeamish affect what you do.“You sort of just get used to it.“For example, I really dislike feet when I’m at home and you see it on telly, but at work it’s just another thing to deal with.”“Once you’ve manually evacuated someone’s bowels, there’s nothing left to phase you.But despite performing essential medical procedures in the surgery, Khan admits hes concerned that these services may not be available in the future.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He attended the leisure centre at times when schools have swim classes.He goes up to the swimming pool, sees the kids, sees them using the facilities, stalks them to the shower area and stalks them to the cubicle area and uses the cubicle next to them.There was a 12-year-old he was following as well. It is all shown very clearly on the CCTV.The court heard no charges were brought in relation to the 12-year-old.Ms Sales said: At the time of the offences, he was the director of Eddie Catz, which are soft play centres for young children.The number of victims is not known, although a police officer involved in the case estimated it could be around 40.Judge Andrew Campbell said: We are certainly running into the tens, twenties and possibly very many more.The company has centres in Earlsfield, Putney, Wimbledon and Newbury, as well as a presence in branches of Mothercare in Leeds, Gateshead, Manchester, Solihull and Cribbs Causeway, near Bristol.Johnsons lawyer said his client had enjoyed a successful sporting career, which took him to Italy, but was plagued by alcohol problems and marriage troubles after he was injured.Two of the voyeurism charges relate to the filming of the 14-year-old girls, while a third relates to images of women taken under cubicles at the leisure centre.Two further charges relate to images of women taken through peepholes and under cubicles in toilets and changing rooms at the soft play

of painstaking research, he devised a “number-picking algorithm” which drew on a method he called “combinatorial condensation” - stay with us.Stefan realised that in some draws, the total cost of buying a ticket to play every possible combination was much lower than the grand jackpot prize.For example, if a game required six numbers ranging between 1 and 40 to be chosen, there would be 3,838,380 possible number combinations.If the jackpot was £10 million, and tickets cost £1 each, he stood to win a massive profit.Along with a group of friends, he bought huge amounts of tickets using all the possible combinations and ended up taking out the top prize — worth over £15,000 .After paying expenses, he was left with just £3,000, but it was enough to bribe officials and escape Romania’s Communist system, and move to Australia to start a new life with his wife and two kids.He eventually won the lottery 14 times without breaking a single law.Stefan persuaded a pool of investors to put their cash together to build a lotto syndicate.He also invented an automation system, with printers and computers using the algorithm to fill out tickets automatically using every combination of numbers.The group won 12 lotteries and won hundreds of thousands of smaller prizes across Australia and the UK.Lotto authorities cottoned onto the plot, and changed rules to ban computer-printed forms and bulk buying tickets.But Stefan had an audacious plan B.With the profits he’d already made, he planted scouts across the US and also developed a list of previous lotteries with jackpots that were at least three times higher than the total of all possible combinations.He set his sights on the Virginia Lottery, as its numbers only ranged between one and 44, which meant the total number of possible combinations was millions lower than in other games.He set up an official company, Pacific Financial Resources, and under it also developed a trust called the International Lotto Fund.He persuaded thousands of investors to pour cash into the fund, raising millions in the process.From a warehouse in Melbourne he employed 16 full-time staff to print out seven million tickets over three months, which he then mailed to an associate in the US.The syndicate won the jackpot and a host of smaller prizes.But while Mr Mandel’s method was not illegal, it still raised suspicions, and he was dragged into a four-year legal battle.He was eventually cleared of any wrongdoing — but while he managed to pocket millions from the win, his investors were left with much smaller payouts that promised.Mr Mandel filed for bankruptcy in 1995 and at one point spent 20 months behind bars in Israel thanks to an investment scam.All US states have since passed laws banning the use of Mr Mandel’s strategy.But despite his epic gamble, Mr Mandel downplayed the risks he had faced during a 2012 interview with the Romanian newspaper, Bursa.“I’m a man who takes risks, but in a calculated way,” he told the publication.“Trimming my beard is a lottery: There is always the possibility that I’ll cut myself, get an infection in my blood and die — but I do it anyway.“The chances are in my favour.A

assassins","story":"The two Scotland Yard detectives have trawled 5,000 hours of CCTV footage trying match faces in Salisbury at the time of the poisoning with images of Heathrow passengers.The two super recognisers are specialists in memorising and recognising faces and believed to be behind the identification of two suspects who the UK authorities now want to extradite from Russia.They were dispatched to Salisbury shortly after Sergei Skripal, 67, and daughter Yulia, 33, were poisoned with nerve agent Novichok, in March.It is believed they were shown images of known Russian agents suspected of operating in the UK before searching for their faces on Salisburys CCTV.Former detective chief inspector Mick Neville, who set up the squad, said: The two super recognisers were deployed immediately because of their special skills and they are still on the case. Ive no doubt theyve played a key role.They have an innate skill, you cant buy it and you cant teach it. They have a highly unusual ability in remembering faces, whether its from a picture, a bit of film or someone theyve met.They dont concentrate on the obvious, the greying hair or the moustache or the glasses, they look at the eyes, the mouth, the ears, the things that dont change. They can recognise a face from the tiniest glimpse of part of it.The intelligence agencies will have images of foreign agents who come here and once they are scanned by the super recognisers they will be imprinted in their memory.The squad was set up in the wake of the 2011 London riots and helped identify the killer of schoolgirl Alice Gross in West London in 2014.Police believe the Skripals, who both recovered from the attempted assassination, were poisoned by Novichok smeared on the front door handle of their Salisbury home.Mr Neville added: Sergei was living openly with his real name registered in the voters database and seemingly unconcerned at the possibility of being assassinated.But he may have had security because he was worried about being burgled and so might his neighbours, so its possible the would-be killers were caught on a camera in the act.Vehicles moving around with dashboard cameras might also have recorded an image.Its possible the attackers followed the Skripals into the city centre the next day to make sure that the poison finally worked and there are lots of cameras around the bench where the victims were found.Its a laborious part of the operation, but there is plenty of material for the super recognisers to work on.The Kremlin denies being involved in any Novichok poisoning plot.Dawn Sturgess, 45, died in June, just 10 days after coming into contact with Novichok believed to be stored inside a perfume bottle. Her partner Charlie Rowley, 45, survived but has since been rushed back to hospital with suspected meningitis.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We fear this policy is putting thousands of private renters on low incomes at risk of poverty and homelessness.“We are calling on the government to conduct an immediate review and to look at ending the freeze on Local Housing Allowance.”And Matt Downie, Director of Policy at housing charity crisis added: This report highlights just how much housing benefits for private renters are falling short of the levels needed, leaving many homeless people stuck in a desperate situation and putting yet more people at risk of homelessness.Your energy bills are a priority debt - that means you should pay them off before other bills like your credit card as your supplier could threaten to cut your supply-off completely.But dont bury your head in the sand.

And since April we’ve provided additional, targeted housing support for low-income households by increasing more than 200 local housing allowance rates.“Since 2011, we have provided a further £1bn in discretionary housing payment for local authorities to support vulnerable claimants with their housing costs.“We have also delivered over 378,000 new affordable properties since 2010 and we are investing a further £9bn in affordable homes to buy and rent.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000429566269.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"luxury six bed home on market for 1m is hiding two amazing secrets","story":"But theres more to The Limes than meets the eye.The luxury home has its own BUNKER hidden in its grounds.The extremely rare concrete WW2 air raid shelter is still intact and accessible to the homeowners and previous occupants have used it as storage space.And thats not all - a sealed up secret school room is hidden away under the floorboards of the house.A piece of angled skirting board and an area of the flooring that feels ‘bouncy’ mark where the concealed entrance to the school room is.Deep in the garden, a concrete air raid shelter from the Second World War is hidden away under a rockeryThe Limes also has other quirky historic features including servants quarters, a wood burning fireplace and a cellar.Natalie Carter at Fine \u0026amp Country said: “The Limes is a wonderful example of how history makes its mark on houses through the generations.“The servants’ quarters are typical of Georgian houses, while the bunker is a rare existing example of a concrete air raid shelter.“And now, having studied the history and walked the house, it appears theres a former school room under the house thats been sealed up.The house is currently on the market for £1million.All of the six bedrooms are doubles and the garden has several fruit trees and vegetable patches.The large sitting and drawing rooms on the ground floor offer large living space, with each room having a bay window and French windows overlooking the garden, allowing in plenty of light and direct access to the lawn.And the kitchen features an Aga range in addition to an electric oven and gas hob, with a separate pantry and boot room.Tucked away is an office overlooking the garden and just off the kitchen is a good size dining room linking the kitchen with the hallway.The first floor leads to four of the six double bedrooms, one of which has an en-suite bathroom, and the additional two bedrooms can be found on the top floor.People interested in buying the house will undoubtedly be drawn by both its history and impressive space.And theres still room to put your own stamp on the The Limes when its snapped up. While the original house is listed, the extension housing the kitchen, laundry room and study is unlisted, offering potential to convert this area of the house into a significant kitchen, dining and garden room subject to planning permission.Foodies can enjoy produce from several fruit trees bearing mulberries, apples and pears while the vegetable garden offers a good selection of vegetables, fruits and herbs.At the bottom of the garden there are three sheds and a gate leading into the church grounds, and one down to the river Thames."},{"url":null,"title":"eagle eyed google users spot something terrifying lurking in a cemetery on street view","story":"The video is taken from Google Maps Street View of Martha Chapel Cemetery in Texas, USA and features a creepy looking little girl hiding behind a tree with a cloaked figure in the background.Video of the Street View shows a sunny scene but as the camera pans gravestones can be seen among the pine trees.The camera stops panning and settles on a tree behind which lurks a strange figure.After zooming in, a little girl is seen peeking around the left side of the tree.

The twins were, as babies, at the centre of an international scandal after being sold online to British couple Judith and Alan Kilshaw. At six months old they were caught up in a transatlantic battle after it emerged a US couple had already adopted the sisters, who were then snatched back by their birth mother Tranda Wecker and sold on to the Kilshaws for \u0026pound8,200. Now, nearly 18 years on, the Mirror has tracked down the sisters and can reveal how they left behind their distressing start in life after being settled with a loving church-going family. Speaking exclusively to the Mirror just weeks after the twins started at university where they are studying social sciences, their adoptive mum tells how “her babies” have flourished. The proud 56-year-old said: “At times it has been tough, sure it has, but they are our babies and we cannot be more proud of them. They have grown into fine young women, each with their own dreams and ambitions.  “Nothing will hold them back from their goals. From the day they were brought to us they have been raised with unconditional love. “God blessed them into our care and we are forever grateful.” The twins’ life is a world away from that of their birth mother, who has yet to find any stability, moving from one home to another and unable to hold down a job. Tranda was a 28-year-old mother of five when her four-month-old twins were adopted by a couple in San Bernardino, California, called Richard and Vickie Allen. Eight weeks later she talked the Allens into allowing her one last visit to say a final goodbye to the girls. However, after taking the twins out for the day she never returned. On December 1, 2000, the Kilshaws arrived in San Diego, 100 miles south, where Wecker introduced them to her infant daughters. Two days later Vickie Allen’s brother confronted the couple at their hotel and demanded the babies back. The Kilshaws claimed that until that moment they knew nothing of the Allens, and they quickly left the state. Over the following week they drove with Wecker and her three-year-old daughter to St Louis, Missouri, to get the twins’ birth certificates, then on to Arkansas, where adoptions can be handled in as little as 10 days.  On December 22 the adoption papers were completed during a five-minute hearing. Within a week the Kilshaws had taken the twins – by then renamed Kimberly and Belinda – to their home in Buckley, North Wales. The seven-bedroom farmhouse was shared with Judith’s younger daughter, their two sons, six dogs, more than a dozen cats, two ferrets, a horse, a pony and two pot-bellied pigs. As the controversy over the twins’ sale erupted the FBI looked into it in the US while then-Prime Minister Tony Blair vowed to ban such sales. Eventually Kiara and Keyara, who now live under different names that the Mirror has chosen not to reveal, were returned to the US after the courts removed them from the Kilshaws. They were flown to their home state of Missouri, where social services had already found a family for the girls. Their adoptive father, now 72, said from the home where the twins still happily live: “It was fate. “I remember seeing them on Good Morning America not long after they were handed over to the British couple. “I remember thinking to myself what a heartbreaking situation it was. “My wife was getting ready for work one morning and I was in bed having just retired, and I said, ‘Oh man, look at those cute little girls.’ “Not long after I received a phone call from social services and they said, ‘We’ve got some twin girls and they are overseas. Would you take them? They need a stable home’. “I felt it was my duty to take them. They brought them straight from the airport to our home and we have never looked back since.”  The twin baby girls arrived at their home in Missouri in good health despite their ordeal. Most people welcomed the twins into their new surroundings, but after all the controversy not everyone agreed with the move. Their adoptive father said: “My wife lost some friends over the fact we had taken Kiara and Keyara. “They thought they should be returned to Tranda, but social services didn’t want that to happen.” Living in Missouri for the early part of their lives, the girls were shielded from the scandal surrounding their dramatic start in life. Tranda Wecker failed to have any contact with the girls until 2006, when she launched a legal bid to gain access. Their adoptive mother said: “The girls were doing really well at the time. They were extremely settled and very happy.”  When Wecker went to court to gain access to the children, the courts ordered that it would only be permitted once the girls had been told their true identity by their adoptive parents and a social worker. “They were only six at the time,” said their mum. “But in truth, we’ve never once hidden the truth from them. They know who they are.”  At the time of the contact, Tranda Wecker vowed to get the girls back but, much as she did in 2001, she later turned her back on them again. “The contact the girls have with Tranda is down to them,” their mum said. But Keyara doesn’t want anything to do with her.” The twins worked hard throughout school and took an active part in sports there.  They both excelled in lacrosse and basketball as well as joining the school band, performing at their high school football team’s games. Now they have continued their passion by joining the band at their new university. For now, the two girls remain living at home with their parents, although they hope next year to move into halls of residence some 30 miles away. Although identical, the independent girls have grown up to have very different personalities. Keyara is known to be bubbly and outgoing while Kiara is more reserved and measured.

And Dame Kelly Holmes is no different - as she found herself desperately needing the toilet during a huge standstill on the M25 yesterday afternoon. The Olympic champion was among thousands of motorists stranded for nearly six hours after two lorries were involved in a serious crash. The smash, near Kent\u0027s Dartford Crossing, led to enormous tailbacks, with more than 200 people even offered beds for the night at an Ikea store. Dame Kelly took to social media to reveal she was stuck in the standstill - with nowhere to go, wearing bright red trousers and bursting for a wee.     Sharing a picture of the scene on Twitter, she posted: So, what happens when your meant to be somewhere an hour ago and can’t because there is a two hour delay with a standstill, nowhere to go, nowhere to divert, in bright red trousers, in a bright blue car, Kelly Holmes and you want the loo...desperately. CRY!!!   She later confessed to having to get out of her car to do a roadside wee. Sorry but I had to go! she told her 130,000 followers several hours later. That\u0027s one thing a runner does well and doesn\u0027t care about - squatting! . She added: Even had the lovely traffic control guy give me some toilet roll and hand wipes!     Dame Kelly, 48, ended up stuck in miles of traffic after the crash blocked the  approach to the Dartford Crossing.  Some drivers were marooned for nearly six hours without moving an inch after the two HGV lorries collided at around 2.35pm. Dramatic pictures from the scene show the damaged lorries lying on their sides, with one left hanging over an embankment. Debris could be seen littering the motorway. Many people clambered out of their cars and began stretching their legs on the M25 clockwise carriageway amid the traffic. Dame Kelly, from Hildenborough, Kent, shared her frustration at being among those stuck on the road - with no toilets in easy reach.     One Twitter user jumped at the opportunity to send her a link to an  informative article detailing how to urinate while on a road trip.  The double Olympic Champion seemed to find it amusing. Another user suggested: Any bushes at the side of the road? How far next services.....walk there. Is there a mobile home in the jam...be cheeky? They added: Moral of the story go to the loo before you leave you depart on your journey. X .  The delays stretched back from the QEII bridge as far as Junction 28 for  Chelmsford.  Dame Kelly later tweeted that she had been given some chocolate.

Lucy McHugh, 13, was found dead in woodland last month, 24 hours after she disappeared from her home. Police have been hunting for her killer for just over a month and today cordoned off an area of woodland a mile and a half from where her body was found. Large metal fences were put up around the area, where police said they believe scissors or a knife used to kill Lucy could have been dumped.  A dog walker discovered Lucy\u0027s body at Southampton Sports Centre, Hampshire, on July 26 - where she could have lay dead for almost 20 hours. The detective leading the murder investigation today appealed for anyone who saw a man in a dark jacket and blue jeans riding a dark coloured mountain bike away from the murder scene on the day Lucy went missing. Detective Superintendent Paul Barton said they believe the man cycled from the sports centre to Tanner\u0027s Brook, an area of woodland in the Shirley area of Southampton. Police tape has also been put up on the fencing, with police cars parked in front to stop people from entering the area.  Detective Superintendent Barton said: We have reason to believe that the murder weapon - a knife, scissors or other sharp implement - was discarded in this area and we are focusing our searches there. As part of our investigation, we are also looking to identify a man we believe cycled from the Sports Centre to this location that morning Lucy went missing.

Lucy disappeared from her home in the Millbrook area of Southampton just before 9am on July 25, with chilling CCTV footage from a Tesco store capturing some of her final movements before her death. The teenager is seen walking \u0027with purpose\u0027 in the footage, with detectives believing she was going to meet someone. Her disappearance sparked a desperate search by family, friends and police, but her tragically her body was discovered at around 7.45am the following morning. Stephen-Alan Nicholson, 24, was arrested in connection with the teenager\u0027s death but later bailed. He was then charged with failing to cooperate with police after he refused to tell them his Facebook password.

Located in the attractive Thames-side village of Benson, South Oxfordshire, ‘The Limes’ boasts six double bedrooms, substantial living space, half an acre of grounds - and it\u0027s own WW2 bunker. History buffs have the chance to snap up the Georgian property and investigate the sealed-up school room under the ground floor and explore the WW2 concrete air raid shelter concealed under a rockery on the grounds. The property retains a wealth of period features typical of the era including generously sized rooms, servants’ quarters and a cellar.  The bedrooms are all doubles, and those looking to enjoy a taste of The Good Life can enjoy the fruits, and veg of their labour from several fruit trees and vegetable patch in the almost half acre grounds. The large sitting and drawing rooms on the ground floor offer impressive living space, each enjoying a bay window and French windows overlooking the garden, allowing in plenty of light and direct access to the lawn. The drawing room has a restored open fireplace while the sitting room has a log burning stove. The kitchen features an Aga range in addition to an electric oven and gas hob, with a separate pantry and boot room. Tucked away is an office overlooking the garden and just off the kitchen is a good size dining room linking the kitchen with the hallway. Eagle-eyed guests will spot the angled skirting board and feel the floor is ‘bouncy’ in one part of the hallway suggesting this is the now concealed entrance to what was a school room.  The first floor leads to four of the six double bedrooms, one of which has an en-suite bathroom, and the additional two bedrooms can be found on the top floor. While the original house is listed, the extension housing the kitchen, laundry room and study is unlisted, offering potential to convert this area of the house into a significant kitchen, dining and garden room subject to planning permission. Foodies can enjoy produce from several fruit trees bearing mulberries, apples and pears while the vegetable garden offers a good selection of vegetables, fruits and herbs.  And it’s in the grounds, hidden under a rockery, that the nine-foot high bunker can be found. Accessed via stone steps, the shelter is tanked and has potential as an additional store or den. At the bottom of the garden there are three sheds and a gate leading into the church grounds, and one down to the river Thames. Associate at Fine \u0026amp Country Oxford, Natalie, Carter said: “The Limes is a wonderful example of how history makes its mark on houses through the generations.

Gerald Gavan ploughed into the youngsters having initially drove at his target Billy McGregor in Glasgow\u0027s Castlemilk. A judge today watched graphic footage of the children being hurtled into the air as the 22 year-old hit both them and McGregor. One 14 year-old girl – who Gavan also reversed over - suffered a broken neck and required lengthy surgery. Gavan is now behind bars after he pled guilty to attempting to murder the six youngsters on March 24 this year.  The carpet salesman, of East Kilbride, South Lanarkshire, also admitted trying to kill McGregor in the same incident. He was remanded in custody at the High Court in Glasgow pending sentencing next month. Prosecutor Maryam Labaki said the background to this crime was a “family feud” involving a “fatality”. She added: “Gavan is associated with one side of that dispute.” Gavan\u0027s former co-accused Gary Owen – who had not guilty pleas accepted – is a relative of Jordan Owen wanted in connection with the play park shooting of Jamie Lee. The hit and run occurred after McGregor – also known as William Dearie – had gone to a local shop around 4pm. The children were meantime “talking and laughing together” in the same street.  As McGregor crossed the road towards them, he clocked Gavan\u0027s silver Vauxhall Astra heading at him. Miss Labaki: “The car accelerated and steered towards Billy McGregor travelling diagonally and mounting the pavement.” He failed in trying to dodge the car – but Gavan then carried on into the children on the pavement. The advocate depute added: “As the car collided with the group, six of them were struck causing them to be thrown up into the air in different directions. “Two of the children who had been sent flying were hit with such force that they were carried over a parked car landing on the ground opposite.” CCTV of the incident was played to the packed court. Distressed relatives of the young victims sobbed. One woman left the courtroom in tears. A 14 year-old girl was unable to get up. Gavan then reversed over her before “leaving the scene at speed”.

Jon Bothwell was never the same after 15-year-old Paige was killed, his mum says, and friends have told how he battled depression after losing her. Roseanne Bothwell said her 37-year-old son, a boxer who struggled with nightmares after the murder, died at home but paramedics brought him back. He was rushed to hospital, where he was in a coma before dying on Saturday, the Daily Record reports.  Jon’s 71-year-old mum said: “He was heartbroken. Paige loved Jon out her mind too. He never got over it. He died of a broken heart. He was never the same after she died. “He said he used to have nightmares where he’d see her at the bottom of his bed and she wanted him to go with her. We’ll never get over Paige’s death and Jon took it the worst. He died in the bedroom but they brought him back. “The paramedics then took him to hospital. He was in a coma. He died there on Saturday.” Jon\u0027s friends told how he believed his life was not worth living after Paige was murdered by vicious John Leathem in March 2016.  Jon, who had split up with Paige’s mum Pamela, had battled depression after being unable to reconcile how he was unable to protect his daughter, who was just 15 and only 4ft 8in tall. Friends claim the brutal violence inflicted on petite Paige haunted him in the two years since her death. Jon’s body was found at his flat in Cambuslang, near Glasgow, on Saturday night. He was taken by ambulance to Hairmyres Hospital in East Kilbride, where he died. One friend said: “Her dad was in and out of her life but he still loved her the way any dad would. He was a successful boxer and well known in Glasgow and beyond but he had his troubles with alcohol and the death of Paige was a hammer blow.  “Jon was in the hospital just last week and people close to him were very concerned about his wellbeing. “He couldn’t get over the fact that he couldn’t save Paige. He lost his life the day she died.” The friend said that Jon felt he had been isolated from his little girl at the time of her funeral, which was arranged by her mum Pamela and her husband, Paige’s step-dad Andy Munro. The pal said: “Paige was registered as Paige Bothwell when she was born and her name-changing had an effect on her dad. The friend said that Jon wasn\u0027t given a prominent role at Paige\u0027s funeral and felt that Paige\u0027s step-dad was at the centre of events, and that crushed him.  The friend added: Jon was a decent guy and a good boxer but after everything that happened in his life he turned to drink.” Jon split up with Pamela when Paige was two and the parting was bitter. It was revealed that Paige had a close relationship with her step-dad Andy. In 2014, she posted on Facebook: “Happy Father’s Day dad. To the best guy out. Even though we argue 24/7, you’re always there for me and always will be and I have your back too. “You’ve been with us since I was about four and it’s honestly been the best thing that’s ever happened to me. And mum loves you to pieces and is so happy. Love you lots and lots, have a great day. xxxx” Jon never spoke in public about his daughter’s death but the ferocity of the violence was hard to bear. Leathem stabbed Paige 61 times and inflicted more than 140 injuries after she stopped for a breakfast roll at his Delicious Deli in Clydebank on March 19, 2016, when she was on her way to work at a hair salon.

The warm weather looks set to last well into September as high pressure will build after the weekend pushing temperatures into the mid-20Cs.  Met Office spokeswoman Nicola Maxey said: “There is a chance that next week we will start to see high pressure build from the Azores and this will cause a rise in temperatures. “Settled conditions are more likely in the south with more chance of rain and cooler temperatures in Scotland and northern England.  “This pattern of high pressure is expected to set in through the rest of September and later in the month we could see increasing temperatures spread further north. “There may be some short-lived unsettled cooler spells in this period, and with high pressure in charge there will be some cooler nights due to the clearer skies. “Parts of the country could see the odd air frost.” "},{"url":null,"title":"dying dog who spent entire","story":"NewsDying dog who spent WHOLE LIFE chained up ticks off bucket list as tear-jerking video documents her final daysRescued Corgi mix Miss Willie slept in a soft bed for the first time, ate cake at her birthday party and went to the beachShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByChris kitching10:28, 29 AUG 2018Updated11:20, 29 AUG 2018Newsthis.style.display=\u0027none\u0027\"/Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror/news/world-news/video/dying-dog-chained-up-entire-13156302,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-M3TH25P,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:false,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx/rhs,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:false,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx/rhs,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA dying dog who spent her entire life chained up outside ticked off a bucket list with a birthday party, daily walks and a trip to the beach in her final days. Miss Willie was given just weeks to live after her owner finally surrendered the ailing Corgi mix after she had been tethered on a tiny patch of dirt for 12 years. Her last moments were filled with activities she had missed out on over the years, including a canoe ride, pizza night, a spa day with a massage and sleeping on a soft bed for the first time. But just 16 days after she was rescued by Peta workers, Miss Willie died peacefully surrounded by those who loved her.  Workers from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals  first became aware of Miss Willie more than a decade ago, finding her tied up outside a home in Halifax County in the US state of North Carolina. Despite repeated pleas they could never persuade her owner to surrender her so she could have a better life. Workers paid regular visits to the depressing patch of dirt where she was kept chained and gave her the best care that they could.  They gave her food, water, toys and treats, and, most of all, attention - scratching her ears and kissing her nose. They have her a doghouse and filled it with straw to help her keep warm during the winter months - and kept asking the owner to hand her over. During one visit, Peta worker Jes Cochran found that Miss Willie was coughing, wheezing and struggling to stand on her own because she was so weak.  With her condition deteriorating, Miss Willie\u0027s owner finally relented and surrendered the dog, allowing her to be taken to a vet for an evaluation and emergency care. It was revealed that she had end-stage heartworm disease, lung tumours and two tick-borne diseases, among other problems. Miss Willie was given just weeks to live, but there were fears that she wouldn\u0027t make it through that first night of freedom. Peta said Ms Cochran took Miss Willie in and decided to make her final days the happiest of her life by giving her the love and care she\u0027d always deserved.  They threw her a blowout birthday party complete with balloons, party favours and vegan cake. She went on regular walks and trips to the beach, a spa and a local fire station to say thank you to firefighters for their service. And they spoiled her with pizza and Taco Tuesday parties over 16 fun-filled days before she died. A Peta spokesperson wrote: Everybody loved Miss Willie. The little Corgi mix was pretty hard to resist with her wagging banner of a tail her jaunty, self-assured walk and her sweet little face that still looked puppyish and up for any adventure even when she had grown very old and sick.

Kimberel Eventide, 36, identifies as a Pleiadian starseed - a person who has past memories and connections to other lives on other planets. Prior to identifying as an elf, or elven, Kimberel, from Illinois, America, had been a spiritual teacher for eight-years. Kemberel, whose husband does not identify as an elf, began her elven journey after feeling a connection with Tolkien\u0027s fictional characters after reading and watching Lord of the Rings. Speaking about her day-to-day life as an elf, she explained: I dress as a High Elf as much as I can in velvet, silk, ornate detailed, or nature inspired clothing. I have about five different types of elf ears and cuffs I wear, plus my own ears have a slight point to them so I don\u0027t always wear my ears.   And now she\u0027s on a mission to inspire others to follow in her spiritual footsteps and discover their inner elf - through her Facebook posts, YouTube channel and blog.  She classes herself as a city-dwelling elf but she tries to connect with nature wherever she can and surrounds her home with plants. Kimberel says friends and family have been very supportive of her journey, especially her husband, who she describes as the Aragorn to her Arwen. He does not consider himself to be anything but human nor fully understands Kimberel\u0027s beliefs - yet fully supports her. Kimberel has a mission called \u0027Projectelvenstar\u0027 to help humans transform into high elves. She said: I ultimately believe in Oneness and that we are all from the Prime Source of the whole Universe that is the Universal Mind, but I think what really describes me best on earth now in this physical body is that I am a Pleiadian starseed. Usually starseeds are creating blogs, writing books, on YouTube, making Facebook and social media sites to push higher consciousness and wisdom to the forefront of human minds in today\u0027s world. You will never find a starseed just simply living a normal human life-we have human ascension and transformation on our mind constantly.  I am also known as an Otherkin, a person who identifies with something else besides being just a human. As many of you can already tell, our perceptions of being human is changing and expanding to include different genders, identities, and now Otherkins. Kimberel also offers individual Skype sessions to help others looking to follow in her footsteps. She said: I am an Elven spiritual teacher who offers personal Skype online sessions to help individual souls. I also create YouTube videos as my way of helping people elevate their consciousness levels to get them in touch with the High Elven personality of Tolkien\u0027s Lord of the Rings or just higher consciousness in general. I offer guidance to other Otherkins, and starseed souls who feel they resonate with something other than being human and how to cope with being in this world. I have a mission and I call it Projectelvenstar. It\u0027s specifically to help humans transform themselves into elves - ears are optional but can become a by-product of becoming extrasensory and hearing better over time. Regardless of ears, I believe humans can act, think and become as wise as the elves of Lord of the Rings. It is a growing up of humanity in a natural way that I am after. I want humanity to grow up organically and move forwards into a brighter age of experience that lives peacefully with nature and has advanced technology for all to experience. This is my major mission, to guide humanity into the higher dimensions of both perception and experience. My friends are supportive of me as they all knew this is who I always was deep down inside. My husband is very much like Aragorn and I am his Arwen.  He is a human soul or at least does not consider himself to be anything other than human in this lifetime. He loves and supports me in this project. He does not understand it and does not watch many of my videos, but he knows who I am and loves me for it. I get no resistance from him except when my filming cuts into our time together. That is the balance I am trying to achieve- helping the world reach High Elven consciousness and at the same time trying to have a family with him. Kimberel said she was called to being an elf and feels like she belongs to the fictional world of Lord of the Rings. She added: I was called to it. I have always resonated with the Elves of Lord of the Rings, ever since reading the books and watching the movies I felt I belonged in Rivendell or Lothlorien and not with other humans at all. One of my spirit guides was a Pleiadian woman who looked much like Galadriel in Lord of the Rings, and I received messages from my intuition to say it was time to bring the elf personality into reality.

They\u0027re great in salads, burritos, smashed on toast and are especially good for making guacamole dip. The only downside is that they\u0027re pretty expensive . In most supermarkets a large one costs at least \u0026pound1 - and that won\u0027t go very far, especially for big families. But now there\u0027s a dream job going where you get paid to them for six months. It\u0027s all in the name of science , as researchers are trying to figure out whether the fruit  trims belly fat or not.  Loma Linda University in California is looking for 250 avocado lovers to eat them in large and small quantities as part of the study. Participants will be assigned to one of two groups: one will eat one avocado every day for six months, while the other will eat just two per month. At the end of the trial, each avocado eater will be paid \u0026pound230. Not bad for simply munching on avo every now and again! It would probably need to be your side hustle though. On their website, researchers write : Since avocados contain the highest fat content of any fruit, it seems illogical to think they might actually help people lose their belly fat.

Mr Musk, 47, branded Vern Unsworth a pedo guy in a bizarre series of tweets days after the diver helped save 12 schoolboys and their football coach from a cave in Thailand . The founder of Tesla and SpaceX apologised for the remark but, on Tuesday, appeared to strike again on social media. He wrote: You don’t think it’s strange he hasn’t sued me? He was offered free legal services.  In a tense Twitter exchange with a journalist, he added: Did you investigate at all? I’m guessing answer is no. Why? The tweets have since been widely shared. What i think is especially strange here is that you\u0027re wondering why he hasn\u0027t sued you while the rest of us are wondering why you did something so egregious that he could sue you for in the first place, one reporter replied. The father-to-six initially apologised for the first outrageous tweets, which he said were fired off in anger. They also led to Tesla\u0027s share price to tumble.  He wrote: My words were spoken in anger after Mr. Unsworth said several untruths \u0026amp suggested I engage in a sexual act with the mini-sub, which had been built as an act of kindness \u0026amp according to specifications from the dive team leader. Nonetheless, his actions against me do not justify my actions against him, and for that I apologize to Mr. Unsworth and to the companies I represent as leader. The fault is mine and mine alone.

Of course, it is not so you can win every game but if you play like we did on Saturday, with this will and commitment to the club, the fans will show they are happy.“It must always be the same as it was against Partick Thistle and now we have to develop this.”Csaba’s also of the opinion his players are now beginning to reap the benefits of the graft they’ve been doing since pre-season kicked off near the end of June.“We have worked hard on set-pieces and also in the counter-attack. It’s clear, too, we have some fast players, attacking players like Craig Curran, Pavol Safranko and Yannick Loemba, who are direct.“This can give us chances in the front.“In the future I want a little bit more movement without the ball than we had in the game against Partick.“If you don’t have that movement you can make the game more difficult but if you have players like Curran and Safranko up front you can create problems for the opponents.”Meanwhile, winger Billy King has stepped up his training after being out since the start of pre-season with a thigh problem.It’s likely to be a few more week before he returns.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"csabas ability to stay clam bodes well for dundee united","story":"\t\t\t\t\tLet’s be honest, most football people are not known for their extensive reading.Other than a glance at the back pages to see what’s been written about them, those in the game don’t tend to stray too far into the world of books.And even if Csaba Laszlo does, as an ethnic Hungarian born and brought up in Romania, it’s unlikely a book of Rudyard Kipling’s poetry is the first thing he reaches for when he fancies a good read.But if he ever did glance over the first few lines of Kipling’s “If”, he might feel it could have been written with him in mind.It’s the one that starts – “If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs and blaming it on you. If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, but make allowance for their doubting, too. . .”We’ll stop there because, to be honest, classic work that it is, it does drone on for a bit.And those opening lines do, pretty much, show the ability demonstrated by the Dundee United gaffer over the opening weeks of the season.As his new team struggled to get going during a difficult Betfred Cup group campaign, Csaba was as disappointed as anyone.But he remained calm, didn’t panic and showed an understanding of the criticism that came his way from a support he knows is as desperate as he is to see the Tangerines back where they feel they belong.Most important of all, he stayed firm in his belief the changes he’s been at the centre of over the last few months were both necessary and the right ones.And while that process still has a long way to go before it’s been successfully completed, after two big Championship wins over Queen of the South and Partick Thistle, now there are at least concrete signs United are heading in the right direction.The success in Dumfries just over a fortnight ago brought a first three vital league points and with them a needed boost to morale.After the toils in the Betfred Cup were followed by a hugely- disappointing home defeat at the hands of Dunfermline, that something was done to lift spirits was vitally important.Having done that, last Saturday saw United seize the opportunity to send a message to the rest of their division that they can live up to their pre-season billing as one of the promotion favourites.The 3-1 win over Partick Thistle, another side expected to challenge near the top, was as convincing as could be hoped for from a side that remains in the middle of the rebuilding process.From the moment defender Paul Watson headed the first of his two goals inside the first 10 minutes, they were in control.It did take them longer than they would have liked to seal the win via Watson’s second fine header in the 78th minute but by the end Craig Curran had added a third.Over the 90 minutes they bossed the proceedings and looked every inch serious promotion contenders.As well as having some exciting attacking talent like Fraser Aird, Yannick Loemba, Craig Curran and Pavol Safranko, the team as a whole turned in a strong display.Almost as importantly, and whether conscious or not of those words written over a century before, the manager kept his head. As was the case when he didn’t panic when things were not going so well a few weeks earlier, he was not going to get carried away by this performance.He knows there is a long way to go in this most difficult of leagues and as he poetically puts it himself, there will be more stones along this rocky road.But he will stay calm and focused and, for United fans, that has to be encouraging.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b851cb07dc47.jpg ","title":"dundee musician be charlotte announced for festival of the future","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA new national festival exploring science, music, art and design will take place at Dundee University for the first time this autumn – and will include city musician Be Charlotte.Festival of the Future is taking place from October 17-21 and will celebrate how using science and creativity could help solve the biggest issues facing the world at both local and global level.Be Charlotte will give a performance showing the results of her collaboration with scientist Dr Kate Stone, which was designed to improve the audience experience of digital music using new technologies.Festival manager Anna Day said: “The festival comes at an exciting time for the university and the city.“It’s an evolution of the Dundee Literary Festival and Women in Science – a chance for us to shout out loud about absolutely everything that the university and the city is brilliant at.”V\u0026ampA Dundee is one of the partners working with the university to create performances, talks and workshops.The National Theatre of Scotland will be providing the opening event, which will include performance and music.Dundee Contemporary Arts, Dundee Rep and other local businesses are also involved.The programme will be officially launched in mid-September.Each day of the festival will feature workshops aimed at children, young people and adults featuring figures from the worlds of science and culture.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee people pictures family fun at dundee gala days","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDudhope Park and Fintry Parish Church were awash with activities when their respective fun day and gala drew the crowds.Families made their way to Dudhope Park for the iety of activities on offer, which included face painting, children’s entertainment and bungee trampolines.There was also sledge racing, while some of the youngsters had a chance to build some structures from plastic bricks."},{"url":null,"title":"dundee star glen kamara earns finland call up for nations league games","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee midfielder Glen Kamara has been called up to the Finland national squad for their Nations League double header in September.Kamara has five full international caps to his name already and will hope to add numbers six and seven next month as the Finns take on Hungary and Estonia.\u0026mdash Dundee Football Club  August 28, 2018Their Group C matches take place on September 8 and 11 in Tampere and Turku respectively.Former Celtic striker Teemu Pukki, now playing for Norwich, has been recalled but there is no place for Dundee forward Ben Kallman after he made his international debut earlier this year.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united fans bid to raise funds for statue in honour of club legend jim mclean","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United fans are preparing a fundraising scheme to build a statue in honour of club legend Jim McLean.The Steering Group, a coalition of most Dundee United supporter groups, has set up a crowdfunder page to raise £75,000 for a statue outside Tannadice.The group was set up to look into raising the cash for the commemoration, and is made up of representatives from the club itself, Dundee United Business Club, Fans United, ULT83, Dundee United Supporters’ Foundation and ArabTrust.Plans for the statue were first mooted last year.A spokesman said: “The Steering Group was set up by the Dundee United Supporters’ Liaison Group to investigate building a permanent monument to Jim McLean.“Look out for announcements over the weeks ahead once the group is able to confirm key details.”The spokesman anticipates it will take 18 months to raise the money.As the campaign is in its early stages, only a few methods have been decided, one of which is the sale of an exclusive print commemorating United’s 1983 Premier League title win.McLean’s trophy-laden era saw the side win both Premier League and League Cup and sweep aside some of the world’s best sides, including AS Monaco and PSV Eindhoven.Mr McLean, who recently turned 81, has been suffering ill health.

described her as a beautiful girl who lit up every roomNow a special event held at Monikie Country Park called Tea in the Marquee has raised £3,585 for Epilepsy Research UK.One of Morgan’s best friends Carly Cargill, 24 – who organised the event along with another seven of her pals – said they had wanted to do something that was in keeping with her spirit.Carly said: “Morgan loved going to festivals.“There was a group of nine of us who did everything together and we thought this was an appropriate way to remember her.“She had epilepsy throughout her teenage years and into her early 20s, although that never stopped her from living life to the full.“She was always the first one on the dance floor, throwing herself right into the crowds at festivals and the only one of us who would stand up in a packed room for some karaoke.“Morgan was the kindest and most caring person I have ever met.“She was always looking out for people and you could count on her being there for you.“It didn’t matter what time of day it was or however silly it seemed, Morgan would always be there and listen to you.“She was such an amazing friend to have and we were all so lucky to have known

all of Morgan’s friends for their amazing job in organising such a terrific event for such a good cause.”A former pupil at Kinloch Primary and Carnoustie High School, Morgan had been working as an archivist at Blackadders in Dundee.At the time of her daughter’s death, Heather – a pharmacist in Carnoustie – said Morgan had been diagnosed with epilepsy when she was 15.She added: “She tried ious

ground of Lochee United Junior Football Club.Project organiser Jayne Kelly, of the Save Our High Street Lochee group, said it was hoped as many families as possible would be included in the artwork, to be created by artist Symon Mathieson.Although the figures have not yet been finalised, she said there would be about 360-400 family namesJayne said: “There is a rich diversities of families in Lochee who have lived and worked in the area for generations.“There are families from all over, including Ireland, Italy and Poland.“These families made Lochee what it is and we want to commemorate

our people,” she said.“We may be deprived in monetary terms but we are far from deprived in terms of culture and the people who live here.“While gathering the names some interesting and entertaining stories came to light and we hope to highlight some of them in the near future.“The mural won’t just be a list of names but the lettering will be incorporated into a work of art that has yet to be confirmed.“By the time the art on the wall is completed it will encompass the rich and ied history of Lochee covering about 150 years.”The project is the latest effort by the Save Our High Street

of the Premiership table with no points after three consecutive league losses as Saints ran out 1-0 winners at McDiarmid Park.Despite a good showing in the first-half, Tony Watt’s strike early in the second period was enough for the Perth side to seal their first three points of the season.And, at the final whistle, the sizeable travelling support made their feelings clear.“I can understand them getting restless,” said Neil.“I don’t have any gripes with the fans showing disappointment at the end because we all want to win the game.“They’ve travelled in their numbers again and they are disappointed to go away with nothing to show for our play on Saturday.“I’ve got no complaints but I just want them to stick by the players and continue to support because we are still working away.“Yes, third league game down we’ve still not got any points but they can’t keep hearing the same things that we are playing well. The boys need to start taking chances.“The fans have been brilliant to me in my time here as a player and as a manager.“Yeah, when things aren’t going well they are going to shout and show their disappointment and I get that because I am disappointed for my team.”What frustrated the manager most was the dominance his team showed in the first half in particular. They didn’t make the most of that, however, as the home side rode out the storm and then took their chance when it came.Neil added: “It’s so frustrating. I thought we totally dominated the first half bar the five-minute spell that St Johnstone had.“It’s another one of those where you feel you’ve played really well, particularly in the first half, and it’s a sore one to take.“Sofien Moussa has a great chance with a header.

We’re really pleased to team up with AFC particularly because of my family’s affiliation with the club, to reach a wider audience throughout Scotland and the UK.“Grassroot Soccer programmes address acute health issues such as HIV, malaria, gender-based violence and sexual and reproductive health as well as focusing on determinants of health such as education and employment to ensure young people stay on a positive health journey well into adulthood.”John Wheeler, education operational delivery convener at Aberdeen City Council, said Lochside Academy was the perfect choice for the scheme by the different organisations.He said: “It’s marvellous that the new Lochside Academy has already been chosen to spearhead this football-based curriculum promoting health and well-being among our young people.“Having visited the site myself only last week and seeing the superb facilities there, I can think of no better setting to kick off this major programme.“We’re looking forward to seeing some fabulous results, on and off the pitch at Lochside when the programme gets under way.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"demolition of old nursery is end of an era1","story":"\t\t\t\t\tStaff from an Aberdeen nursery are asking former pupils and their families to share memories ahead of the demolition of their old building.The building, on Logie Place, used to be home to Middlefield Nursery, which has since moved to the Hub in Middlefield.The old building is due to be demolished as part of the £30 million Haudagain redevelopment scheme.Staff at the current nursery are hoping for a big turnout when the building is taken down on Monday, in what will be an “emotional” moment for workers.Marie Macdonald, who is the nursery manager at the Middlefield Community Project, which runs the nursery, said: “When we found out the time and date of the demolition, we thought that it was an end of an era.“With all the families in the area that have used the nursery, we thought that it might be nice to mark it together.”As well as people from the community, Marie hopes to take some current pupils to the site.She said: “We don’t have a huge number of pupils who were attending in the old building, but we do have a couple, so we were hoping to be able to take them down on Monday afternoon.”Marie added: “It’s for any other families, past and present – it’s quite poignant and it’s the end of an era for some people.“The Community Project has been running for a long time so we’ve had people messaging us with their kids now in their 20s.“We just want people to have that shared experience, because the whole community is changing, a lot of the community is being knocked down.“The project and the nursery has played such a big part in people’s lives and it’s the end of that, in a positive way.”Marie also expects her staff to be feeling nostalgic. She said: “There’s always going to be nostalgia for the place.“Our project co-ordinator has been here for a long time, we’ve got a member of staff who’s been here for 20 years, so it’s part of their life. I’d imagine it’ll be emotional.”The nursery moved from Logie Place into purpose-built premises within the Hub, on Manor Avenue, in January last year.According to Marie, the move has dramatically improved the quality of the nursery, with more children being able to attend, increasing the catchment area they can serve.Marie said: “Before, we could only serve Middlefield, but now we can take children from Heathryfold, Cummings Park, Marchburn and other places in the local area, so more people are really seeing the benefits.”The new facility has also improved the quality of care, she added.“It’s greatly improved the facilities that we have – it’s a purpose-built nursery and the space we have is much bigger, and it’s much more open plan,” Marie said.“We have better access to the outdoors – the doors open up into the nursery garden, which was always our vision, to give the children a choice.”Transport Scotland announced that the demolition will take place between 1.30 and 2pm on Monday.A spokesman said: “Transport Scotland is pleased to accommodate the request of Middlefield Community Project Nursery for the opportunity to visit the site during demolition of their former premises, which are part of the ongoing works being carried out in preparation for the A90/A96 Haudagain Improvement Project.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"fishermen call for platforms to be completely removed from north sea to bring back stocks","story":"\t\t\t\t\tScotland’s fishing industry has urged oil operators to ensure offshore infrastructure is “completely removed” from the seabed when it is decommissioned.In a new policy paper, the Scottish Fishermen’s Federation , argues the removal of platforms will “herald the potential return of former fishing grounds”.It comes amid some operators looking to retain certain parts of platforms in the sea as they are dismantled.Notably, Shell is seeking approval to keep the huge concrete legs of its Brent platforms in the North Sea, which is currently being considered by the UK government.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"north east road to close for resurfacing works","story":"\t\t\t\t\tRoad closures will be in place next month for resurfacing to be carried out in a north-east town.The A98 on Seafield Street in Banff will close between Castle Street and Boyndie Street West.Preparatory construction work, including the replacement of drainage gullies, will take place from the week beginning Monday September 10 until Monday September 31.The resurfacing work will require full closure of the section of road throughout the day over two weekends – September 22-23 and September 29-30.During the two full daytime closures there will be temporary waiting restrictions on streets around the area to allow diversion routes to flow.Three separate diversion routes will be available for eastbound, westbound and local traffic.Access to properties and businesses will be maintained as far as possible.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dee out to home in on away win","story":"\t\t\t\t\tBanks o’ Dee co-manager Tommy Forbes is expecting “another challenge” in the Evening Express Aberdeenshire Cup against Aberdeen Reserves.Dee will be the away team at their own Spain Park against Paul Sheerin’s colts, who have agreed to play all of their “home” ties in this year’s competition at their opponents’ grounds.The second-round tie is one Forbes knows will push the Junior Superleague champions.He said: “It’ll be another challenge, against obviously a full-time young Aberdeen side.“I’m not sure if they’ll be sprinkled with , but a few of them will have first-team experience, anyway. It’ll be a tough evening for us – but at Spain Park – they’re the home team, hopefully that’ll help us a bit.”Forbes thinks, compared to his part-time outfit, the fitness and sharpness of the Dons Reserves will be much higher than junior and Highland League opposition.Dee blasted past Highland high-flyers Inverurie Locos 5-1 away from home in the first round, while Sheerin’s team defeated Buckie Thistle 4-0 at Victoria Park.Forbes said: “We’ve got to be aware they’ve got lots of good, young players with points to prove. They want to get in the first team. They will be sharper but these are the types of games you want to play. It’s a bonus game for us because we didn’t enter the Aberdeenshire Cup last year, just the Shield.“We’ve got all of our players back. We’re starting to get everybody back slowly from injuries and holidays.”While Dee are prioritising, as expected, retaining their Superleague crown this term, Forbes says they are aiming for as many cup runs as possible. They’ll play in the North/Tayside Cup, the North Regional Cup, Scottish Junior Cup and Aberdeenshire Shield, alongside the Shire Cup and other trophies.Dee exited the Scottish Cup proper after drawing another junior powerhouse, Auchinleck Talbot, away.Forbes and co-boss Jamie Watt’s team will be missing captain Josh Winton due to work commitments, while Ryan Hall, Kieran Heads – who is recovering from surgery this week – and Matt Robertson are out injured.One problem Forbes is looking to address against the Dons is Dee’s recent tendency to concede early.He said: “We’ve conceded first in our past four games, that’s something we need to address.“We cannot let Aberdeen get in front.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 31","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 03/08/18, 1:40 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Well done to young Ella Pollock for recognising that she can make a difference.Something as simple as baking cakes can be all it takes to make another\u0026#8217s life a little better.

However, they often endure short, painful lives without the most basic requirements.This is where SPANA makes such a huge difference, ensuring animals have access to the free veterinary treatment they urgently need when they are sick or injured.Actors Dame Judi Dench and Joanna Lumley are throwing their support behind this year’s event, and we hope your readers will be inspired to take part and help transform the lives of working animals around the world.The SPANA World Tea Party fundraising pack, full of free recipes, is available from www.spana.org/teaparty or by calling 020 7831 3999.SPANA World Tea Party Host, Tom HorsfieldSir,It only takes one person to put a stop to the accidental loss of life to drowning.With recent headlines being filled with tragic stories of people losing their lives to drowning, Lesley Laird, Shadow Scottish Secretary and the Royal Life Saving Society UK  urge the public to be that \u0026#8216one person\u0026#8217: take some simple precautions and get \u0026#8216water smart\u0026#8217, before cooling off this summer.For more information on the issue, the statistics involved and interview opportunities, please contact Claire Huggins on 0300 323 0096 or email clairehuggins@rlss.org.ukSenior Communications Executive, Claire HugginsSir,There are more people using Instagram for interiors inspiration than ever before, but 70 percent of Scottish Instagram users feel dissatisfied with their homes after looking at images of other people’s houses on social media, a study has found.Researchers who polled 1,500 UK adults using social media for inspiration with their homes, found that a whopping 66 percent of those are displeased with their home. They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors. This mindset has been described by Chartered Psychologist, Dr David Lewis, as ‘Home Dysmorphic Disorder’ .energypr representative, Beth ReynoldsSir,Researchers at the University of St Andrews have shown for the first time that some of the standard measures of memory in rodents and humans are likely based on the same cognitive process which could have implications for development of treatments for memory disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.One of the most widely used memory tests for rodents is the novel object recognition test, in which animals explore two objects one of which is new and the other they have seen before.The results of new research showed that their participants object recognition scores were far more associated with their memory abilities than their preferences for newness.One of the research team, Dr James Ainge, of the School of Psychology and Neuroscience at St Andrews said: \u0026#8216This is important as it provides some of the first evidence that the standard memory tests in humans and rats are testing the same cognitive process.

The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a different form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex  from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray.

I was glad the age limit had been lowered since I could enjoy the race with my dad.\u0026#8217John Hardie, the event organiser said: ‘With the guidance of British Cycling we managed to stage our event. As usual, the support from the people and businesses of Tarbert has been exemplary.\u0026#8216We wanted cyclists of all levels to enjoy the glorious cycle route 78, better known as the Kilberry Loop. It is a 40 mile cycle, not long for a sportive, but it is within the capability of most cyclists.

Following on from the success of last year’s event, the Joan Price Memorial Concert will take to the stage once again next month. Joan Price, a beloved trombone player, was tragically killed in a road traffic accident in January 2017 by two boy racers who are now serving jail sentences. Joan’s fellow band members wanted to do something to honour her memory and decided to organise a concert featuring all three bands which she had played for. Kilmarnock Concert Brass, Irvine \u0026amp Dreghorn Brass Band and Dunaskin Doon Band will join together on September 1 to pay tribute to the Troon gran. The brass band show will now be an annual event, with each band taking it in turns to nominate a charity. This year Kilmarnock Concert Brass has chosen Beautiful Inside \u0026amp Out  as the worthy recipients. Beautiful Inside \u0026amp Out  supports bereaved families of suicide victims and any troubled person by providing and funding services such as counselling, music, play and drama therapy.  The charity was set up by mum, Pauline Moriarty, originally from Ayr, following the suicide of her 13-year-old daughter, Jenna. The concert will honour Joan and Jenna with traditional marches, big band hits, movie themes and film scores. Tasty treats and a raffle will be on offer during the interval. Colin, Joan’s husband said: “Our family is delighted and honoured that the three bands have decided to make this concert an annual event in Joan’s memory. A lot of hard work goes on behind the scenes to make a concert like this happen and I’m indebted to everyone who has helped or who is playing on the night. “Last year’s concert was a fantastic night of entertainment and I’m looking forward to meeting many old and new friends again this year.” Pauline Moriarty added: “We are so touched the bands have chosen to raise funds for the work of a Beautiful Inside \u0026amp Out . It is such a lovely tribute to Joan Price and it will help us to potentially save lives.” Joan Price Memorial Concert will take place on Saturday, September 1 at 7pm at Kyle Academy on Overmills Road in Ayr. Tickets, \u0026pound7  are available by emailing secretary@ddband or messaging Dunaskin Doon Band on their Facebook page. A limited number of tickets will also be available on the night.

Fraser and Freya Russell have qualified for the National final of the American Golf Junior Golf Championships. The pair, who live in Troon and attend Marr College, progressed from the qualifying competition held at Leven Links Golf Club and now go forward to the final which will be televised on Sky Sports later this year. Competing in the gross score stroke play competition, 14-year-old Fraser, who incredibly plays off a five handicap at Royal Troon, put in a superb performance to take the qualifier with a score of nine over par. Not to be outdone by her older brother, Freya, 12, put in a fantastic performance to score 32 points in a stableford off a handicap of 13 in the girls’ net score competition. That was enough to take top spot and secure a spot in the final at Gainsborough Golf Club, where she will take on the UK and Ireland’s best girls. Speaking after the qualifier, Fraser said: “I am delighted with how I played, it will be a great chance for me to play golf on a good stage and I can test myself against some of the best.”  And younger sister Freya is looking forward to the continuing her golfing journey as she commented: “I love to play different golf courses, meeting new friends and getting to play golf with other girl golfers.” The pair play their junior medals on the Portland Course at Royal Troon, but due to their impressive handicaps they are allowed to enter in competitions that are played on the par 71 Old Course. They are both coached by Royal Troon pro Kieron Stevenson. Both Fraser and Freya represent Ayrshire for their age levels, and Freya has been playing with the West of Scotland U18 team since she was just nine. And they both played in the World Championships at the stunning Pinehurst course, which held both the men’s and women’s US Open just a year later - won respectively by Martin Kaymer and Michelle Wie.  Pinehurst has also been pencilled in for the 2019 US Amateur Championships and the 2024 US Open. The pair’s dad, Craig, has always played golf and he helped get them into the sport. Craig, who played golf for Cambridge University, said: “They have always been interested in golf. “I took Fraser to play at a young age, and Freya’s first steps were when she got up to pick up her brother’s golf club! “I’ve never forced it on them though, anytime they play golf it’s because they want to, which I think is the key. “They aren’t just into golf though, Fraser plays rugby for Marr and Freya wants to play hockey for her school, and both of them swim.” "},{"url":null,"title":"festival-fever-at-harestanes","story":"HARESTANES Countryside Visitor Centre will be coming alive with

benefits assistance service.\nIn November 2017 the council merged the customer, homelessness, and welfare benefits services to become one integrated department.\nNow, a petition signed by over 200 Borders residents has been handed into Scottish Borders Council, urging the authority to employ officers with a specific remit to assist benefits claimants in applying for welfare. \u0026nbsp\nThe petition further calls on the council to \u0026ldquoensure there are sufficient staff resources within Scottish Borders Council for maximisation of benefit entitlement in the Borders and to \u0026ldquoacknowledge the error made in not carrying out any public consultation on the restructure.\nThe author of the petition and chair of the Borders mental health forum, Jenny Mushlin, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom very concerned that at a time when the benefits system has become so complicated the council has changed its service.\n\u0026ldquoThere are now fewer welfare officers and they are all working across different services.\n\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom hoping this petition will give some understanding to councillors of what people are facing at the moment, and hopefully persuade them to hire more people in the future to help people with filling in of forms and other admin.\n\u0026ldquoThe welfare benefits service was a much loved service which really helped people and the changes were made with no consultation whatsoever.\n\u0026ldquoWe are calling for them to consult with people who claim welfare benefits as to what is needed.\nCouncillors sitting on the Scottish Borders Council\u0026rsquos audit and scrutiny committee will hear representations from the petition\u0026rsquos authors and from council officers on Thursday, before making a decision on whether to accept or reject the petition.\nAhead of the meeting, Scottish Borders Council\u0026rsquos service director for customers and communities has written to councillors urging them to take no further action.\nIn her statement, she said: \u0026ldquoThe aim of the restructure was to ensure that the level of service provided continued and in some areas improved, ensuring Scottish Borders Council was prepared for ongoing welfare reform including the rollout of universal credit.\n\u0026ldquoThe Department for Work and Pensions expectation on customers to self-serve online has created increased demands on Council services to assist customers.\n\u0026ldquoPrior to November 2017 the equivalent of 1.7 welfare benefit assistants were employed to assist with basic benefit enquiries including form filling with customers.\n\u0026ldquoWe now have 49 customer advice and support advisors across a wider range of locations, with a remit to assist customers at the first point of contact with their enquiry whether they present in a locality office face to face, over the telephone or online.\n\u0026ldquoThese advisers already deal with a range of benefit enquiries and applications as well as

It was nailed to the stretcher rather than the modern method of stapling. At some stage a further bar of yellowed wood had to added to keep the canvas taut.Further internet research revealed a painter known as H Shapiro, who was born in 1933. Helen was born in 1946.Unfortunately for those hoping for a massive price tag, the H stands iously for Hermon or Herman.A painting with a similar style, titled Loch Long, appeared recently on eBay and was described as: ‘Oil on canvas, possibly an early work by the artist Herman  Shapiro.‘It is hand signed, lower right, with “H. Shapiro” and dated ‘52 .’A large collection of Mr Shapiro’s other work, mainly of life studies of a distinctly different style is for sale with a gallery, named Hatfield Hines in Norwich.One of the partners at the gallery said they had bought the paintings. Despite having much biographical detail the partner claimed they had no way of contacting Mr Shapiro.That gallery states that Mr Shapiro was born in London and is settled in Scotland, which fits Clachan’s picture.He studied at Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts from 1949-54 where he was apparently influenced by Bloch, Minton and Vaughan and was associated with the acclaimed Camberwell Group.By the mid 1950s he had started teaching in South Wales schools and went on to lecture at Cardiff College of Art.His paintings and sculpture are mostly based on the female figure, more recently in a domestic environment. He also enjoys the open, figureless, landscape.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"from our facebook beautiful and impressive sunflowers","story":"Below are some of their comments.Jane Wykes, from Dunoon, said: \u0026#8216Loved this on our arrival.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.

The scheme will apply to the section of the town north of the railway line, with major roads such as Belhaven Road also included.  All roads affected previously had 30mph speed limits.  The new order, which is an experimental order, will mirror what is already in place south of the East Coast Mainline in the Hallhill area of the town, where all the streets, with the exception of Kellie Road, are 20mph.  Herbert Coutts, from the town\u0026rsquos community council, has been heavily involved in moving the project forward and was pleased to see progress being made.  He said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased about it because that is what essentially the research carried out by the community council demonstrated. There was public support for it in Dunbar and it will be good to see it going ahead and I am hopeful the outcome will be positive.  Mr Coutts stressed that the change in speed limit would not see an end to speeding but he felt it would help improve people\u0026rsquos safety.  He added: \u0026ldquoIt was never thought by people supporting it that it was a magic answer to all our speeding problems but a step in the right direction and people become accustomed to going at 20mph in the town.  \u0026ldquoThereby the safety of pedestrians \u0026ndash particularly children and elderly but people of any age \u0026ndash will be enhanced.  \u0026ldquoThat is the hope and hopefully people will observe it.  A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoThe order has been made and we are just awaiting the appropriate signage, which should be within the next month.  \u0026ldquoThe order will be for an 18-month period and is an experimental order.  If the order is deemed a success, steps will be taken to see the 20mph speed limit become a permanent fixture.  Feedback from members of the public could also help decide whether any roads become exempt from the 20mph speed limit in the future.  Currently there are no plans for traffic calming measures, such as speed humps or chicanes, on the streets affected by the new speed limit.  The 20mph speed limit starts to the west of Edinburgh Road\u0026rsquos junction with Shore Road and Beveridge Row.  To the east, it comes into force as drivers make their way along the A1087."},{"url":null,"title":"your-chance-to-apply-for-thousands-of-pounds-of-support-for-your-charity","story":"  Last year, donations totalling almost \u0026pound300,000 were made up and down the country on behalf of Newsquest Media Group, one of the UK\u0027s largest publishers and owners of the East Lothian Courier.  The Gannett Foundation UK, which makes the grants, has given more than \u0026pound3 million to help charitable community causes all over Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland in the last 10 years.  One of the successful applicants last year was Lothian Autistic Society, which received \u0026pound5,000 for its East Lothian Basecamp service. This service supports children, aged 5-13, with autism and helps them develop social communication and social interaction skills through structured themed group and play sessions.  The foundation supports charities with projects which take a creative approach to fundamental issues such as education and neighbourhood improvements, economic development, youth development, local problem-solving, assistance to the disadvantaged or disabled, environmental conservation and cultural enrichment.  And it values projects that bring lasting benefits to local communities.  A spokesman said: \"While preference may be given to ideas which create a durable legacy for the community, judges will consider single events or projects of limited duration that otherwise meet the criteria.\"  Typically grants are made for substantial projects which require and merit awards of between \u0026pound5,000 and \u0026pound10,000, although applications can be for any size of grant and level of ambition.  The foundation will join with other contributors to support elements of larger projects, but prefers to be in a position of making a donation which will fund a project in its entirely or which constitutes the final instalment to complete a project.

The findings come at the same time as overall employment in the county has increased slightly.  Figures show that the number of people in either part-time or full-time employment in East Lothian rose to 78.6 per cent between April 2017 and March 2018, an increase of 3.6 per cent from the previous year, when the rate was at 75 per cent.  Councillor Brian Small, leader of the opposition Conservative Group on East Lothian Council, said: \u0026ldquoObviously the fact that 4,000 households are without work is worrying.  \u0026ldquoWork isn\u0026rsquot only important for the financial benefits to those in employment, it also generates health and social benefits for them.  \u0026ldquoHaving something to get up in the morning for is good for you.  \u0026ldquoBut we have to welcome that East Lothian is better than both the UK and Scottish average but there is still more that can and should be done to get people back into work.  Peter Dicker of East Lothian Foodbank, based in Tranent, said: \u0026ldquoAlthough the statistics for the increase in the population in work is encouraging, the foodbank can only comment on the fact that over the same period that the statistics were compiled for April 2017 to March 2018 we here at East Lothian Foodbank experienced a 12 per cent increase on the number of referrals we had sent to us \u0026ndash this 12 per cent compares to a national average of a 13 per cent increase on referrals .  \u0026ldquoSince the introduction of Universal Credit in April 2016 we have seen an increase in people being referred to us by over 45 per cent .  The figures from the ONS estimate that last year 14 per cent of households in East Lothian were workless, lower than the Scotland-wide average of 18 per cent.  County MP Martin Whitfield said: \u0026ldquoClearly the increase in the local employment rate over the last year is welcome. However, the fact there are still many people out of work remains a concern. It underlines the complacency of the UK Government, which is simply not doing enough to help people into work.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Council, through its East Lothian Works employability service, is doing a good job supporting jobseekers, but both the UK and Scottish Governments must do more to enhance prosperity and create new jobs.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray added: \u0026ldquoI welcome the fact that East Lothian\u0026rsquos employment rate is higher than the Scottish average. However, too many local people are still not in work. We need a fundamental shift in how we grow our economy.  \u0026ldquoWe also need to ensure opportunities for creating these kind of jobs locally are maximised at the former Cockenzie Power Station site and the new innovation park at QMU.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoUnemployment figures in East Lothian are following a positive trend as there are over three per cent more people in employment now compared to last year.  \u0026ldquoThe council continues to strive to grow East Lothian\u0026rsquos economy and to make it the best place in Scotland to live, work and do business and we would very much hope our employment figures will continue to rise year-on-year as a result of this work.  \u0026ldquoIt is difficult to comment in detail on the figure of 4,000 households being classed as out of work as it\u0026rsquos unclear, as yet, exactly how this figure has been calculated.  \u0026ldquoIt is also important to note that the roll-out of full service Universal Credit in East Lothian has had an effect on the recording of our out-of-work levels so this too needs to be looked at more closely.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Works continues to support people of all ages and abilities to gain skills, re-train and undertake courses and work experience to get them back into rewarding employment, working closely with employers and education providers. There are also many initiatives to support the most vulnerable in our society, including those living in poverty, including projects initiated by our area partnerships designed to meet the needs of our very different communities across East Lothian.  Across Scotland, the most common reason people gave for not being in work was being sick or disabled \u0026ndash 37 per cent of out-of-work individuals cited illness or disability as the primary reason.  Students made up 13 per cent of the group, and 18 per cent were early retirees, with 10 per cent of jobless people in the area officially \u0026lsquounemployed\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash looking for work and able to start within two weeks.  A spokesperson from the Department for Work and Pensions  said: \u0026ldquoSince 2010 the proportion of workless households is down in every region of Great Britain.  \u0026ldquoThe unemployment rate remains at its lowest since 1971, but we\u0026rsquore committed to ensuring that everyone who wants to work has the opportunity to do so \u0026ndash while making sure there is a safety net for those who can\u0026rsquot.  The DWP has also said that the majority of employment growth has been in both full-time and permanent roles.  David Leese, policy analysis manager at charity the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said that workless families in particular were at a much higher risk of poverty.  Figures from the DWP for 2016-17 show that in workless households nearly 75 per cent of children were growing up in poverty, compared to only five per cent of children with two working parents.  \u0026ldquoIf a child lives in poverty, it affects their health, their education, their family relationships and their plans for the future, Mr Leese said. \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos not right that any child lives in such insecure circumstances."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-courier-pet-idol-see-the-top-50","story":"  Pictured here are all the 50 pets still in the running.

Among the East Lothian pubs to have permanently closed during this period are the Elphinstone Arms in Elphinstone The Hub in Tranent the Bay Horse in Haddington and The Hayweights, Burgh and Mrs Forman\u0026rsquos in Musselburgh.  The figures from the Office for National Statistics  show that in 2010 there were about 55 pubs and bars in East Lothian but by 2017 that had fallen to about 45.  Michael Peters, who is behind The New Pheasant in Haddington \u0026ndash which opened this week at the site of the former Pheasant, which shut in 2009 \u0026ndash was not surprised by the figures.  He said that there were a iety of reasons for the decline in the number of pubs, including the lowering of the drink-drive limit in Scotland in 2014, issues with breweries, and the state of the economy.  Mr Peters felt that there was a real need for pubs in towns and villages and said: \u0026ldquoI am not biased but every town needs a pub.  \u0026ldquoIt is not just for drinking but socialising and the community \u0026ndash nothing would be happening. Most things that happen \u0026ndash golf trips, football, anything like that \u0026ndash it is organised when you are in the pub.  \u0026ldquoWhere do most people socialise?  Across the UK, 5,745 pubs closed over the same period, and there are 54 local authorities across the country where 30 or more shut.  Pubs have been pointing the finger of blame at the taxman for their troubles, complaining about the duty on beer, VAT levels and the cost of business rates.  Britain\u0026rsquos Beer Alliance, a group of organisations in the pub and brewing sector, has started a campaign called Long Live the Local with a petition and calls for people to write to their MP to have beer duty reduced.  The latest data from the ONS shows that between 2016 and 2017, 655 pubs and bars across the UK called time for the last time.  In East Lothian there was a slight upturn in that period, with numbers up by about five.  A change in consumer habits, with people drinking at home more often, has been blamed for fewer people visiting pubs.  There are 21 areas of the country that have bucked the decline and have more pubs now than they had in 2010. Top of the list is Hackney in East London, which had 55 more bars in 2017 than it did in 2010."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-the-mermaids-magic-storm","story":"  AFTER our return from a final camping trip in the midges and mist, my youngest daughter started school. She needed an early-morning shower to remove the lingering smell of wood smoke in her hair this morning before getting ready.  She protested a bit, as she said she liked the smell of wood smoke because it reminded her of camping in the Highlands. But soon she was all excited to be dressed up, smart and clean for school. She is attending Prestonpans Infant School, as her big sister did before her, and as I did when it was the primary school.  She looked so smart and business-like as she walked into class with a beaming smile. We shared this moment with many other parents, who were taking the same photos and shedding similar tears. Only the day before, Skye had climbed the side of a mountain in Glencoe as if she had once been a mountain goat and proclaimed she wanted to live by a waterfall.  Now, all dressed to conform , she has entered a formal system which in my day did its best to  beat out any original creativity that didn\u0026rsquot fit in with teachers\u0026rsquo expectations.  But as our daughter walked through the same doors I had once gone through, I was uplifted by a hopeful expectation that when we come to pick her up she will be less smart, less clean and her hair even wilder. That\u0026rsquos what school should be like for a wee girl not yet reached five. And I know she is in good hands in that respect at Prestonpans Infants.  But as I kissed her goodbye this morning, she asked: \u0026ldquoCan we have tea by a campfire in the woods? The campfire had been the communal focus during our camping trip. As darkness fell, the spirit of the fire glowed brighter and danced with our imaginations as we told stories and riddles with each other. I of course agreed, but her comment helped me think of which tale to tell this week.  Much of our summer has been spent exploring the wonders of East Lothian. We explored beaches and caves. We climbed hills and moors. We swam and paddled in rivers, climbed trees and sat under them having picnics.  But wherever we went there was one thing that we always saw, even in quite remote places: litter. Sometimes there was more, sometimes there was less, but we couldn\u0026rsquot escape it. My children notice it I suppose because I mention it. Our children pick up other people\u0026rsquos litter as we walk, so we now need an extra rucksack to carry it.  \u0026ldquoWhy do people do this? asked my nine-year-old after she had watched a family sitting in a car in a car park by a beach. They had been eating sandwiches and drinking juice, and then threw all the packaging out of the windows. The plastic juice bottles rolled about in the breeze and the sandwich packaging blew away and got caught in some sea buckthorn bushes nearby. The family then drove away, no doubt having had a nice day at the beach, but leaving their rubbish for others to enjoy.  I make no apologies for sounding angry at this. And I do not blame the children, it\u0026rsquos the adults who frame this behaviour. I understand people want to keep their cars tidy but I couldn\u0026rsquot answer my daughter\u0026rsquos question as we sat watching someone else\u0026rsquos rubbish desecrate a beauty spot. I just can\u0026rsquot understand the mindset. So all I said was: \u0026ldquoWell they just don\u0026rsquot know any better I suppose, or maybe just don\u0026rsquot care.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos so sad, she replied, then went very quiet. Then she came up with an answer to the problem: a story:  \u0026lsquoThe king of the sea told all the mermaids not to go close to the shore because of the dangerous litter that humans pollute it with. One mermaid asked what litter was and the king replied it was many things, such as broken glass and plastic which kills sea creatures, as well as making the place humans live look ugly.  \u0026ldquoWhy do they do this? asked the mermaid. The king shrugged his shoulders, and said: \u0026ldquoThey must be less clever than the animals they kill.  But one day the mermaid disobeyed her king and swam to the shore close to the beach at North Berwick. But her tail was cut by broken glass and then she got caught in plastic bags floating on the surface. She was in trouble and a fisherman saw her.  He helped her remove the bags and gave her cream for her cut tail.  \u0026ldquoWhy do you people do this? she asked him. He felt ashamed because he also would throw litter. He promised her he would never do it again. But there was so much rubbish in the sea that they agreed they would try and collect it.  So the mermaid gathered her friends and collected the rubbish. The fisherman\u0026rsquos boat was soon so full that it nearly sank, and when he returned to the harbour people saw the mountain of rubbish he had caught. They laughed at him, thinking he was not a good fisherman because all he had caught was litter and rubbish.  \u0026ldquoLook, said the fisherman, \u0026ldquothis is what we are doing to the sea and the land. Why do we do this? But nobody cared.  \u0026ldquoThis is impossible, we can\u0026rsquot collect all of it, said the mermaid, \u0026ldquoand every day the wind blows more into the sea.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos hopeless, people will never change, said the fisherman. But the mermaid was angry: \u0026ldquoThey must change or else we will all die, including them too eventually.  Mermaids have powers to control the wind. They can whip up storms and so she decided she would make a very unusual, magic storm.  The wind blew not everywhere but where the litter lay. It blew all the rubbish thrown by the humans back into their houses and cars. People woke up with broken glass in their beds and plastic bags covering their children. Their homes were piled high with dangerous and ugly rubbish. When they tried to get rid of it, it just blew back in.  The countryside and sea became wonderfully litter free because of this magic storm, and when people littered the storm whipped up again and blew it straight into their house or car. They couldn\u0026rsquot escape from it. People were living knee-deep in the rubbish they had thrown out of windows or not recycled.  So soon they stopped littering because now they understood what it meant for the other creatures. Finally they cared, because they were the ones who suffered most. At last they got the wisdom of the animals.\u0026rsquo  This story, I think, would make the perfect start to any school day."},{"url":null,"title":"new-world-record-set-at-haddington-rugby-club","story":"  A total of 458 men, women and children took to the pitch at Neilson Park on Sunday as part of the Haddington 700 celebrations.

We look forward to seeing many of our record-breakers back at the club in the near future.  \u0026ldquoWe would also like to thank the Royal Bank of Scotland, sponsors of RugbyForce day of which we were one of two top prize winners, without whose support the event would not have been possible \u0026ndash in particular their many staff, including a good number from the local branch who helped massively on the day.  The match between Haddington President\u0026rsquos XV and Haddington Barbarians XV was kicked off by Provost John McMillan.  The councillor, who previously played for Murrayfield 3rds, said: \u0026ldquoIt was a real honour. I have not played rugby for well over 40 years and it was an amazing day, with a great turnout.  \u0026ldquoIt was very well-organised, despite the horrific weather. It was a great community thing and I was impressed how many people were there \u0026ndash men, women and children of all ages.  \u0026ldquoIt was a great tribute to the club but also the community.

Ms Cook, who lives in the county, previously worked in Edinburgh at a number of schools, including Drummond Community High School, Leith Academy and Tynecastle Academy.  The teacher, who has a background in physical education, started on Monday.  Two in-service days gave her the chance to meet the staff before pupils arrived.

She said: \u0026ldquoI absolutely love the school.  \u0026ldquoLots of people say it about Dunbar, that it is a really special community.  \u0026ldquoThere is really something quite magical about the school and the community.  \u0026ldquoThe youngsters here are just tremendous and the friendliness you get from young people and staff \u0026ndash it is a really caring place.

And it takes the masterplan a stage further with more detailed ideas for each of the zones proposed in its vision, including calling for the Scottish Government to be invited to base its HQ for its proposed state company on the site, as well as suggesting offshore windfarm company Inch Cape \u0026ndash which wants to place a substation on the land to bring energy ashore from proposed turbines \u0026ndash should also be encouraged to put its Scottish base there.  The community council document comes in the wake of a brochure produced by neighbouring Prestonpans Community Council promoting its vision of a Port of Prestonpans cruise terminal at the former power station site.  That proposal sparked anger among supporters of the masterplan vision, who accused the Prestonpans group of ignoring the views of the local communities.  It led to the launch of \u0026lsquoGreenhills: delivering the Masterplan\u0026rsquo, a campaign by local groups and businesses backing the consultation document.  Now Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council has drawn up a draft brochure which sets out why it supports the plans and proposes a range of detailed ways it could be taken forward.  That includes putting head offices for Inch Cape and the Scottish Government energy interests in one part of the site, identified as its \u0026lsquoEnergy Quarter\u0026rsquo.  It also floats the idea of flooding the power station footprint to create a marina \u0026ndash as suggested by a local fisherman \u0026ndash with associated retail and leisure facilities, attracting businesses such as a film studio or 3D printing innovation to the site, or even creating a brewery.

Mother Nature has been kind and the pipe is, by and large, under sand once again \u0026ndash though there are concerns it is likely to be exposed again in future if a permanent solution is not found.  As well as being an eyesore at a popular tourist spot, sand and rocks collect around the pipe and are then blasted by the tide at the sea wall, causing it damage.  The town\u0026rsquos community council has long voiced concerns over the issue and claims houses overlooking the iconic West Beach are \u0026ldquoin danger.  North Berwick Community Council  contacted Scottish Water over the issue and the company\u0026rsquos response was read out at a NBCC meeting last week.  A letter from Brian Lironi, director of corporate affairs, said: \u0026ldquoWe are not able to re-lay this section of pipe. However, following an inspection of it, we plan to carry out some work on the casing around the laterals and raised manhole columns.  \u0026ldquoThis work will take place outside of the bathing season when the laterals are more exposed and the beach is less busy. This should help to improve the aesthetic of the pipe.  The letter added: \u0026ldquoOn the point of erosion, we do not believe our pipe is to blame for this. With that said, I am asking for this to be looked at in more detail as it is important that we take an evidence-led approach. This will not happen during the bathing season.  Mr Lironi said the community council would be kept informed of any developments.  Spring 2018 was not the first time that severe weather saw the sewage pipe badly exposed. The pipe was clearly visible in the aftermath of storms in December 2010 and it took many, many months before the tides re-covered it with sand."},{"url":null,"title":"in-this-weeks-courier","story":"  HADDINGTON...

Plans lodged with East Lothian Council are split into two.  The design and access statement states: \u0026ldquoThe brief is twofold: to diversify the core business on the site with the introduction of small-scale gin and whisky distillation to enable the production of speciality spirits for sale within the business pub chain.  \u0026ldquoSecondly, in light of the increasing demand for both brewery tours and the use of the Monk\u0026rsquos Retreat as a function venue, it is felt that the facilities require being upgraded, both in terms of general amenity, improving the visitor experience and to provide for the disabled visitor with the addition of a platform lift and accessible toilet.  A spokeswoman for owners Greene King explained why they were looking to diversify at the site, on Belhaven\u0026rsquos Brewery Lane.  She said: \u0026ldquoLike any business we are always exploring options to develop our business and facilities. The recent planning application is just one of many opportunities we are considering but no decision has been made yet about whether it is an option we will pursue if planning permission is granted.  In terms of the production of gin and whisky, a still house would be created.  According to the design and access statement: \u0026ldquoThe distillery will be designed to produce 250 litres of spirit a day. It will be unique in the marketplace, making spirit from the same wurt as the beer.  \u0026ldquoThe spirit will be a mixture of Scotch whisky, gin and rum.  \u0026ldquoThis volume and complexity will mean that the brewery will need to employ an additional person to run the distillery.  \u0026ldquoIn time the site would like to re-instate a historical greenhouse within the gardens in order to grow their own botanicals to add to the gin however, this will be part of a separate application.  The new still house would mirror the mash house, which was given planning permission in January 2011, in terms of its look.  It is two storeys, with a more modern design than some of the historic buildings on-site.  If the plans were given the green light, work would also be carried out at the main building on the Belhaven site.  A museum is already in place on the ground floor of the main building, with a pub on the first floor.  Plans show a refurbishment of both floors as \u0026ldquothe existing interiors are now tired and dated and in need of a revamp.  The application, which could go before members of the council\u0026rsquos planning committee later this year, adds: \u0026ldquoConsidering the site\u0026rsquos historic importance both locally and within Scotland, it is clear that any development both internally and externally requires to be sensitive.  \u0026ldquoIt is also important to recognise the value of this development in terms of the improved visitor experience, which will impact visitor numbers to the area as a whole, and the business diversification."},{"url":null,"title":"avid-lynyrd-skynyrd-fan-pens-foreword-to-new-book-about-his-idols","story":"  Iain Monk has contributed to The Gospel According to Abraham by Paul Abraham, who was the American band\u0026rsquos road manager for a decade.  The new book is full of stories about the band, best known for hits such as Sweet Home Alabama and Free Bird.  Iain said: \u0026ldquoI became an instant fan of the band in the 1970s and was instantaneously hooked by the music, that kind of southern rock music.  \u0026ldquoMy obsession for the band just grew from there but the first time I saw them live was in 1988 in New York when I flew over to see them.  \u0026ldquoI had written to the band\u0026rsquos management to see if they could help me with tickets and I think they were impressed that I was coming from Scotland to see the band.  \u0026ldquoThat relationship grew with management, road crew and members of the band and I started following them across America.  Iain, who lives in Gullane, has spent countless hours travelling across the globe to see his idols perform at 31 shows, ranging from New York, Boston and Washington to Belgium, the Netherlands and all across the UK.  His friendship with band members and those associated with the band has even seen him spend a week at the family home of Randall Hall, who was the band\u0026rsquos guitarist, in Florida. A friendship also grew with Paul Abraham, with Iain interviewing the road manager for his Lynyrd Skynyrd blog about his intention to write a book.  Iain said the band, which was formed in 1969 and continued following the tragic death of lead singer Ronnie Van Zant in 1977, were \u0026ldquoamazing live but also \u0026ldquolovely people.  He added: \u0026ldquoThey are down to earth, very friendly people in my experience and the people that formed the band are very approachable.  \u0026ldquoI have been very, very fortunate that I have been given access to the band over the years.  \u0026ldquoThat is something most fans would simply not get and I think that is down to trust and trusting me not to take advantage of their generosity.  The 55-year-old was delighted to be asked to write the foreword for the book, which is now available online.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis memoir provides a ringside seat, it is an intriguing glimpse into Skynyrd\u0026rsquos world. Fans will feel more than satisfied. Paul had a lot to get of his chest. The book offers up more explosive revelations than a Donald Trump press conference.  \u0026ldquoOver the many years I followed Skynyrd on tour, I was treated like royalty by the band. That was all down to Paul so I was delighted to contribute to his fascinating book."},{"url":null,"title":"teenage-tranent-judokas-shock-visit-from-love-island-star","story":"  Hannah Wood was stunned when Jack Fowler, one of the stars of the hit ITV2 dating show Love Island, walked through her door on Sunday.  Hannah\u0026rsquos world had come crashing down when she tore her ACL last April while fighting in a competition in Berlin, leaving her facing a summer on crutches.  Having binge-watched Love Island while off her feet, the 16-year-old Ross High School pupil was starstruck when Jack \u0026ndash who was already in Tranent to visit family \u0026ndash appeared at her Church Street home to wish her well.  \u0026ldquoIt was mental, Hannah told the Courier.  \u0026ldquoHe was in Tranent and my little sister [Sophie, 12] had messaged him, and I didn\u0026rsquot know.  \u0026ldquoShe told him I\u0026rsquod had surgery and was being really moody! He said he\u0026rsquod be down soon and the next minute he was at the door!  The 22-year-old came sixth with partner Laura Crane on this year\u0026rsquos season of Love Island. Having only entered the show\u0026rsquos Majorcan villa in the fourth week, he proved an immediate hit with viewers.  \u0026ldquoHe was always my favourite, said Hannah.  \u0026ldquoHe\u0026rsquos just dead nice. He has family up here so he was up visiting them.  \u0026ldquoHe stayed for about 20 minutes. He plays sport too, so he was asking about my injury and about judo.  \u0026ldquoI just asked him about Love Island, and what life was like after the villa.  \u0026ldquoHe said that he had a gut feeling he was going to leave, and that they all shared clothes and had a laugh. He said they\u0026rsquore all best friends after the villa.  But what did Hannah\u0026rsquos mum think when a 6ft 3ins-tall personal trainer from London walked in her door?  \u0026ldquoSophie told her before me but I still think she was a bit confused, Hannah laughed.  After posting news of her surprise house guest online, Hannah said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove gained 4,000 followers on Instagram and had loads of people messaging me wishing me well. My friends all said they should\u0026rsquove come round to see me!  Jack\u0026rsquos visit certainly lifted Hannah\u0026rsquos spirits as she now faces another agonising four to six months off the mat through injury.  \u0026ldquoI just fell awkwardly, she said.  \u0026ldquoI actually carried on which probably wasn\u0026rsquot a good idea, and then I got withdrawn from the European Championships.  \u0026ldquoIt was my first big selection which is why I was in denial about being injured.  Even with this bump in the road, Hannah is adamant to make it to the top.  \u0026ldquoI got into [judo] when I was five through my friends doing it, she said.  \u0026ldquoWhen I was about 12 I started doing competitions and this year I\u0026rsquove been travelling loads.  \u0026ldquoI went to Japan for a six-week training programme and trained full-time with the Japanese kids.

ICOL wants to build a substation, which will bring energy from an offshore windfarm onshore and into the National Grid, on the former power station footprint.  The application has been opposed by local community councils and the council, who believe it is not the best use of the site, which was bought by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower in March and is subject to an ongoing masterplan process for its future.  However, within weeks of the council buying the site, Scottish Ministers called-in the only lodged application for the land, from ICOL.  They said the move was because it was of \u0026ldquonational importance and denied any link to the fact that First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was on a state visit to China \u0026ndash whose state-owned company Red Rock own ICOL \u0026ndash at the time of the announcement.  The reporter appointed to investigate the application carried out a site visit at the start of this month.  Following that visit, it was announced a hearing into the plans would be held and Allison Coard was named as the appointed reporter who would oversee the hearing and report back to ministers.  Ward councillor Lachlan Bruce welcomed the announcement.  He said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom glad that there is going to be a hearing on this application.  \u0026ldquoI, of course, would prefer if members of the public could also speak at the hearing to give their views and opinions but I do think that community councils being invited is a welcome step.  \u0026ldquoOf course, this is again lengthening the process of the application out. If it had been left by the Scottish Government for East Lothian to make a decision we probably would have had an outcome by now and members of the public would also have had their chance to have a say.  \u0026ldquoI am confident that the hearing will be a further step in helping to convince the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos independent reporter that the current Inch Cape application is wrong for the site and wrong for the people of Cockenzie and Port Seton and Prestonpans.  Invitations have been sent out to Prestonpans and Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Councils inviting them to be represented at the hearing, along with East Lothian Council and representatives of ICOL.  All four have confirmed they will be attending the hearing.  In a statement following the visit, it was announced: \u0026ldquoThe reporter considers it would be helpful to have some wider community participation at the hearing and suggests that these views might be represented by one or both of the local community councils.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoThe appointed Reporter has decided that a hearing should be held on certain matters to help her consider the application, and the council has confirmed in writing that we will participate in this procedure. The council welcomes the Reporter\u0026rsquos decision to invite both Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council and Prestonpans Community Council to participate in the hearing.  A preliminary date for the start of the hearing has been announced as Tuesday, October 2, with a venue and more details of those attending to follow.  A spokesperson for ICOL said: \u0026ldquoWe welcome the announcement that a hearing will take place on the planning application for the proposed substation, in line with planning guidance for schemes of national importance. It is important that the local community has its say and we look forward to engaging with this process."},{"url":null,"title":"looking-back-when-haddington-was-underwater","story":"  John Hamilton of the Facebook page Lost Haddington got in touch with the Courier to highlight how the floods of 1948 would look in present-day Haddington.  He said: \u0026ldquoUsing the flood mark in the video-still as a reference, I got a friend who has access to a theodolite to use this and project this water level to other landmarks around the river and town centre.  \u0026ldquoRobert Byers from Haddington Camera Club then used his photo editing skills and a photoshop \u0026lsquoflood\u0026rsquo plug-in to reconstruct the photos.  In August 1948, persistent heavy rainfall saw the county face its most serious flooding in history.  Although much of East Lothian was affected, Haddington took a major hit. High Street as far west as the Town House was under several feet of water which stretched to the gates of Amisfield Park, a distance of more than half a mile.  Distillery Park, the Nungate, Peffers Place and Brewery Park were similarly devastated.  The Biel Burn also flooded, submerging all the low-lying land north and west of West Barns.  The flood occurred as the culmination of a period of truly exceptional rainfall \u0026ndash 122 mm of rain fell between August 1 and 8, followed by 153 mm in the next five days.  The saturated ground then received a huge 139 mm of rain in the next 24 hours, bringing severe flooding across the county.  The Haddingtonshire Courier reported on \u0026ldquodisastrous flooding without parallel in living memory \u0026ndash if not in history.  In the August 20, 1948 edition of the Courier, \u0026ldquoserious damage was inflicted on the banks of the River Tyne while other streams burst their banks and \u0026ldquoleft destruction in their wake.  It added: \u0026ldquoSo heavy was the flood of water that the streams made courses for themselves, with the result that many people were flooded out of house and home.  \u0026ldquoOne of the worst areas to suffer was Haddington, where a large number of people were rendered homeless, while shops and business premises were flooded to a depth of several feet.  Meanwhile at West Barns, the Biel Burn overflowed, causing serious damage to houses and shops in the village but fortunately \u0026ldquono loss of life is reported, although some people had narrow escapes, so suddenly did the water levels rise.  The floods also caused serious damage to crops on farms close to the Tyne and extensive damage was also caused to the now-demolished New County Cinema on Hardgate.  Nungate residents who had been enjoying the evening\u0026rsquos film were instructed by cinema management to return home to avoid being cut off as water levels rapidly rose.  And slightly further afield, the electricity supply in Gifford and Saltoun was interrupted, and at the Maltings in Haddington the sub-station was completely swept away. It was anticipated it would take many months for the affected areas to return to normal, and calls for assistance to help with the recovery were issued."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-the-commodore-of-haddington","story":"  TEENAGERS often get a bad press. To be sure, it\u0026rsquos a time when parents wonder what has happened to their children and feel they have lost them or gone wrong somewhere. This is because teenage years are a time of great change in terms of brain development. Quite literally the teenage brain is being remodelled and new priorities and emotions are created as a result.  It\u0026rsquos a time when peers and their approval become more important than parents or family, or almost anything else. Taking risks, or doing seemingly foolish things, are all part of this. We are familiar with the term \u0026lsquopeer pressure\u0026rsquo, but in our teenage years, approval by our peers and being included by them takes on a massive importance. It is an essential part of growing up and creating a new self-identity.  And a story from over 200 years ago shows that although the word teenager may not have been invented, and that there was no such thing as \u0026lsquoyouth culture\u0026rsquo as we now know it, behaviour was much the same.  It involves a group of young men who we would now call teenagers. They were a group of friends from Haddington. They included George Neill, John and William Haldane who were brothers, Peter Martine, Benjie Hunter and John Davie, whose nickname was \u0026lsquoLettie\u0026rsquo. They were all from Haddington, and their escapade became a story told well into their senior years. The nickname \u0026lsquoCommodore\u0026rsquo was coined for George on this day and stayed with him until he took it to his grave many years later.  Much of the tale is left to the imagination but the essentials were well told. One of the group came up with the idea of hiring a boat and heading out to Fife. These young men were not from poor backgrounds and so had the means to do this. So with the madcap plan devised, they set off as a group to the fishing village of Prestonpans.  The negotiations to hire a boat were concluded and they set off for the foreign shore of Fife, aiming for the town of Kirkcaldy. I cannot comment on their sailing abilities but they must have had some experience for they successfully navigated themselves to the shore of the \u0026lsquoLang Toun\u0026rsquo, possibly using the Lomond hills as a marker.  They came ashore like invading Vikings, intent on mischief. No social media in those days, but each town had a drummer who would disseminate news. And so they found Kirkcaldy\u0026rsquos drummer and paid him to announce to the town that at three in the afternoon there would be a spectacular diving and swimming show at the harbour entrance. The drummer set forth announcing the news, creating an air of expectation.  The group chose Lettie to be the performer. He was the best swimmer amongst them. As 3 o\u0026rsquoclock approached, a large excited crowd assembled on the harbour walls. The Haddington lads looked at each other with wry smiles and secret sniggers. Their ruse had worked, perhaps too successfully.  \u0026ldquoShow them what ye can dae, Lettie was told by his friends. And so Lettie stood on the edge of the boat and dived into the sea, from a height of about two feet. The crowd was silent, except for a wee five-year-old girl who clapped. She was the only one impressed by the spectacle.  There were murmurings as the Kirkcaldy folk began to realise they had been duped and were being made a fool of by these young Haddington lads. The mood began to get angry, and boos were followed by threats and words I cannot print here. It was clear it was time to go.  \u0026ldquoThank ye, the lads said, bowing to the crowd and laughing, mocking them for being so gullible. Stones began to fly towards them as they set off back towards Prestonpans, gesturing to the now-furious crowd. The lads in the boat were hysterical with laughter. They had raided and fooled the \u0026lsquoLang Toun\u0026rsquo.  But then their laughter stopped. Emerging from the harbour was a boat filled with angry Kirkcaldy lads who were shouting serious threats. The prank looked as if it might end unpleasantly so the Haddington lads had no choice but to row for their lives.  George took command. His friends had nicknamed him the Commodore at the beginning of their voyage, not so much because of his nautical skills but because of his leadership qualities. They were now desperately needed.  \u0026ldquoRow lads, row, he called on them. To be truthful the Haddington lads were at a disadvantage. They were not skilled seamen and in truth they were more bookish than brawn. But fear can do mighty things to a man\u0026rsquos capabilities, and as the adrenaline pumped through their veins they found levels of strength they didn\u0026rsquot know they had. They rowed like true Vikings, heave ho, heave ho. The sea splashed at their feet, their hearts nearly burst, but they kept the pace.  Slowly they began to pull ahead from the Kirkcaldy boat. \u0026ldquoKeep rowing, lads, dinnae look back, dinnae slow doon, called George, who was himself rowing as hard as he could. The tide was strong, the night was drawing in and the weather was beginning to change. The Kirkcaldy boat turned back, but the Haddington lads dare not attempt a Fife landing. They had no choice but to cross the Firth.  Darkness fell, then a thick haar covered them in freezing mist. They rowed through the night not sure in which direction they were headed. They wondered if their parents would ever know what had happened to them if, as now seemed likely, they were lost at sea.  The morning sun slowly burned off the mist. Thankfully they were still in the Firth, and there in front of them was the smoke coming from the lums and salt works of Prestonpans. They wept with relief and summoned up their last drops of energy to row ashore. Their final few hundred metres to the stony beach was watched by village children and women drying clothes.  Some fishermen helped pull the boat to land and the Haddington lads literally collapsed out of the vessel onto the beach, utterly exhausted but elated to be still alive.

East Lothian Council said that pupils across its six secondary schools \u0026ndash Musselburgh Grammar School Knox Academy, Haddington North Berwick High School Preston Lodge High School in Prestonpans Ross High School, Tranent and Dunbar Grammar School \u0026ndash improved their performances, with the number of Highers passed going up to more than 79 per cent.  Lauren Rodger, headteacher at North Berwick High School, told the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe are absolutely delighted.  \u0026ldquoOur Higher results are brilliant and we\u0026rsquore really pleased with how all the current sixth year pupils have performed.  \u0026ldquoI know schools are judged on their exam results, but for us it\u0026rsquos also about seeing the pupils develop \u0026ndash that\u0026rsquos the most pleasing part.  Similarly pleased was Paul Reynolds, the Ross High School headteacher.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are delighted with the exam results.  \u0026ldquoOur Higher results have been record-breaking and the sixth-years who have just left us have got really positive results that will allow them to hopefully go to uni or further education.  Meanwhile, Musselburgh Grammar School is celebrating record attainment levels for S5 and S6 pupils at all levels in this year\u0026rsquos exam results.  Headteacher Colin Gerrie said that there were also many \u0026ldquoexcellent results achieved by pupils in S4.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe results achieved by our students this year are exceptionally good and continue the successes of recent years, with school records broken on an annual basis.  \u0026ldquoWe do not underestimate the hard work of our pupils and the commitment of our teachers to make this happen.  His counterpart at Preston Lodge High School, Gavin Clark, also gave his thoughts.  At PL, four S5 pupils achieved six As at Higher, although the number of pupils gaining one, two, three or four Highers dropped from the last set of results.  Mr Clark added: \u0026ldquoWe expected that to happen, as a result of our regular tracking process.  \u0026ldquoThis dip in no way diminishes the achievements of those who performed so impressively in examinations.  At Knox Academy, new headteacher Susan Cook gave an update on how the school was performing.  She said: \u0026ldquoSeventy-four per cent of S4 pupils attained five or more qualifications at National 3 69 per cent achieved five or more passes at National 4 and 47 per cent achieved five or more passes at National 5 at grades A-C and 55 per cent at grades A-D.  \u0026ldquoThere were some outstanding individual performances in S4, with eight of our candidates achieving seven A passes at N5.  \u0026ldquoThese results are a really strong foundation to build S5 performance upon and I would encourage all parents/carers to continue to support their child to study at home as the transition from S4 to S5 in terms of challenge and pace moves up a few gears and much more study is required, especially at Higher level.  Meanwhile, the performance of S5 pupils in their Higher exams was down on the previous three years.  Ms Cook added: \u0026ldquoFifty-five per cent attained one or more Highers 35 per cent three or more and 16 per cent attained five or more Highers.  \u0026ldquoTwenty-two of our pupils achieved five Highers and some with straights As across all subjects.  \u0026ldquoMany other pupils achieved a mixture of Higher and National 5 awards and will build upon these in their sixth year.  Finally, there was \u0026ldquoan improving trend for S6 pupils over the last four years at Higher level, Ms Cook added.  The headteacher said: \u0026ldquoThose attaining one or more Highers was 62 per cent and then added to their results from S4 and S5  this rose to 76.22 per cent having achieved one or more Highers over S5/S6 \u0026ndash one per cent lower than last year, which in terms of statistics is not significant. However, it\u0026rsquos more than 13 per cent more than pupils attained in 2015 and 2016.  \u0026ldquoThirty per cent of the year group attained three or more Highers and the accumulate total was 66 per cent .  Finally, Claire Slowther, headteacher at Dunbar Grammar School, told the Courier that the staff at the school were \u0026ldquovery pleased with the exam results and said: \u0026ldquoAt Dunbar Grammar we are very pleased with the SQA results our students have achieved.  \u0026ldquoIt is wonderful to see the hard work of our students be rewarded with great results.  \u0026ldquoOur excellent team of teachers always work hard to support and challenge students and we were all really delighted to see them do well.  \u0026ldquoWe are incredibly proud of the achievements of our students and are looking forward to celebrating these at our awards evening, which will be held on September 12."},{"url":null,"title":"plans-for-longniddry-south-to-go-on-display","story":"  Developers Cruden Homes  and ZeroC will be displaying their proposals for development at the Longniddry Inn on Wednesday from 3pm to 8pm.

That project came about following rising safety concerns from drivers who did not feel confident using the unlit road.  Since then, driver confidence has improved by 78 per cent, with the project, which was undertaken by UK-based Clearview Intelligence in partnership with Transport Scotland and Amey, shortlisted in the Road Safety, Traffic Management and Enforcement category at the National Transport Awards, which take place in October.  Councillor Norman Hampshire, a Dunbar ward councillor and deputy leader of East Lothian Council, as well as chairman of the A1 Action Group, was one of those hailing the project as a big success.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe installation of the studs has, in my view, revolutionised the driving experience on the A1 after dark.  \u0026ldquoThe studs have improved night-time visibility beyond all recognition along certain parts of the route.  Concerns about driving conditions on the unlit road were first raised by the A1 Action Group, which comprises councillors from Scottish Borders and East Lothian Councils, transportation groups and community councils.  Transport Scotland met with the action group and, upon investigating the road, recognised that entering or exiting the A1 during the hours of darkness was a key area of concern due to a lack of visibility, junction definition and consistency in signage and road markings.  Clearview Intelligence was then appointed by Amey to make improvements to the road as part of a wider project and installed the road studs to give a visual consistency to the route by ensuring all major junctions were visible and treated similarly.  This included using white, red, amber and green studs to effectively highlight road edges, the centre of the road and junctions.  Andy Salotti, director of solutions at Clearview Intelligence, said: \u0026ldquoWe are immensely proud of the work we did to improve the driving conditions on the A1 and delighted this has been recognised at a national level.

The agricultural land has been earmarked by East Lothian Council for business use but Barratt claimed the council\u0026rsquos vision was financially unviable.  They said the only way to make the \u0026ldquonumbers add up was to create a mixed use site with housing and industry.  But their claims were rejected by councillors after Provost John McMillan , cabinet spokesman on economic development, insisted: \u0026ldquoIf we build it, they will come.  The quote, paraphrasing one made famous in the US baseball movie Field of Dreams starring Kevin Costner, came as he backed council officials who recommended the plans from Barratt and site owners The Co-operative be thrown out.  Jason Watt, from Barratt, told a meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos planning committee in Haddington last Tuesday that site drainage and geology issues meant it would cost \u0026pound1.5m to get ready for development.  Once general costs were taken into account, the total development bill would be \u0026pound2.25m \u0026ndash yet the value of the land was estimated at only \u0026pound1.1m.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe numbers clearly do not add up and never will unless there is cross subsidising with a mixed use development.  Ward councillor Kenny McLeod  backed the Barratt proposal, highlighting the lack of council housing available for rent in Tranent: the proposed Barratt development included 25 per cent affordable housing.  Mr McLeod said: \u0026ldquoWe need to keep the local connection and they are not building housing for rent in this area.  \u0026ldquoIt must be 50 years since a house was put in the area for rent.  However, fellow Tranent, Wallyford and Macmerry councillor Colin McGinn  said he was concerned about the traffic that would be created by more than 100 homes on the site, which is on the opposite side of the town\u0026rsquos Haddington Road from Steading View.  He added: \u0026ldquoWe have a responsibility within Tranent to increase employment and opportunities for our young people.  Councillor Brian Small , opposition leader, told the committee: \u0026ldquoThere is no point in having a [Local Development] Plan if at the first turn we think we can turn it over. We need to give this business land the opportunity to develop.  The committee was told that while the district valuer had agreed with developers that the land was not financially viable as a single business plot, they had said it could be made financially sound by developing it in phases.

That means traffic was responsible for 18.5 per cent of the total amount of carbon dioxide released in East Lothian in 2016.  But in total, CO2 emissions in the county fell over the same period.  Jason Rose, from East Lothian Greens, blamed more housing developments in East Lothian for the rise in CO2 from emissions relating to transport.  He told the Courier: \u0026ldquoTo live [in the new developments], you need a car. More houses means more cars.  Mr Rose also highlighted the fact that nearly half of East Lothian residents commute to Edinburgh every day for work.  \u0026ldquoThe main issue is half the people who live in East Lothian work in Edinburgh, so they have to commute, he said.  \u0026ldquoBuses take a long time, you want cheap and reliable.  \u0026ldquoWith trains, there definitely needs to be more of an effort to improve length and frequency.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Council should be trying to increase employment in East Lothian, so people don\u0026rsquot need to commute.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove heard some people say, \u0026lsquooh what if you open a bridge here or build another road?\u0026rsquo but creating more roads just increases traffic and spreads the problem around.  Overall, emissions from transport, both private and for business purposes, increased by 3.5 per cent in the UK over the period between 2011 and 2016.  However, total CO2 emissions fell by 4.6 per cent over the five years in East Lothian.  The county was responsible for releasing 1.1 million tonnes of CO2 in 2016 \u0026ndash down from 1.15 million tonnes five years earlier.  But Mr Rose highlighted that it was not just CO2 emissions that needed to be monitored.  \u0026ldquoWe need to watch for NO2  and PM10  \u0026ndash those are the pollutants that can cause health risks, he added.  In East Lothian, industrial and commercial activities are by far the main producer of CO2 emissions, releasing 63.9 per cent of the total. In 2016, households produced 16 per cent of the CO2 in the county, lower than five years earlier.  The Department also takes into account the amount of CO2 produced by farms and through other rural activities and the CO2 removed from the air by trees.  According to its estimates, these agricultural activities produced more greenhouse gases than forests removed, and so were responsible for 1.6 per cent of the carbon emissions in East Lothian in 2016.  Overall, the UK reduced its carbon emissions by 15.4 per cent over the five years."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/8024055.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"flying-banker-clocks-up-11000-flights-over-three-decades","story":"  Every week Anne Rendall island-hops across Orkney to open local Royal Bank of Scotland branches for customers there.

Long before becoming the Queen Mother, Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon married the Duke of York  in a style that was classic for her 1920s wedding. Whybro contrasts her gown to Princess Alexandra\u0026rsquos, saying: \u0026ldquoHer dress had a much straighter skirt, created from deep ivory chiffon, moving away from stark white and embroidered with pearls. The gown is very Twenties in design, featuring short cap sleeves with strips of Brussels lace, making it contemporary yet elegant. It was a simple affair, heavily influenced by Coco Chanel.  The current Queen got married during a time of austerity, as the country was still recovering from the Second World War. Elizabeth used ration stamps to buy the fabric , and it was designed by Norman Hartnell. Whybro says: \u0026ldquoQueen Elizabeth\u0026rsquos wedding dress incorporates elements of Princess Alexandra\u0026rsquos design, with embroidered floral motifs over the bodice and skirt, and long sleeves. In contrast to her mother\u0026rsquos dress, the Queen\u0026rsquos gown had a fit-and-flare silhouette, was created from ivory silk and embellished with crystals and pearls.  Elizabeth\u0026rsquos diamond tiara snapped hours before she was due to leave for the ceremony at Westminster Abbey. Luckily, a court jeweller was on standby, and they took the tiara via police escort for some emergency welding before returning it to the bride. If you\u0026rsquore eagle-eyed, you can spot a slight gap at the centre of the headpiece.  Princess Margaret\u0026rsquos dress for her wedding to Lord Snowdon is often described as the simplest royal wedding gown in recent history. Whybro says: \u0026ldquoPrincess Margaret\u0026rsquos dress was in stark contrast to her younger sister\u0026rsquos, with the emphasis being on exquisite tailoring and beautiful fabrics. The gown was made from silk organza and featured much less detailing. Although simple, the dress still had a full skirt and was designed to show off the bride\u0026rsquos petite frame.  Princess Anne married Mark Phillips in Westminster Abbey, with an estimated global audience of 500 million watching.\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoPrincess Anne\u0026rsquos 1973 wedding dress could not be more of the era, in terms of style and silhouette, says Whybro. \u0026ldquoA Tudor-style high neck dress with medieval sleeves, this remarkably modern gown was sophisticated, simple and contemporary, while featuring detailing embroidery far removed from that seen on Princess Elizabeth\u0026rsquos gown.  For most people, chances are the words \u0026lsquoroyal wedding\u0026rsquo conjure the wedding of the century \u0026ndash when Lady Diana Spencer married the Prince of Wales. It\u0026rsquos thought a whopping one billion tuned in worldwide to witness the fairy-tale event, and\u0026nbspWhybro says: \u0026ldquoProbably one of the most iconic wedding dresses of modern history, Princess Diana\u0026rsquos extravagant ballgown-style dress featured ivory silk taffeta and antique lace, with an opulent 25ft train.  The gown, she adds, \u0026ldquoset wedding dress trends for years to come, with its large puffed sleeves, narrow waist \u0026amp meringue style skirt. But having such a dramatic dress did come with its share of problems \u0026ndash too big for her glass carriage, Diana arrived at the ceremony slightly creased.  Sarah Ferguson had the unenviable position of following Diana\u0026rsquos wedding just five years later. \u0026ldquoSarah Ferguson\u0026rsquos dress was always going to be compared to Diana\u0026rsquos, and was understandably much less elaborate, says Whybro. \u0026ldquoThe gown was an ivory satin bodice with heavy beading, retaining some of the Eighties elements of Diana\u0026rsquos dress in its puff sleeves, yet cut to a three-quarter length. Sure, not as elaborate as Diana\u0026rsquos, but it still had a 17ft train.  Sophie Rhys-Jones\u0026rsquo dress was a much simpler affair, when she married Prince Edward. However, Whybro says it echoes another royal gown from the past \u0026ndash Princess Margaret\u0026rsquos. \u0026ldquoCreated from hand-dyed ivory silk organza and crepe, the dress featured minimal pearl and crystal beading around the neck and sleeves, with far less of a full skirt than previous royal gowns, she observes.\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoRhys-Jones\u0026rsquo gown had a more modern feel, with simple lines.  Camilla Parker-Bowles was in a unique position when marrying Prince Charles, as this was a second marriage for both of them. As such, instead of wearing a white or ivory gown, Camilla opted for a more understated cream chiffon dress with an oyster coat. \u0026ldquoKeeping detailing to the minimum, this contemporary outfit followed the tradition of not wearing ivory or white for a second wedding and instead featured modern styling, including a cream coloured straw hat.  As with Meghan, there were months of speculation as to who would design Kate\u0026rsquos gown, in the run-up to her and Prince William\u0026rsquos wedding day. In the end, the honour went to designer Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen, who created an ivory dress with a classic silhouette, covered in delicate lace. Whybro says: \u0026ldquoChanging wedding dress fashion for decades to come, in the same way Diana did, Kate\u0026rsquos McQueen creation was a combination of tradition and modernity, with a classic shape evoking that of Victorian styling with its narrow waist and hip padding, long lace sleeves and a semi-bustle at the back. The floral motifs echoed Princess Diana\u0026rsquos detailing and the full skirt with elegant train touched upon contemporary elements.  Meghan\u0026rsquos silk gown, its train and well-recognised boat neckline will undoubtedly command the most attention at the new exhibition. Designed by Claire Waight Keller, the Givenchy dress features an intricate five metre-long veil, on which flowers of the 53 Commonwealth countries are embroidered along with Wintersweet and a California Poppy. Queen Mary\u0026rsquos 1932 diamond and platinum bandeau tiara, lent to Meghan by the Queen for the star-studded ceremony earlier this year, will go on public display for the first time from October 26."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8480652.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"facade-of-landmark-belfast-building-inspected-after-blaze","story":"  Crews continued to battle overnight to douse the smouldering shell of the Bank Buildings after Tuesday\u0026rsquos inferno.

Doubts remain over the structural integrity of the building, though there are\u0026nbsphopes the shell could be saved.  A main section of the city centre remains sealed off to allow for detailed structural assessments throughout Wednesday.  Assistant chief fire and rescue officer Michael Graham told the Press Association the firefighting operation had been \u0026ldquoscaled back to six fire appliances from the 14 used by 100 crew at the height of Tuesday\u0026rsquos blaze.  \u0026ldquoWe are currently assessing the situation with structural engineers, he added.  \u0026ldquoThere has been constant collapsing within the building and currently we are assessing the external facade to see what that looks like and how secure it is.  The chief executive of Primark, Paul Marchant, has expressed shock and sadness at the fire and moved to reassure the 300-plus workforce that have been gravely impacted, saying he will ensure they are \u0026ldquofully supported.  The building, which has been in the heart of Belfast\u0026rsquos shopping district since 1787, had recently undergone a multimillion-pound refurbishment.  Primark customers and staff were evacuated from the building at around 11am on Tuesday after smoke could be seen billowing from the roof.  Flames reaching at least 50ft could be seen right across Belfast\u0026rsquos skyline.  The historic clock at the top of the building was engulfed in flames before the fire spread from the roof to the floors below.

The investigation is into two complaints of incidents alleged to have taken place at Bute House, the First Minister\u0026rsquos official residence in 2013.  Ms Sturgeon said she agreed to the procedure covering ministers and former ministers in December 2017 but that while she was aware of the investigation she had no role in it.  Ms Sturgeon said that she was initially made aware of the investigation by Mr Salmond himself.  She said: \u0026ldquoAlthough I have been aware for some time of the fact of the investigation \u0026ndash initially from Alex Salmond \u0026ndash I have had no role in the process, and to have referred to it before now would have compromised the integrity of the internal investigation, which I was not prepared to do.  \u0026ldquoHowever, I was informed by the Permanent Secretary earlier this week that she had completed her investigation and that she intended to make the fact of the complaints public.  \u0026ldquoAlex Salmond is now challenging the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedure in court. The Scottish Government refutes his criticisms of its process and will defend its position vigorously.  \u0026ldquoHowever, this focus on process cannot deflect from the fact that complaints were made that could not be ignored or swept under the carpet.  The First minister said here relationship with Mr Salmond, who she has previously described as a mentor, makes it difficult to deal with but that people must feel able to make complaints.  She added: \u0026ldquoI have been clear on many occasions that all organisations and workplaces must make it possible for people to come forward to report concerns and have confidence that they will be treated seriously.  \u0026ldquoFor that principle to mean anything it cannot be applied selectively. It must be applied without fear or favour, regardless of the identity, seniority or political allegiance of the person involved.  Mr Salmond denied the allegations and was taking action against the Scottish Government claiming he was denied the opportunity to refute them.  He said the claims which date back to 2013 were \u0026ldquopatently ridiculous and said the investigation was \u0026ldquounjust."},{"url":null,"title":"edinburgh-western-msp-alex-cole-hamilton-bombarded-with-2000-empty-envelopes","story":"  Liberal Democrat member for Edinburgh Western, Alex Cole-Hamilton, received the pile of nuisance mail at his Clifton Terrace office last week.  Speculation is now rife as to whether the post was a bizarre prank or a malicious attempt to cut into Mr Cole-Hamilton\u0027s constituency coffers.  Some 2,000 envelopes with the Freepost address scrawled in the same handwritten block capitals and ink arrived last Wednesday at the Clifton Terrace Lib Dem base.  Mr Cole-Hamilton said: \"We had a bit of a laugh about it at their expense.  \"It must\u0027ve taken them two or three days, but it\u0027s unlikely to cost us a penny.\"  Mr Cole-Hamilton said the Freepost address was \"widely available\", pushed through constituents\u0027 doors on surveys so they can submit them completed to his office.  He added: \"It\u0027s important in a democracy that elected members are accessible and at no cost to yourself and we fundraise to support that.\"  Mr Cole-Hamilton\u0027s staff started opening the envelopes to find nothing inside and immediately twigged to the ruse.  The MSP said he suspected the sender intended for him to run up a bill of close to \u0026pound1,000 in Freepost fees.  He said: \"Clearly this was designed to target us, to drain our resources, but what they didn\u0027t know is that the Royal Mail might refund malicious misuse of postal addresses, as they may do in this case.  \"To spend that amount of time on something like this is a bit of a worry. My staff just wondered what was going on.  \"But I would\u0027ve been far more worried if they\u0027d been knocking on doors in my constituency persuading people to vote for someone else.\"  Mr Cole-Hamilton\u0027s staff have now reported the matter to police, but hold out little hope officers will be able to trace the sender.  Mr Cole-Hamilton said: \"We\u0027re not wasting police time, it\u0027s just so they can log it and see the bigger picture.  \"Ever since Jo Cox, we don\u0027t take anything lightly and log with police anything that\u0027s out of the ordinary.\"  The Royal Mail is understood to look at malicious use of Freeport services on a case-by-case basis before considering covering the cost itself.  A spokeswoman said: \"We are investigating and liaising with the MSP on this matter.\"  Police officers are expected to meet with Mr Cole-Hamilton and his staff today to discuss the matter.  A police spokesman said: \"Police in Edinburgh have received a report of inappropriate use of a Freepost service in the Corstorphine area.  \"Officers will liaise with the recipient to establish the full circumstances surrounding this report.\""},{"url":null,"title":"mike-ashley-blasts-greedy-landlords-as-house-of-fraser-stores-hang-in-the-balance","story":"  The Sports Direct tycoon, who recently bought the department store chain out of administration for \u0026pound90 million, has been in tense talks with landlords over rents in recent weeks.  Those negotiations have resulted in around seven House of Frasers being saved from closure, including in Oxford Street, Telford and Plymouth.  However, the tracksuit billionaire warned on Tuesday that \u0026ldquotime is running out for the remainder of the 59-store estate.  A spokesman for House of Fraser said: \u0026ldquoSome landlords are being very collaborative in order to give us a chance at turning the business around, giving House of Fraser a lifeline and saving hundreds of jobs.  \u0026ldquoHowever, some greedy landlords would rather see the stores close than help save the jobs of hundreds of people.  \u0026ldquoWe will continue to try and convince these landlords but ultimately time is running out.

Of the 78 students due to begin studying dentistry there next month, 52 - 67% - are Scottish, down from 85% in 2012.  Over the same period, the share of overseas students among the intake has increased from 3% to 14%.  A similar pattern has also been seen at Scotland\u0027s other major undergraduate facility, Dundee Dental School, where the proportion of Scottish undergraduates among the first-year intake has reduced from a peak of 80% in 2012 to 63% in 2017 - although it has been as low as 40% at times, in 2010 and 2014.  The percentage of international students also went from 8% in 2012 14% in 2017, but peaked at 19% in 2015. Figures for 2018 were unavailable.  This mirrors the trend seen with medical school intakes, where the share of Scottish undergraduates studying to be doctors has fallen from 63% to 51% since 1999.  A spokesman for the British Dental Association  said: \"The Glasgow University figures show a worrying steady decline in the proportion of Scottish dental students in the past five years.  \"Scottish students are more likely to remain in Scotland and work in the NHS, therefore the University and the Scottish Government must ensure that Scottish applicants are not being disadvantaged compared with applicants from elsewhere in gaining a place to study dentistry at Glasgow.\"  Although dental students in receipt of a bursary are required to work in the NHS for one to five years after qualifying, depending on the amount of money they were given, most new dentists are free to leave Scotland as soon as their training is complete.  The number of places available to Scottish and non-UK EU students is capped and funded by the Scottish Government, based on projections of future workforce needs.  While Scottish and EU students do not pay tuition fees out of their own pocket, universities are reimbursed instead by the Scottish Government - at a current rate of \u0026pound1850 per year.  In comparison, Glasgow Dental School charges overseas students \u0026pound39,500 a year in tuition, adding up to a total bill of \u0026pound197,500 over the five-year degree.  At Dundee Dental School, an international student will pay even more - \u0026pound203,300 over the five years.  This has previously led to accusations that foreign students are used as \"cash cows\" to prop up university courses and sustain the Scottish Government\u0027s free tuition policy.  The actual number of international dental students at Glasgow has increased steadily over the past decade, from three to 11, while the total number of places has declined from 95 to 78.  At Dundee, the overseas intake climbed from fewer than five in 2007 to a peak of 24 in 2014, before declining back to eight in 2017.  Scottish Conservative shadow health secretary Miles Briggs said: \u0026ldquoThis is a similar situation to the declining number of Scots being accepted to study medicine.  \u0026ldquoBecause of SNP government policy, universities are being forced to take in more international students who pay fees for financial reasons.  \u0026ldquoThat means Scots are being squeezed out of their own universities.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos not only harmful to their aspirations, but the future of the NHS, for whom international students are less likely to stay on and work after graduating.  Labour Health spokesman Anas Sarwar, a former dentist, added: \"This is an example of how the SNP government bungle workforce planning for our health service.  \"Earlier this summer, Labour said that the SNP government should review the cap on student places with a view to raising it.\"  A spokesman for Dundee University said it was not true that Scottish students were \"squeezed out\" in favour of more lucrative foreign recruits.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe number of places on offer to Scottish and EU students is capped and funded by the Scottish Government on the basis of future workforce planning.  \"We are also permitted to recruit a limited number of international and rUK candidates but these places have no impact on the number of Scottish students studying Dentistry here.  A spokeswoman for Glasgow University said they could not comment as its Scottish and EU intakes were set by ministers.  Free tuition for EU students predates Brexit, when EU students were automatically entitled to live and work in Scotland. Around one in 10 of Scotland\u0027s dentists are from the EU and the BDA reported in April this year that UK dental practices are struggling to fill vacancies amid uncertainty over future visa rules.  The number of registered NHS dentists in Scotland dropped from 3670 to 3647 between 2016 and 2017, the first fall in five years and only the second year-on-year in 18 years.  A UK-wide BDA survey in 2017 also revealed that 58% of NHS dentists were considering leaving the profession within the next five years, and a third of members over the age of 55 were planning early retirement."},{"url":null,"title":"Iain Macwhirter  Salmond   s determination to clear his name could tear the SNP apart","story":"  The former First Minister is the most formidable fighter in politics and will not to go quietly into that good political night.

Mr Logan quoted advice from the Society of Local Authority Lawyers in Scotland  stating: \u0026ldquoSolar have advised us that parents don\u0026rsquot have the option to opt out of the assessments, explaining that all children ... will participate.  However, a spokesman for Solar told The Herald the body did not provide a view to the Scottish Government on the literacy and numeracy assessments.  He said: \u0026ldquoSolar has not advised the Scottish Government that parents don\u0026rsquot have the option to opt out of the assessments. Solar does not have an agreed position on this matter and has therefore not provided any formal or informal view.  \u0026ldquoTo clarify, Solar works alongside other stakeholders, including the Scottish Government, on a number of matters, but we cannot and do not provide any stakeholder with legal advice.  Last night, the Scottish Government said they had worked closely with Solar during the development of the assessments.    A spokeswoman said: \u0026ldquoHaving asked Solar for a view, we received a response and communicated that to directors of education in good faith.  The confusion over where the opt out advice had come from provoked a backlash from opposition politicians.  Iain Gray, education spokesman for the Scottish Labour Party, said it was \u0026ldquoutterly unacceptable for parents to have been misled and called for an apology.  He said: \u0026ldquoParents and teachers who were appalled when Mr Logan told them pupils could not opt out of these tests will be further shocked to discover the letter was based on an assertion which does not appear to be true.  Liz Smith, education spokeswoman for the Scottish Conservative Party, said the government \u0026lsquos position on P1 testing was in \"utter confusion\".  She said: \"Worse still, it seems the Scottish Government has issued misinformation to the directors of education and has therefore confused matters even more. This is wholly unacceptable.\"  Tavish Scott, education spokesman for the Scottish Liberal Democrats, called for Mr Logan\u0027s letter to be withdrawn immediately.  He said: \"It is absolutely unacceptable behaviour by the government and yet another incident from blundering ministers intent on  making life difficult for parents.\"  There was also concerns from the members of a campaign set up to encourage parents in P1 to opt out of the assessments.  Eileen Prior, executive director of parent organisation Connect, described the revelation as \"shocking\".  She said: \"It is very disturbing that this misinformation was used to support the government\u0026rsquos stance on standardised assessments.  \"Schools acting on this advice might find themselves in direct conflict with parents at what should be an exciting time for new P1 families.\"  Sue Palmer, chair of literacy charity Upstart Scotland, said: \"Parents have the right to withdraw their children from the P1 tests, but thanks to this strange letter many headteachers are under the impression that this right doesn\u0026rsquot exist unless there are exceptional circumstances.\"  A spokeswoman for the Educational Institute of Scotland teaching union said the episode was \"very concerning\" and confusing for parents and teachers.  She said: \"We fully support the right of parents to opt their children out of standardised assessments. Where parents have concerns or state a clear wish to opt their children out we would advise that parents make this known to the headteacher.\"  Jackie Brock, chief executive of Children in Scotland, said: \"There is no legal basis for insisting that P1 children be tested. There is also zero credible evidence that children will benefit from being tested at this early age.  \"It\u0027s time to call a halt to this wasteful and damaging approach, which is opposed by organisations across the education sector.\"  The government stressed that parents had no statutory right to withdraw their child from any aspect of schooling - other than some parts of religious education.  The Scottish Government spokeswoman added: \"If a parent does not wish their child to take part in an aspect of teaching and learning, they can discuss this with their school. This is the same position as has existed for decades.\"  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon introduced the assessments as a response to concerns over falling standards of literacy and numeracy and a lack of consistent data across the country.  However, critics claim they are too stressful for the youngest pupils with feedback highlighting cases where pupils were left distressed - particularly when whole groups were assessed together."},{"url":null,"title":"angela-haggerty-let-the-orange-lodge-step-back-but-continue-marching","story":"  It released a statement last week declaring it had fallen victim to a \u0026ldquoreligious no-go zone after it was ordered to re-route a parade away from St Alphonsus church in Glasgow, after reports last month that a priest had been attacked and parishioners heckled as they left mass during an Orange Walk. In response, Glasgow City Council insisted the lodge change the route of a later march, which was again due to pass St Alphonsus church. Unhappy with the request, the lodge cancelled the march altogether.  In its subsequent statement, the lodge said: \u0026ldquoIn order to offer concessions \u0026hellip we identified the times of the service in the church and proposed times to avoid this. All of this was rejected. We were simply told that some streets are now no-go zones based simply and horrifically on religious beliefs.  \u0026ldquoThis is religious intolerance, nothing less.  It went on to suggest an alternative approach: that the parade should be allowed to pass St Alphonsus\u0026rsquos and parishioners should all come outside to greet the march. They could all \u0026ldquowish each other well and carry on with our own lives, it said.  I must admit, I didn\u0026rsquot realise the lodge had a sideline in comedy. The notion that an Orange march passing a Catholic church, where only recently a priest was reportedly attacked in similar circumstances, could magically become an exercise in religious harmony was truly brilliant. It\u0026rsquos impressive spin, I\u0026rsquoll give it that.  If it\u0026rsquos genuinely interested in improving relations with the Catholic Church as an institution and public perceptions of it, perhaps it should consider how Catholics feel about these marches.  As a Catholic who grew up on the Isle of Bute, I hadn\u0026rsquot encountered an Orange march in the flesh until I moved to Glasgow a number of years ago. However, I\u0026rsquod met and known plenty of people who would strongly identify with the lodge, which describes itself as the \u0026ldquooldest and biggest Protestant fraternity in Scotland, and organisation of people \u0026ldquobonded together to promote the ideals of our faith.  It would be an understatement to say I did not have good experiences with those people. It was abundantly clear that I was considered inferior and problematic. These views and attitudes may not reflect how the lodge would like itself to be seen in the modern age, but there\u0026rsquos no denying it exists among its followers.  During my first summer in Glasgow, I\u0026rsquod find myself awoken at the weekends by the banging of drums and the sound of flutes. It\u0026rsquos a very odd experience to wake to the beating of a drum I felt was designed to let me know my place. As I became used to the schedule of marches, I\u0026rsquod purposely avoid certain areas. On the day of the biggest Orange march in Glasgow \u0026ndash the week before the 12th of July events in Belfast \u0026ndash I\u0026rsquod avoid going out altogether or leave the city. I know many other Catholics who do the same.  On one occasion, I stepped out of the house and accidentally right into the oncoming path of a parade. I initially froze, and then in a panic, ran. Was it likely that anything untoward would happen? No. But that wasn\u0026rsquot the point. These events instil a certain fear among many Catholics. The lodge can argue until its heart is content that there\u0026rsquos no danger, but it is simply wrong to dismiss how Catholics feel about it. We are a minority in Scotland and, according to hate crime statistics, a highly targeted one.  For me, it\u0026rsquos a no-brainer that the lodge should avoid being part of the intimidating atmosphere created by marches passing Catholic churches. If it is serious about exhibiting good relations with Catholics it shouldn\u0026rsquot be calling on us to step out of churches, while fearing for our safety, to help it prove a point.  But all of that said, there\u0026rsquos an element of the lodge\u0026rsquos concerns that I do sympathise with. Amongst the debate about all of this, it\u0026rsquos clear that some of the condemnation of the lodge does not originate from a place of concern about balancing religious freedoms, but rather of religious intolerance.  I may not like Orange walks, but in principle I support the right of its members and supporters to march. The Orange Lodge is an easy target for those who do not believe the state should accommodate expressions of religious freedom. Just as they\u0026rsquod decry Orange walks, these are often the same people who would have complained that the visit of Pope Benedict to Glasgow in 2010 cost too much money and disruption to justify.  And so, to an extent I actually do share the lodge\u0026rsquos concern, and that\u0026rsquos why I hope it will step back from this ludicrous determination to march past Catholic churches. In the end, all it will be is a gift to those who really want to see the end of the lodge, and it may be surprised to find that this attitude isn\u0026rsquot coming from Catholics."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-screen-guide-taps-into-trend-for-set-jetting","story":"  The new VisitScotland guide features landscapes and landmarks featured in more than 60 programmes filmed in or inspired by Scotland, including Outlander, Doctor Who and Taggart.

She said: \"Today I am committing that our development spending will not only combat extreme poverty but at the same time tackle global challenges and support our own national interest.  \"This will ensure that our investment in aid benefits us all and is fully aligned with our wider national security priorities.\"  She explained that an additional \u0026pound4bn of UK investment would aim to \"pave the way\" for at least another \u0026pound4bn from private sector financing as part of the Government\u0027s ambition to overhaul the United States as the G7\u0027s top investor in Africa.

However, government body Transport Scotland can reclaim some of this subsidy if profits exceed those agreed by the operator.  In a statement on its website, CalMac claimed its \u0026ldquoefficient and effective service delivery over 2016-17, the first year of the contract, led to the money being returned.  While Western Isles Labour candidate Alison MacCorquodale criticised the claw-back, saying the money could have been spent improving the service, the Scottish Government defended the move as \u0026ldquocommon sense.  A government spokesman said: \u0026ldquoThe contract to run the Clyde and Hebrides Ferry Service relies on a significant Scottish Government subsidy which is why a claw-back mechanism is included to recover excess profits over and above those bid by the operator and ensure taxpayers receive the best value for money.  \u0026ldquoThis mechanism ensures the operator only receives the correct amount of subsidy to compensate it for the shortfall between what it receives in fares from passengers and what it costs to run the service.  \u0026ldquoThe Clyde and Hebrides Ferry Service contract is set up to ensure the operator is paid for what they actually deliver, which most people would hopefully recognise as common sense.  CalMac reported that 99.5 per cent of their services had run within ten minutes of the scheduled times last year.  However, this year has so far seen a different picture with repair delays causing widespread disruption to services.  Earlier this week, the Scottish Government announced plans to invest \u0026pound3.5m in Scotland\u0026rsquos ferry services to reduce the risk of vessels breaking down and return them to service quicker if they do.  The move, announced by transport minister Michael Matheson, aims to stop ferries being out of service for extended periods.  Mr Matheson said: \u0026ldquoWe are very much aware that, as our ferries age, additional resources will be needed to keep the vessels running so our island communities stay connected.  \u0026ldquoThe funds will be used to upgrade or replace key systems and equipment on the vessels. This will be tackled on a priority basis to avoid potential vessel breakdowns and delays to the ferry service and customers."},{"url":null,"title":"study-shows-shocking-decline-of-arctic-skua","story":"  A study of 33 colonies in Orkney, Shetland and Handa, off Sutherland, recorded an 81% decline in breeding pairs from 1992 to 2015 \u0026ndash reduced from 1,061 to 200.

Dr Allan Perkins, senior conservation scientist at RSPB Scotland and the study\u0026rsquos lead author, said: \u0026ldquoLack of food has been the biggest pressure for these birds and shows just how vulnerable our seabirds and marine life are.  \u0026ldquoAs sandeel numbers have declined around these key north east areas in Scotland the whole food chain is impacted. If these sharp declines continue, it\u0026rsquos possible that Arctic skuas will be lost as a breeding species in Scotland.

University of Strathclyde PhD research student Mel Cosentino has been studying underwater audio recordings and found the dolphin has\u0026nbsplearned to increase the frequency of the clicking sounds made to navigate and hunt to match the porpoises.  Common dolphins have peak frequencies below 100 kilohertz  while for harbour porpoises it is around 130KHz.

Imelda made an impression with her cherry and white chocolate oatmeal biscuits in the first round, but she struggled in the technical challenge, coming in 11th place.

The study, which began in the 1970s, involved 1,222 middle-aged men born between 1919 and 1934 who were at risk of heart disease, due to factors such as high blood pressure, smoking or being overweight.  Half were given instructions to exercise, eat healthily, achieve a healthy weight and stop smoking, while the others were given no extra advice.  The research, presented at the European Society of Cardiology conference in Munich, found that those given the regular advice were more likely to die young \u0026ndash with the experts suggesting the interventions may have added extra stress to their lives.  Among the same group, those who took less than three weeks off each year were 37% more likely to die young over the next 30 years.

An open meeting, ‘Winter Fodder – Dealing with a Shortage’ was held on Friday, August 17 at Thainstone Centre and farmers heard about different strategies to help with winter fodder budgeting, managing stock numbers, and alternative fodder and bedding options.                                                    Farm Profit Programme advisors Declan Marren and Robert Gilchrist, along with focus farmers Scott Duguid, Andrew Biffen and Jim Gammie shared their on-farm successes and strategies.                                                    John Gregor, Executive Director at ANM Group and Chairman of the event, said: “We are pleased with the success of this event and strong attendance from the farming community. The Farm Profit Programme advisors and focus farmers did an excellent job sharing their expertise and provided a wide range of practical steps available to farmers as they plan for the winter ahead. It is incredible how a number of small changes can make a significant difference to the fodder challenge.        “ANM is committed to supporting our members and more information is available by contacting our Farm Profit Programme advisors or by getting involved in a focus group.”At the outset, farmers were urged to create a winter fodder plan by determining current levels of fodder supplies, how many animals they need to feed, and the extra fodder required.  To reduce fodder and increase commercial productivity, Mr Gilchrist advised to implement a strict bulling period, scan for pregnant cows 40 days later, and cull the poor performing, non-pregnant cows to achieve 90-100% fertility rate in the herd. This will ensure the calving interval is shorter for next spring and reduce the number of animals on the farm this winter.By identifying non-pregnant cows earlier, they can be removed from the system before the expensive winter period. The next decision to make is whether or not it is worth feeding them prior to the sale. Where grass and fodder reserves are extremely tight, selling will be the best option. Where younger, easier fleshed cows are scanned not in-calf and are thin, it may be worth feeding them for a short period to increase the sale value. Feeding 5kg concentrates at grass for five weeks pre-sale will cost £35 but has the potential to increase cow weight by 52kg and the overall value of the cow by over £130 per cow.                                                                                                        Next, weaning calves early in October will help maintain cows’ weight leading up to winter, as cows utilise this condition throughout winter before the calving period begins. Supplementing growing calves instead of cows will realise a better conversion of around 4kg of concentrate to 1kg of live weight gain, which is the preferred option rather than trying to build up flesh in cows whose feed-to-gain efficiency will be poorer.Mr Marren reported that there is a fantastic opportunity to increase fodder supplies as the soil temperature is currently above the seasonal average at 14°Celsius and grass is growing at the rate of 40-50kg of dry matter produced per hectare. Farmers also have the chance to optimise grass growth by blanket spreading nitrogen across the whole farm. Nitrogen can be spread right up until early September with the confidence that you will receive an economical response to the application. Applying 40kg of nitrogen per hectare will grow at least an extra 600kg of dry matter per hectare at the cost of £35 per hectare.Alternative bedding options presented on the day included woodchip, recycled wood, sand and rushes. Once the animals are housed, one option for farmers is to replace 6kg of silage with 1kg of straw and 1kg of barley per day for one month. Over a four-week period and 63 cows, this will result in 11 tonnes less of fodder supplies used. While, focus farmer Jim Gammie reported success using woodchips over the last two years, which he is also composting for further land use.Those interested in finding out more or getting involved in a focus group, are invited to get in touch with Declan or Robert on 01467 623 838 or farmprofit@anmgroup, or by stopping by the Farm Profit Programme office located in the concourse at Thainstone Centre.

The cycle, entitled ‘ Tour O’ Scotland 2018’ starts from Louise’s farm near Rothienorman on September 15 and takes in Aberdeen and Edinburgh on the east coast as well as Dumfries, Ayr and Oban on the west coast.                                                    The first day of the tour will end, rather appropriately, at CLAN House on Westburn Road in Aberdeen. The final leg of the journey will take Louise from Inverness back to her farm on September 26.        Louise is hoping to raise £25,000 to be split between these two fantastic charities. She has been training hard since the turn of the year in preparation by completing the ETAPE Loch Ness and Caledonia events as well as the very challenging Isle of Mull Sportive in gruelling 25 degree heat. Most recently, Louise completed the overnight ‘Ride to the Sun’ cycle between Carlisle and Edinburgh on June 23, and is looking forward to her final organised event before her big challenge when she participates in ‘Ride the North’ over August 25 and 26.Louise said: “ I know it’s not going to be easy, but for such good causes, I’m going to give it my all.  I’m increasing my training to ensure that I am as fit as I can possibly be.”                                                                                                        You can follow Louise’s progress via her Facebook Page at: https:www.facebook/touroscotland2018, and for those who want to donate, you can do so at Virgin Money Giving at: virginmoneygiving/Team/TourOScotland2018.And, as if that wasn’t enough she has gone one step further and arranged a black tie ball at Thainstone Exchange, Inverurie, on Saturday, November 3.The speaker for the evening will be Mark Beaumont, the man who is most famous for his own exploits in cycling round the world.

Colin Clark, MP for Gordon, said that retailers will have to reflect vastly lower yields due to the prolonged hot and dry weather this summer.                                                    He also suggested that supermarkets will increase the range of what can be packed in order to keep prices down.                                                    Mr Clark is a shareholder in a vegetable growing and packing company based near Inverness supplying carrots and potatoes to supermarkets.        Speaking during a visit to a farm in Moray, Mr Clark said: “This has been the worst drought since 1976 but it is a wake-up call for the supermarkets.“I have been involved in supplying fresh produce to the supermarkets for almost 30 years. Farmers and growers have become so professional that supermarkets and perhaps customers no longer understand how fragile the supply chain is.“Scotland will come into its own this year with availability of water and serious investment in irrigation.“Retailers will have to reflect vastly lower yields due to the hot dry weather. The east coast and the southern half of England have disastrous yields, crops have wilted and failed, the same is true across Europe.                                                                                                         “Supermarkets will increase the range of what can be packed to keep prices down. “With less intense farming plant disease pressure is less, traditional rotations and precision farming give Scottish vegetable growers serious advantages.“Climate change predictions suggest the use of water will become critical and UK producers will have to be more efficient.”Mr Clark also sounded a note of warning about the ongoing row over UK-wide frameworks in areas like agriculture post-Brexit.                                                                                                        He said: “The vast majority of output is supplied south of the border to national supermarkets who value the quality of Scottish produce.“A fully integrated UK market is essential to Scottish farming. This year more than any other shows how important food security is and the opportunity for Scottish growers to displace imports.”                                                                    "},{"url":null,"title":"strong prices at thainstone collective sale","story":"        Over 2,000 buyers and sellers attended the latest collective sale of plant, machinery and equipment at Thainstone.

Some reports suggest it may be more than just a fanciful notion.When first contacted by Wick historian Harry Gray about the recent restoration of the \"Iron Wellie\", we had visions of a giant Wellington boot unearthed from the Caithness moors. That theory was firmly booted into touch after a visit to this unearthed marvel on the northern side of Wick Bay.The Iron Wellie is in fact a spring water well situated down a flight of recently restored Caithness flagstone steps close to the Soldiers\u0027 Tower on the North Head.Charlie Bain of Wick Paths Group explained how together with Denny Swanson, Tommy Munro and others from the Royal British Legion Scotland they recently restored the site of the spring.\"The steps down to it were overgrown and damaged,\" he said. \"We also replaced the pipe the water flows through and there is a marker stone at the top of the steps.\"Denny Swanson said he remembered bringing the water to his mother who suffered from arthritis for most of her life.\"She sent me down every second day for a bottle of \u0027Iron Wellie water\u0027, as she called it. She maintained it helped her arthritis and it certainly seemed to take some of her pain away.\"After Harry symbolically cut a ribbon of barricade tape the group, together with Charlie\u0027s dog Jet, went down for a taste of the water that many in the area depended on in bygone times. It is speculated that the inhabitants of nearby Tinkers\u0027 Cave would have consumed the water. The Wick worthy Tudor James resided close to the site and lived to a ripe old age.Harry said that the Iron Wellie was also known as the Chalybeate Spring and its taste has been described like \"sookin\u0027 pennies\".\"Chalybeate waters, also known as ferruginous waters, are mineral waters containing salts of iron \u0026ndash hence the local name Iron Wellie,\" he said.\"There is no written history of this well but it was certainly known in the 18th century and by the turn of the 20th century it was sometimes referred to as \u0027Jocky Simpson\u0027s Wellie\u0027. Who Jocky Simpson was, is lost in time.\"Harry said that \"generations of Wickers\" out for a walk along the braes or exiles home on holiday would nearly always stop for a drink from the wellie.\"We as youngsters firmly believed that the water did us good despite the taste and it was a welcome drink when playing around the North Head or when fishing or swimming from the rocks,\" he said.\"Young lads get hungry and we would sneak a turnip from Bob Cormack\u0027s field above the wellie, dock it on a stab [for the uninitiated that means removing the ends of the neep by striking it against a fence post] and we then cut off the skin and washed the neep in the Iron Wellie water before sitting on a rock and devouring it.\"Harry laughed at how present-day health and safety regulations would make drinking the water seem like a risky act \"but none of us became ill or died from it, perhaps proving the efficacy of the wellie\u0027s water\".Perhaps in the future Wick will host thousands of pilgrims queuing up for a taste of the rejuvenating powers of the Iron Wellie water.Wednesday 29 Aug 2018 11:42 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117108.jpg","title":"Dont be put off if youre being bullied employees are told after Scrabster complaint is rejected by tribunal","story":"A LOCAL advice service is stressing that although a tribunal has rejected a complaint of workplace bullying made by a Scottish Government agency employee, others should not be deterred from launching similar action.DeeAnn Fitzpatrick had claimed that she experienced bullying and harassment while employed as a fisheries officer for Marine Scotland at Scrabster harbour, but a tribunal this week ruled against her in the case.Speaking to the Groat, Iain Gregory, the deputy manager of Caithness Citizens\u0027 Advice Bureau , stressed that bullying regularly takes place in the workplace, and each year he hears numerous complaints.\"Clients feel that they have been the victim of unfair dismissal, discriminatory treatment, bullying or other types of incorrect treatment,\" he said.\"Anyone who feels they have been the victim of such conduct or treatment should never be deterred from reporting the matter.\"DeeAnn Fitzpatrick had claimed that she experienced bullying and harassment after she became a \"whistleblower\" while employed as a fisheries officer at Marine Scotland at Scrabster.The 49-year-old Canadian national told an employment tribunal in Aberdeen recently that she felt intimidated after being sent anonymous cards between 2015 and 2017, and claimed she was targeted with sexual harassment, for being a woman, and because of her age.In a previous hearing, Ms Fitzpatrick had also alleged that she was taped to a chair and gagged by colleagues in 2010.The employment tribunal, however, ruled against Ms Fitzpatrick in its decision on the case.In its judgment, it said it could not agree whether the cards came from current colleagues, and is understood to have been unable to consider the chair allegation as it was said to have taken place more than three years before the complaint was brought.Mr Gregory says that each year CAB deals with a \"substantial number\" of bullying cases, each of which is examined carefully and then detailed evidence is obtained.He says in many cases CAB is able to resolve matters without progression to the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service  or to a tribunal \u0026ndash \"perhaps by raising a grievance with the employer or by negotiation\".He added: \"However, there are numerous cases which require referral via ACAS and we can often resolve issues at this point by using the \u0027Early Conciliation\u0027 process.\"He underlined that it is \"comparatively unusual\" for a case to proceed to tribunal, with only a \"small percentage\" going that far.\"While it would be inappropriate to comment on any case in which we were not involved, I would stress that people should not under any circumstances be dissuaded from pursuing their rights,\" Mr Gregory said.\"The system exists to ensure that your case can and will be properly considered and we can advise you and make sure that you understand it.\"Wednesday 29 Aug 2018 11:42 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Jobs boost for AMTE Power in Thurso","story":"THE number of staff at a Thurso business is to increase by 25 per cent over the next year following a partnership deal with a British technology company.The workforce at AMTE Power Ltd, based at Thurso Business Park, is expected to rise from 32 to 40 following the deal with QinetiQ whose headquarters are in Farnborough in Hampshire.

Local resident and self-professed \u0026ldquoTrinkie lover Bryan Newlands welcomed the group\u0026rsquos formation, underlining that the pool harboured a lot of memories. \u0026ldquoI used to go there a lot... Even though I lived on the other side of town, every summer myself and a friend would go \u0026ndash even when it was raining, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was a great place as the town didn\u0026rsquot have an indoor swimming pool until 1994. Many people learned to swim at the Trinkie.While a slideshow showed images of how the pool used to look and how much Wickers got from it, other more contemporary images show a dilapidated ruin \u0026ndash a far cry from the hustle, bustle and smiles of yesteryear.The new group was formed with a mission to \u0026ldquobring the pool back to life and a number of office-bearers were proposed and elected.James Bremner was elected chairman with other roles going to William Macdonald , Catherine Patterson  and Garance Warburton .Seven committee members were also elected: Fiona Bremner, Trudi Mcalpine, Davina Lyall, Fiona McPhee, Leslie Grant, Roddy Mackay and Councillor Willie Mackay.Ms Patterson underlined that it was going to be no easy fix as \u0026ldquothere are holes in the wall at the deep end, which also has cracks that go right down to the ground.\u0026ldquoThe previous group... had the holes patched up, but they kept reappearing, she said. \u0026ldquoThe wall itself is also crumbling and the bridge that divides the deep and shallow ends has had its fixtures corroded. Also the south access road that leads the public to the pool is in poor nick.She stressed that volunteers to patch things up and general goodwill is always welcome, \u0026ldquobut [often] their help only scratches the surface of what needs to be done.She added: \u0026ldquoMajor investment is needed along with a report from a structural engineer to see how much damage there is, what can and cannot be done, and to get an estimate of how much the restoration will cost.Mr Newlands \u0026ndash committee member Ms Lyall\u0026rsquos son \u0026ndash stressed that the Trinkie added tremendous character to Wick.\u0026ldquoPut it this way, with the summer we\u0026rsquove had, that pool would have been full had it been in use, he said.Other memories came from Wick Society chairman Iain Leith. \u0026ldquoGoing there was a popular pastime in its day with adults and kids from all over Pulteneytown flocking to it, he said.\u0026ldquoRestoring it could be a big boost to the town\u0026rsquos economy by making it a tourist attraction as well as giving back the town a much-loved landmark.Ms Patterson emphasised that the Trinkie had the potential to be an asset to both locals and tourists.\u0026ldquoBut we need investment because if nothing gets done the pool is on its way out.Wednesday 29 Aug 2018 11:42 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Open evening in Thurso for potential Childrens Panel members","story":"AN open evening is taking place next week with the aim of attracting volunteers for the Children\u0026rsquos Panel in Caithness.Tuesday\u0026rsquos event in Thurso will allow members of the public to find out how they can play a part in the children\u0026rsquos hearings system \u0026ndash helping others and giving something back to the community in the process.Volunteers from all walks of life make life-changing decisions that create a difference in the lives of many, and this is very true for children, young people and families in Caithness and across Scotland within the children\u0026rsquos hearing system.It relies on the voluntary involvement of around 2500 people who are willing and able to give their time and commitment to serve as Children\u0026rsquos Panel members.A number of agencies work together with the system to deliver protection, care and support to families, children and young people.

Accompanied by a support boat, Mr Cameron, 40, reached the shore on the other side, near Duncansby Head, sometime just before 8.20pm tonight.Mr Cameron decided to take on the seven-mile swim across the Firth in memory of his girlfriend Ena Brown, who died suddenly earlier this year. Money raised through the challenge will be going to the Kirkwall Maternity Ward, where Ena had worked.Speaking tonight, Monday, following the swim, he said: \u0026#8220It was a grind, I was swimming for over four hours and I never stopped for one second, I just ploughed on the whole way.\u0026#8220It was quite choppy to start with but it got better as I went on. Things eased off after about an hour or so. I knew I had it in me, I was just worried about the conditions changing and having to pull the plug, so I couldn\u0026#8217t relax during the swim. I went through all sorts of emotions \u0026#8211 I was confident and I had moments of doubt.\u0026#8220That last hour was a real grind, I must confess. I could see Duncansby Head in the foreground and I didn\u0026#8217t think I had long to go, but I was scared to ask. I had thought I had about 15 minutes to go, but I had an hour-and-a-half to go. It was real tough going.\u0026#8221\u0026#8220I\u0026#8217ve done marathons, I\u0026#8217ve won Scottish championship surfing titles, but that\u0026#8217s the toughest thing I\u0026#8217ve done.Asked how he felt following the swim, he replied: \u0026#8220I feel a big weight off my shoulders. If this hadn\u0026#8217t happened this week we would have been looking at next summer. I feel I\u0026#8217ve achieved something, I know this has been done before once or twice before, but this is something I will remember for the rest of my life. It\u0026#8217s very rewarding.

Local residents are digging in the last few metres of cable to more than 35 per cent of the properties.Community spokesman Steve Jones said: \"It\u0026rsquos a tremendously exciting time. Like many residents I\u0026rsquove only been getting very slow speeds capped at 0.5Mbps, making even the most basic of online activities difficult and frustrating, so looking forward to ultrafast speeds is fantastic.\"Fast, reliable broadband will bring huge potential to regenerate our scattered communities. It\u0026rsquos a prerequisite for attracting families and businesses to the area, where the population has fallen in recent years. People now expect good internet as a basic. In essence, it will help us to build a closer and more integrated community.\"Lesley Negri, who runs the historic Aultguish Inn near Garve with her husband Dario, added: \"It will make a huge difference to us, especially for our booking system and payments.\"At the moment everything slows down from 4pm and we can\u0026rsquot manage customer expectations. Many of our customers want to stream things or download photographs and it\u0026rsquos impossible to do that at the moment. We\u0026rsquove lived with slow broadband for so long that we can\u0026rsquot imagine what it\u0026rsquos going to be like when we can access ultrafast speeds!\"Wednesday 29 Aug 2018 11:43 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Although the provision of public toilets is a non-statutory function of local authorities, the Scottish Government ensured that the criteria for the fund did include capital support for toilet provision, where there was a demonstrable need.\"She added that she was aware of the council\u0026rsquos toilet closure plans and said she had \"personally pressed\" the local authority to reconsider.Council leader Margaret Davidson said the cuts were part of wider measures to \"balance the budget and safeguard essential services\" amid a climate of reduced funding for councils across Scotland and the wider UK.What do YOU think?

It consists of a retail box of fresh fish, sent directly to consumers all over the UK within hours of being landed. Fishbox now boasts in excess of 2000 subscribers with 100 new customers signing up every month.Mr Houston told the North Star: \"These are very exciting times for us. We will leave the Inverness premises on August 24. We have simply outgrown the premises and all of Coast \u0026amp Glen will relocate to Alness.\u0026nbsp We currently have 14 staff, plus four staff we have taken on from Summer Isles and are recruiting a further eight staff. There will me more next year too.\"Fishbox currently employs nine staff and this will increase next year too. We have big expansion plans for both companies.\"The award-winning businessman, a former motorcycle racer who taught himself the trade after a bad crash, has built up Coast \u0026amp Glen to a turnover exceeding \u0026pound2.2 million. The combined turnover for the two companies at the end of this year is set to top \u0026pound3m.His change in direction came by chance whilst out on a fishing boat. He went on to buy a small 21ft fishing boat, teaching himself from YouTube and Google. He decided to start selling his own catch and found the demand was so high he started selling from other boats. With the high demand from restaurants for a wider iety of products, Coast \u0026amp Glen was born.He said: \"I have always thought it\u0026rsquos very important to support the local community with jobs. It would be much easier for us to send fish to Glasgow to get processed just like majority of the salmon companies do and the whisky companies do for the bottling of their whisky, but that would have an impact on the area I was born and brought up in.\"This was the reason that I put a lot of time pressure on the people involved in the transition of the purchase of Summer Isles Foods.\"Wednesday 29 Aug 2018 11:43 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Alex Salmond has formally begun his legal action against the Scottish Government over its handling of sexual harassment allegations made against him.                Two complaints were raised in January against the former first minister, who strongly denies the allegations, and he was informed of an investigation in March.            Mr Salmond is taking court action against the Scottish Government to contest the complaints process activated against him.            His petition for a judicial review has now been lodged at the Court of Session in Edinburgh, court officials confirmed on Tuesday.Meanwhile, Mr Salmond has written to Scotland’s top civil servant, calling for an inquiry into how the allegations against him were made public.He contacted Permanent Secretary Leslie Evans on Monday urging her to investigate.Read more: Alex Salmond demands full inquiry into harassment ‘leak’ in government letterThe former first minister said someone within the Scottish Government has “flagrantly and repeatedly” breached the confidential complaints process by leaking details to the Daily Record newspaper.            The Government previously said its investigation into the two complaints has been “entirely confidential throughout”.A statement released on Mr Salmond’s behalf said: “It is manifestly absurd for the Permanent Secretary to claim that her procedure is ‘confidential’ when it is splashed over the front pages, emanating from briefings to a single newspaper.“As explained many times now, confidentiality on such matters is crucial to both complainers and those complained about.“Without it those who wish to make a complaint can have no confidence in the system protecting them while those complained about are denied fairness.            “Someone within the Scottish Government has flagrantly, and repeatedly, breached that requirement and the Permanent Secretary is now required to try and find out who it was.”The allegations about Mr Salmond’s conduct towards two staff members in 2013, while he was in office, first emerged on Thursday when the former MP released a statement prompted by an inquiry from the Daily Record.The newspaper published what it claimed were details of one of the complaints over the weekend.Police Scotland confirmed on Friday that the complaints have been passed to the force.Opposition parties have called for “full transparency” from the Government over its investigation.            A spokesman said: “For legal reasons we are unable to provide further detail at this time.“However, in the fullness of time the Scottish Government will seek to make available as much information as it can.”The PCS, Prospect and the FDA issued a joint statement saying: “Civil service unions met with the Permanent Secretary today and have confidence that the Scottish Government will continue to take seriously and handle sensitively all complaints of harassment.“The unions are confident that the Scottish Government processes which we negotiated are valid and robust and if any member wishes to make a complaint then they will receive the full support of their trade union.“We also indicated our full support to the Permanent Secretary personally in leading the process and would encourage any worker with any concerns to come forward. ”Read more: Alex Salmond: ‘dirty tricks’ conspiracy theories run wild amid allegations"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4778381.1535382019!/image/image.jpg","title":"edinburgh fringe 106 of the best ever jokes and one liners","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...

An army of the unemployed descended on Edinburgh from all corners of Scotland. With them were bands, field kitchens and banners. Each marcher had a knapsack and blanket. The goal of the marchers was to meet with Sir Godfrey Collins, Secretary of State for Scotland, to demand the abolition of the means test, increased relief for men, women and children and for work schemes to provide jobs. The city authorities made it clear the marchers were not welcome and they would provide no accommodation or food.            The march was organised by the Communist-led National Unemployed Workers Movement , whose Scottish organiser was the veteran agitator, Harry McShane, but it won support from the Independent Labour Party, the trade unions and Labour Party. The Aberdeen and Dundee contingents marched south to join with the Fife contingent in Kirkcaldy. The Ayrshire contingent joined with Lanarkshire marching via Shotts and East Calder. The Renfrewshire and Dunbartonshire contingents, including a women’s section marched via Glasgow, Coatbridge, Airdrie, Bathgate, and Broxburn. The main Glasgow contingent marched to Kilsyth and Falkirk, where they joined with Stirlingshire, and onto Edinburgh via Bo’ness.READ MORE: Video: Rare footage of Edinburgh in the 1930sOn Sunday 12 June, they joined up in Costorphine for their entry into the capital. The next day 20,000 people greeted them at the Mound. The first sign of a thaw on the part of the authorities was when the Ministries of Labour, Health and Education agreed to meet delegations of marchers. But there was still no reply from Collins. A second victory was when the police lifted a ban on street collections. But Collins refused to meet with them.The NUWM members paraded through the royal palace of Holyrood with their band playing ‘The Internationale’ and other socialist tunes, and when the city council refused to provide accommodation their leader, Harry McShane, said they’d sleep on the pavement of Princes Street, the city’s most prestigious thoroughfare, as marcher William McVicar recalled: “I think someone offered us somewhere [to sleep] like Waverley Market or somethin’. And McShane and them wouldn’t accept that, they says, ‘No, no, we’re not going there.’ So they says, ‘Oh well, we cannae give you anything else.’ And of course he says, ‘Right we’ll sleep in Princes Street.’” The Edinburgh Evening News reported McShane telling the marchers as they gathered on the south side of Princes Street: “So far here we are and here we stay until another decision is reached. We can breakfast, dinner or tea here, and the men require a rest. They can have that rest in Princes Street. We have decided to give them a long lie in ‘bed’ this morning.” The Edinburgh Dispatch caught the mood among the ordinary folk of Edinburgh as they made thier way along Princes Street on that first morning: “Walking along on the carriageway one heard snatches of conversation: ‘Slept well?’ ‘How did ye enjoy yer feather bed?’ ‘Did ye feel a draught coming in during the night?’”            On the first morning, women marchers blocked the tramway while men shaved using their reflections in the windows of the big department stores. Tom Ferns remembers: “And they couldnae ha’ picked a better spot than Princes Street. Under the Conservative Party headquarters, the Liberal Party headquarters and the big luxury hotels, here was hundreds and hundreds o’ angry unemployed. Obviously a sight like that is not seen every day, particularly in the capital city of Edinburgh.”READ MORE: Astonishing press photographs capture interwar-era EdinburghAnother marcher, James Allison, said, “the police were going mad”. Yet Edinburgh police were not keen on inciting a pitched battle as Hugh Sloan recalled: “At dinner time, our field-kitchen came along and the police chief told Harry McShane, ‘This is Princes Street, you can’t feed here.’ Harry told them, ‘It was good enough for us to sleep here, it’s good enough for us to feed here.’” The marchers then demanded free transport home. Eventually the city’s chief constable and deputy town clerk told them they would provide transport if McShane guaranteed there would be no more marches to Edinburgh. He refused and the chief constable, worried about disturbances on the capital’s streets, backed down. Transport was then provided to take the marchers home.            On the last night, the marchers and their supporters gathered to burn an effigy of Sir Godfrey Collins before boarding buses and a final meal paid for by the city council. The march organisers refused to give a guarantee that no further hunger marchers would defile the city!Throughout the 1930s, the unemployed protested but the NUWM also organised children’s parties in the summer and at Christmas. A number of the marchers would go on to fight in the Spanish Civil War, including the leader of the Aberdeen contingent, Bob Cooney.The inter-war period, not just the “Hungry Thirties”, was grim in Scotland. Prior to the First World War, it had been at the cutting edge of British industry. Within a few years of the wars end the traditional industries, coal, steel and shipbuilding were in trouble. Scottish banks and companies were bought up by their bigger English rivals. Unemployment was a permanent feature, peaking in the 1930s and only ending with the demands of the Second World War.The shale mining industry collapsed, for example, as cheap imported oil cut demand for paraffin. In December 1925, “The Scotsman” reported from Tarbrax, a shale mining village then in South Lanarkshire under the headline “Situation at Tarbrax: Faced With Starvation,” which reported: “Workers from Tarbrax, to the number of nearly 400, marched in procession to Carnwath, nearly ten miles distant, on Thursday night last for the purpose of asking poor relief. Relief under the emergency clause of the Poor Law Act, which enables people in a state of absolute destitution to get relief, has been given to a number of people in Tarbrax on the recommendation of the doctor there. A meeting of Carnwath Parish Council has been called for today to consider the whole situation.”  Starvation – it’s a strong word. My father was little over a year old when the mine at Tarbrax shut. His father would have been on that cold December march before briefly finding work at another pit nearby, then giving up and coming to Edinburgh in search of work. He was without a permanent job until the end of the 1930s.

All the recent chatter about expanding the Fringe beyond its current slack boundaries concerns me. If anything, we should be looking to shorten the leash on this ever-famished beast.            I used to adore the Fringe, and still do in many respects. I am also highly aware of all the many benefits it brings.            But, as the years roll on, the buzz, colour and vibrancy it generates becomes harder and harder to detect through the thick fug of commercialisation and obnoxiously large crowds.For the first time in years, I stayed away.The party atmosphere the organisers strive to achieve every year may exist in the minds of the visitors who knowingly expect chaos before they arrive, but, for many residents, it’s beginning to feel more like an annual occupation.READ MORE: Call for longer Edinburgh festival to ease room cost crisisWe know a different Edinburgh, a majestic city unburdened by the indignity of placing fairground wheels adjacent to its most prized civic monuments.            Latest Fringe figures, meanwhile, reveal that almost a million more people booked shows this August than this time a decade ago. Records are being broken every year.From one perspective, this is great news, but the reality is this unbridled growth merely diminishes the experience for guest and host alike.Yet Edinburgh seemingly isn’t concerned by this profits, after all, are growing too. Opposition voices are drowned out by the persistent slapping of backs and the unwavering faith of those who believe the Fringe can do no wrong.Fringe organisers are becoming increasingly obsessive about ensuring that this year’s festival be bigger than the last, as if maintaining the long-held ‘world’s biggest arts festival’ title can guarantee quality alone.            A notable elephant, or should that be heifer, in the room here is Underbelly. Since the events firm planted down its hooves in the early 2000s, the Fringe’s character has shifted considerably.What deserves to be a world-class alternative arts fest is slowly being churned into a homogenised, cog-driven carnival that primarily serves to maximise gate receipts above all else.If the Fringe cannot be tamed in size, perhaps we should consider reducing its run-time. Three-and-a-bit weeks is an awfully long time to be loaning out your city centre.But that wouldn’t aid the great paradox, as touched upon by Fringe Society chief executive Shona McCarthy, who pointed out that ever-inflating accommodation costs mean the bread-and-butter Fringe acts, the “life force” behind the 71-year-old stramash, are increasingly being priced out during August. She, quite rightly, considers that a more serious threat to the future of the Fringe than Brexit.READ MORE: Edinburgh Fringe chief: Accommodation prices will ‘kill life-force of festivals’            Even those who are supposedly in charge of Edinburgh cannot control the machine, as illustrated perfectly a couple of weeks back when council leader Adam McVey made an embarrassingly unsuccessful attempt to have a wall of black, vista-blocking barriers removed from Princes Street. While the Summer Sessions concerts they were erected for were not part of the Fringe, McVey’s climb-down was of K2 proportions the coda here being that the tail is well and truly wagging the dog.The annual commercial takeover of central Edinburgh is wearing thin. The Fringe needs to take a long look in the mirror before it becomes irreconcilable with its own original philosophy."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4791233.1535522965!/image/image.jpg","title":"sir malcolm rifkind uk must stay eu ally to oppose any russian aggression","story":"        It is in the UK\u0026#8217s strategic interest to ally itself with the EU to oppose any Russian aggression, writes Sir Malcolm Rifkind.                Britain and our European neighbours share at least one thing in common. There are times when neither of us can see the wood for the trees.            The past two years of Brexit negotiations have been consumed by interminable exchanges on budget contributions, internal markets, WTO rules and financial services.            We are left with the wider world assuming that Napoleon was right and that we are, after all, a nation of shopkeepers and not much else. It also implies the same for the French and the Germans, who seem to be having much the same obsessions.But, in the longer term, the greatest challenge of Brexit may not be trade but peace and security in Europe.A deal of some kind with the EU remains highly likely but is not certain. Equally uncertain, however, is whether, through benign neglect, both we and the EU allow Europe as a whole to be weakened in a globalising world and our joint security to be compromised at a time when Russia is resurgent and China is emerging as the new superpower. It is, of course, Britain, through our referendum decision to leave the EU that bears the prime responsibility for this serious threat having emerged, but the EU nations have as much interest as we do in dealing with it.There are two separate dimensions to the geopolitical challenge we will face. The first is the defence and security of Europe at a time when Vladimir Putin is a serious menace and Donald Trump is, at best, ambivalent about his commitment to Nato and the defence of Europe.The second issue is whether Europe’s voice in the wider world will be heard and listened to by the US, China, Russia and other global powers when an emerging common EU foreign policy will no longer have the military weight and diplomatic experience of the United Kingdom to support it. It is not only the UK that now risks irrelevance in global foreign and security policy, it is the European Union as well.            Some take comfort from the fact that the military defence of Europe is the responsibility of Nato and not the EU and that this will not be directly affected by Brexit. That has considerable truth if it comes to a stark question of peace or war.READ MORE: Russia warns UK: ‘No one should threaten a nuclear power’Yet the security of Britain and Europe does not depend on Nato alone. It requires, also, political stability, economic growth and diplomatic strength. It also requires the closest European co-operation in ensuring that Europe’s military capability is of the highest order. Without the UK any longer able to veto it, EU countries may now wish to go forward with their proposal to have a EU command and control headquarters operating alongside Nato, to handle relatively modest military operations in support of the UN or for humanitarian purposes. This is a proposal that Washington has opposed. Time will tell whether such a change would help or harm Nato.            Even more important will be European countries, including the UK, drawing closer together to maximise their combat and deterrence capability, both to support the US as part of Nato or, in the longer term, to ensure Europe’s ability to defend itself if US resolve were ever to weaken. Such a strengthening of Europe’s military capability is quite simply impossible without the direct involvement of the UK.Together with France, we are Europe’s sole possessors of nuclear weapons without which an aggressive Russia could blackmail Europe over the decades ahead. Furthermore, global trade and economic security requires European nations to have the capability to protect their own territorial seas, and our common merchant sea lanes in the Atlantic, the Gulf and elsewhere.READ MORE: Leader comment: Russian democracy fades under its ‘tsar’The Royal Navy, even in its current reduced state, remains Europe’s paramount naval and maritime power a position that will be further enhanced when the two new aircraft carriers come into service.The second strategic issue is how Europe is to project its foreign policy interests in the wider world unless the UK is around the table with Germany, France and other European states when crisis issues are being discussed. The two great successes of European foreign policy have been the financial sanctions imposed on Russia over Ukraine, and Europe’s sanctions on Iran that helped make possible the nuclear deal with that country. Neither could have been achieved without the City of London’s financial strength and involvement.            The Iran deal was negotiated by the permanent members of the UN security council. But Germany was, also, included, in a 5+1 group, to demonstrate to Iran the unity of the international community. In the same way there will need to be a EU+UK forum available when future crises need to be addressed.It is more than a truism to say that Britain is leaving the EU but not leaving Europe. Long before the EU existed, Britain always joined with other European nations to prevent tyranny or aggression in Europe. We helped defeat Napoleon in 1815, rather than assuming that it was nothing to do with us. We declared war on the Kaiser, who hoped we would stay neutral, in 1914 and on Hitler in 1939. We did so not because we faced invasion at the beginning of those crises but because we recognised that there is no strategic threat to continental Europe that is not also a threat to the UK.Britain’s strategic interests will not change in 2019 when we leave the EU. They will remain the same as those of France and Germany. That is the geopolitical reality that neither we nor our EU partners must ever forget. Whether the UK is in the EU or outside it, Britain needs Europe and Europe needs Britain if we are to maximise our diplomatic strength in a wider world that will be, increasingly, dominated by Americans, Chinese and Russians.It was once remarked that lawyers and missionaries make the worst diplomats because with law and faith it is difficult to make the necessary compromises. That is why we have politicians. That is why Angela Merkel and Emannuel Macron, as well as Theresa May, must be flexible and must compromise. If the “rules” make that difficult, change the rules.As Churchill remarked, politicians should never commit suicide as they might live to regret it.Sir Malcolm Rifkind was Foreign Secretary and Defence Secretary between 1992 and 1997"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4791412.1535534175!/image/image.jpg","title":"letters nicola sturgeon is right not to suspend alex salmond in face of allegations","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        Nicola Sturgeon is most likely correct in her view that there is no legal basis in suspending Alex Salmond from the SNP , but there is another, more straightforward reason for not having to do this either.                 Previous SNP politicians who needed to be investigated over alleged wrongdoings – Michelle Thomson MP, Natalie McGarry MP, Mark McDonald MSP – were all suspended from the ­party because they held public office on behalf of the SNP at the time.             In these cases, there was a clear public interest in the cases being properly investigated. Mr Salmond holds no such office, and it is really down to the SNP themselves to determine whether his being a member is damaging to their reputation or not.            READ MORE: Alex Salmond begins legal action against Scottish Government What this case highlights is that Alex Salmond is an ex- politician, important once, but not now. He has no current political relevance. His time has now gone and he should have realised in 2017 that when the Tories become more popular than you are, then it is time to go. What is important now is seeing that justice is done, for both parties. Whether Salmond remains an SNP ­member or not is irrelevant.

Turkish Airlines operates scheduled services to 304 destinations in 122 countries across Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas.            The “interline” agreement will allow customers in the Loganair Highlands and Islands network to book a single ticket, via their travel agent, to long-haul destinations when connecting through Edinburgh Airport – saving on an air passenger duty  charge of as much as £78.            Passengers will have the added advantage of being protected should their connecting flights be disrupted.Kay Ryan, Loganair’s commercial director said: “This is a deal with one of the biggest names in international air travel, and we see it as the start of a partnership that will develop into a full codeshare agreement later in the year.”Gokhan Haciibrahimoglu, general manager of Turkish Airlines Scotland, added: “We are pleased to be working with Loganair for our flights operating from Edinburgh Airport, thus giving Turkish Airlines the opportunity to extend its network and better serve Scotland.“Our partnership will allow our passengers to easily connect with the regional airports of north and west Scotland to 304 destinations and 122 countries.”The move is the latest in Loganair’s “Better Connected” programme. Deals have already been signed with Air France, KLM, Emirates, Thomas Cook Airlines, giving customers the ability to through-ticket and through-check baggage where flights connect at Glasgow, Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Inverness and Norwich.            Single ticket booking for ongoing flights with more than one carrier offers a number of benefits including through check-in, protected connections in the event of delays and the APD saving on flights from the Highlands and Islands if connecting onwards to long-haul destinations.It also complements codeshare arrangements Loganair already has in place with British Airways and its partner airlines at Manchester, offering connectivity to transatlantic routes, including Chicago and Philadelphia, with onward connections throughout the US.In June, Loganair revealed that it had plunged almost £9 million into the red following the break-up of its franchise agreement with Flybe and subsequent competition.The cost of the Glasgow-based airline “flying solo” again brought a bill of about £3m, while delays in newly-negotiated codeshare agreements with partner airlines and travel agency booking channels going live led to a £2.1m bill.            Most damaging of all, Loganair noted, was the announcement by Flybe that it was entering a new franchise agreement with Eastern Airways and would compete head-to-head on six routes.Despite the turbulence, Loganair booked turnover of £110.7m, a rise of 7 per cent. Passenger numbers were up 6.2 per cent to an all-time high of 812,541, but the load factor – the percentage of seats filled on scheduled flights – fell from 62.8 per cent to 59.8 per cent, due to overcapacity on routes with Flybe competition."},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006. Construction began in 2016 and is expected to be completed on schedule in late summer.\nLocated at Seafield the new centre is just a short distance from the long-standing Eric Gray Centre. Once opened the centre will provide specialist assistance for adults with complex care needs and learning disabilities.\nThe building has been designed by Richard Gibson Architects and construction is being led by DITT. The drone footage was shot by Nick McCaffrey.\nThe centre does indeed look good and is on schedule well done DITT , the clients and staff are all looking forward to being in the building. It has taken many years to reach this point  and is much needed.\nI wonder what, if any, proof you have that clients and staff are looking forward to being in the building? If you do have some proof to justify your claim, are they looking forward to being in before or after completion?\nGeorge Dickson\nI have along with other parents of clients that currently use the Eric Gray Centre worked hard, and against many obstacles to finally see the realisation  of a much needed new building where all clients who are at this moment in different buildings due to there being not enough space in the old building and facilities that have run there course in time. It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at different stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed. I like many other parents and carers look forward to the day its complete and our daughters and sons can enjoy the help and encouragement from staff to live their lives to the best of their ability.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August.

Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call  744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of life or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards significantly to make and justify it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and life experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen  and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers if I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds if difficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped diffuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"locum psychiatrist costs health board 625000 a year ","story":"\nMembers of the board agreed at Tuesday’s meeting to advertise for a full-time consultant post.\nThe health board has a substantive consultant psychiatrist who has been in the job for the six months, as well as speciality doctor, and paying a locum consultant psychiatrist for 12 months.\nDirector of community health and social care Simon Bokor-Ingram said in a report to members that out of hours cover was being provided solely by a locum and this was not sustainable.\nLocum costs for a full year were £625,000, the board heard, whereas a consultant psychiatrist would be £166,000 a year.\nMembers were told while a budget would need to be made for a permanent post it would provide “resilience and sustainability” across the service.\nMr Bokor-Ingram said the decision to appoint permanently would also mean the board could look to someone who had a specialism in dementia or learning difficulties.

This is especially true in relation to tourism businesses where the loss of access to cash via local banks could have a detrimental effect on long term prospects.\nAlthough there are potential alternatives, including online or Post Office banking and mobile bank vans, the report warned that these options raised concerns over such issues as cybersecurity, the fragile nature of Post Office contracts and accessibility of mobile banks for less able people. Customers facing a shift from a local branch to a mobile bank also consider this a backward step.\nIn its recommendations, the report calls for a collaborative approach involving Scottish Government, HIE, local councils, community members and delivery partners, including the banks and Post Office.\nIt also wants recognition of the importance of cash to local economies and support over time for a sustainable transition to digitally based economies. This includes the creation of digital inclusion strategies to help businesses benefit fully from online banking.\nThe report also recommended a Post Office banking strategy that would include securing the long-term sustainability of contract Post Offices to support rural economies and infrastructure.\n\nWednesday 29 Aug 2018 11:43 AM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117085.jpg","title":"Dalwhinnie makeover starts to take shape","story":"Tom Ramage\n\u0026nbsp\nDALWHINNIE is on the verge of a major makeover at its southern entrance.\nFor too long dogged by a disused, overgrown compound and a rusting old water treatment works, villagers are now beginning to hope that things could change dramatically over the next few months.\nAll being well, they heard on Tuesday, a \u0026pound2.3 million upgrade by Scottish Water could get under way in the new year which would leave the village with a new treatment works by this time next year.\n\"There\u0027s a long way to go,\" said the north\u0027s corporate affairs manager Gavin Steel when the Strathy met with an SW team in the village hall, \"but we\u0027re hopeful that all the many stages will be gone through on schedule.\n\"We are having to consult with a lot of different individuals and organisations \u0026ndash not least the national park authority, the Highland Council, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and landowners \u0026ndash but this is work which will have to be done on behalf of the community.\n\"Quite simply the current system has reached its sell-by date.

There is certainly great excitement surrounding them and anticipation is high amongst both band and audience.\n“The Stirling concerts will be celebrations of our long musical journey, albeit tinged with the realisation that these are farewell appearances and so naturally emotions will be high – this is something we experienced recently at the farewell concerts in England and Europe – all spectacular events but nevertheless very moving.\n“We’ve been overwhelmed by the response to the announcement of the Stirling concerts – all the positive comments, the stories about what our music has meant to so many people, the sadness as the end approaches. But overall there will be a huge amount of love and positivity at Stirling and that’s what will carry everyone through these days ahead.\u0026#8221\nJones has been with Runrig all his adult life, having first joined the band on stage as a 17-year old at a dance in Portree’s Skye Gathering Hall in late 1977. He hopes the set list – which will be lengthy – will give a full reflection of the groups’s journey from a three -piece Scottish dance band playing island village halls to one which has sold out major venues across Scotland and Europe.\nHe said: “Compiling a set list is always a dilemma, with such a large back catalogue to choose from. Of course, there are certain songs that have to be included, otherwise we’d be lynched – but it’s also nice to pick some lesser-performed songs, possibly giving them a fresh twist.\n“Our set will be a good bit longer than usual – the problem was trying to keep the length down to sensible proportions – in essence, it will hopefully represent the band’s whole career, a celebration of our music and the unique bond with our audience.”\n century – the history of their native communities has shaped Runrig’s lyrics and songs. Jones believes that staying true to their roots – fusing them with the popular rock and pop influences they listened to in their teenage bedrooms \u0026#8211 has made sure the band’s popularity has endured through the generations.\n“We’ve been fortunate that throughout our long career we’ve continually gained new fans of all ages, at home and abroad, which has sustained us, even as fashions come and go around us,” he adds. “I guess there must be something in the lyrics, the melodies and the ethos of the band that has attracted such loyalty amongst fans, something universal that transcends our shared background in the heartland of the Highlands and connects with the wider world.”\nAuthenticity has been the hallmark of a band which can essentially still trace its origins to the three Portree streets of Fraser Crescent, Kitson Crescent, and Balmoral Road.\nThe original Run-rig dance band was founded by the Skye-raised sons of North Uist Calum and Rory MacDonald, along with Blair Douglas in 1973, and a year later the trio were joined by Donnie Munro, who became the band’s singer for more than two decades. Munro, who left in 1997 and was replaced by Canadian singer Bruce Guthro, will be on stage as a special guest this weekend.\n\nJones’ hopes for a legacy of music that people can continue to enjoy, and be inspired by, seem assured.\nHe adds: “Even though the band’s touring and performing life will have finished, I hope that people will continue to enjoy and discover our music for many years to come, perhaps giving inspiration to musicians that will follow on from us, in the knowledge that if you stick to your own path, be true to your musical roots and retain an open mind, great things may happen.”\nAs for the future – the band say it might be the end for Runrig, but it won’t mean retirement or the end of their music-making careers.\nSaid Jones: “The first thing to say is that there will be a long wind-down period – for instance we’ll film and record Stirling, so that will have to be worked on and brought to some sort of completion, plus there is the whole ongoing administration of the band archive and legacy which may lead to some interesting sideline projects.\n“Beyond that, we’ll all still be involved with our own individual performing, writing and music-making projects – that’s something you never retire from.\n“Personally, I’ll miss the band dreadfully but on the positive side I’ll spend more time on Skye plus I’ll have time to learn some new accordion tunes!”\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/visitor-web.jpg","title":"oidhche mhath runrig whfp editorial 24 8","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n night spoke for the Highlands.\nThe unassuming Malcolm has often been a coolly detached figure on stage, concentrating solely on his guitar.\nBut he has been playing with the Run Rig Dance and Ceilidh Band since he was 17 years old and he is now in his 60th year.

Arising out of the local experience of sectarian discrimination, the march helped to set in train a series of events that would change Irish politics forever.\nNationalists in the Six Counties had begun to explore new ways of highlighting the reality of discrimination. They had looked to Governments in Dublin for decades but found little help there. The IRA’s Resistance Campaign had ended in 1962, having failed heroically against the overwhelming military superiority of the British Army and RUC. However, the imposition of internment without trial, the banning of Sinn Féin and the use of the B Specials as a rural terror force, all exposed the violence that lay beneath the surface of the Orange state. \n which read: ‘Protestant girl required for housework. Apply to the Hon. Mrs. Terence O’Neill...’\n\nFive years after O’Neill’s accession nothing had changed. Unemployment and emigration among Catholics was far higher than among their Protestant neighbours. In County Tyrone, with a population of just over 73,000 Catholics to 60,500 Protestants, there were only 52 Catholics employed in local government as against 300 Protestants. Such discrimination was highlighted by the Campaign for Social Justice established by Patricia and Conn McCluskey in Dungannon in 1964. \nParallel with these developments, the IRA and Sinn Féin were rethinking their strategy with more emphasis to be placed on open campaigning against injustice in the North. The Wolfe Tone Society was established as a forum for debate and to circumvent the Stormont ban on the Republican Clubs, the name which, in turn, had been adopted to evade the ban on Sinn Féin. Members of the Wolfe Tone Society, the Campaign for Social Justice and others were involved in the formation of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association  in February 1967.\nIt was direct action on the ground that propelled the nascent Civil Rights Movement onto the streets. The Brantry Republican Club in County Tyrone had campaigned for council housing to be built but when 15 houses were built in Caledon only one of them was allocated to a Catholic. The house next door was allocated to a single Protestant woman, the secretary of a unionist politician. \nLocal people decided to protest. The main organiser was Annie Mary  Gildernew, grandmother of Sinn Féin\u0027s Michelle Gildernew. Over a period of several months in 1967/68 a local family and supporters occupied a house in the Caledon estate. When they were evicted the case was raised in Stormont and began to make headlines beyond Tyrone. This was the spur for the march from Coalisland to Dungannon which received the endorsement of NICRA. \n\n\nIn a pattern that was to become all too familiar in the months ahead, Ian Paisley organised a counter-demonstration for Market Square in Dungannon. This was then used as a pretext by the RUC to ban the NICRA parade from the Square. \nAbout 2,500 took part in the NICRA march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon. The main speaker was Austin Currie MP, later a Fine Gael TD. Also speaking was Gerry Fitt, West Belfast MP. Fitt who, years later, was lifted into the House of Lords by Margaret Thatcher, declared that they would go on until they had “Civil Rights and a 32-County Republic”.\nBut the real leaders of the Civil Rights Movement which began that day were the rank and file, the ordinary people of Tyrone and beyond who marched for justice and freedom. \nThe first Civil Rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon was held on 24 August 1968, 50 years ago this week.\n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27459  ","story":"Sinn Féin spokesperson for Business, Innovation and Enterprise Maurice Quinlivan TD\n Callum Smyth\n\n“The government is currently missing its own targets when it comes to reforming the apprenticeship system.

We want to build on the success of the traditionalcraft trades in Ireland such as plumbing, bricklaying and plastering, andexpand this way of learning, into a host of new fields.\n“Apprenticeships in fields such as green energy, retail, hospitality andfinancial services are hugely popular in other European countries. We aim toexpand the system into these areas to create different opportunities for allyoung people including more females and people with disabilities.”\n Currently,most apprenticeships are aimed towards male participants with just 160 out of13,589 people in apprenticeship programmes across the state being female in2018. In addition, the physically demanding nature of the current availableapprenticeships has resulted in just 1.7% of total apprentices in 2016 beingpeople with disabilities.\n\nSinnFéin aims to increase investment in apprenticeships to over €350 million perannum within five years. \nTheLimerick City TD, Deputy Quinlivan has said that this will “fund the treblingof the number apprenticeship programmes and provide places for 60,000apprentices”.\nDeputy Quinlivan continued: “€5,166,000 of investment will be required overfive years for the development of 63 new apprenticeship programmes, bringingthe total number of craft and new courses to 100.\n“Ireland’sallocation from the EU for training and education of the young is €68 million.Fine Gael was forced to return €19.8 million of this allocation in 2016, asthey failed to submit a payment application.\n“SinnFéin will ensure all EU monies allocated to Ireland would be fully utilised, tobenefit the education and training of our young people.

The Vatican must release any and all files it holds that would help investigations and inquiries into abuse by priests and religious in Ireland and it must also commit itself to providing redress, including financial redress to victims of abuse north and south,\" he said. \n\ntest\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27464  ","story":" Caolán McGinley\n\nThe first civil rights march was a major cornerstone in Irish history, the people of the north stood up and said no more will we be treated as second class citizens, shaping politics on the island of Ireland for decades.\nToday, 24th August, marks the 50th anniversary of the first Civil Rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon in County Tyrone. \nThe Brantry Republican Club, led by Annie Mary Gildernew, had campaigned against the lack of council housing in the area. \n spoke exclusively to Colm Gildernew, Sinn Féin MLA for Fermanagh and South Tyrone and grandson of Annie Mary or better known as ‘Nana’ Gildernew, about the first civil rights march and events leading to it.\n“Fifty years ago, on the 12th of October 1967, Dungannon District Council convened its monthly meeting.  \n“One of the decisions they were about to take would reverberate across decades and bring the northern Unionist state to its knees and, some argue, ultimately led to its demise as a one party Orange state.\n“The Brantry Sinn Fein Republican Club, under the leadership of Annie Mary Gildernew  had been trying to secure housing in the local area for nationalist families. \n“Dungannon Council refused point blank to build social housing in the Brantry area as this would also provide local nationalists with votes as well as housing.  \nInstead they agreed to build 15 houses in the then predominantly unionist village of Caledon and stated they would allocate these homes on the basis of half to unionists and half to nationalist families to ease the housing crisis.\n“At the council meeting this deal was reneged upon Unionist Councillor William Scott simply presented a list of 15 names which he had decided would be housed, no debate, no discussion, no democracy.\n“The Brantry Republican Club met immediately to assess their next move.  It was decided that they were left with no alternative but to take immediate and direct action.  \n“At 2am, on Friday the 13th of October members of the Gildernew, Goodfellow and McKenna families supported by the Brantry Republican club went to Caledon and took possession of two of the newly allocated homes,  including a three bedroom house which had been allocated to a single 19-year-old woman who worked for a Unionist election candidate.  \n“In May 1968, following a 6 month series of court action and coercion, the State’s patience gave way a force of policemen, led by the brother of the young single girl who had been allocated the house, evicted Nana Gildernew, her daughter Mary Theresa Goodfellow with a three-month old baby and two other small children, and her daughter in law Geraldine Gildernew, expecting me at the time and with two young children.  They were forcibly dragged from the house under the gaze of the world’s press. \n“This led to the organisation of the first Civil Rights March from Coalisland to Dungannon was 24th of August to protest the eviction. The march was blocked by the RUC at Thomas Street from entering Dungannon’s Market Square, subsequently leading to the second Civil Rights march in Derry’s Duke Street on 5th October 1968.\n\"The first civil rights march was a major cornerstone in Irish history, the people of the north stood up and said no more will we be treated as second class citizens, shaping politics on the island of Ireland for decades,\" he said.\nOver 2,500 took part in the first civil rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon.\nThis would evidently change politics here forever - this was very much a campaign organised by people, from all backgrounds and none. \nProminent republicans were also central to the organisation of demonstrations, including the now Mid Ulster MP, Francie Molloy and the late Stan Corrigan.\nReflecting on the first civil rights march, 50 years on, Colm Gildernew said the first civil rights march should act as a rallying cry to those of us who seek to promote rights, equality and respect for all in society today.\n\"We are currently experiencing an unacceptable blockade on a swathe of rights-based issues by the DUP, including Irish language, marriage equality, women’s health, and legacy rights.  \n\"There are huge concerns arising from Brexit and the recent Boundary Commission proposals, seen by many as a new attempt to gerrymander the north. This could have a chilling impact on rights and representation in the six counties,\" he concluded.\n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8615705.1535445232!/image/image.jpg","title":"cullybackey college students celebrate great success in gcses","story":"\nStudents at Cullybackey College have received their long awaited GCSE results.   \n\n                \nFor the Year 12 students, these results represent the culmination of five years of hard work and dedication often involving modular examinations and Controlled Assessment pieces.   \n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nCullybackey College student Kyle McGrath and his mum.\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nOver 63% of students were able to secure at least a grade C in their subject entries.  \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nMr David Donaldson, the College Principal was keen to highlight the many individual successes within Year 12: “At Cullybackey College our primary aim is to create opportunities for our students to succeed and that has been clearly evident today.  \n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n“I am delighted to congratulate them for achieving results that reflect their hard work in conjunction with the professional support of our dedicated staff.  \n\n“In particular, I would like to say well done to Annie Millar, Lucia Bernatova and Chloe McGregor for achieving a superb set of results.” \n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nCullybackey College student Erin Crawford and mum.\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\nAnnie achieved four A*s and six As whilst Lucia managed to get two A*s, six As and one B Chloe McGregor was awarded four As, four Bs and twoCs.   \n\nSome other great performances of note included: Jade Higgins Aaron McPeake Erin Crawford Jordyn Moore Jack Weir Chloe Brown.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nMr Tim Manson, Vice Principal, added: ““It is pleasing to note that our three-year average for GCSE passes at C or above has risen to 69% this year.  \n\n“This shows the consistently high performance that our students are achieving over a wide range of subjects.” \n\nA large percentage of pupils will be returning to embark upon A Level studies and the College would also like to formally wish those leaving all the very best in the future career paths they choose to follow.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n    try   catch     \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8616533.1535465707!/image/image.jpg","title":"dup man to step down from council role","story":"\nAn elected member on Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council has announced he is to resign from political life next month.\n\n                \nCllr Nigel Kells took the decision to step down from the local authority following changes in his personal life.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nCllr Kells was elected to represent the Antrim DEA in 2014.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nSpeaking to the Newtownabbey Times, Mr Kells said: “I am stepping down because I cannot commit my future to Antrim town and I feel that someone in elected office should be giving 100 per cent of their commitment to the constituents who have elected them. \n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n“I have always tried to do the right thing during my time in elected politics and repay the faith of those who elected me by representing them with all my ability. \n\n“Due to changes in my personal life, I believe the right thing at this point is to allow one of my DUP colleagues the opportunity to establish themselves in the area before the elections next year.”\n\nHe added: “Antrim and it’s people will always hold a special part in my heart and I hope the work to explore Antrim’s unlocked potential continues in my absence. \n\n“I will be remaining a member and supporter of the DUP and I wish all our candidates well in the upcoming elections next year.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nCommenting on social media, Nigel said: “I will remain your representative, contactable in the usual ways until the end of September.\n\n“My resignation triggers a selection process within the party.

Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit. It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying:

by-election opens this Wednesday at three venues across North Antrim, including the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney.\nAccording to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland  75,478 North Antrim voters are entitled to sign the Petition in respect of Mr Paisley, recently suspended from the House of Commons, with 10% of those or 7,547 signatures needed to force a by-election.\nUUP Leader Robin Swann and Dunloy Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan have both expressed disappointment at the EONI decision to open only three centres with limited opening hours, instead of a possible 10.\n\n\nINADEQUATE\n\n\nBoth MLA\u0027s as well as TUV leader Jim Allister have said will be signing the petition.\nExpressing disappointment, Mr Swann said three petition centres was totally inadequate for a constituency the size of North Antrim, and by restricting the opening hours, the EONI has shown little regard to people in daytime employment,\n\nSUBVERTED\n\n\nMr McGuigan agreed that the EONI decision on venues was extremely disappointing, and simply not good enough.\nHe continued that people\u0027s ability to reject the disgraceful behaviour of Ian Paisley was greatly reduced by this decision after he had accepted lavish family holidays from the Sri Lankan government and lobbyied against a UN resolution about\u0026#160 human rights abuses by the Sri Lankan authorities.\nHe said the UUP would not register as campaigner during the recall petition, but would encourage any North Antrim electors who think what Ian Paisley did was wrong to sign the petition\n

The Skoda man felt the format incurred unnecessary expense in terms of fuel costs.\n\u0026#8220The fuel isn\u0027t cheap and the cars run on it whether you are driving a stage or the road sections, said Bogie.

authority offers assurance about future of school crossing patrols","story":"\nThe Education Authority  has given an assurance that school crossing patrols will be in operation when children across Northern Ireland return to school in the coming days.\n\n                \nA spokesperson for the EA offered the assurance in response to media coverage revealing that the authority had considered removing “lollipop men and women” in a bid to save money.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nA letter obtained by BBC News NI revealed that the EA faces an estimated funding gap of £58 million in 2018/19.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIt highlights a number of “difficult choices” the authority is faced with in order to cut costs, including the possible removal of school crossing patrols, withdrawing uniform allowances and making compulsory redundancies in schools.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nAccording to the BBC, EA board members regarded the possibility of scrapping school crossing patrols – and other potentially controversial savings measures – as “unpalatable” and decided that any decision to make such cuts should be down to the Department of Education.\n\nThe letter also suggests that “traffic control measures” are not the EA’s responsibility, but that of the Department for Infrastructure and the police.\n\nReacting to media reports about the future of school crossing patrols, a spokesman for the EA said: “The Education Authority does not intend to make any changes to the current arrangements for school crossing patrols in the current financial year.”\n\nManned crossings are seen as a vital for the safety of children crossing busy roads, and the DUP’s education spokesman said any move to remove lollipop men and women would be “unacceptable.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“While undoubtedly the Education Authority and the department have to explore every option to live within budget, this idea cannot be regarded as a serious suggestion and it is clear that the members of the Education Authority would reject any attempt to propose it,” said Peter Weir MLA.\n\n“The safety of our children must be paramount, and there is no need to remove the current process for assessing individual placements of lollipop people provision.”\n\nThe Strangford MLA continued: “This bizarre suggestion does however highlight two key issues. Firstly, the extent to which education is effectively subsidising other elements of government particularly on road safety and transport and there needs to be a debate about where financial responsibility is borne. \n\n“Secondly, it further shines a light on the heavy pressures facing education in Northern Ireland, and the need for strategic changes and reform which need commitment on an Executive-wide basis, which again highlights the damage being done by a single party putting their narrow interests ahead of proper decision making and the restoration of government.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8615613.1535442232!/image/image.jpg","title":"fundraising abseil in aid of action ms","story":"\nA fundraising abseil was recently organised by the staff at Thompson House Hospital in aid of Action MS.\n\n                \nA team  including neurologist Dr Stella Hughes, Nurse Sarah McCallan and administrator Laura Fisher scaled the dizzy heights of the Europa Hotel.

The results are amazing and they have clearly drawn inspiration from a iety of sources.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n“I would like to congratulate all our finalists, Andrew Moore, James Magennis and Charles Leathem, who have each taken some of our iconic packaging and transformed it into a catwalk sensation, showcasing the raw talent of some of our stars of the future.”\n\nClaire Concannon, course co-ordinator from Belfast politan College, added: “Working with crisp packaging has been a very valuable learning experience for our ingenious students who have more than risen to the challenge. The judges had an almost impossible decision narrowing the entries down to just three finalists who all showed technical ability combined with creative flair and imagination. The finalists were then featured on the Tayto Northern Ireland facebook page with more than 2000 people voting for their favourite.\n\n“All three finalists should be very proud of what they have achieved and they have certainly made a lasting impact on the catwalk and attracted huge interest from those attending – it’s hard to believe that these are made from material more commonly seen on the production lines at Tayto Castle.\n\n“We would like to thank everyone who took the time to vote and for the many shares which helped to bring our students’ work to a wide audience.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nTayto crisps have been made at Tayto Castle, Co Armagh, since 1956 when Thomas Hutchinson spotted a gap in the market to make tasty potato snacks.

when Michael Bradley cracked home an early goal and while Kevin Barry McShane responded in kind for The Town, a Conor Johnston goal from a penalty gave the Whiterock side a 2-11 to 1-10 half-time lead.\nIt was plain sailing for the hosts in the second period with Johnston and Mícéal Dudley clipping over the scores and while Dermott McShane goaled for Ballycastle, this tie has long been settled.\nSt John’s will enter Group Two where the first game took place on Saturday lunchtime with Loughgiel romping to a 6-22 to 0-7 win over a badley depleted Rossa.\nShamrocks had this game decided by the break with Tiernan Coyle scrambling home their first goal on 13 minutes, while team captain, Shay Casey bagged two more before the interval to establish a 3-12 to 0-3 lead – Rossa’s scores coming from Stephen Beatty and Tiernan Murphy .\nThere was no let-up from Loughgiel in the second half as they emptied their bench.\nSian McGrath lobbed Danny Murray for goal number four on 51 minutes, while Dan McCloskey found the net twice more in the closing stages to complete the rout.\nIn Group One on Saturday evening, defending champions, Dunloy travelled to Cushendall and edged home by a point, 0-18 to 0-17.\n\nIntermediate Hurling Championship\nIn the Intermediate Hurling Championship, St Gall’s withstood three red cards to overcome Gort na Móna 4-10 to 2-11 on Sunday afternoon.\nMark Napier and Tomás O Cíarán hit first-half goals for St Gall’s before Conor Burke saw red, while Dessie McClean kept the Gorts in touch with a goal from a free to leave it 2-7 to 1-4 at the half.\nCJ McGourty and Jackson McGreevy plundered a further two St Gall’s goals early in the second half, but McGreevy and then Napier were both send off to leave them with a major disadvantage,\nHowever, Gort na Móna couldn’t take advantage with Darren Boyd’s goal with 10 to play ultimately proving mere consolation.\nEarlier in the day at Creggan, a badly depleted Lámh Dhearg were on the receiving end of a 3-21 o 0-1 defeat to Glenariffe.\nJohn Boyd hit the Red Hands’ only point of the game in the first half, but Glenariffe registered 2-11 in the opening period – Alex

second, while Cathal McMeel stroked home a penalty as Éire Óg crashed out.\nAt Woodlands, Pearse’s overcame newcomers, Laochra Loch Lao 3-18 to 1-3.\nThe North Belfast men asserted themselves from the

What the Secretary of State has done is take steps where it has been needed to provide that political direction and stability and certainty.\"\n\nAmong those who met with Mr Brokenshire was SDLP leader Colum Eastwood.\n\nHe described yesterday as \"another positive step towards a City Deal\".\n\nMr Eastwood said: \"The united voice and vision behind the tireless advocacy for the deal is extremely encouraging and the SDLP will continue to work with all parties from across the political and civic spectrum to ensure that the deal is secured.\n\n\"Historically, the north west has been a victim of underinvestment and economic inactivity. \n\n\"The delivery of a City Deal will be transformational for Derry and therefore it is important that we keep up the momentum to securing this deal.\"\n\nMr Brokenshire said he was \"very firmly\" in support of a City Deal for Derry. \n\nHe added: \"I absolutely recognise the way in which investment here in the north west could transform the city.\n\n\"I do want to see a City Deal coming to fruition because of the difference it can make to the lives of so many people and why this has been important for me to hear about progress, to hear about other issues we can support and getting that momentum and turning it into a reality.\"\n\nFoyle Sinn Fein MP Elisha McCallion said the delivery of a City Deal must have the necessary economic benefits that meet the needs of the region. \n"},{"url":null,"title":"cool response as alliance bids to kickstart fresh political talks","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

He claimed the DUP had not been in contact with Sinn Fein for weeks, and engagement prior to that over the summer had been minimal.\n\nIt has consistently maintained that the DUP\u0027s blocking of \"rights-based\" issues - such as protections for Irish language speakers, the introduction of same-sex marriage and the release of additional funds for historic inquests on killings carried out by the security forces - were the major stumbling blocks to resolution.\n\n\"Those rights issues will continue to have to be addressed, they are still here, they are still part of the reason why this institution collapsed, they are going to have to be addressed,\" said the Newry and Armagh MLA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublic take part in the ‘We Deserve Better’ rally in Derry\n\n\n\n\nMrs Long said the DUP\u0027s pointing of the finger of blame at Sinn Fein would not deter her from going ahead with the meeting, which is planned for next Monday.\n\n\"Despite the DUP\u0027s attempts to play down my invitation, and to look to put blame elsewhere, that party must accept the role it has played and continues to play in holding Northern Ireland to a standstill,\" she said.\n\n\"I hope to see Arlene Foster next Monday, allowing the DUP to prove through actions that they are dedicated to securing Northern Ireland\u0027s future and not just cheap political stunts.\"\n\nGreen leader Steven Agnew\u0027s attendance was confirmed last night by his party, although the UUP\u0027s Robin Swann cast doubts over the prospect of the meeting taking place.\n\n\"The UUP has been engaging with other parties for the last 18 months,\" he said.\n\n\"We are happy to meet other parties but we need all parties round the table and it is my understanding that Sinn Fein have already said they are not available next Monday or Tuesday.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople in Portadown braving the rain to demonstrate last night\n\n\n\n\nThe SDLP was also asked if its leader Colum Eastwood had accepted the invite, but a response was not received.\n\nMrs Long made it clear that all of the parties were culpable.\n\n\"Ultimately, finding agreement lies primarily with local parties,\" she said.\n\n\"While there are still key issues which divide the parties, I hope the desire to better serve those who elected us represents a point of agreement on which we can start to build.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"exclusion

To complete Level Two, he also needed two years, which would have meant exceeding by one year the departmental guidelines for funding.\n\nWhen Adam\u0027s circumstances were explained to the Department by the college, they were told: \"Unfortunately, an exception cannot be made there are no extensions given.\" \n\nAdam eventually completed the course successfully, but lost out on ious benefits.\n\nAdam, who won a gold medal for badminton at the Special Olympics Ireland National Games in June, works for Eurospar NI. \n\nHe said when the funding was refused for Level Two, Adam said he was very upset, \"It seemed very unfair to me.\" \n\nThanks to financial support from his family, Adam was able to finish the course. \"I need a job and my independence. I hope any other student will be encouraged to know they can challenge something they think is unfair,\" Adam said.\n\nDr Michael Wardlow, chief commissioner of the Equality Commission, said: \"Under the Disability Discrimination Act, any provider of services has a duty to make adjustments where their practices, policies or procedures make it impossible or unreasonably difficult for a disabled person to access services.\n\n\"Adam had the time for his first course extended by one year, and his request for a similar extension to the second course was entirely reasonable. \n\n\"The refusal by the Department to make an adjustment to the funding arrangements left Adam with less funding and support.\"\n\nThe Equality Commission said the Department and SERC have since affirmed their commitment to equality of access to goods, facilities and services and affirmed they will ensure their policies, practices and procedures conform to all relevant equality legislation.\n\nThey have also undertaken to liaise with the Equality Commission to review the Skills to Succeed/Training for Success programmes.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic alerts delays in belfast centre after primark blaze","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Residents and businesses in the city cenre were advised to keep their windows and doors closed as a precautionary measure.\n\nThe fire started on the fifth floor of the building, which has been undergoing refurbishment work.\n\nA Primark spokesperson said the shop was safely evacuated this morning \u0027following a fire on the roof\u0027.\n\nHundreds of people gathered to watch firefighters tackle the blaze.\n\nPolice are also at the scene and have cordoned the area off. They have advised motorists to avoid the Castle Street area.\n\nDiversions are currently in place at Bridge Street and High Street, Castle Street and Queens Street and Royal Avenue and North Street to allow Northern Ireland Fire \u0026 Rescue Service to deal with the incident.\n\nCastlecourt and a number of other local businesses have closed due to the fire.\n\nDrivers parked in Castlecourt car park can still access their cars via the car park entrance.\n\nCaitlin Hunter  was in the ground floor when the alarm was raised.\n\n“I was just on the ground flooring all of a sudden I could smell smoke. People started walking out quickly and I followed the crowd.\n\n“Before I knew it there was smoke everywhere and flames, even though it seemed to start off very small.\n\n“The mood was very confused in the shop, everyone could smell the smoke but nobody could tell what was going on.”\n\nShe added: “It’s a shock and a very scary moment.”\n\nWithin minutes the entire building was emptied and the flames tore through the top floor.\n\nBelfast City Councillor Jim Rodgers said he had been told tar was being laid on the roof of the building shortly before the fire started.\n\nA number of loud bangs were heard on the street below, believed to be gas cannisters.\n\n“Inquiries are still at a very early stage but I’ve been told by a number of people that the fire started on the roof, seemingly it was tar being put down on the roof as part of the refurbishment of the building.\n\n“It’s been worked on for so long and within minutes it’s disappeared into an absolute inferno.\n\n“I’ve got to praise the fire and rescue service, there’s a large number of them here and they’ve done a brilliant job in bringing the fire under control.”\n\nSinn Fein Mayor of Belfast Deirdre Hargey has urged members of the public to keep a safe distance from the site.\n\n“I would also ask the public to avoid the Castle Street and Royal Avenue avoided whilst the incident is ongoing,\" she said.\n\n“Emergency services at the scene and responding.

We could smell smoke but it was a shock, a scary moment,\" she said. \"It was a rush as well as there were very few ways out as there was still building work being done.\n\n\"There was a lot of people on the ground floor so we did all feel like sardines.\"\n\nShe added: \"You\u0027re in doing your usual nosy around and all of a sudden you come out and see this. \n\n\"It makes you wary of what can happen so quickly.\"\n\nA huge emergency response was already underway by 11.30am, with 14 fire appliances and 80 firefighters initially tackling the growing blaze.\n\nHundreds of shoppers stood, watching in disbelief and shock, while some filmed the unfolding drama on their phones.\n\nOver the next hour, the building\u0027s rooftop collapsed inwards, with smoke and the skyline behind becoming visible through the broken face of the landmark structure\u0027s rooftop clock.\n\nLoud bangs were heard frequently from inside the building, thought to have been caused by exploding gas canisters.\n\nConcerned for public safety, police began urgently moving crowds further away from the danger, extending the cordon already set up around the building.\n\nBy 1pm it appeared the severity of the fire had lessened but the true extent of the damage was yet to emerge. \n\nMore explosions were heard as the blaze spread rapidly to the lower floors and consumed the entire building.\n\nPrimark workers who were evacuated earlier stood among the crowds, watching, a number of them understandably upset and too shocked to speak.\n\nOne man who was in the building at the time said: \"The fire alarm went off and everyone got out safe and sound. \n\n\"I got out to the safety point and was as shocked as everyone else to see the smoke.\"\n\nAimee McKee  had been on her way to start her shift in Primark when she was confronted with the scene of devastation.\n\n\"I just think it\u0027s heartbreaking, especially with all the new work that has gone into the building, it was nearly finished and that\u0027s put us back to square one again.\n\n\"I think everyone is concerned for their job, but the main thing is that everyone\u0027s out safe and no one\u0027s injured today,\" she said.\n\n\"I heard about it before I even got there but it\u0027s just shocking to see it in person.\"\n\nBy 4pm, emergency services remained on high alert with one senior police officer fearing that the entire structure would collapse.\n\nLast night, the Belfast Buildings Trust  called for action to be taken to ensure the building can be saved.\n\nShane Quinn, development manager at BBT, paid tribute to the efforts of the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service to save the building and to ensure the safety of staff and shoppers. \n\nHe said: \"In reality, the full extent of the damage will take time to assess. Rebuilding will require creativity and hard effort, and we hope that the city and the building\u0027s owners will make every effort possible to make sure that the Bank Buildings once again brings life to the city\u0027s heart.\" \n"},{"url":null,"title":"arlene foster it was my decision not to send anyone from dup to papal visit","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

This must be matched by creating an inclusive, diverse and equal Ireland for all, where diversity is not just accepted, but celebrated.”\n\nPotential candidates require the support of four local authorities or the backing of 20 TDs or Senators to gain a nomination.\n\nMr Gallagher said he would be seeking a nomination as an independent candidate from four local authorities.\n\nIn a video released by his team, the presidential hopeful said he was “heartened” by the fact that motions to nominate him as a candidate had been formally submitted in ten local authorities since the presidential election order was announced on Tuesday.\n\n“If I am honoured to be nominated as a candidate I will set out a clear and compelling vision for the people of Ireland to assess in the context of an engaging and energetic presidential election campaign,” he said.\n\nMr Higgins confirmed earlier this year that he will be running for a second term.\n\nOthers hoping to get on the ballot include Dragons’ Den star Gavin Duffy, Pieta House suicide prevention charity founder and Senator Joan Freeman, journalist Gemma O’Doherty and artist Kevin Sharkey.\n\nSinn Fein said it will also put forward a candidate, but is not expected to reveal their identity for a number of weeks.\n\nPresidential hopefuls have until September 26 to gain a nomination.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"flying banker clocks up 11000 flights over","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

This is the first ever photograph of a member of the royal family wearing their wedding dress, from her marriage to Queen Victoria’s son Edward Albert in 1863.\n\nWhybro describes it as “an opulent and highly detailed dress, with an off-the-shoulder neckline and large floral motifs that dominated the design”. Adorned with decorative lace depicting Scottish thistles, Irish shamrocks and English roses, plus a 21ft train that took eight women to carry, it was a particularly over-the-top gown.\n\n\nElizabeth Bowes-Lyon, April 26, 1923\n\n\nLong before becoming the Queen Mother, Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon married the Duke of York  in a style that was classic for her 1920s wedding. Whybro contrasts her gown to Princess Alexandra’s, saying: “Her dress had a much straighter skirt, created from deep ivory chiffon, moving away from stark white and embroidered with pearls. The gown is very Twenties in design, featuring short cap sleeves with strips of Brussels lace, making it contemporary yet elegant.” It was a simple affair, heavily influenced by Coco Chanel.\n\n\nPrincess Elizabeth, November 20, 1947\n\n\nThe current Queen got married during a time of austerity, as the country was still recovering from the Second World War. Elizabeth used ration stamps to buy the fabric , and it was designed by Norman Hartnell. Whybro says: “Queen Elizabeth’s wedding dress incorporates elements of Princess Alexandra’s design, with embroidered floral motifs over the bodice and skirt, and long sleeves. In contrast to her mother’s dress, the Queen’s gown had a fit-and-flare silhouette, was created from ivory silk and embellished with crystals and pearls.”\n\nElizabeth’s diamond tiara snapped hours before she was due to leave for the ceremony at Westminster Abbey. Luckily, a court jeweller was on standby, and they took the tiara via police escort for some emergency welding before returning it to the bride. If you’re eagle-eyed, you can spot a slight gap at the centre of the headpiece.\n\n\nPrincess Margaret, May 6, 1960\n\n\nPrincess Margaret’s dress for her wedding to Lord Snowdon is often described as the simplest royal wedding gown in recent history. Whybro says: “Princess Margaret’s dress was in stark contrast to her younger sister’s, with the emphasis being on exquisite tailoring and beautiful fabrics. The gown was made from silk organza and featured much less detailing.” Although simple, the dress still had a full skirt and was designed to show off the bride’s petite frame.\n\n\nPrincess Anne, November 14, 1973\n\n\nPrincess Anne married Mark Phillips in Westminster Abbey, with an estimated global audience of 500 million watching. “Princess Anne’s 1973 wedding dress could not be more of the era, in terms of style and silhouette,” says Whybro. “A Tudor-style high neck dress with medieval sleeves, this remarkably modern gown was sophisticated, simple and contemporary, while featuring detailing embroidery far removed from that seen on Princess Elizabeth’s gown.”\n\n\nPrincess Diana, July 29, 1981\n\n\nFor most people, chances are the words ‘royal wedding’ conjure the wedding of the century – when Lady Diana Spencer married the Prince of Wales. It’s thought a whopping one billion tuned in worldwide to witness the fairy-tale event, and Whybro says: “Probably one of the most iconic wedding dresses of modern history, Princess Diana’s extravagant ballgown-style dress featured ivory silk taffeta and antique lace, with an opulent 25ft train.”\n\nThe gown, she adds, “set wedding dress trends for years to come, with its large puffed sleeves, narrow waist \u0026 meringue style skirt”. But having such a dramatic dress did come with its share of problems – too big for her glass carriage, Diana arrived at the ceremony slightly creased.\n\n\nSarah Ferguson, July 23, 1986\n\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nSarah Ferguson, Duchess of York, in her wedding gown \n\n\n\n\nSarah Ferguson had the unenviable position of following Diana’s wedding just five years later. “Sarah Ferguson’s dress was always going to be compared to Diana’s, and was understandably much less elaborate,” says Whybro. “The gown was an ivory satin bodice with heavy beading, retaining some of the Eighties elements of Diana’s dress in its puff sleeves, yet cut to a three-quarter length.” Sure, not as elaborate as Diana’s, but it still had a 17ft train.\n\n\nSophie Rhys-Jones, June 19, 1999\n\n\nSophie Rhys-Jones’ dress was a much simpler affair, when she married Prince Edward. However, Whybro says it echoes another royal gown from the past – Princess Margaret’s. “Created from hand-dyed ivory silk organza and crepe, the dress featured minimal pearl and crystal beading around the neck and sleeves, with far less of a full skirt than previous royal gowns,” she observes. “Rhys-Jones’ gown had a more modern feel, with simple lines.”\n\n\nCamilla Parker-Bowles, April 9, 2005\n\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nThe Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall leave their wedding ceremony \n\n\n\n\nCamilla Parker-Bowles was in a unique position when marrying Prince Charles, as this was a second marriage for both of them. As such, instead of wearing a white or ivory gown, Camilla opted for a more understated cream chiffon dress with an oyster coat. “Keeping detailing to the minimum, this contemporary outfit followed the tradition of not wearing ivory or white for a second wedding and instead featured modern styling, including a cream coloured straw hat.”\n\n\nKate Middleton, April 29, 2011\n\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nPrince William and his bride Kate leave Westminster Abbey in London, following their wedding service \n\n\n\n\nAs with Meghan, there were months of speculation as to who would design Kate’s gown, in the run-up to her and Prince William’s wedding day. In the end, the honour went to designer Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen, who created an ivory dress with a classic silhouette, covered in delicate lace. Whybro says: “Changing wedding dress fashion for decades to come, in the same way Diana did, Kate’s McQueen creation was a combination of tradition and modernity, with a classic shape evoking that of Victorian styling with its narrow waist and hip padding, long lace sleeves and a semi-bustle at the back.

nothing out of this world, according to Network Rail. \n\nThe light was caused by a laser used by Network Rail to make sure that workers don’t enter a particular zone during railway works.\n\nThe high

I look forward to talking with you soon.\n— Be A King  \nAugust 28, 2018\n\n\n\n\nTuesday was the 55th anniversary of the March on Washington and Dr King’s “I Have a Dream” speech.\n\nThe sketch from comedian Rip Michaels’ new series Off The Rip portrays pettiness between Coretta Scott King and Malcolm X’s wife, Betty Shabazz – and ends with a joke about Dr King sleeping with “The Iggy Azalea of the Civil Rights Movement”.\n\nBut Bernice King later thanked Cardi B on Twitter for reaching out and apologising, and said she looked forward to talking with her.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"appreciated im not 100 per cent sure hopefully derry city chairman philip odoherty speaks recent criticism magee university","story":"\nBy Gary Ferry\n\n[email\u0026#160protected]\n\n\nHE provides almost a thousand jobs locally and has saved Derry City Football Club on two occasions, but for some, Philip O’Doherty is still not exempt from criticism.\n\nRecent reports to Derry City FC’s shareholders have revealed that the club’s Chairman has contributed £300,000 of his own money on an annual basis, just to keep the club afloat.\n\nOn top of that, he has built E\u0026ampI Engineering to a stature that it is respected across the world, a real jewel in the Irish landscape that sits in Burnfoot.\n\nIn its 32nd year in operation, E\u0026ampI is still growing, with a new extension set to be completed on site by the end of October. \n\nThat will bring yet more jobs to the local economy, north and south of the border, news of which will be lauded by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar when he visits E\u0026ampI on September 11. \n\nSo when an angry Derry City fan accosts him whilst doing his shopping in Sainsburys, or when he is socialising with friends, what is his response?\n\n“The first question I usually ask them is ‘Are you a season ticket holder or do you go to the matches?’ If the answer is no then there is no point in me talking to them,” he states. \n\n“Why are they criticising if they don’t go to the matches and pay their money? If they do pay their money then I will have the conversation with them. \n\n“Usually it’s when results are bad. I feel exactly the same as they do. It does get a bit personal sometimes. We went through a few managers there and I did get a bit of stick about that.”\n\nO’Doherty is crazy busy, admitting himself that he spends 70 per cent of his time travelling across the world to meet customers personally. For him the personal touch is vital when it comes to meeting customers and establishing relationships. \n\nFor that reason he is a hard man to nail down, but he is not afraid to raise his head above the parapet, as he did during the recent controversy over the pricing of Europa League tickets at the Brandywell. \n\nBut with 840 families in Derry, 400 in South Carolina and 320 in Dubai relying on his ability to grow his business, there are more important issues on his mind day to day. \n\n“I would never let Derry City get in the way of that because too many families depend on me here to pay mortgages and car payments and stuff like that,” he continued. \n\n“I’ve always made it clear to the board that I’m not going to available. The big concern I do have is that I am away so much, probably 70 per cent of the time I’m out of Derry – is that reasonable for a chairman? I don’t know, but that’s the way it is at the minute. \n\n“When things are going well it’s an easy job but when things aren’t going well, it’s a difficult job.”\n\n\nResponsibility\n\n\nWith around 1,500 employees to cater to worldwide, there is a huge responsibility on O’Doherty’s shoulders, but it is one he carries well, with E\u0026ampI’s profits and workforce growing year on year. \n\nEven in his home town, so many rely on him. \n\n“I don’t even think about that, there’s no time to worry about that, you just have to get on with it,” he admits. \n\n“If I can keep the customers happy and bring in the sales from those customers, that’s key. It’s very easy to bring in a sale from customers who were happy with their last order. If that’s gone well, it’s easy to get the next ones. \n\n“We have some long-standing relationships with very big companies, some multinationals and the internet sector, we would count as customers and I would look after them personally.\n“I just keep going. I work very heavily in sales so I’m away a lot.\n\n“I suppose at the end of every year you sit down and see what the achievements were for the year and what you’re going to do next year. But I think I’m just too busy to reflect on where we are versus where we started.”\n\n“At the last count, O’Doherty’s personal value was estimated at £163 million, making him one of the most successful businessmen in Ireland. \n\nAt 25 years old, O’Doherty left Du Pont to start a business which focused solely on engineering. \n\nNow, 32 years on, the former St. Columb’s College student retains his hands-on approach. \n\n“I do get involved in things and because I’m an engineer, I’m very interested in research and development. I talk to a lot of customers who say: ‘I wish we could get this or I wish we could do that’, so that turns into a project. \n\n“I’m partly doing technical sales, but I’m partly working in research as well. I am using my engineering skills it’s not just a management job where I’m not actually doing things. \n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\n“I think getting close to customers is really important, because you have to ask the question – why do people in Silicon Valley place orders with a company in Donegal? They don’t just happen to be driving past and call in and see us, we go out and talk to them and show what we have.\n\n“We have a fabulous work force, which is the big advantage that we have. It’s a mix between Derry and Donegal people who have a great work this, a good education.”\n\n\nDown time\n\n\nThat passion for his work continues to drive him on, be it in his office overlooking the building in Burnfoot, in Anderson, South Carolina or in Dubai. \n\nThere is no down time for O’Doherty it seems. \n\n“To be honest, I’m quite happy with my lifestyle at the minute,” he shrugs. \n\n“I would like a little more free time. I’ve just become a grandfather my grandson is 14 and a half months and I would definitely want to spend more time with him. I have two kids, a boy and a girl, so I would like more family time but at the same time I like what I do. I like engineering.\n\n“Earlier this morning I was looking at some drawings for a large project we’re doing for a client and I really enjoyed going through them. I wouldn’t want to be an accountant. A lot of engineering people tend to make out that they’re management only then all of a sudden all they are doing is looking at financial statements all the time. \n\n“I do do that. I can read a balance sheet, but I wouldn’t want it to be the main focus of my job.”\n\nO’Doherty has created something hugely significant right on his own doorstep. His value to his home town cannot just be measured in jobs alone, but by other contributions, which he does not want acknowledged in print. \n\n“He has helped bail Derry City out twice, once in 1995 and again in 2010. From whatever angle you choose to look. It’s clear that O’Doherty cares, and cares deeply about his home town, and the people in it. \n\n“We have the right people in this area,” he explains. “We probably underestimate how talented our people are. I sometimes think we lack in confidence. I go to other cities in Ireland and the UK and they seem to be very confident whereas as soon as our people get stuck into a project, they are probably more impressive than people from these other locations. I think that’s the work ethic particularly. \n\n“What I notice about people here as well, is that if they encounter a technical problem they are very innovative in coming up with a solution. They tend to try and work solutions out themselves. I think that’s natural. I think this innovation is very, very important.\n\n“It’s not all me. I started it off but I developed a team. My workforce and in particular my two directors Damien and Cathal they have done a lot more than I have in terms of what’s in this building. I may bring the sales in but what you see in the factory is largely down to them.”\n\nAnother key issue for O’Doherty is education in the city, primarily the development of Magee university, which he believes has been held back in recent years. \n\n“We’re still short engineers there’s not enough engineers and there’s the lack of a proper university here,” he insists. \n\n“Magee is definitely making progress with the new vice-chancellor but it should have been making that progress years ago. \n\n\"The reason that I feel so disappointed at the lack of sufficient progress in the university, is that, when I meet other people who own businesses and you get talking to them, one of the questions I get asked is ‘Why have you built your factory in such and such a place?’ There’s two answers I give them one is that I was born here, and two is that \n\n“I went to university here and I met my wife. I think you need a good university to attract good people and I think the university will attract people who will eventually settle here as well.\nThat will create businesses which will help the university and all of a sudden you have a virtuous circle of good stable employment. Without a university, it’s definitely more difficult.”\n\n\nRetirement?\n\n\nSo, does he have an end-game? At 57 years old, is retirement now starting to creep into his thinking?\n\n“I certainly think I have got seven or eight more years until I think about retiring. \n\nI will probably wind it down a bit. \n\nI would like to work less hours and spend more time with my grandson particular, but I still want to do something. I don’t play golf,” he laughed.\nThe last question is a simple one- ‘Do you feel appreciated?’\n\n“I think I am, not by everybody but it really doesn’t matter,” he says. \n\n“I’ve got a very good relationship with my shop floor in particular. I tend to come down here on a Saturday morning if I’m not away and walk around. \n\n\"I just want to know what’s happening, because I don’t have time during the week because of my travels. I just don’t get time. I like to walk around and if there are any new starts I have a worked with them.\n“Am I appreciated? I’m not 100% sure, but hopefully.”\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"bus users urged say creggan bogside brandywell route proposals","story":"\nPeople living in Creggan, Bogside, Brandywell and Bishop Street areas are being urged to let their voices be heard on the proposed amended Foyle  8A route during the consultation which is to take place this week.\n\nSinn Féin Councillor Kevin Campbell said: “There are currently proposals to amend the current bus routes that service the Creggan, Bogside,Brandywell and Bishop Street areas.\n\n“Translink are to undertake a consultation this week about the proposals to amend the Foyle  8A route.

I was talking to her team and they asked me what I did for a living.  When I told them I was a barber, they said they might need someone to cut their hair during the Dublin leg of Britney Spears’ tour.\n\n“I received initial contact two weeks ago asking if I would go to Dublin to cut the eight male dancers’ hair.”\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\nWith eight haircuts to fit in between dance rehearsals on the day of the concert, Chris decided to enlist the help of four members of his senior staff – Matty Young, Cathal McCormack, Marty McErlean and Megan Ludlow.  Unfortunately, Megan was unable to make the trip due to a prior engagement, but the other lads were delighted to take on their biggest job to date.\n\nChris, a former student of Holy Family Primary School and St Pius X College in Magherafelt, said it was a great ‘honour’ to be chosen to work for ‘one of the biggest selling pop artists of all time’.\n\n“The boys who work for me have all been trained by me and they were so professional throughout it all.  I couldn’t be prouder of them.  The dancers were so happy with their haircuts and it also gave the boys their first glimpse of working within the world of celebrities and session styling.”\n\nChris, who has 15 years’ experience in the barbering industry, opened Barbers of BT45 almost five years ago and since then he has seen the business go from strength-to-strength with the opening of Barbers of BT80 in Cookstown, Salon 45 and the BT45 Barbering Academy, having trained over 120 students since it opened.\n\nA former Disney World employee, Chris has also notched up barbering experience in Australia.\n\nJust last year he launched his very own range of products and is currently in negotiations to have them distributed throughout Ireland.\n\nLast night Chris revealed that Britney Spears’ tour management team have been in contact again about future projects, however he is keeping shtum until all is finalised.\n\n“It’s great that we have got a lot more opportunities out of this.  It just shows you that one opportunity can open so many doors,” he added.\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"traffic travel arrangements announced waterside half marathon derry sunday motorists advised disruptions","story":"\nAs over 2,000 runners and thousands more spectators prepare for the Waterside Half Marathon on Sunday September 2nd, race organisers Derry City and Strabane District Council have announced the traffic and travel arrangements for the event.\n\nThe race start is at the usual time of 10pm am at Ebrington Square with the finish at St Columb’s Park Running Track between 11.05am and 1.30pm and all those attending as well as members of the public who will be in the vicinity of the race route are being urged to familiarise themselves with the arrangements in place.\n\nTo ensure the safety of everyone attending and other road users a number of temporary traffic restrictions will be in place for a short time, these have been carefully selected in consultation with the PSNI and Department of Infrastructure and Roads to minimise delay and inconvenience for residents and traffic.\n\nThe route travels along the following roads and traffic may be affected: St Columb’s Road, Limavady Road, Waterfoot Park, The Gransha Grounds, the A2 Dual Carriageway , Foyle Bridge , Lower Culmore Road, Bay Road, Queens Quay, Foyle Embankment, Foyle Road , Lower Deck Craigavon Bridge.\n\nExtensive sections of the Council greenways will also be used in the Waterfoot Park and Gransha area, Bay Road Park, Fort George to Council offices, Peace Bridge to Craigavon Bridge and from King Street to St Columb’s Park Running Track.\n\nWhile some disruption is inevitable, in order to avoid delays the public are being asked to heed some specific advice on the day.\n\nIf possible, avoid travelling along the affected route during the event.\n\nIf you must travel during the event, please follow the signed diversions and allow some extra time for your journey.

The words “I want to be an organ donor” are simple, but what an inspirational difference they could make. \n\nThis Organ Donation Week  the Western Health and Social Care Trust  is centred on encouraging people to talk to those closest to them about organ donation. Many people don’t realise that their family’s support is needed for organ donation to go ahead.\n\nApproximately 140 people in Northern Ireland are waiting on life-saving transplants and approximately 6,000 people in the United Kingdom. Unfortunately every year around 14 people in Northern Ireland die waiting for an organ transplant, highlighting the real shortage of organ donations.\n\nDr Declan Grace, Lead Clinician for Organ Donation at the Western Trust said: “Organ donation transforms and saves lives and the Western Trust is encouraging everyone to join the Organ Donor register and tell their loved ones that they wish to be a donor, so that they are aware of their wishes.\n\n“Deciding to become an organ donor is entirely your decision but it does affect your family. After your death, your next of kin will be consulted on whether your organs can be donated, even if you carry a donor card, and any decision they make will be respected. When families or friends know the wishes of their loved ones it makes the situation less stressful and can give them the confidence to fulfil your wish to be an organ donor.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\n“No one wants to think or talk about dying but set in the context of helping one or more than one person after death, the conversation becomes easier. The more people pledge to donate their organs and tissues after their death, the more people stand to benefit. Between 1 April 2017 and 31 March 2018 there were seven organ donors in the Western Trust area, resulting in 20 patients receiving a transplant.”\n\nDr Grace continued: “There is a constant drive towards promoting organ donation in the Western Trust and it has been successful. This is shown in the number of people registered as potential donors which has increased from about 25% to 43% in Northern Ireland over the past five years. While this is very encouraging, there is still a lot of work to do to ensure as many people as possible join the Organ Donor register and tell their loved ones about their wishes.”\n\nThere are many ways to register as a potential donor:\n\nRegister online at \nwww.organdonation.nhs.uk\n or \nwww.organdonationni.info\n\nRegister when applying for or renewing a driving licence.\nRegister when registering with a G.P Practice.\nTelephone the N.H.S. Donor Line 0300 123 23 23. Telephone lines are open 24 hours a day all year round.\nDownload a form from \nwww.organdonation.nhs.uk\n, print it and return it by Freepost\nRegister when applying for a Boot’s Advantage Card.\n\n\nPictured above: Highlighting the need for more people to sign up to the organ donor register and telling your family your wishes is: Maria Coyle Specialist Nurse in Organ Donation and Dr Declan Grace Lead Clinician for Organ Donation in the Western Trust.\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"martin butler is presteigne festivals composer in residence","story":"\nPresteigne Festival\u0026rsquos composer-in-residence Martin Butler.\n\" data-thumb=\"/resources/images/8433308/?type=mc\u0026amphtype=0\" height=\"\"\n                                                                                                                        \nIntroducing Presteigne Festival\u0026#39s composer-in-residence\n\nFestival president Michael Berkeley whose 70th birthday will be celebrated with \u0026ltspan class=truncate\u0026gt\u0026ltspan class=truncate-preview\u0026gta special concert on\u0026ltspan class=truncate-full-screen\u0026gt Tuesday, August 28.\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\n\" data-thumb=\"/resources/images/8433309/?type=mc\u0026amphtype=0\" \n\n                                                                                                                        \nIntroducing Presteigne Festival\u0026#39s composer-in-residence\n\nDavid Matthews, a composer with long standing links to the Presteigne Festival i\u0026ltspan class=truncate\u0026gt\u0026ltspan class=truncate-preview\u0026gts celebrating his 75\u0026ltspan class=truncate-full-screen\u0026gtth birthday.\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\n\" data-thumb=\"/resources/images/8433310/?type=mc\u0026amphtype=0\" \n\n                                                \n                            \n\n                            \nSkip to next image \u0026raquo\n                        \n                                            \n"},{"url":null,"title":"machynlleth festival reaches its finale","story":"\nElin Manahan Thomas will be performing at the Machynlleth Festival.\n\" data-thumb=\"/resources/images/8106823/?type=mc\u0026amphtype=0\" height=\"\"\n                                                                                                                        \nCelebration of Welsh composer at Machynlleth\n\nAnn Murray will be leading a workshop at the Machynlleth Festival.

In April, Newry, Mourne and Down Council also backed the campaign to retain the sweeping beam at the lighthouse, vehemently rejecting the controversial proposal to remove it.\n\nSpeaking following Sunday\u0026rsquos community protest, Mr Hazzard said: \u0026ldquoFor 150 years the iconic sweeping beam from St John\u0026rsquos Point Lighthouse h\u0026nbsp as been a fundamental part of life for those of us who live and work in East Down.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe Commissioners of Irish Lights current proposals to alter this beam as a result of their planned refurbishments of the lighthouse are unacceptable and are therefore opposed by both heritage campaigners and the local community.\n\n\u0026ldquoWe have unfortunately seen CIL\u0026rsquos modernisation policy diminish the unique character of Irish lighthouses in recent years.\n\n\u0026ldquoRecent problems at Tory Island, Mew Island and Fastnet are a timely reminder as to why we must not tamper with the special heritage at St John\u0026rsquos.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe message remains the same \u0026mdash leave our light alone.\n\nLocal Sinn F\u0026eacutein Cllr John Rice, who also attended the protest, added: \u0026ldquoSt John\u0026rsquos Point is one of the most iconic pieces of social heritage that we can offer.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe light itself can be seen right across the constituency and it is something that locals enjoy greatly from as far as the Mournes and Slieve Croob.\n\n\u0026ldquoI like most other people grew up always admiring this great light house and I feel that the Irish Lighthouse authority must stop their proposed changes immediately.\n\nEileen Peters, one of the local campaigners, said the protest was chosen to coincide with International Lighthouse weekend.\n\nShe said Captain McCabe from CIL made a \u0026ldquosurprise entrance with plans for the lighthouse \u0026ldquowhich unfortunately, are still at iance with those of the local community.\n\n\u0026ldquoHe presented the case for a replacement light, which he claims would provide the same beam as the original, said Ms Peters. \u0026ldquoThis cannot be the case as the range of the light would be reduced by several miles.\n\nMs Peters also argued CIL had not taken into account reports by eminent toxicologists on the safe use of mercury in lighthouses, or the findings of the Royal Society\u0026rsquos Publication on the detrimental effects of LED lighting on epifaunal marine communities.\n\nMs Peters said that following their extensive research and campaigning they were \u0026ldquodismayed at the ease in which the heritage of Irish is discarded.\n\n\u0026ldquoLecale Lightkeepers would like to thank the local community and all who made their way to the lighthouse on Saturday for their support, she said. \u0026ldquoWe are grateful to Chris Hazzard MP, Cllr Dermot Curran and Cllr John Rice for attending today\u0026rsquos event, and thank Cllrs Patrick Brown and Gareth Sharvin for their good wishes.\n\nAhead of Sunday\u0026rsquos protest CIL said it had confirmed its commitment to retain the sweeping beam with an LED light.\n\nA spokeswoman said: \u0026ldquoAs part of the Commissioners of Irish Lights ongoing investment programme to maintain and modernise its aids to navigation, planned work at St. John\u0026rsquos Point Lighthouse will deliver environmental, safety and cost benefits and is part of the continuing investment programme of maintenance, upkeep and modernisation of our coastal services to the mariner.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoThe main programme of works at St John\u0026rsquos Lighthouse, due to take place in the coming years, is the replacement of the light source with a new LED light. This light source will be housed within the original Fresnel lens and there will be no changes to the visual structure of the light source. The new LED light will maintain its sweeping beam and will use less than 30 watts compared with the previous 1000 watt lamp thus improving its environmental footprint and removing the need for a diesel generator at the station. It will also allow the removal of mercury from the station.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoIrish Lights has addressed previously held concerns relating to the sweeping beam and has reiterated that the solution being considered for St John\u0026rsquos Point will ensure that the beam will retain its sweeping feature and rotating lens will be unaffected visually.\n\n\u0026ldquoSince this project was first proposed in 2016, Irish Lights has engaged with local stakeholders, including Lecale Lightkeepers, on the replacement of the lens, and has taken on board key concerns raised by these groups and will continue to engage with the community on an ongoing basis to ensure the unique lighthouse heritage is protected.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoIrish Lights is currently trialling a system that will allow the lens to rotate in the same manner it currently does and will engage with the local community once again when this trial project comes to a final conclusion. When the project is in a position to progress Irish Lights will continue to consult with the local community and will ensure all planning and heritage requirements are met.\n\n\u0026ldquoIrish Lights respects the right to protest however urges members of the public to be cognisant of tenants and tourists who are currently residing at St John\u0026rsquos Point Lighthouse.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Celtic tournament success  ","story":"\t\t\t\nTHE club\u0026rsquos fourth annual youth tournament took place in Dunleath Park at the weekend and it was another overwhelming success with 70 teams participating over the course of Friday evening and Saturday morning.\u0026nbsp\n\nCeltic Bhoys would like to thank all the clubs who participated in the tournament along with the players and spectators who attended on both days.\u0026nbsp\n\nFurthermore, they would like to thank all all those who worked behind the scenes with the club including Newry, Mourne and Down Council Officials Davy Duggan,Tony McShane, Rita, Lewis and all their support staff for the logistical support and the marking out off the 7-a-side pitches.\u0026nbsp\n\nSpecial thanks also goes to the local referees who officiated during the tournament and last, but certainly not least, all the club volunteers who once again outdid themselves to make it all possible.\n\nTraining has now recommenced for all the club\u0026rsquos youth teams.

Fortunately, on-one was injured.\n\nHowever, local people were puzzled that the nearby coastguard services did not promptly answer an emergency call and the incident led local councillor George Flinn to call for a review of rescue procedures.\n\nMr Flinn was given his answer this week in a frank letter from the coastguard service, which admitted there had been a 17-minute delay.\n\nHe was told in the letter, read to Down councillors, that the RNLI is currently reviewing the type of life craft and the methods used along the Down coastline and it will be taking into account the incident at Coney Island.\n\nThe letter pointed out that it was ironic that the coastguard had identified the Killough area as a likely accident spot on that day because of the water sports being held as part of the village\u0026rsquos festival weekend.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe failure of radio units meant they could not assist the young men in canoes at Coney Island.

In this case it is believed that some of the weed has found its way into the river and has been washed up on the banks.\n\nThe death toll up to now includes a cow, a bullock and three sheep. In each case the poisoned animals had access to the river or one of its tributaries.\n\nA spokesman for the Department of Agriculture said the weed resembles the more common and harmless \u0026lsquoFools Parsley\u0026rsquo, but is regarded as the most poisonous plant growing in Northern Ireland.\n\n\u0026ldquoIf farmers find it on their land the safest thing they can do is to dig it up entirely and destroy it, the spokesman said. \u0026ldquoHowever, great care must be taken to do this properly.

If no agreement is reached with him the land might have to be vested, meaning a lengthy hold-up.\n\nWhen it does go ahead, the new car park will be built between Irish Street and Market Street and will hold up to 80 cars.\n\n\u0026ldquoWe hope to enter the construction stage in this financial year because money is available, the Roads Service spokesman said. \u0026ldquoWe are very anxious to press on in an effort to provide good parking facilities at that end of the town.\n\nLOUGHISLANDREAVY \u0026mdash A builders hut at Loughinislandreavy, outside Castlewellan, was broken into on Thursday night.
